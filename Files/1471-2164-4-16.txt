                    Background        Draft sequences of human mouse fruit fly and nematode        genomes have recently been released and the sequencing of        several other complex genomes is underway The next        challenge  sequence completion and verification  requires        the closing of the gaps between contigs isolation and        characterization of centromeric and telomeric regions that        are poorly represented in libraries and verification of        contig assembly These goals could be greatly simplified by        a cloning strategy that would allow selective isolation of        any genomic region Driven by the needs of functional        genomics a novel approach for DNA cloning by homologous        recombination in         Escherichia coli has been recently        developed      While the new approach greatly simplify        cloning protocols peculiarities of         E coli transformation do not allow        to apply recombinogenic engineering to large size of DNA        fragments        We developed an alternative cloning procedure based on        transformationassociated recombination TAR in the yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae             TAR cloning allows to selectively isolate genomic fragments        up to  kb The following two general TAR cloning        approaches were developed and exploited      i When        DNA sequence information is available from both the  and         flanking regions of the gene of interest the gene is        isolated using a vector with two short unique sequences        that flank the gene The hooks can be as small as  bp            ii When DNA sequence information is available only as         or  flanking regions a modified version of TAR        cloning called radial TAR cloning is used In radial TAR        cloning one hook is a unique sequence from the chromosomal        region of interest and the other is a repeated sequence        that occurs frequently and randomly throughout the genomic        DNA          ie Alu repeats in human DNA and         B repeats in mouse DNA The radial        cloning method involves isolation of a set of nested        overlapping fragments that extend from the genespecific        targeting hook to upstream or downstream         Alu or         B  positions in the gene of        interest TAR cloning has been used successfully to isolate        over a dozen single copy genes from human and mouse genomes                   and NK unpublished data        TAR cloning requires that the cloned DNA fragment carry        at least one autonomously replicating sequence          ARS  that can function as the origin        of replication in yeast Sequences that function as         ARS s in yeast occur on average every         to  kb in all the eukaryotic genomes thus far examined             which suggests that most mammalian chromosomal        regions can be readily isolated by TARcloning with a        vector that lacks an         ARS  The         ARS frequency in chromosomal regions        that consist of multiple repetitive elements however such        as the centromere and telomere may be reduced meaning        that these regions may not be isolatable by the original        TAR method        This report describes a general TAR cloning system for        isolation of genomic regions regardless of the presence of         ARS elements In this new system the        TAR vector contains an         ARS and a counterselectable marker        Negative genetic selection eliminates the background due to        vector recircularization caused by endjoining during yeast        transformation This novel method provides a powerful tool        for structural and functional analysis of eukaryotic and        prokaryotic genomes                    Results                  Vectors with a counterselectable marker at the end          of a targeting hook are not efficient for gene isolation          from complex genomes          Isolation of           ARS less genomic regions by TAR          cloning requires incorporation of yeast origin of          replication into the vector It is well documented          however that linearized           ARSCEN vectors circularize with          high efficiency via illegitimate endjoining during yeast          transformation     and references therein To          eliminate background resulting from recircularization of          the vector during TAR cloning we investigated two          different strategies based on use of a counterselectable          marker          The first strategy exploited a vector with a          counterselectable marker placed at the end of one of the          targeting hooks This strategy is similar to one widely          used for gene disruption in mice    and was recently          successful in isolating chromosomal fragments from a          prokaryotic genome     To apply the strategy we          constructed a TAR vector which when linearized had the          structure           URAHookCENARSHHISHook           Hook and Hook represent two targeting sequences while           URA is a marker that can be          selected for or against in yeast Circularization of the          vector does not prevent           URA expression and therefore the          clones containing the vector without the DNA insert can          not grow on media containing FOA If the TAR vector          recombines with a genomic DNA fragment the           URA gene is lost and the resulting          YAC clone becomes resistant to FOA          We used the selection system described above to          isolate the TgAC transgene from the mouse genome The          TgAC transgenic mouse carries approximately  copies of          the transgene integrated into a unique site on chromosome               and references therein Each copy includes          the           vHaras gene and a simian virus           SV polyadenylation signal and is under control of a          zetaglobin promoter The TAR vector used in this          experiment pARSSVURA contained a bp          transgenespecific hook and a           B repeat as the second hook see          Methods The vector was linearized between the           B targeting hook and           URA and cotransformed with          genomic DNA into yeast spheroplasts Transformants were          selected on histidineminus synthetic medium containing          FOA No transgenepositive clones were found among the           transformants analyzed Because the standard TAR          cloning technique ie one that uses a vector lacking           ARS and a counterselectable marker          yields about  transgenepositive transformants               this result demonstrates that the specific          targeting hook recombines much less efficiently when it          is protected by a   kb nonhomologous           URA sequence To study in greater          detail how the presence of nonhomologous DNA at the end          of one of the hooks reduces gene capture efficiency we          constructed a set of TAR vectors with different lengths          of nonhomologous DNA next to the hook Each vector          contained a bp transgenespecific hook and a common           B repeat as the second hook          Figure summarizes the results of radial TAR cloning of          the transgene with those vectors As can be seen the          yield of genepositive clones progressively declined as          the length of the nonhomologous DNA increased Even  bp          of nonhomologous DNA decreased TAR cloning efficiency            times These results demonstrate that TAR cloning vectors          with a counterselectable marker at the end of one of the          hooks are inefficient for cloning the genes from complex          mammalian genomes                          Rationale for TAR cloning of genomic regions          lacking ARS sequences          To reduce the background caused by recircularization          of           ARS containing vectors we          developed a different gene capture strategy Figure           As in the first approach the TAR vector contained a          yeast centromere            CEN  a yeast           ARS element            ARSH  a positiveselectable          marker            HIS  and a negativeselectable          marker            URA  In this approach however          the targeting hooks are placed between the promoter and          the open reading frame of the           URA gene The promoter derived          from the           S pombe ADH gene exhibits          specific spacing requirements for its function such that          the permissive distance between the TATA element and the          transcription initiation site is at most  bp               A greater distance results in transcription initiation          at an alternative site and inactivation of           URA expression The specific          spacing requirements allow selection against the          recircularized vector Figure shows the outcomes of two          different events involving such a TAR vector In Figure          A the TAR vector recombines with a genomic DNA fragment          via the targeting hooks which results in separation of          the TATA box from the transcription initiation site in          the           URA gene by the DNA insert The          resulting YAC does not express           URA and therefore the clone can          be selected by medium containg FOA Figure Bshows the          results of nonhomologous endjoining leading to          recircularization of the vector In this case the          distance between the TATA element and the transcription          initiation site is not changed and           URA is expressed normally          rendering the clone sensitive to FOA                          Isolation of specific chromosomal regions with a          TAR vector containing ARS and a counterselectable          marker          We used the TAR cloning strategy described above to          isolate the           vHaras TgAc transgene region          from mouse DNA The vector pARSTGAC contained  bp of          SV as a transgenespecific targeting hook and  bp of          a common mouse repeat           B as a second hook Both selected          targeting sequences do not contain an ATG initiation          codon that is outofframe with the vector           URA  which avoids the          translational incompetence of           URA mRNA and resistance to FOA          see Methods The targeting hooks were placed in the          promoter region of           URA as shown in Figure  Genomic          DNA and the linearized TAR cloning vector were combined          with yeast spheroplasts and the His Ura transformants          were selected on medium containing FOA to identify          clones with genomic DNA inserts Yield of the          transformants varied from  to  coloniesug vector           ug genomic DNA and    spheroplasts Table           Eight transgenepositive YAC clones were identified among           His FOAresistant transformants screened by PCR          for the presence of the zetaglobin promoter sequence          Table  Among  YAC clones characterized by CHEF          electrophoresis size of inserts varied from  to           kb Approximately the same yield of genepositive clones          had been previously observed during TAR cloning of this          genomic region with vectors lacking           ARS and a counterselectable marker               No transgenepositive clones were found when          FOA selection was omitted Table  indicating that          the new TAR cloning method is highly selective and          efficient for isolation of multicopy genes          We also tested whether TAR cloning with an           ARS containing vector and negative          selection can be used to isolate a single copy gene from          a complex genome such as           HPRT from the human genome We          designed a TAR cloning vector pARSHPRT carrying a bp                     HPRT specific targeting hook and a          bp            HPRT specific hook and inserted          them into the promoter region of           URA see Methods His Ura          transformants were selected on medium containing FOA          to identify recombinant clones Transformant yields          ranged from  to  colonies Table  A low yield is          predicted for a TAR vector containing two unique          targeting hooks We screened  randomly picked          transformants by PCR for the presence of           HPRT  and    of them          carried all the           HPRT exon sequences Table  All          genepositive clones contained circular YACs with   kb          DNA inserts data not shown Such a high yield of           HPRT positive clones has been          previously observed with a similar vector lacking the           ARS element     Our results          indicate that the novel TAR cloning system is highly          efficient highly selective and sufficiently sensitive          to isolate a single copy gene from the large and complex          genomes                          Selective isolation of centromeric regions          The new TAR cloning system is useful for isolation of          heterochromatic regions enriched by repeats and          presumably poor in           ARS elements such as a mammalian          centromere Human centromeres contain primarily alpha or          alphoid satellite DNA Alphoid DNA consists of bp          repeating units organized into higher order repeats The          length of centromeric alphoid arrays of different human          chromosomes varies from  to  Mb          To apply the new selection strategy for isolation of          large blocks of alphoid DNA we created a TAR vector          pARSALF with the structure                     SATpADHCENARSHHISURASAT  where           SAT represents two bp fragments          from the alphoid DNA consensus sequence see Methods As          in the constructs described above the targeting hooks          were inserted into the           URA promoter region TAR cloning          of human centromeric DNA was carried out as described          above The average yield of His Ura transformants was           To detect the colonies with alphoid DNA inserts          randomly selected transformants were tested by          dothybridization with an alphoid DNAspecific probe The          probe has no homology to the targeting sequences in the          TAR vector see Methods Roughly  of the clones          reacted with the probe indicating high selectivity of          TAR cloning Fig Aand Table  Twenty alphoid          DNApositive clones were further characterized The size          of YAC inserts was determined by clamped homogeneous          electrical field gel electrophoresis and visualized with          an alphoid DNA probe The size of the YACs varied from           kb to  kb Fig B Some isolates had more than one          band suggesting that some satellite sequences may be          unstable in yeast cells as has been previously reported              Alternatively the transformants may have          acquired more than one YAC The relatively large sizes of          the inserts suggest that genomic alphoid DNA fragments          recombine with targeting hooks in the vector by sequences          located at DNA fragment ends rather than by internal          sequences          Because the human genome contains approximately           copies of alphoid DNA monomer it is possible          that alphoid DNA could be cloned into an           ARS containing vector even without          counterselection To test this conjecture we performed          TAR cloning as above but selected His  rather than the          His Ura  transformants As expected the number of          transformants was roughly one order of magnitude higher          than that obtained with counterselection Table           Dothybridization of transformants showed that          approximately  of the clones were alphoid DNApositive          Thus although alphoid DNA arrays represent a significant          fraction of the genome TAR cloning of those regions is          inefficient without counterselection Similar results          were obtained during cloning of genomic fragments using          the           Alu containing vector pARSAlu          data not shown          In conclusion the results demonstrate that our novel          selection system is useful for isolation of large          centromeric regions that are poorly clonable in bacterial          artificial chromosome vectors                                Discussion        Over a decade ago FurterGraves and Hall           demonstrated that the         S pombe ADH gene promoter is        tolerant to insertion of up to  base pairs between the        TATA box and the transcription start site That observation        led to the development of a system for investigating the        expansion of trinucleotide repeats in yeast in which the        promoter is combined with the         URA gene a widely used        counterselectable marker      In our work we took        advantage of the specific spacing requirements of the         ADH promoter to develop a novel TAR        cloning procedure that allows isolation of genomic regions        that lack         ARS elements A prerequisite for        development of the system was an estimate of the minimal        size of targeting hooks required for TAR cloning That size         bp for each hook exactly matches the maximal size of        an insert tolerated with the         ADH promoter The use of the system        allowed us to include a yeast origin of replication into        the TAR vector and to select TAR cloning events against        vector recircularization        The new system greatly expands the applicability of TAR        cloning It eliminates the limitation of the previously        described TAR cloning protocols by eliminating the need for        an         ARS sequence in the region to be        cloned Now any region of a complex genome can be        selectively isolated in yeast Because TAR cloning produces        multiple gene isolates it allows the isolation of both        parental alleles of the gene which can then be used for        haplotype analysis     Recently we found that up to         DNA divergence does not preclude efficient gene        isolation by TAR     Such tolerance to DNA divergence        allows the isolation of highly polymorphic alleles and gene        and homologues with the same TAR vector Moreover the new        system provides an alternative approach to selectively        clone large fragments of bacterial genomes    that are        poor in sequences that can function as         ARS s in yeast            The new TAR cloning system has several potential        applications for the Human Genome Project The goal of the        current phase of the Project is to close gaps and improve        the quality of the data which is to be accomplished by        collecting additional sequence data With TAR cloning the        desired regions could be isolated from the genome directly        rather than through construction and screening of new        bacterial artificial chromosome libraries Recently we        successfully applied this approach to close the gaps in the        draft of human genome sequence     Characterization of        the TAR isolates has shown that the gap sequences to be        toxic to         E coli  which may explain why those        regions were not found in bacterial artificial chromosome        libraries Verification of contig assembly includes        characterization of multiple independently isolated        chromosomespecific clones TAR cloning may be the simplest        way to achieve that goal We previously demonstrated that         Alu containing TAR cloning vectors        that lack         ARS elements are efficient for        selective isolation of human DNA from humanrodent        monochromosomal hybrid cell lines     Our new        counterselectable system allows construction of        representative chromosomespecific libraries One of such        library for chromosome  has been constructed in our        laboratory and is now being used to improve the accuracy of        chromosome  draft sequences        Among the other advantages of the new TAR cloning system        is its ability to isolate centromeric and telomeric        regions which have been generally excluded as potential        targets by the Human Genome Project because of the        difficulty of cloning large blocks of repetitive DNA When        centromeric DNA is digested by a restriction endonuclease        the resulting fragments are usually either too small or too        large for efficient cloning in bacterial artificial        chromosomes     In recent work we reported isolation        of human centromeric DNA using a TAR vector lacking         ARS element     While the        isolation was selective a standard TAR cloning technique        does not allow to recover a significant fraction of alphoid        DNA arrays that does not contain         ARS  In our present study using the        new TAR cloning strategy clones of human alphoid DNA up to          kb in length were isolated with high selectivity        Most of the TAR clones contained exclusively alphoid DNA        which in some cases was organized in higherorder repeat        arrays data not shown Approximately  of the isolates        contained alphoid DNA arrays interrupted with nonalphoid        DNA sequences including         Alu and         LINE repeats Those clones can be        used as starting material for construction of physical maps        of human centromeres as well as for functional analysis of        centromeres                    Methods                  Yeast strains transformation and selection of          genepositive clones          The highly transformable           S cerevisiae strain VLN            MATalpha his trp            ura            lys            ade met  which has           HIS and           URA deletions was used for          transformation The strain is a derivative of VL with          the           ura gene replaced by the           KanMX cassette              Spheroplasts were generated as described previously              Agarose plugs  ul containing approximately  ug          of high molecular weight DNA were prepared from normal          human fibroblasts MRC ATCC or from liver cells of the          TgAC mouse     Linearized TAR cloning vector  ug          was added to the plugs treated with agarase and mixed          with yeast spheroplasts Optimum conditions for TAR          cloning have been recently described              Transformants were selected on synthetic histidineminus          plates containing fluoroorotic acid FOA to select          clones that no longer express           URA     Because of its toxic          effect on yeast spheroplasts FOA was not included in          the top agar                          Construction of TAR vectors          Table lists the TAR cloning vectors used in this          study All those vectors were created with the          Bluescriptbased yeast           E coli shuttle vector pRS           HISCENARSH     The          cassette containing the           URA gene driven by the           Shizosaccharomyces pombe          ADH promoter was derived from the pBL plasmid              In the original cassette the           ADH promoter and           URA were separated by a bp          adaptor containing an outofframe ATG initiation codon          In our construct we deleted this adaptor to prevent use          of the start codon for translation that would result in          nonexpression of the functional           URA gene and therefore an          inability to grow in the absence of uracil The deletion          of the adaptor also provided an opportunity to          incorporate longer DNA fragments between the TATA box and          the transcription initiation site without inactivation of                    URA  Construction of the modified                    ADHURA cassette included PCR          amplification of the           ADH promoter and the           URA gene from the pBL plasmid          using two pairs of primers ADHF plus ADHR and          URAARSF plus URAARSR Table  The first pair          amplifies the           ADH promoter as an           Apa I           Xho I fragment the second          amplifies the           URA gene as a           Cla I           Bam HI fragment The PCR fragments          were inserted into a pRS polylinker    to generate          the basic           ARS containing TAR vector          designated as pARSVN In this vector the TATA box and          the initiation transcription site in           URA are separated by           Xho I           Cla I sites which were used to          clone targeting hooks          To determine the distance permitted between the TATA          box and the transcription initiation site in pARSVN we          cloned different sized           Alu targeting hooks  bp           bp  bp  bp  bp and  bp          into vector           Xho I           Cla I sites The           Alu hooks were PCRamplified from          the  end of a bp           Alu consensus sequence    with          pairs of aluF aluR primers Table  Each pair of           Alu targeting hooks is separated by          a           Sma I site present in the           Alu consensus sequence Six          constructs  pARSAlu pARSAlu pARSAlu          pARSAlu pARSAlu and pARSAlu  with          different sized           Alu sequences from  bp to           bp were tested for           URA expression after          transformation into VLN Expression of           URA determined by the sensitivity          of His transformants to FOA was abolished with bp          and bp           Alu inserts Based on those          results we concluded that targeting sequences hooks          with a combined length of up to  bp cloned into the           ADH promoter region would allow          selection for insertion events during TAR cloning          We designed three pairs of targeting hooks to          investigate the selectivity of the new TAR cloning          system The first pair contained  bp of the          SVspecific targeting sequence in the TgAC transgene              and  bp of the mouse           B element The hooks were          PCRamplified from the SV vector using specific primer          pairs SVARSF and SVARSR Table  and cloned into           Xho I           Cla I sites of pARSVN yielding          the vector pARSTGAC We mutated an outofframe ATG          codon identified in a           B template sequence during PCR          amplification of the hook to avoid translational          incompetence and resistance to FOA The second pair          contained bp and bp specific sequences from the           and  ends of human           HPRT  The hooks were amplified          from           HPRT yeast artificial chromosome          YAC    with primer pairs HPARSF and HPARSR          Table  and cloned into the           Xho I           Cla I sites of pARSNK yielding          the vector pARSHPRT The third vector pARSALF was          designed for cloning human alphoid DNA arrays pARSALF          contained two bp fragments of alphoid DNA monomer that          were PCRamplified using the primer pair ALFF and ALFR          from a bp alphoid consensus sequence X              None of the amplified targeting hooks contained an ATG          codon that was outofframe in           URA  Vectors pARSTGAC and          pARSHPRT were linearized by           Sal I pARSAlu by           Sma I and pARSALF by           Mlu I exposing the targeting          sequences The TAR vector pARSSVURA was constructed          by insertion of the           S cerevisiae URA gene between the          targeting hooks of pVCSV    and cloning of           ARSH into the polylinker           URA was amplified as a   kb          fragment from pRS     Before TAR cloning the          vector was linearized with           Bam HI to expose the           B targeting sequence and the           URA sequence placed at the end of          the transgenespecific hook          Three TAR vectors used in this study did not contain           ARS elements Two of them          pVCSV and pVCSV contain a bp mouse           B element as a common hook and          respectively  bp and  bp of the trangenespecific          targeting hooks These vectors have been described              We constructed an additional vector to investigate how          the presence of nonhomologous DNA at the end of a hook          affects the efficiency of gene capture The          pVCSVpolylinker plasmid contains the same hooks as          pVCSV     but the hooks are separated by          approximately  bp in the pBluscript polylinker This          configuration allowed us to linearize the vector by a          different combination of enzymes producing a set of TAR          constructs with different lengths of nonhomologous DNA at          the end of the specific hook Fig                           Detection of positive clones among yeast          transformants          We used two pairs of primers to identify transformants          containing a human           HPRT sequence INR plus INL amply          a bp sequence in intron  and L plus R amplify a          bp sequence in exon  along with flanking introns              We used a pair of primers specific to the          zetaglobin promoter region to screen PCR transformants          for the TgAC transgene sequence     These primers          generate a bp PCR product that is diagnostic for          recombination between the TAR vector and genomic TgAC          transgene sequences Yeast genomic DNA was isolated from          transformants and PCRamplified as described previously                       Detection of recombinant clones obtained during TAR          cloning with           Alu  and alphoid DNAcontaining          vectors was carried out by colony hybridization For this          purpose we designed two specific probes  a bp          alphoid DNA fragment            Sat probe and a bp           Alu fragment            Alu probe Because those          sequences are not present in the TAR constructs they are          diagnostic for recombinant clones The probes were          labeled for hybridization by PCR using           Alu and alphoid DNA monomers as          templates and repeatspecific primers Table                           Characterization of YAC clones          Chromosomesize DNA was prepared from yeast          transformants carrying circular YACs separated by          clamped homogeneous electrical field gel electrophoresis          CHEF transferred onto a nylon membrane and hybridized          with an alphoid DNA probe or           Alu probe see above The size of          circular YACs was estimated by melting the agarose plugs          with yeast genomic DNA prior to CHEF analysis This          treatment linearized approximately  of the YACs in the           kb size range Southern blot analysis of YAC DNA          was performed with P labeled probes and the protocol          described by Church and Gilbert
