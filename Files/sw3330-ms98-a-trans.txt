        Jay um my kids are are both in college um       and id played i played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go on the other hand they really decided themselves um what what kind of experience did you have   umhum well i uh one girl went in in state and has graduated and then uh that was um you know that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go and i have uh one out of two out of state both in Missouri     umhum   and um i teach uh in a college and so i had they had heard me talk about it and for years that   umhum   i didnt think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate uh so that was pretty much uh   hm i see well i maybe maybe im wrong but i think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and and and the appropriate support environment and things like that   oh they if they if theyre content there but i mean as far as the education and as far as looking at the degree at the end that uh to its very little difference is paid to it where you get that bachelors   umhum   uh if its a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally and if they can get uh   umhum   um two out of lets see my son got a full total uh scholarships and so theres uh theres plenty of scholarships out there and so people should be advised to   umhum   to look for those and um   did did you play a a strong role in helping them pick schools or did you just sort of say listen to your uh guidance counselors and   uh well they uh i went we went around my son was a graduated from a Jesuit high school and so he he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university and so there were you know that was limited to   umhum umhum   uh five or six different places and um so hes in Saint Louis U and i guess i played a role in that i i just sort of uh let them um   umhum   you know theyd all been uh pretty uh  efficient as far as studies and and uh   yeah   so i didnt have that much to do they just uh they just knew they wanted to go to college and and i you know helped them uh   yeah   uh get there as far as uh traveling with them to look at different places we did do that and i would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up   yeah yeah yeah i think think thats a great idea i mean that   some people dont do it and then they get there and hate it or or whatever so   right its it it seems expensive at the time youre doing it but but the compared to the the total decision its nothing   if its possible right   i think in the short run it is expensive in the long run its very uh reasonable if the person my daughter thats been in in Missouri uh for a   yeah   a second year now shes coming home at the end of the semester   umhum umhum   so uh you know shes already twenty one she started late so thats you know strictly up to her and uh shell finish down here um um finish this year down here and then decide what shes gonna do next year   yeah   itll save me a lot of money because im not going to have to pay out of state tuition but again thats her decision   yeah right   so uh but i have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back and theyre much better students at twenty five twenty six maybe twenty eight so you know i dont i never have pushed them i just say that education is important you should do it uh but uh they have to do the work   yeah   so uh   you know well back back to this visiting thing i mean i found that my kids had no conception of what college was really like um and and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand   right yeah   and being able to go with them to some at least some of them  you know it had gave me a chance to explain things to them in terms uh in reference to what we had seen   oh i think so and also im opposed to the to the size does theyve just gotten so huge and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand see thats just too many   good grief   ended up going to where i used to go and that was twenty five hundred when i went there its twenty one thousand now its too big   good grief what is what is twenty one thousand what what school is that   so uh pardon its Southwest Missouri State University   uhhuh   and um it was twenty five hundred when i went there forty years ago and uh my son is in a school about seven thousand and thats thats not bad i teach in a school about eight thousand and thats thats even a little large but its much better than twenty one thousand   umhum yes   but they do have to visit and and if if the parent can point out all the different places to look for for scholarships and then   umhum   oh those rating uh the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything i dont think it hurts to look at them i dont put that much stock in them but probably fine just to compare   yes umhum helps helps to at least set up range of things to look at   right and uh if they you know uh they need to
