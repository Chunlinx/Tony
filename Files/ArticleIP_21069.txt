                                  The Wages of Spin            A seemingly honest womanpartially backed by circumstantial evidence accuses the president of havingraped her two decades ago The president denies it but refuses to say where hewas that day The public believes her but seems not to care The oppositionparty declines to press the issue and the media concede it will go away Howhas such cynicism come to pass            This is a lesson in theconsequences of spin For more than a year Clintons friends and enemiesplayed a game His enemies conspired to drive him from office His friendsconspired to protect him Each side did and said whatever it deemed necessaryto capture public opinion The game ended but the spins remain engraved in ourconsciousness Now they are clouding our perception of Juanita Broaddricksaccusation             Its just more politics                        Clintons enemies like his apologists care moreabout politics than about truth Together they have ruined his accuserscredibility His apologists have dismissed every charge against him as theproduct of a rightwing propaganda machine and his enemies have doneeverything possible to prove that theory right Rather than let each womandecide whether to come forward Clintons antagonists dragged her onstagePaula Jones said nothing about sexual harassment until the AmericanSpectator outed her three years later Conservative activists financed andmanaged her lawsuit Linda Tripp taped Monica Lewinsky tricked her into savingthe stained dress and ultimately fed her to Jones attorneys and toIndependent Counsel Kenneth Starr            Likewise antiClintonactivists didnt start pushing Broaddrick onstage until he ran for president in Eventually they fed her to the Jones lawyers who sent privateinvestigators to her home subpoenaed her and dumped her name and story intothe public record based on hearsay disregarding her denials Even after Starrchose not to pursue her story House Republicans used her secret FBIinterviewwhich Clinton had been given no chance to rebutto persuade theircolleagues to vote for impeachment Jerry Falwell and Matt Drudge pressured NBCto air its interview with her Fox News Channel the New York Post  andthe Washington Times pushed the story into the public record and theWall Street Journal editorial page blew it open To prove that Clintonhad used Broaddrick against her will his enemies used her against her willWhy did she finally tell her story Because all of these stories are floatingaround she said and I was tired of everybody putting their own spin onit            With equal cynicism Clintons surrogates used theseconservative associations to distract the public from his treatment of womenThey dismissed Jones as a rightwing stooge and discredited Starrsinvestigation as a political war While Democrats discounted impeachment as apartisan jihad the GOP locked arms to prove them right In so doingRepublicans squandered their credibility Now that Clinton stands accused ofrape they sit helplessly mute            Meanwhile Clintonsallies are burying Broaddricks story under the usual political dirt OnMeet the Press  National Organization for Women President PatriciaIreland scoffed that the public wouldnt heed attacks on Clinton from a BobBarr whos been married three times and lied under oath On This Week former bimboleak plumber George Stephanopoulos argued Gennifer Flowersstarts out in the Star tabloid Paula Jones in the AmericanSpectator  Monica Lewinsky with Matt Drudge and now this on the WallStreet Journal editorial page  We have a history of rightwing pressuretactics to push these into play without verification             Its just more sex                        Clintons alleged sexual offenses have progressedalong a spectrum of violence from consensual adultery Flowers to unwantedsolicitation Jones to unwanted groping Kathleen Willey to rapeBroaddrick But his enemies intent on proving a pattern of behavior anddestroying him with whichever scandal was at hand lumped them together andoverplayed the lesser charges Their latest gaffe was to spend a yearprosecuting Clinton for lying about consensual adultery while the Willeyinvestigation remained offstage            The point of the rapecharge is that its different Yet once again Clintons critics are lumping itinto a pattern Broaddricks story is believable because of its wretchedfamiliarity wrote columnist Michael Kelly citing Clintons piggishbehavior with Lewinsky as evidence that he could be a brute On Meet thePress  hamfisted moralist Bill Bennett huffed How many times does thiskind of thing have to come up  We have heard seen this pattern beforeABCs George Will chimed in Is this out of character Please On Fox NewsSunday  host Tony Snow touted a poll showing that  percent of Americansthink the allegations represent a pattern of behavior            Clintons apologists are content to subsume the allegationof violence into a pattern of sex and thereby dismiss it as immaterialStephanopoulos rephrased the rape charge as a question about the relevance ofcandidates private lives Sen James Jeffords RVt dismissed the story asa private matter though he later apologized Id like to see us get on tothe issues replied Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle DSD when askedon This Week about Broaddricks allegation Sen Paul WellstoneDMinn used the same dodge on Fox News Sunday  Cant we focus onissues that are important to people            Already the media aredissolving Broaddricks story into a pattern of philandering The ChicagoTribune called it another allegation of boorish and immoral sexualbehavior CNN Late Edition panelist Steve Roberts cited its uneasyfamiliarity And This Week cohost Cokie Roberts worried that inpursuing it the press would again be accused of asking too many questions about the candidates life Framed this way the story is dying             It cant be proved                        Not content to disgrace Clinton morally hisadversaries tried to inflate his coverup of the Lewinsky affair into crimesand impeachable offenses Not only did this weak poison fail to kill him itstrengthened his immune system It raised the threshold for inquiring intoClintons personal behavior and for obliging him to answer questions If anoffense cant be prosecuted and proved in court it no longer matters            This mindset has crippledBroaddricks story in four ways First it has induced a sense of helplessnessabout charges that cant be legally proved There is no way well ever knowwhat all the facts are Daschle argued on This Week  What we have todo now is move on Crossfire cohost Bill Press agreed Theres no wayto prove shes telling the truth  Well never know New York TimesManaging Editor Bill Keller added The merits of the allegations are probablyunknowable Legally it doesnt seem to go anywhere This notion that thecharge doesnt go anywhere legalizes and objectifies the investigativeprocess absolving the speaker of responsibility to pursue the question            Likewise the word unknowable disguises the fact that themerits of the charges are not only knowable they are known by two peopleBroaddrick has now spoken Shouldnt Clinton When asked this question Daschlereplied I dont think youre going to hear anything from him nor do I thinkits going to lend any new information Lets move on Thus the passiveprediction that Clinton will successfully lie stonewall or evade the questionglosses over whether the media have a duty to ask it and Clinton has a duty toanswer it            Second the legalframework shifts the burden from Clinton to his accusers When asked on LateEdition whether Clinton was obliged to respond to Broaddricks allegationSen Joe Lieberman DConn said that was up to the president and called thecharge effectively unprovable On Meet the Press  Susan Estrich fumedthat those who dared to pursue the question would tear peoples lives apartbased on a plausible allegation Estrich demanded a higher standard for suchan inquiry On Fox News Sunday  Steven Brill defended Clintons silenceas a legal tactic to avoid a libel suit            Third this framework lends a highminded legal cast to alowminded excuse for ignoring the story Instead of admitting to scandalfatigue and fear of exasperating the public reporters and politicians observethat the statute of limitations on the rape charge has expired A legitimatereason not to prosecute Clinton thus becomes a bogus reason not to questionhim Its not that were tired and its not that were lacking in moraloutrage Estrich asserted But unless youre ready to reopen the impeachmentprocess  the country wants to move on The bipartisan movement to kill theindependent counsel law provides additional legal cover for this exit Thetime has come for us to close the books Daschle argued            Fourth the notion that the courts are responsiblefor all inquiry lets politicians and journalists pass the buck Upon leavingoffice Clinton will be subject to criminal prosecution just as any othercitizen would be observed Wellstone On This Week  Rep John KasichROhio refused to say whether anything should be done about Broaddricksstory Im really not involved in that at all  The proper authoritiesought to handle it Conversely Steve Roberts predicted that the story woulddie because Republicans dont want to touch it and fellow LateEdition panelist Susan Page added Theres no legal process continuingwith it Theres no impeachment process I dont see what keeps this storyalive            Maybe Bill Clinton wasnever in that room with Juanita Broaddrick Maybe they had consensual sexMaybe what seemed coercive to her seemed merely rough to him Maybe he lostcontrol and has regretted it ever since But the bottom line is that hesgiving no answers and a nation jaded by spin is giving him a pass Its lessand less clear that actions have consequences And its more and more clearthat ideas do
