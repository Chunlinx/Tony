            about the weather  uh   oh yes uh very appropriate i guess uh you ready for this   yeah   okay John just a moment   well guess what we get to talk about the weather  uh   the weather is uh this time of year has actually been kind of unusual ive expected it to be colder until you know what weve gotten last couple days   uhhuh   i dont know i i fly for a living and ive uh the weathers been terribly unusual every where ive been   oh you do so you you you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather and imagine its kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather   yeah yeah yeah that way it was around here last night ill tell you that     well actually im ive ive heard on the news that we uh will be setting a  record here in the state of Texas for the uh large amounts of rain and moisture weve had this year that its gonna break all kind of records that were set set set back since nineteen thirty two   no kidding   so yeah  if it uh keeps on raining like this and i understand its supposed to rain until Saturday night   hm Saturday or Sunday they were saying yeah   oh yes so were gonna   yeah i know the systems have been real strong out i went through uh Phoenix on twice on uh Wednesday morning   uhhuh   and uh shot approaches to low minimum it was both both times you know and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather   wow     so   well so are you an airline pilot   yes i am with Southwest yeah yep   oh great with Southwest fantastic i have a brother i have a brother thats a pilot also with American   yeah yeah oh is that right   yes and so i imagine you uh oh with all this kind of weather its uh makes it kind of dangerous for you   well now i no i wouldnt call it danger this is uh this really isnt bad stuff to fly around in this is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the springtime   oh i guess so yeah   you know the the the air systems are reasonably calm you dont have uh the turbulence you know you little bit of chop but its not like it is in the spring time   umhum oh yes well we moved actually down here from another location and its spectacular the the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain   so   spectacular is the right word for them   pardon me   spectacular is a good word for them           ive never seen a thunder show like ive seen down here before in in Texas   its amazing   lights up the whole sky and even on a on a actually ive ive seen it where theres not a cloud in the sky its a cloudless night and the rain isnt falling but you can see the thunder and lightning excuse me see the lightning going horizontally across the sky and and back and forth and what a light show its its fabulous   oh yeah yeah yeah cloud to cloud it can be real really sensational here   yes yes thats true   yeah really where you from originally   im from uh northern Utah and thats a very arid climate from uh Salt Lake City area   umhum   and theres always a lot of snow in fact where i grew up we were about an hours drive from seven to uh twelve different major ski resorts and so there was an awful lot of snow and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow   oh oh yeah   which made it fantastic for skiing and and sleigh riding and everything else so we had a great time and   oh oh yeah yeah were you near Park they were near the Park Cities area   um yeah   yeah thats beautiful area   in a in Snowbird and Solitude and   umhum   and Brighton and yes all those areas so i imagine have you skied before     well weve skied i have not skied that area ive driven through it several times uh ive skied we skied California a bunch when we lived out there and   umhum umhum   and uh um and of course grew we grew up in Minnesota and we do some skiing there   oh yes oh yes   lot of cross country skiing there   yeah great well do you think this the the weather is typical for this time of the year   well not really i you know Minnesotas gotten just hammered with snow um the uh the um       uh weve getting a fair amount of rain for this time of year already i i think and uh ive been surprised that we havent seen more of the temperatures that weve got today you know that moved in last night   yes yeah yeah its been its been cold there was a time though in the uh middle part of November that got really cool really really unseasonably cool   yeah yes it did   and then it warmed right back up and i thought great  and thats   yeah yeah   thats a fun thing yeah uh my wife was just listening here and she said yeah it froze in fact   yeah it was it was real cold that was that was very unseasonable for us down here   and uh but uh ive really enjoyed the weather down here too because uh two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather weather and its not as severe i should say as the weather that ive experienced up in northern Utah   yeah oh yeah thats thats real true same with us from Minnesota its its uh in fact ive i played golf on the first on the New Years Day one year   down here   you know it was yeah yeah   not in Minnesota   no no no no   i have a brotherinlaw that lives in Minnesota and they say boy six months out of the year its bitter cold and   oh it is it is   and the wind and the blowing snow and everything its   well and theyve had uh you know usually in Minnesota they get their snow in January and uh February   umhum   and theyre up over sixty five or sixty
