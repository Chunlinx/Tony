                                 Reagans Triumph Over Collectivism                        Dear Alan            Now youve done it You have ruined our chance to makehistory by achieving almost complete unanimity I knew this bipartisanship wastoo good to last Oh well back to the battlefront            I dont want to fall into the trap of disagreeing withyou by defending Edmund Morris Ill concede that in the areas where Morrisembraces Reaganism its generally for wrong and simpleminded reasons Theamazing truth which I take it you accept is that it is Morris and not Reaganwho is the political simpleton            So why dont we leave poor Morris behind to enjoy hisRobert Frost and Edna Millay And lets examine the two main elements ofReaganism his attack on the welfare state and his role in the collapse of theSoviet Union Actually Reagan saw these as a single crusade His life wasdevoted to challenging and discrediting collectivism For Reagan Sovietcommunism was only the most grotesque version of the collectivist impulseReagan devoted his career to bringing down the evil empire But Reagan wasequally determined to discredit the Great Society because he didnt trustintellectuals to plan the economy and he correctly worried that high taxesand government programs like welfare would diminish individual freedom andresponsibility            In practice Reagan didnt cut domestic spending verymuch Actually government spending on domestic programs grew under Reagan Ithink this is the price that Reagan consciously paid for fighting the Cold WarHe knew that the Democratic House led by Tip ONeill would never agree to cutdomestic programs and put the money into B bombers So Reagan settled forkeeping government domestic spending roughly constant while he focused hisenergy on defense hikes aimed as he put it at inviting the Soviets into anarms race that they couldnt win            But if Reagan lost the battle to control domesticspending he won the war over the larger question of the growth of the welfarestate Reagan launched a powerful moral attack on the idea of Big GovernmentHe challenged the idea popularized by JFK that if you were an idealisticAmerican you should join the Peace Corps or do public service in otherwords become a bureaucrat Reagan denounced the bureaucrat as a donothing anda loser and celebrated the entrepreneur as one of the highest embodiments ofAmerican creativity and possibility And I think that Reagan prevailed The eraof the welfare state that began with FDR effectively ended with RR BillClinton admitted as much when he said the era of big government is overToday its a settled question that markets not intellectuals and bureaucratsrun the economy            Alan I expect that you think this is a bad outcomeIm not trying to change your mind about this But I am trying to establishthat it is Reagan who brought about the change Previous Republicans such asEisenhower Nixon and Ford had made their peace with the welfare state Theirview was that Republicans would run programs with greater attention to fiscalresponsibility than Democrats Reagan by contrast proclaimed that governmentis not the solution government is the problem He launched a principledattack on the notion that government is more capable of running the countrythan the private sector And we have Reagan to thank or blame for the erathat were living in now the era of the entrepreneur            So what about the Soviet Union My view is that twopeople deserve the credit for the fall of the evil empire Reagan andGorbachev Of these two Reagan deserves the greater praise because hepredicted the collapse of the Soviet regime intended the outcome andimplemented policies aimed at producing that result Gorbachev by contrastdesperately tried to save the regime adopted glasnost and perestroika to that end and saw the system blow up inhis face            Your theory which is that the Soviet empire sufferedfrom grave internal weakness and collapsed of its own weight makes littlesense to me If you are referring to economic inefficiencies I am not aware ofany weaknesses that the Soviets suffered in the s that were not also presentduring the s or the s or the s or any decade since the Bolshevikscame to power The Soviet economy has always been a basket case and the buttof grim jokes            Moreover even if the s dramatized Soviet economicincompetence because the US economy was growing so rapidly this is no reasonfor the Soviet empire to implode in the way that it did There is simply nohistorical precedent for a large empire calling it quits because it could notcompete economically or technologically As you know the Roman and the Ottomanempires suffered from grave internal weaknesses but persisted for centuriesWhy should a ruling elite give up power because the gross national product isdeclining or because the country is falling behind technologically            I cannot hope to settle this large issue here Nor am Iclaiming that Reagan singlehandedly produced the result The pope wascritical especially in Poland Margaret Thatcher Lech Walesa and VaclavHavel all performed important supporting roles And the West benefited from theappointment of Gorbachev an incompetent but goodnatured fellow who played hispart as the opposing teams quarterback who kept throwing interceptions            But Reagan was the prime architect of Soviet collapseHe united the Western coalition and he led Gorbachev over the precipice Ihonestly believe that if Reagan and Gorbachev had not come to power when theydidif Brezhnev had lived and if Carter had served a second term and Mondaleand Dukakis had succeeded himthe Soviet empire would be intact today I askedCzech president Vaclav Havel about this when he came to Washington a few yearsago and he agreed wholeheartedly with my analysis And Henry Kissinger no fanof Ronald Reagan acknowledges in his book Diplomacy that Reagans role in bringing about the end of theSoviet empire represents the greatest diplomatic feat in the second half ofthe twentieth century            I think history will vindicate that judgment I dontexpect todays generation of historians many of whom opposed Reagan all theirlives to admit their errors But the new generation of historians who wonthave a personal stake in opposing Reagan will recognize his achievement Asfor me I wrote my book about Reagan because Id like to see him get at leastsome of the recognition he deserves during his lifetime            BestDinesh
