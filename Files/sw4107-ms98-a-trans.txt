              so well what what are you guys doing with recycling   uh well i mean in DC theres a law uh that was recently passed that like um you have to  its a law i think that organizations have to provide recycling i guess recycling bins they have to recycle its a law to do it   yeah they just they just did the same thing up here uh the whole county built a uh uh incinerator actually only two thirds of the county built it   right   and they also of course they had to the New York State EEC the environmental people mandate that you have to recycle things so anybody who wants funding or doesnt want their landfills closed and sued       has to uh recycle   its like um i mean personally ive never been a recycling nut in terms of like i dont i dont go out of my way and i think like they put uh receptacles around campus and the dorms and that makes me um  more apt to do it because its there its more convenient right   yeah a lot of people up here the exact same way you know they wont lift a finger and uh it hasnt gotten around here that you know you go to any store or something and there is a trash can there isnt a bin for glass a bin for   right   its its really just on the verge it it hasnt quite happened yet but that you know i was on vacation a couple places uh uh Utah had some bins   yeah i mean im looking right here theres a waste bin  for waste i dont know i guess they recycle i guess they can recycle normal waste im not really sure and theres trash cans too i mean generally when im right when i if i go by the waste bin ill put something in there if it fits  theyve got cans and bottles um and bins for paper     so you wouldnt walk around for a long time with a can in your hand because you couldnt found a uh a bin for it   no no not really i mean     toss it in the first place that it  that you could find   yeah i mean like the right now im in uh our student center studying and ill go out of my ill walk up get up from my table and walk out of my way i mean well theyre right near the trash can so ill ill toss it in the bin but um as far as if im walking in the street drinking a soda and i finish it im going to toss it in the nearest trash can probably i mean its convenient its its there if the the recycling bin is not there im probably im if it was there id use it   right well i think well maybe thats a good way to uh promote recycling is just to make it more available   yeah   yeah   exactly i mean even in my in my dorm its in the basement but i pile it i let i let them pile up in the trash in my uh in the garbage in um a giant bag a a shopping bag and then uh take it down in the basement and toss it in the uh recycling trash can um but yeah i mean more receptacles uh around on the streets even would would um make people do it i mean if its there theyre going to do it still i mean some people wont even go that far out of their way there are people who are pretty ignorant and i mean or are really set in their ways   yeah i guess you know my mom she always recycled everything   yeah   so im use to it but if i was use to just throwing things away it would be a really tough habit to unlearn   yeah   so maybe you know the next generation will be a little bit more uh conscientious than we are   yeah im sure they will i mean with uh the way things are going i mean uh its going towards a more green type of thing green thinking should call it people more aware more aware they need to save the environment and all that   course you are on a college campus where people are more aware than the general public   right oh definitely i mean theres been plenty of uh up roar about the uh Marriott using um styrofoam cups and styrofoam plates and that kind of thing     now now thats really tough because you read stuff and you cant tell whether a styrofoam plate is actually more or less wasteful than a paper one or some other plastic   yeah cause i mean yeah the paper ones are have plastic coated and theyre probably even worse i dont really know   yeah who knows whats not   harder to recycle   and uh you know if you put them in a landfill they take up the same amount of space   yeah   because the paper doesnt break down either   well i think its possible to recycle styrofoam but its more expensive um they do have reusable cups that people can uh i mean basically youve got carry around this cup if you want to if you want to be uh environmentally um conscious and they i believe they give discounts on on drinks if you have this cup so thats kind of incentive       you have a discount on your on your on your drink instead of the regular price or whatever   well that thats good i mean God forbid you should actually you know have a cup and then wash it out once and a while and reuse it   yeah right   yeah like imagine that
