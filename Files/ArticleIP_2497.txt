                                 Can Newt Gingrich Save Social Security            House Speaker Newt Gingrichhas been gently tapping the third rail of American politicsSocial Securityreformto see if the electricity it generates is truly lethal Earlier thisyear Gingrich impressed a group of journalists at the World Economic Forum inDavos Switzerland with a disciplined description of his thoughts on thesubject At the time the speakers remarks were off the record That he hasnow agreed to let them be reported may be due in part to the cover provided bytwo Democratic senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Robert Kerreyof Nebraska who have unveiled a Social Security plan that is in certain waysmore radical and less socially conscious than what the speaker seems to have inmind            Gingrichs approach will not placate diehard defenders of the current systemwho are already up in arms about the Moynihan plan Nor will it satisfy firebreathing privatizers who would dump the whole thing and set every wageearner free to make a killing on Wall Street But the speaker like Moynihanand Kerrey would start to move some of Social Securitys current surplusesinto private sector investments He would do it by setting up SocialSecurityplus accounts for each participant These could be invested in abroad based portfolio of private securities with low risk but a higher rateof return than government bonds            The basic idea is not new Last year for example all members of the Social Security Advisory Council agreed that some part of thetrust funds should be invested in the private market though they didnt agreeon how The reason is simple The Social Security system is missing out on itsown golden yearsthe one period in the programs lifetime when it should bepossible both to keep paying benefits to current retirees and to make prudentprovision for future claimants            Thatsbecause over the last several years and for several to come Social Securitypayroll taxes have far exceeded and will continue to far exceed the benefitspaid out Those surpluses totaling more than  trillion by the end of thisdecade are supposed to be invested against the rainy day when the babyboomers retire Instead they are simply transferred to the Treasury inexchange for IOUs plus IOUs for interest on past loans The money is thenused to help cover the costs of everything from Black Hawk helicopters to WhiteHouse spinners Social Security is thus doing the rest of the budgetand ahuge favor since without its loans the much touted budget surplus would be atripledigit deficit            This is like replacing the money youd beensaving for your kids college tuition with an IOme note buying a new car andthen congratulating yourself on your financial prudence But in the case ofSocial Security theres an added problem A payroll tax is a lousy way to payfor most of what government buys Its fair enough to use such a tax to pay fora social insurance program that provides coverage in rough proportion tocontributions This is especially so since Social Securitys retirement anddisability benefit formulas are heavily weighted to favor low earners Buttheres no justification for paying for defense or environmental protection orthe weather bureau with a regressive tax that hits only the lower part ofearnings and hits investment income not at all Well there is onejustification Otherwise Congress and the president would have to cutspending raise taxes or just admit they cant come close to balancing thebudget            In theirplan Moynihan and Kerrey would address this inequity by cutting payroll taxesby some  billion over the next decade thus eliminating the trust fundsurplus To keep the deficit in the rest of the budget from being laid bare forall to ogle they propose both tax hikes and benefit cuts Click for asummary Some savings would come from higher income and payroll taxesespecially on welloff workers and retirees Expect a hue and cry to be raisedamong tax cut advocates against the plans provisions calling for smallerinflation adjustments in the income tax code But much would come in the formof reduced Social Security benefits notably accelerated increases in theretirement age and a onepercentagepoint cut in annual costofliving benefitadjustments Most economists do agree that the Consumer Price Indexsignificantly overstates inflation and the system currently adjusts retireesinitial benefits for real economic growth as well as for inflation But thesenators cut is toward the high end of the consensus especially if sustainedlong into the future            How plausible are these proposals A truly honest reformwould force the general budget to pay for itself and let Social Securityreserve its past as well as its future surpluses for the systems nextcenturyneeds But the senators would soften the benefit cuts by offering workers ashot at higher private sector returns Beginning in  workers could takethe full twopercentagepoint cut in payroll taxes they propose including theemployer share and invest the money in personal savings accounts Otherwiseworkers can pocket their own half of the payroll tax cut That would makeSocial Security look much like the current government employee retirementplanand many private sector plansin which a fixed benefit pension issupplemented by a savings plan in which worker contributions are matched byemployer contributions up to certain limits            Thetrouble with this as former Social Security Commissioner Robert Ball pointsout is that making the savings accounts voluntary means that many lowerwageworkers will surely choose not to participate Moreover if workers are alloweda wide range of investment choices then administrative costs error ratesandriskwill soar And even if investments are limited to a relatively small menuof governmentsupervised options the timing of their contributions orretirement will disadvantage some workers In case youve forgotten the stockmarket doesnt always go up            Gingrich however addresses these concerns ifonly in general terms At Davos he said he didnt even want to use the loadedterm privatization A basic social insurance system is a hallmark of acivilized society he said and it must be governmentrun and mandatoryOtherwise for reasons laudable or frivolous many people wont save the moneyneeded to provide for their old age or unexpected disability and society willend up paying to keep them on welfare Nor should any current retirees fear fortheir benefits especially at a time when the system is generating hugesurpluses that ought to be reserved for the systems future needs No one hasto worry No one should get scared            Still astraditionalists such as Ball acknowledge private investmentseven thebroadbased relatively conservative portfolios selected by insurance companiesand banksdo offer significantly better returns than government bonds TheNational Bureau of Economic Research estimates that stocks outpace Treasurysecurities by a range of  percent to  percent a year Even the lower limitof that differential compounds to a hefty sum over time Moreover redirectingtrust fund surpluses into the private market which is what the MoynihanKerreyplan essentially does has one large potential advantagewhen the time comesto redeem the securities the money should really be there            And thats the key point The incremental reforms thattraditionalists favor to put the systems books in longterm balance all assumethat the current trust fund balances held in the form of Treasury bonds arereally being compounded and preserved But when the time comes to redeem thebonds or even when the annual payroll tax surpluses begin to taper off severalyears from now the government will be forced to choose among uglyalternatives It will have to cut other spending raise other taxes or morelikely sell other bonds to the publicthat is run a big budget deficitSocial Security itself wouldnt go bankrupt As long as there are still USworkers paying payroll taxes and if there arent well have many far biggerproblems these can cover at least partial benefits But the pressure to cutbenefits or sharply raise payroll taxes would be enormous            Moynihanhas long been a stalwart advocate of traditional social insurance By hisabrupt switch to the side of relatively radical reform the senator has openedup a gap in the middle of the debate In a further role reversal Gingrich mayhave positioned himself to fill it                           If
