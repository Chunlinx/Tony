                                 The Accidental Theorist            Imagine an economy thatproduces only two things hot dogs and buns Consumers in this economy insistthat every hot dog come with a bun and vice versa And labor is the only inputto production            OK timeout Before we goany further I need to ask what you think of an essay that begins this wayDoes it sound silly to you Were you about to turn the virtual page figuringthat this couldnt be about anything important            One of the points of thiscolumn is to illustrate a paradox You cant do serious economics unless youare willing to be playful Economic theory is not a collection of dictums laiddown by pompous authority figures Mainly it is a menagerie of thoughtexperimentsparables if you likethat are intended to capture the logic ofeconomic processes in a simplified way In the end of course ideas must betested against the facts But even to know what facts are relevant you mustplay with those ideas in hypothetical settings And I use the word playadvisedly Innovative thinkers in economics and other disciplines often havea pronounced whimsical streak            It so happens that I amabout to use my hotdogandbun example to talk about technology jobs and thefuture of capitalism Readers who feel that big subjects can only be properlyaddressed in big bookswhich present big ideas using big wordswill find myintellectual style offensive Such people imagine that when they write or quotesuch books they are being profound But more often than not theyre beingprofoundly foolish And the best way to avoid such foolishness is to playaround with a thought experiment or two            So lets continue Supposethat our economy initially employs  million workers which corresponds moreor less to full employment It takes two persondays to produce either a hotdog or a bun Hey realism is not the point here Assuming that the economyproduces what consumers want it must be producing  million hot dogs and million buns each day  million workers will be employed in each sector            Nowsuppose that improved technology allows a worker to produce a hot dog in oneday rather than two And suppose that the economy makes use of this increasedproductivity to increase consumption to  million hot dogs with buns a dayThis requires some reallocation of labor with only  million workers nowproducing hot dogs  million producing buns            Then a famous journalist arrives on the scene He takes alook at recent history and declares that something terrible has happenedTwenty million hotdog jobs have been destroyed  When he looks deeperinto the matter he discovers that the output of hot dogs has actually risen percent yet employment has declined  percent He begins a twoyearresearch project touring the globe as he talks with executives governmentofficials and labor leaders The picture becomes increasingly clear to himSupply is growing at a breakneck pace and there just isnt enough consumerdemand to go around True jobs are still being created in the bun sector butsoon enough the technological revolution will destroy those jobs too Globalcapitalism in short is hurtling toward crisis He writes up his alarmingconclusions in a page book full of startling facts about the changesunderway in technology and the global market larded with phrases in JapaneseGerman Chinese and even Malay and punctuated with occasional barbed remarksabout the blinkered vision of conventional economists The book is widelyacclaimed for its erudition and sophistication and its author becomes a lionof the talkshow circuit            Meanwhile economists are abit bemused because they cant quite understand his point Yes technologicalchange has led to a shift in the industrial structure of employment But therehas been no net job loss and there is no reason to expect such a loss in thefuture After all suppose that productivity were to double in buns as well ashot dogs Why couldnt the economy simply take advantage of that higherproductivity to raise consumption to  million hot dogs with buns employing million workers in each sector            Or to putit a different way Productivity growth in one sector can very easily reduceemployment in that sector  But to suppose that productivity growthreduces employment in the economy as a whole is a very different matterIn our hypothetical economy it isor should beobvious that reducing thenumber of workers it takes to make a hot dog reduces the number of jobs in thehotdog sector but creates an equal number in the bun sector and vice versaOf course you would never learn that from talking to hotdog producers nomatter how many countries you visit you might not even learn it from talkingto bun manufacturers It is an insight that you can gain only by playing withhypothetical economiesby engaging in thought experiments            At this point I imagine that readers havethree objections            First isnt my thoughtexperiment too simple to tell us anything about the real world            No not at all For onething if for hot dogs you substitute manufactures and for buns yousubstitute services my story actually looks quite a lot like the history ofthe US economy over the past generation Between  and the present theeconomys output of manufactures roughly doubled but because of increases inproductivity employment actually declined slightly The production of servicesalso roughly doubledbut there was little productivity improvement andemployment grew by  percent Overall the US economy added more than million jobs So in the real economy as in the parable productivity growth inone sector seems to have led to job gains in the other            But thereis a deeper point A simple story is not the same as a simplistic one Even ourlittle parable reveals possibilities that no amount of investigative reportingcould uncover It suggests in particular that what might seem to a naivecommentator like a natural conclusionif productivity growth in the steelindustry reduces the number of jobs for steelworkers then productivity growthin the economy as a whole reduces employment in the economy as a wholemaywell involve a crucial fallacy of composition            But waitwhat entitles me to assume that consumer demandwill rise enough to absorb all the additional production One good answer isWhy not If production were to double and all that production were to be soldthen total income would double too so why wouldnt consumption double Thatis why should there be a shortfall in consumption merely because the economyproduces more            Hereagain however there is a deeper answer It is possible for economiesto suffer from an overall inadequacy of demandrecessions do happen Howeversuch slumps are essentially monetary they come about because people tryin the aggregate to hold more cash than there actually is in circulation Thatinsight is the essence of Keynesian economics And they can usually be curedby issuing more moneyfull stop end of story An overall excess of productioncapacity compared to what has nothing at all to do with it            Perhaps the biggest objection to my hotdogparable is that final bit about the famous journalist Surely no respectedfigure would write a whole book on the world economy based on such atransparent fallacy And even if he did nobody would take him seriously            But while thehotdogandbun economy is hypothetical the journalist is not RollingStone reporter William B Greider has just published a widely heralded newbook titled One World Ready or Not The Manic Logic of GlobalCapitalism  And his book is exactly as I have described it a massivepanoramic description of the world economy which piles fact upon fact some ofthe crucial facts turn out to be wrong but that is another issue in apparentdemonstration of the thesis that global supply is outrunning global demandAlas all the facts are irrelevant to that thesis for they amount to no morethan the demonstration that there are many industries in which growingproductivity and the entry of new producers has led to a loss of traditionaljobsthat is that hotdog production is up but hotdog employment is downNobody it seems warned Greider that he needed to worry about fallacies ofcomposition that the logic of the economy as a whole is not the same as thelogic of a single market            I think Iknow what Greider would answer that while I am talking mere theory hisargument is based on the evidence The fact however is that the US economyhas added  million jobs over the past  yearsfar more jobs have been addedin the service sector than have been lost in manufacturing Greiders view ifI understand it is that this is just a reprievethat any day now the wholeeconomy will start looking like the steel industry But this is a purelytheoretical prediction And Greiders theorizing is all the more speculativeand simplistic because he is an accidental theorist a theorist despitehimselfbecause he and his unwary readers imagine that his conclusions simplyemerge from the facts unaware that they are driven by implicit assumptionsthat could not survive the light of day            Needless to say I have little hope that the generalpublic or even most intellectuals will realize what a thoroughly silly bookGreider has written After all it looks anything but sillyit seemsknowledgeable and encyclopedic and is written in a tone of high seriousnessIt strains credibility to assert the truth which is that the main lesson onereally learns from those  pages is how easy it is for an intelligentearnest man to trip over his own intellectual shoelaces            Why did ithappen Part of the answer is that Greider systematically cut himself off fromthe kind of advice and criticism that could have saved him from himself Hisacknowledgements conspicuously do not include any competent economistsnot asurprising thing one supposes for a man who describes economics as notreally a science so much as a valueladen form of prophecy But I also suspectthat Greider is the victim of his own earnestness He clearly takes his subjectand himself too seriously to play intellectual games To testdrive an ideawith seemingly trivial thought experiments with hypothetical stories aboutsimplified economies producing hot dogs and buns would be beneath his dignityAnd it is precisely because he is so serious that his ideas are so foolish
