                                                            Judge Me by MyActions                        I write to you about the comments by Paul Krugmanin a to a recent column of his in this magazine Dont Blame It on Rio  OrBrasilia Either In it Krugman states that during the week prior to my beingoffered the central bank presidency by President Cardoso I was negotiatingwith the government and that meant I knew nothing bad was going to happen toBrazil At the same time he goes Soros was buying up large quantities ofBrazilian debt at deep discounts            Paul Krugman is a great economist perhaps the bestin his generation As a journalist however he was careless and I happened tobe his unlucky victim His accusation is false He did not bother checking withme I did meet with senior government officials that Wednesday Jan  but Iwas not offered any government job not the least the central bank presidencyI did not have access to any privileged information either As it turned outFriday was a chaotic day in the markets and on Sunday I did get theinvitation which I was honored to accept These are the facts            Since then Krugman haswritten two notes on the episode both available on his Web site In them hestates that he does not believe that I am corrupt thanks but in my worstnightmares I never dreamed my name and the word corruption would appear on thesame page and that he did not treat me unfairly I beg to disagree WhetherKrugman thinks it is right or wrong for someone with market experience to takea government post is immaterial People should be judged by their actions andtheir record not by labels of any kind not by rumors                           Arminio Fraga                                       Commentary                        I suppose you think youare being iconoclastic by publishing Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decters nastymusings on King Hussein on the day of his funeral see  You are wrong Itis never iconoclastic or even interesting to read the predictablechauvinismdriven propaganda of hacks The Israelis the rightwing onesanyway are always right The Arabs are always wrong It is so very tired Toobad that the kind of thinking these two represent has led to so many deadIsraelis and Arabs over the past  years                           MJRosenberg                        ChevyChase Md                           AndDissent                        Why are you subjecting your loyal and usuallyenthusiastic readership to the reactionary bigoted and sexist drivel of MidgeDecter and Norman Podhoretz in  We dont subscribe to                   Slate                inorder to expose ourselves to the ramblings of Anita Bryants spiritualparents            While Podhoretz may be correct in his opinion of AlSharpton his comments regarding Sharpton and Jesse Jackson possess a thinlydisguised undertone of racism As he castigates white liberals for assumingthat Negroes could do no wrong his discussion of Sharptons actions seem tosay Well what can you expect We told those white liberals years ago thatyou couldnt expect more from Negroes Podhoretz implies that Sharptonsbehavior is both representative of and entirely in keeping with the characterof AfricanAmericans in general            Of Decters comments the less said the betterWhile we may deplore that sex has become the dominating factor in many youngpeoples lives the goal should be to expand and emphasize the nonsexual meansof personal expression liberation available to them not to return to therepressive and contaminating moral hypocrisies of a previous age            The best thing that maybe said of Podhoretz and Decter is that their biological clocks cant have manymore minutes left on them And that the editors of                   Slate                willnever see fit to subject their readership to them again                           ChristopherMilazzo                        Albuquerque NM                           StraightShooter                        In his  Jonathan Chait says its misleading tofocus on the ratio of tax revenues to GDP Why Because the boom in stockprices has led to a big jump in federal tax receipts but isnt counted as anaddition to GDP But why should it be The price of a stock reflects thepresent value of expected future earnings these earnings will be counted asincome whenand iftheyre achieved It would surely be silly to count theexpected earnings implicit in the stock price of Amazoncom as income earnedtoday            Chait also errs when hecriticizes the Tax Foundation The group he says assumes that the averagetaxpayer pays an average share of estate and capital gains taxes which isabsurd In fact it isnt absurd at all The median or modal taxpayer may notpay the average but the average one obviously does                           Ira Carnahan                        Washington                           Taxonomy                        Jonathan Chait may be correct that  percent ofincome does not go to the federal government but he is wrong if hethinks that we dont pay around that in taxes overall Does he include theSocial Security and Medicare nontaxes in his calculations of tax burdensState local sales property and gasoline taxes Does he count the other percent of ones salary that goes to Uncle Sam in his tax burden number            Back of the envelope it seems that every workingAmerican pays a flat  percent of salary plus around  percent to  percentin state and sales taxes on every dollar earned or spent respectively plussome unknown amount in property taxes and renters get screwed the most heresince rent of course includes prorated property tax passthroughs plusgasoline taxes plus some special local taxes such as DCs extra taxes onrestaurant meals liquor and other sin taxes All told this seems to add upto a total tax burden for a typical family of nearly  percent            The typical American pays a greater percentage oftotal income to taxes than the rich who would have to pay estate or capitalgains taxes This is true because the vast majority of tax revenue that iscollected in the United States is regressive sales taxes property taxeswhich are passed on to renters so paid by everyone Social Security etcAnd poorer people are more likely to spend money on things like cigarettesalcohol and so on making their total percentage tax burden even largerFinally Social Security tops out at around  making it a smallerpercentage tax burden for the rich than the poor            Perhaps Chait and hisbuddies should donate more to the government                           Eric MEisenstein                        Philadelphia                            Notes onGroove                        Almost everything Cullen Murphy states about theword groovy in  is accurate except for its original meaning Jazzmusicians did indeed use the term to indicate being in the zone but itdidnt necessarily refer to the grooves of a record It referred more to thesense of swing derived from the rhythmic variation in their playing of eighthnotes While classical performers tended to interpret their eighth notesstrictly and evenly jazz musicians provided a little bounce in theirs aslightly uneven distribution of rhythm achieved by placing them slightly behindthe beat andor by making the first eighth note slightly longer than thesecond This heightened the sense of groove by playing against the beat ratherthan on top of it Musicians often refer to a great rhythm section with termslike grooving popping and killing            All great jazz musicianshave an original approach to playing eighth notes from Louis Armstrong toColeman Hawkins to Lester Young to Charlie Parker to Bill Evans to Miles Davisand on and on They all play eighth notes in a unique way They all have theirown grooves Jazz musicians also experimented with several moodalteringsubstances and this also plays into a sense of feeling groovy
