              well who wants to go first here   you you can go ahead   well to me capital punishment is uh how should i say it uh i dont think its its neither the last thing that its neither the first uh thing that i would  think that needs to be done you know to great length uh how should say it uh not wholesale or something to be shunned at all costs   yeah   but it is uh something that i think that uh is uh   necessary uh under circumstances under many circumstances   well i think um i dont think really it should go much  for you know rapist or just people who broke into a house nothing like that but i think if someones killed someone then they deserve to die thats how i see it      yeah uh my uh i heard a guy one time who explained it uh in in in kind of a natural way he said uh said just outside of my door theres a theres a hornets nest and uh thats youre from Atlanta right   no Dallas   oh excuse me Dallas do they have hornets in Dallas   uh they have big bees   okay big bees anyway says theres a hornets nest right outside of his door and he says i i hate to do it but i had to uh to uh to get rid of them and they were just doing what they were supposed to do you know thats what nature equipped them to do and they were doing their thing and but it was pretty threatening to my family so i got rid of them and then he said uh now i have uh he says and that was too bad its too bad i couldnt relocate it   and he said now i have a uh we have somebody who has the will and the ability to be good but instead they choose to be very bad they can destroy any lives and and uh uh and and if not your life your uh   yeah   mental stability so to speak after they submit you to to uh and he says uh i dont have a lot of feeling for them i have more feeling for the for the hornets than i do for these people that are preying on on uh society   yeah   so im uh lets see the the other question i had i guess was uh i heard one person on the radio say uh where do we get the right to put these people death and  or the the corresponding question is where do we get the right to put people in jail at all     yeah i think um i think its kind of sad people who a guy can go out and        completely slaughter a family and theres always got to be one person saying that they should have a chance to live and that the person who did the murdering should have a chance to live and i just dont think thats right i think it just makes me want the killer to go after that persons family just one person just to see so that that person will see how the other family felt      yeah   just so that theyll they can understand all the pain that theyre going through and you know then they wouldnt be saying well that killer has a life too because its not true the as soon as the killer kills someone they they should deserve to die their life is over too i mean they took someone elses life so i dont i just dont think they should deserve to live i think  everybody whos ever murdered well i dont know because theres always people who um like fathers who a daughter was raped and they went after the the rapist i think thats kind of a good crime there   in my uh youre youre more conservative than some people that i couldve talked to but i kind of agree with that uh theres there are people out there who just choose to uh like i said based on my little hornet example they choose to do bad then they  because theyre human have the ability to   umhum   to uh to do immense harm and uh when a person chooses to do that time after time i dont have a lot of uh uh i i just dont feel like theyre you know whats there to say uh there are people out there that have made mistakes and theyre sorry for it uh i feel bad for them but on the other hand   yeah   anything in nature that doesnt that doesnt rid itself of of uh decay uh winds up in pretty sad shape and i think thats what were having now and so weve got some pretty sad sad conditions out there weve got these guys that go out there and and uh do drug uh uh how should i say it wholesale murders   umhum   and what that means is that the politicians rather than try and clean up this that nest of uh problems theyll theyll come out to uh to uh people and theyll say what you you have to uh were going to enact stricter laws on the rest of you   yeah   you know and and so uh i dont know i ive ive i i guess you can say im pretty strongly in favor of capital punishment as long as as long as its not uh
