                okay what do you feel are some of the main problems      well im in a im in an urban area im in Dallas   umhum   and were finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem uh even a more major problem uh in Dallas some of the major problems um        drugs seems to be related related to quite a bit of the crime we have now there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with uh people trying to get money for drugs   yeah   and uh i think thats a national problem though its not unique   it it its pretty bad here too weve had a lot of murders drug related and stuff and in Durham which is right next to Raleigh   yes uhhuh well now were pretty close to the golden triangle arent you   yeah that that Durham Raleigh and Chapel Hill is the triangle   right research triangle and all of that and um   right      im sure you have a lot of students there uh and a lot of researchers so you you may have a you know perhaps a little better economic climate but in all your cities now it seems like there theres a a crowd thats really effected by this bill   yeah its its really its and and ive seen in more in Durham than i have in Raleigh or or   really   or Chapel Hill Chapel Hill is kind of a a ritzy        city or whatever i mean its kind of im im sure theres problems with it but it has a pretty low crime rate compare compared to to Durham has probably got the worst theyve had like forty eight murders since the beginning of the year and over half of its been drug related   really hm well here uh im not sure how many Dallas has had ive uh Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four i I dont know a a number every week   yeah   uh Dallas is having quite a few it seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or or like i say drug related        uh i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values seems like a a lot of people dont hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to   yeah   um i   well that and the and the economys so bad and   the economy is lousy   and so many people have been laid off and stuff theyve done special stories on the news local news here weve had a lot of bank robberies and different lot of breakins and stuff   umhum      i know like a week or so ago i live in a in a town house which is you know its a pretty nice neighborhood and this lady was going to work she came home and everything in her house was total gone light fixtures everything and nobody thought any different they just thought she was moving it was a moving man pulled right up to her house broke in and stole everything she owned   boy that really that really takes someone whos bold to do that   well yeah its its its pretty bad   well now do you find that security is very good in in a in a town home   um i would say so for the majority in in our in my little section of the neighborhood because theres always somebody at home and we all know one another and and on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that were not moving  and different things like that its i im   uhhuh well that   im probably the one of the youngest people that live over here most people are are retired or or   i see   or you know theyre theyre in their forties or or whatever so and im in my twenties so i im im out more than they are but theyre at home at night so i really dont worry about anything   yeah well i think you hit on one point there is you know each other im im in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything uh i am   yeah      oh about three blocks off a major road and uh a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts and uh im over the northeast part of Dallas and its a in a nice neighborhood the houses here uh before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and course everythings down ten to twenty percent now   yeah see thats the same thing here   but we have uh one one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away        and now that the economy is bad they have trouble keeping those full so theyve dropped the uh uh theyre not nearly as selective as they used to be   yeah   and course thats kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex you start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so uh im sure that aggravates it also   yeah   but unemployment now in Dallas or in Texas is up around six point
