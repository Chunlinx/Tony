A Brief HistoryThe first wave of California immigrants arrived somewhere between  and  years agowandering Asiatic tribes who entered the American continent via the Bering Strait which at that time was dry land or perhaps covered in ice In the succeeding centuries their descendants continued to push south and east and eventually spread out to people the whole of the continent from Alaska to Patagonia The tribes who decided to settle in what is now California were fortunate in their choice of homeland The climate was very pleasant and food was sufficiently plentiful for them to avoid the constant warfare that plagued many tribes elsewhere in the AmericasThe Indian tribes lived in harmony with nature Anticipating s flower children seeking druginduced enlightenment medicine men drank the juice of the jimson weed to provoke revelatory hallucinations However not even their wildest visions prepared them for the arrival of bearded men armed with swords and crossbows in whose wake the Indian population plummeted from a peak of  to a mere  at the start of the th centuryThe Spanish MissionsThe first Europeans landed on the California coast in the th centurySpanish explorers in search of gold seeking to extend their Mexican empire northward In  Juan Rodrguez Cabrillo a Portuguese mariner in the employ of the Viceroy of Mexico landed at Point Loma at the mouth of San Diego harbor He sailed on past the Bay of Smokes San Pedro in presentday Los Angeles and on through the Santa Barbara Channel During a scuffle with Native Americans he broke his leg and contracted gangrene which was to prove fatal but his crew pushed on as far as Oregon They found few good harbors however and no sign of gold and had to return emptyhandedIn  Englands Francis Drake during the roundtheworld trip that earned him his knighthood took a break from harrying Spanish treasure galleons and stopped for repairs at Point Reyes Drakes Bay just north of San Francisco He claimed the whole coastal territory for Queen Elizabeth I but England was being kept busy with other concerns and no attempt was made to settle the new territoryIn  the Spanish began to settle in California establishing a string of military garrisons presidios and religious missions The first was built in San Diego in  and then in  Monterey was founded as capital of Alta Upper California The long peninsula of Baja Lower California remained separate and ultimately became part of MexicoThese early missionaries who were led by the Franciscan friar Junpero Serra were all tough and courageous men who faced hunger and hardship when their first agricultural efforts failed Their plan was to convert the Native Americans to Christianity teach them European farming methods as well as other skills and crafts and then return the land to them before moving on to set up another mission somewhere elseThe missionaries remained active well into the th century and encouraged Spanish settlers by establishing Californias first towns the pueblos By  they had created a chain of  missions that stretched all the way from San Diego north to SonomaTwo notable localities were first settled during this period In  a presidio and a mission were built near the mouth of the beautiful bay discovered by Gaspar de Portol in it was named the Misin San Francisco de AssThe first two pueblos to be founded were the Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe near San Francisco and in the south El Pueblo de Nuestra Seora la Reina de los Angeles del Ro de PorcinculaThe Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels by the River Porcincula Founded in  with a total of  inhabitants most of whom were Native Americans its name was mercifully shortened over time toyou guessed itLos AngelesAt this time California was not considered a particularly attractive proposition by its Spanish overlords Distracted by the Napoleonic wars raging in Europe they finally abandoned the territory when Mexico declared its independence in The MexicansAs far as California was concerned the Mexican takeover was practically bloodless In fact Californias  years of rather loose Mexican administration  were characterized by a series of bloodless revolutions The governorship at Monterey changed hands  times in a period of five years not counting three governors whom Mexico City had dared to impose and whose authority was then completely ignored There was some halfhearted fighting between northerners and southerners for control of the property and lands left by the Spanish missionaries half of which was meant to be returned to the Native Americans but never wasCalifornia grew into a territory with just one industrycattle ranching for the sale of cowhide and tallow In the meantime the old crafts were abandoned and California started to earn a reputation as a place of leisureThe American PioneersThe first Americans to come to California from the eastern states were Boston fur traders taking the Cape Horn route at the end of the th century They didnt stay for long but gradually other traders and fur trappers began to arrive overland through Utah Nevada Arizona and New Mexico settling only in small numbers until the famous covered wagons began their heroic treks of the s The hardships the pioneers suffered in the Sierra Nevada mountains Death Valley and the Mojave Desert became the stuff of California legend the most tragic being the fate of  pioneers who set out from Illinois in  While attempting to cross the Sierra Nevada George Donners wagon train became snowed in and from November until February was stuck high in the mountains north of Lake Tahoe at a point now known as the Donner Pass Just  people survived and then only by resorting to cannibalismJust simple farmers seeking a place in the sun to work a piece of land the pioneers came at a time when territorial expansion was much in voguethe French in the Pacific and Algeria the British in Africa and the Far East The United States was eager to get in on the act and so during the war with Mexico over the annexation of Texas California was suddenly regarded as a useful addition to the spoils United States forces captured Los Angeles in  and the Mexicans capitulated at Cahuenga A treaty of American annexation of California was signed on  February  Meanwhile unknown to the American and Mexican signatories gold had been found in the Sierra Nevada foothills only nine days earlierThe Gold RushThe find that caught the whole worlds imagination was made by one James Wilson Marshall a carpenter at John Sutters sawmill on the American River at Coloma which lies midway between Sacramento and Lake Tahoe He had found flakes of carat gold in the river gravel and in the following year alone  prospectors poured in from Hawaii Oregon Utah Mexico Peru and Chile and proceeded to dig up  million worth of the precious metal In  the Gold Rush really began with  fortune hunters from all parts of North and South America scrabbling for the  million worth of goldBy  at the peak of the mining boom there were over  prospectors in the region all fiercely individualistic working away at their personal private stakes rather than banding together in organized syndicatesThere was also another fortune to be madethis time from the service industriesand San Francisco home of the banks and manufacturers of mining equipment began to grow into a metropolis All kinds of conmen and hustlers flocked in to part the diggers from their gold dust One of the more enduring spinoffs of the Gold Rush was the hardwearing work trousers sold by the Bavarian immigrant and entrepreneur Levi Strauss Originally made from tent canvas and later from the twillweave cotton known as denim Levis jeans are now world famousLured by the promise of increased federal revenues from the newly discovered gold the United States Congress admitted California as the st state of the Union in StatehoodThe early years of statehood were marked by a roughandready kind of justice In the absence of a wellestablished judiciary or organized police force law and order was enforced by vigilantes and summary hanging was the usual sentenceThe Chinese arrived in the wake of the great Taiping Rebellion of  seeking security and prosperity in what they were told were Californias Golden Mountains They suffered both exploitation by Chinese entrepreneurs who used them as indentured labor and discriminatory taxation by the state legislature The worsttreated however were the Native Americans whose numbers dwindled rapidly not only as a result of disease and malnutrition but also because of systematic massacres in the s by Californian militiaIn  the discovery of silver the Comstock Lode in western Nevada caused a Silver Rush in the reverse direction with the mining being organized almost completely from California As the states economy expanded its major priority became a transcontinental railway to connect it to the eastern markets Engineer Theodore Judah defied all the experts by plotting a railway link between Sacramento and the East passing right through the heart of the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky mountains He managed to sell his idea to a San Francisco consortium that became known as the Central Pacifics Big FourMark Hopkins Collis Huntington Charles Crocker and Leland Stanford names that continue to echo in both the streets and institutions of presentday CaliforniaThe railroad project transformed the Big Fours personal assets of  in  into a fortune of  million The line which linked up with the Union Pacific at Promontory Utah in  was built under the most hazardous conditions using poorly paid Chinese laborers who sometimes worked suspended in wicker baskets over sheer cliffs to hack a tenuous cutting through the steep passes of the SierrasThe Great EarthquakeThe more devout Californians were convinced God was punishing San Francisco for its gold lust and sinfulness when an earthquake registering  on the Richter Scale struck the city at am on  April  The initial quake wiped out about  buildings but the great fire that followed destroyed most of the city With the water mains shattered the City Fire Department could do nothing to stop the fire from spreading out of controlThe earthquake and fire together caused  deaths according to official estimates but the imposition of martial law by Mayor Schmitz without authorization resulted in up to  more dead in summary executions for looting or refusing to help the firefighters The performance of the military was less than exemplaryas Chinatown burned it was looted by the National Guardsmen sent to protect itReform Progress and OilThe San Francisco earthquake helped to focus the nations attention on the graft and corruption that ran right through the heart of California society The federal prosecution succeeded in jailing only a handful of the principals involved but the publicity was enough to make the concept of reform a popular oneThe reform movement intent on breaking the political power of the big corporations attacked corrupt practices in administration public finances and banking but did nothing to oppose the businessmens traditional resistance to unions and more liberal labor laws There was also a campaign of official discrimination against Chinese and Japanese immigrants excluding them from owning land and preventing further immigrationAll kinds of produce grew large and lush in Californias fertile irrigated soil but the most financially profitable thing to come out of the Californian earth was oil Drilling had begun in the s but didnt take off until  By the s the derricks of the Standard Union and Shell oil companies had sprouted all over the Los Angeles basin In that one decade the states oil revenues were  billion  million more than all the gold the Sierras yielded in a centurySunny oilrich Los Angeles was therefore the perfect place for the car to emerge as an everyday household accessory From  to  LAs population more than doubled and the number of private cars increased fivefold Noting the central position of the pursuit of happiness in Americas Declaration of Independence the Los Angeles Times asked in  How can one pursue happiness by any swifter and surer means than by the use of the automobileHollywoodIf you didnt feel like pursuing happiness in a car you could sit in the dark and dream about it in the cinema instead The booming popularity of this new entertainment form meant that the film production companies based originally in the East had to find a place where they could shoot outdoors for  weeks a year They finally settled in a suburb of Los Angeles Hollywood where there was guaranteed sunshine all the year round pluswithin easy reach of the new studiosdeserts and mountains as well as beaches rivers forests and islands which could double for the Wild West the Holy Land the Mediterraneanwherever Hollywood soon became a mecca for dreamers Somewhat dubious talent schools sprang up catering to smalltown girls who hoped to emulate film stars such as Mary Pickford If they didnt make it as actresses the schools turned them into call girls for the producers and in  the lurid rape trial of comic Fatty Arbuckle highlighted Hollywoods decadent lifestyle of fast cars bootleg whisky and drugs The immediate reaction was the imposition of the Hays Office code of morals which decreed that in all Hollywood films sin must be punishedit could be shown in detail but it must always be punishedThe industry cashed in on the boom years of the s Hollywood Boulevard introduced lavishly exotic Chinese and Egyptianstyle movie palaces and film stars built homes to match in Beverly Hills the most famous being the Pickfair mansion a hunting lodge which Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford turned into a honeymoon estate However in spite of the glamour Hollywoods rather seedy image persisted Boarding houses in Los Angeles sometimes advertised Rooms for rentno dogs or actors allowedDepression and BoomThe Great Depression hit California hard Income from agriculture dropped by  percent between  and  and onefifth of the states population was on public relief California managed to weather the downturn better than the rest of the country however and became a magnet for dispossessed refugees from the Dustbowl of the Midwest Okies as they were known packed their families and belongings into rickety cars and trucks to make the epic voyage west to find work in the farms and orchards of California Their tale of hardship pride bitterness and exploitation is graphically recorded in the Pulitzer Prizewinning novel The Grapes of Wrath by California writer John SteinbeckThen came World War II bringing with it an enormous boom for the states beleaguered economy with the United States federal government spending  billion in California Overnight ships and planes became the states most important products Manufacturers such as Douglas Lockheed and Northrop were all located in the Los Angeles areaIn the postwar period California continued to prosper Agriculture grew up into agribusiness the film industry expanded into the new field of television the aircraft industry was boosted by the space program and semiconductor technology paved the way for Silicon ValleyBeatniks Hippies and Modern TimesTrue to the tradition of Californias indulgence of utopian dreams the Beat generation of the s made its home in San Franciscos North Beach district Writers such as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg as well as the poets that hung round Lawrence Ferlinghettis City Lights Bookstore advocated a free and unstructured style of writing exemplified by Jack Kerouacs cult novel On the RoadTen years on the term hippies was coined for the flower children who gathered around the HaightAshbury district of San Francisco These inhabitants of what Joan Didion was to call Americas first teenage slum dispensed a vision of love peace and light heavily laced with marijuana and more dangerous drugs such as LSD The sixties also produced a distinctive brand of rock music with bands such as the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane and the legendary voice of Janis JoplinCalifornia was also in the forefront of student radicalism beginning with the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley in  and ending with the violent clashes at San Francisco State University in  and the  Berkeley demonstration in favor of a Peoples Park when protesters were sprayed with tear gasBlack radicalism accelerated after the Watts riots in Los Angeles in  and reached its peak with the Black Panthers in Oakland a paramilitary organization led by Huey Newton Eldridge Cleaver and Bobby Seale The Watts riots were sinisterly echoed in the Los Angeles riots of

revolution has always had a prominent place in California life Pressures for some kind of change have been alternately encouraged and resisted as the states volatile political establishment has swung
