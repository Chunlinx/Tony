                                 Paste Test            There are two considerationsto keep in mind when buying a toothpaste clinical effectiveness and aestheticappeal On the former I talked to dentists on both sides of the Atlantic Onthe latter I and a team of researchers my friends mostly sampled more than different toothpastes First the clinical categories                           Fluoride Clinicaleffectiveness basically means Does it have fluoride If it does itseffectivefluoride strengthens tooth enamel Some toothpastes boast thanothers but the difference is negligible Most dentists agree that if its gotfluoride and its approved by the American Dental Association you cant gowrong with it How regularly and how attentively you brush matters far morethan what you brush with But while its true that any fluoride toothpaste willdo a fine job certain clinical distinctions may help you choose your weaponSome toothpaste claims are bogus but others are for real                           Tartarcontrol For real Tartar control toothpastes Crest Tartar ControlColgate Tartar Control With MicroCleaning Crystals feature an ingredientcalled tetrasodium pyrophosphate This sponges up minerals in your saliva thatwould otherwise collect on your teeth and form tartar hardened plaque Tartarcontrol toothpastes cant remove tartar but they can stave it off                           Toothpastes for sensitive teeth Forrealsort of Toothpastes for sensitive teeth Sensodyne Crest SensitivityProtection use potassium nitrate to block nerves connected to your teeth Thisworks for people with receded gums But if your sensitivity stems instead fromcavities habitual tooth grinding or a root canal problem as it does for mostpeople sorrythese products wont do a thing for you                           Bakingsoda Bogus Baking soda Aquafresh Baking Soda Colgate Baking Soda Peroxide is a popular toothpaste ingredient Baking soda does nothingwhatsoever for your teeth However its effervescence may leave your mouthfeeling fresh and clean If this encourages you to brush more often mazeltov                            Whitening Entirely bogus Whiteningtoothpastes Mentadent Advanced Whitening Colgate Platinum WhiteningRembrandt countless others remove surface stainsbut all toothpastes will dothis even the nonwhitening kinds No toothpaste can whiten your teethpermanently Dentists can apply peroxide solutions to bleach your teeth justas peroxide would bleach your hair but the peroxide would have to stay onyour teeth for several continuous hours before it made any difference Brushingwith whitening toothpastes does nothing no matter how many times you have atit Topol smokers toothpaste claims to remove stains caused by smokingAgain it is no more effective than any regular toothpaste would beit justcosts more Rembrandts whitening pastes can cost up to  per tubea horribleripoff                           Triclosan For realTriclosan is an antimicrobial solution currently available in a singletoothpaste Colgate Total One dentist I spoke with called Total the firstrevolutionary toothpaste in a long time Why Triclosan clings to your teetheven after you finish brushing and continues to kill bacteria the dentist saysyou may feel a residual slipperiness after you brush with Total Because italone contains triclosan Colgate Total is without question the most clinicallyeffective toothpaste on the market for now Other toothpastes will no doubtadd triclosan soon            Ofcourse as noted above any fluoride toothpaste will do an adequate job Forthis reason you may wish to buy CVS brand tartar control toothpaste or asimilar generic brand which is fluoridated has tartar control and is everybit as effective as every other toothpaste save Colgate Total yet costssignificantly less than its flashier competitors Or you may wish to ignore allthe above advice and choose among the flashier competitors for aestheticreasons which are laid out below                           Consistency This is determined foremostby whether the toothpaste is a gel or a paste Gels use silica as anabrasive to help polish teeth Pastes use calcium carbonate to the same endSimply a matter of preference for the brusher For some reason nearly everykids toothpaste Colgate Barney OralB Rugrats is a viscous gelespeciallyperplexing since thick gels are ineradicable when smeared across a sink topConsistency has a direct impact on                            Ease ofsqueeze Some brands offer smooth even flow from the tube others do notCrest is the standard here while Colgate products tend toward runniness Theoutlier Rembrandt Age Defying Adult Formula Toothpaste dont ask about theAge Defying part This product was so thick that it refused to come out ofits tube even when squeezed with both hands at once My researchers quicklydubbed it the sword in the stone Only stomping on the tube with a shod footproduced any results and those meager One shudders to imagine an actual agedperson attempting to use this toothpaste                           Packaging The main choice here is screwtop or flip top Flip tops make more sense as you can open the tube andsqueeze it with one hand and youll never drop a tiny toothpaste cap behindyour toilet But one packaging design thinks outofthetube entirelyMentadents standup pump Mentadent Advanced Whitening Mentadent CrystalIce The Mentadent pump is just like the monolith from   if themonolith were white instead of black and emitted a fluoride toothpaste insteadof consciousnessaltering rays When you press down on top of the pump twoseparate substances emerge from two separate and concealed tanks One tankholds paste the other gel and the two strands join on your brush in beautifulharmony The pump also offers superb ease of squeeze To be clear Mentadenttoothpastes are no better clinically than the CVS brandtheyre just coolerlooking                           Color Most brands opt for classic titanium white

                  Taste After sampling more than different toothpastes my researchers and I came to some conclusions abouttaste A traditional minty zing is good But it must have a real bite so yourmouth feels clean Compare Rembrandt Natural and Rembrandt With Baking SodaThe baking soda paste is not overpowering but it bites just enough to let youknow its there The natural paste meanwhile lacks all bite and your mouthfeels dirtier after youve brushed The foaming action of baking soda in thiscase makes all the difference A severely biteless paste such as ColgatePlatinum Whitening Mild Mint can be retchtriggering Some furtherobservations            Generally natural pastesToms of Maine Natural Toothpaste taste awful first because they lack bitebut also because they use natural flavoring ingredients such as papayaRembrandt Natural You may think you want to brush your teeth with papayabut you dont Rembrandt Age Defying when finally coaxed from its tube tastedlike rancid cinnamon and smelled of BenGaya miserable paste by any measureAquafresh Whitening Striped Gel is zesty and cleanfeeling with good ease ofsqueeze and little aftertastea solid entry Cool Mint Listerine TartarControl Gel is a minty and pleasant concoction unlike the mouthwash CrestGumCare tastes repulsively buttery at first then slightly biliousitslingering aftertaste makes your teeth feel chapped Finally kids toothpastesall taste like bubble gum Again you may think you want to brush your teethwith bubble gum but unless youre under  you dont            Our clinical championColgate Total got mixed reviews on taste It could have used more bite and ittasted a bit medicinal The clear winner on aesthetics in general MentadentCrystal Ice Researchers likened it to brushing with Altoids and claimed itcleared out nasal passages The baking soda in Crystal Ice made my mouth foamlike a rabid animals leaving my teeth feeling reborn Couple this with thepump technology and the combination of
