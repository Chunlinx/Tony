the response and Prudie is trying to keep a straight face asshe writes There is no label etiquette because  well labels are beneathsocial acceptability Stationery  however can be Mr and Mrs And toquote the Tiffany lady It usually stops fights if the womans name isfirst            As for your ownsituation the Michael and Katherine dilemma why dont you have two sets oflabels printed They are inexpensive after all and that way you can eachaffix what you consider the right label to a letter            Prudie compromisingly                                             HeyPrudie

How are youmy retort to which is usually Do you have half anhour                                       How am I Wellperhaps you wish to hear about my problems but I dont think so I find suchlinguistic tics simply sloppy semantics                                       Careful in Washington carefully                        Dear Care            Prudie is grateful for your linguistic supportthough on the question of what is required by the question How are you sheis more forgiving Perhaps because her mother taught her years ago that Howare you is a greeting not a question            To respect yourfeelings however Prudie would not mind if the next time you are asked theirritating query you begin a recital of exactly how you areno detailsspared And do let us all know how many seconds elapse before yourconversational companion makes a getaway            Prudie tellingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have had it withpeople talking into their fists and mumbling up their sleeves All these callson the hoof cant be that important Plus they interrupt innocent bystandersIs there an accepted etiquette for the mobile phone people and anything therest of us can do about them                                       AntiCell Phone Annie                        Dear Ant            Alas there is no etiquette per se regarding cellphones though some highend restaurants have tagged them verboten Prudie is noticing that concert halls and theaters now have printedannouncements requiring their restriction as well Little by little variousestablishments are making house rules            As for what the rest ofus might do about them Prudie is afraid the answer is not much A cross lookof disapproval is always worth a try The best hope of integrating thistechnological advance into society is to hope that those so important theycannot be out of telephonic touch will themselves arrive at some feeling ofmobilesse oblige Prudie is somewhat hopeful on this score having recentlyseen some cell phonies remove themselves to the sidelines as it were at thering of the bell She has even seen an apologetic smile or two as these peopleget the call We will hope for the best            Prudie wishfully
