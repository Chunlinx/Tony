          are you ready to start okay   yes have you recently bought a new car Catherine     well i just found out that my car was thirty months old and it doesnt seem like its that old seems like i just bought it   oh oh wow   its an eighty nine and i bought it uh in uh eighty eight so yeah   well i really i the last car we got was a was a used car i really dont prefer buying a new car i like to let somebody else pay for that   i know i really will do that the next time i buy it too   but uh mine was a year old and we bought it for very functional purposes and that was we bought a station wagon we wanted an economical car   umhum umhum umhum   to operate but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment so we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon and ive never been sorry however the need for that   umhum oh thats wonderful umhum   kind of car has changed now   oh okay   and uh while it is still good and its quite serviceable and ill drive it until it no longer is reliable and probably then some  i spend a lot of time praying over it before i give it up   um um   sure   i think that i would like to if i you know we all say if i could have the car i always wanted   right   i would either buy a Nissan Maxima uh im sold on Nissans i or or or foreign cars actually uh   uhhuh but you feel though uh craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities     uh   is that how you i have never   its reliability its reliability   its   and uh i you know ive read all the Consumer Reports and things and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars if Ford was a head and the shoulders above it id buy a Ford   isnt that a shame   but i had uh had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it   my word isnt that sorry thats sorry   uh you know i mean it was ready for the graveyard and i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car   my word oh mercy   so and that was just trying to hold us getting out of that was a used car and it was an older car but you know Escort is supposed to have a great track record   youd um um hm hum   as far as sales   umhum   but its just it just was not  and you get stung a time or two and you say no thanks so i just trusted the Consumer Reports and the auto   sure no thanks thats right umhum umhum   uh reports instead had my son who knows a lot about that study them thoroughly and he gave me four choices of cars to buy an Escort definitely was not among them in fact there wasnt an American car in there   uhhuh wow   uh the Nissan came and and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the Consumer Reports said we should get   umhum   but it served our needs uh later on his reports the reports that he studied showed that uh Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the area in the class that we were looking for and that and id rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac i really would its not necessarily prestige but its comfort uh theres a lot of features on there that are desirable if youre going to pay that kind of money for a car uh   uhhuh who makes that car   Nissan Maxima   i mean but where are they where are they what what is their location is it uh Asian or is it European or who   no no no Nissan Japanese   oh it is Japanese okay i didnt know   umhum umhum umhum yeah and if i couldnt have my luxury Maxima   uhhuh   then id buy me a fancy little red CRX sports car   okay           i mean you know every other every one of us have two sides   yeah i guess so thats true yeah   yeah now what about you if you could have the car that you wanted what would you get and why   if if if i had the car i wanted gee probably um   uhhum   uh lets see i like the looks of the Lincoln Town Car but i i dont know the performance of it thats a Ford product and you know i would get hung up by my boot straps if i ever if i ever mentioned the Ford product in my family   uhhuh uhhuh yeah see there uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh umhum       ill tell you thats sad too because at one time Ford was the best that was made   yeah yeah   really was   umhum   and uh i i really have not seen now a lot of the American cars actually are are parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa   can i put you on hold for one minute thank you   of course     well that was one minute they hung up   okay huh uh       uh at any rate do you have color preferences or what would be the features that youd be looking for   um well the comfort of a large car the the security of a large car   umhum   uh and the luxuries of a large car   umhum   uh now color preferences i think i would opt to go with a bronze   uhhuh uhhuh   which is probably closest to gold that you can get   yeah oh wow we like the stuff that glitters             good theres nothing wrong with that actually i think probably if i were going to get uh if i were going to be practical which doesnt mean i would be i would prefer white   right well practically yes thats uhhuh   because simply because its more visible at night   right and its cooler i believe too when youre driving in   and uhhuh umhum now the interior okay i dont care about the interior just as long as its not black or red   uhhuh uhhuh     but if i had the little read CRX i guess the interior would have to be black leather and id have to live with that and if i got the CRX it would have to have a real good sound system in it because id want that too       ah   id just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind   um can you uh hang on again   umhum   thanks   ive got the phones for lunch hour   umhum   so       just dont mind me if i bounce back and forth   thats okay   um so you like to listen to uh a lot of music or do is it talk shows   no no no i generally would prefer uh prefer to listen to uh well i listen to KCBI a lot but i will listen to the news and the and the traffic and those things at work   uhhuh umhum   but if im going to be traveling in that car for any period of time i want some real good classical music i love classical music and you just cant enjoy it unless youve got a good sound system to produce all the   umhum umhum all the yeah umhum   all the characteristics of the instruments   umhum thats true   so i do love classical music or at least or or uh contemporary classical   do you listen to do you like listen to WRR   uhhuh sure do WRR and the Oasis are the two that i listen to more than anything else and i do like them and   uh yeah umhum umhum   id like to have a compact disk player in a car that would be something that i would really like those compact disks really are good for cars because they dont melt they dont warp you know theres nothing in there that can wrap around the the uh   those are nice arent they yes those are nice umhum umhum   rollers or anything it seems seems like a really good answer to portable music that you can choose
