                                 The Dems Debate Race            The questions at tonights Black and Brown Forum in Des Moines were the bestat any of the presidential debates so far I especially liked NBC correspondentSoledad OBriens one about why refugees from Cuba are allowed to stay in theUnited States while refugees from Haiti or China are not OBrienscomoderator Tavis Smiley of Black Entertainment Television came up with anequally shrewd question about whether the priority of lilywhite Iowa and NewHampshire in the presidential primaries is unfair to minorities Yet anothersharp question came from one of the panelists Erik Parker of the musicmagazine The Source  who asked whether it was right to deprive convictedfelons of the right to vote            What was especially impressive about these questions is that they wereunexpected without being obscure trivial or overly clever Each wassubstantive framing a significant problem in a surprising and fresh way Andeach was designed to make the candidates squirm but without being merely atrick or a trap            In each case the answers were revealing Gore stumbled over OBriensimmigration question by trying to argue that refugees from Communist countriesshould be treated differently OBrien rightly pointed out that this answerdidnt account for China Smileys question on the primaries provoked bothcandidates into utterly unconvincing defenses of Iowa and New Hampshiresfirstinthenation status And the question about voting rights for felonscaused Bradley to say hed reconsider whether nonviolent convicted felonsdeserved the right to vote One could reasonably defend this position Theproblem is that Bradley never did so before being asked about ittonightBradleys answer was an attempted constituencypleaser on par withGores gays in the military answer from two debates ago The difference is thatwhere gays ought to have appreciated Gores effort Im not sure blacks supportthe idea of criminals voting any more than whites do            Like Bradley Gore sometimes crossed the line from deeply felt concern intopandering In his answer to the voting felons question Gore implied that thedisproportionately high incarceration rate for AfricanAmericans wasprincipally the result of bias which is preposterous But Goressolicitousness expressed itself less in his specific answers than in hisslightly excessive effort to bond with the audience When he said that theClinton administration not only talked the talk but also walked the walk oncivil rights Gore actually drew boos from the Bradleyfriendly crowd for hissomewhat hokeysounding appropriation of street language            Gore was also clumsy in the way he constantly invoked his close friend andpartner Bill Clinton For months Gore has been speaking to largely whiteaudiences and barely mentioning the Presidents name Tonight in front of anaudience composed of minorities and whites sympathetic to minority concernsthe Vicepresident bragged extensively about the record of an outfit he seldommentions the ClintonGore administration When Bradley zinged Gore byproposing that the Vicepresident walk down the corridor to the Oval Office andtell Clinton to sign an executive order banning racial profiling Gore shotright back in defense of his boss I dont think President Bill Clinton needsa lecture from Bill Bradley about how to stand up and fight forAfricanAmericans and Latinos This was an excellent rejoinder but Gore willget himself into trouble very soon if he doesnt figure out a single attitudetoward Clinton and stick with it            More persuasive was Gores emulation of the presidents style which afterabout a thousand tries finally came off in one portion of the debate When adoctor by the name of Paula Mahone asked both candidates about theunderrepresentation of blacks in medical schools Bradley responded with aroutine defense of affirmative action But Gore who was either better preparedor better cluedin recognized the questioner as the doctor who delivered theMcCaughy Septuplets            Dr Mahone I recognize you Gore said And when you performed thatmedical miracle you made not only Iowa proud but the entire nation proud AndI think it is fair to say that there were countless young AfricanAmericangirls and boys and boys and girls of all backgrounds who saw you on thenational television screens at the very top of your profession demonstrating toone and all that theres nothing you dont know how to do in the field ofmedicine And they thought to themselves You know I can do that            As Gore heaped praise on Dr Mahone he seemed truly moved and the audienceseemed moved with him For one brief moment you even might have thought youwere listening to Bill Clinton
