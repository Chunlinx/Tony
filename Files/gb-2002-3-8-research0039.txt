                    Background        The structure and dynamics of chromatin clearly        differentiate the eukaryotes from the other superkingdoms        of life    Eukaryotic chromatin undergoes a variety        of structural and compositional changes that accompany the        progression of the cell cycle and changes in gene        expression   These dynamics are regulated both by a        variety of proteinprotein and proteinDNA interactions and        by catalytic modification and reorganization of proteins        and nucleic acids that comprise the chromosomes   In        recent years it has become clear that covalent modification        of histones transcription factors and other chromosomal        proteins plays a major part in the dynamics of chromatin        The covalent modifications include hydroxylation of proline        and lysine methylation of lysine and arginine        phosphorylation of serine and threonine and acetylation        and ubiquitination of lysine Other enzymes such as        deacetylases and phosphatases remove covalent        modifications from proteins and thus reverse their effects            The covalent modifications may change the local        or global charge properties of chromosomal proteins and        regulate their interactions with DNA Additionally the        modifications also seem to form a code that is recognized        by specific groups of regulatory proteins            Besides covalent modifications ATPdependent enzymes such        as the SwiSnf ATPases and other chaperonelike proteins        remodel the chromatin by rearranging the binding pattern of        histones and other chromosomal proteins             These covalent and noncovalent catalytic actions on the        chromatin can result in condensation or decondensation of        chromatin either locally or on the chromosomal scale and        thereby regulate access of transcription factors and other        proteins to the chromatin        Many of these chromatinmodifying activities are        organized into large multisubunit complexes with the core        enzyme accompanied by several noncatalytic subunits          The subunits of these complexes are characterized by a        number of conserved domains that interact with other        proteins or DNA Most of these domains are evolutionarily        mobile modules and combine with each other in a very wide        range of domain architectures   Well studied examples        of these are the bromodomain that interacts with acetylated        peptides     chromodomains that mediate specific        interactions with proteins    and RNA    the        PHD finger mediating proteinprotein interactions          the Myb and SANT domains   that interact with both DNA        and proteins   and the SAP and AThook domains that        interact with DNA    These domains often occur        together in large proteins linked to catalytic domains and        may serve to tether these proteins to different components        of chromatin and deliver catalytic activities to specific        locations        The computational analysis of chromatin proteins has        helped in the identification of a large number of conserved        modules in the chromosomal proteins   These studies        followed by biochemical and structural characterization of        these modules has thrown considerable light on the biology        of chromatin dynamics and the roles these domains have        played in course of evolution      Using        computational analysis we have discovered a previously        uncharacterized domain in multiple chromatin proteins We        also show that this domain is found linked to catalytic        domains such as oxidoreductase and Jun activating binding        protein  JAB domains and these proteins may define a        novel class of chromatinmodifying enzymes                    Results and discussion                  Identification of the SWIRM domain          In the course of our systematic survey of eukaryotic          chromosomal proteins we observed a conserved globular          module shared by the SWIp and RSCp proteins from the          yeast           Saccharomyces cerevisiae that did          not map to any previously characterized domain These          homologous proteins are parts of the multisubunit SWISNF          and RSC complexes that drive chromatin remodeling through          the SNFSWIlike ATPase subunit     The          region of similarity encompassing this segment has been          termed conserved region  in   Both these proteins          additionally contain a Mybrelated helixturnhelix          domain termed the SANT domain   at their carboxyl          terminus and a further carboxyterminal conserved          helical extension restricted to orthologs of RSCp and          SWIp Given that these subunits are key components of          the respective chromatinremodeling complexes and          mediate multiple interactions we sought to further          investigate the provenance of their conserved          aminoterminal module using computational methods A          PSIBLAST search   initiated with this region from          RSCp gi  region  not only recovered          its paralogs and orthologs from other organisms such as          Moira from           Drosophila   and BAF and          BAF from vertebrates   but also several other          uncharacterized proteins from diverse eukaryotes with          statistically significant expected values            e values at the point of          detection For example the search recovered the nuclear          protein SPACE from           Schizosaccharomyces pombe   in          iteration             e      the human proteins          KIAA            e    and KIAA                        e    in iteration  and the           Arabidopsis thaliana protein          Atg in iteration             e    We prepared a multiple          alignment of these regions from all the proteins detected          in these searches Figure  and used it to construct a          PSIBLAST positionspecific score matrix PSSM   and          a hidden Markov model   for further searches against          the complete or nearly complete proteome databases of          individual eukaryotes These searches allowed us to          detect additional copies of this region in the carboxyl          termini of the Asynaptic  protein a Hopp homolog from          plants   Additionally these searches also recovered          a conserved globular region in the extreme carboxyl          terminus of the ADAlike proteins from eukaryotes            with moderate significance While these newly detected          proteins have a somewhat distinct conservation pattern          from the originally detected set Figure  their          secondary structure predicted using the JPred program            closely matches that predicted for the originally          detected set This observation together with the          information that the ADAlike proteins are chromatinic          proteins just like the members of the original set          suggests that these domains are probably distant          relatives of each other Figure           The conserved region described above occurred in          various distinct domainarchitecture contexts suggesting          that it is an evolutionarily mobile domain Figure  We          named this domain the SWIRM domain after the proteins          SWIp Rscp and Moira in which it was first recognized          Secondarystructure predictions based on the multiple          alignment indicate the presence of four distinct a          helices Hence it is predicted that the SWIRM domain is          likely to form a globular structure in the form of a          tetrahelical bundle Figure  However a direct          comparison showed no specific relationship between the          sequence conservation pattern of the SWIRM domain and          those of other helical bundles that are commonly          encountered in chromosomal proteins such as the          bromodomain   the Myb or SANT domains and other          helical DNAbinding domains   The differences in          conservation pattern between the distantly related ADAp          carboxyterminal domains and the canonical SWIRM domains          suggest that the former are likely to interact with a          very distinct set of partners                          Functional implications and domain architectures of          the SWIRM domains          Rscp Swhp has been shown to mediate multiple          interactions in the RSC complex it undergoes          dimerization via the carboxyterminal coiledcoil          segment associates with the SWISNF ATPase Sthp by          forming two distinct contacts and it forms a complex          with RSCp subunit Deletion analyses have shown that the          region of the protein that includes the SWIRM domain is          probably required for at least one of the contacts with          Sthp and perhaps even those with Rscp    This          suggests that the SWIRM domain is most likely to mediate          proteinprotein interactions The Rscp and          SWIprelated proteins have fairly complex architectures          implying that the different modules may mediate distinct          interactions Rscp has an additional ZZ domain            between the SWIRM and Myb domains whereas the animal and                    Dictyostelium versions like Moira          have an additional aminoterminal chromodomain Figure           However the common denominator in all these proteins          are the SWIRM and Myb domains suggesting that they          mediate the evolutionarily conserved interactions of          these proteins such as those with the SwiSnf ATPase          The presence of a divergent SWIRM domain linked to a          HORMA domain in Asy the plant ortholog of the yeast          Hopp   is consistent with the role of these          proteins in mediating proteinprotein interactions in the          process of chromosome synapsis   The ADAplike          proteins   Figure  are chromatinassociated          proteins and are known to mediate proteinprotein          interactions   They contain a distinct          carboxyterminal globular domain that is distantly          related to the SWIRM domain suggesting that this domain          could mediate a subset of their interactions with the          transcriptional machinery          A striking group of proteins with the SWIRM domain is          the one typified by SPACE and SPBCc from           S pombe Between one and four          orthologs of this protein are encoded by different          crowngroup eukaryotes Figures   and contain the          SWIRM domain linked to a predicted FADdependent          oxidoreductase domain   A similar observation          regarding the presence of a FADbinding domain has been          reported for KIAA a vertebrate protein of this          family    KIAA along with the corepressor          CoREST is stably associated with the histone deacetylase          complex Furthermore SPACE has been shown to be a          nuclear protein   and along with its paralog          SPBCc contains at its extreme carboxyl terminus an          HMG domain which is a common DNAbinding module found          in diverse chromosomal proteins   Figures   The          closest relatives of the predicted oxidoreductase domains          linked to the SWIRM domain are the polyamine oxidases and          the monoamine oxidases Figure  These enzymes are          involved in the oxidation of amino groups of polyamines          such as spermine and spermidine and monoamines such as          dopamine and serotonin   The availability of the          crystal structure for the polyamine oxidase from maize          allowed us to evaluate the sequence conservation of the          oxidoreductase domain fused to the SWIRM domains             The alignment of this domain from the          SPACElike proteins spans the entire length of the          amino oxidase and contains the hallmark residues required          to bind the FAD cofactor Figure  These include the          glycinerich loop bounded by a strand and an a helix          that is typical of Rossmann fold nucleotidebinding          proteins a conserved glutamate specific to the amino          oxidase family that interacts with ribose in FAD and          other residues of the substrate and cofactorbinding          site Thus these oxidoreductase domains are likely to          function as amino oxidases this together with their          linkage within the same polypeptide to domains typical of          chromatin proteins and evidence for nuclear          localization suggests that they are novel          chromatinmodifying enzymes Consistent with this the          complex containing KIAA has been shown to contain FAD          and was suggested to be a chromatinmodifying enzyme            Building on these observations we suggest two          functional possibilities for these proteins first they          could act as novel proteinmodifying enzymes that oxidize          the amino groups of lysines or arginines present on          histones or transcription factors alternatively they          could affect chromatin structure by oxidizing basic          polyamines present in the chromatin and thereby reducing          the charge balance          It is also conceivable that the FAD cofactor of these          enzymes functions analogously to NAD in a deacetylation          reaction of acetyllysines similar to that carried out by          Sir enzymes   Whereas both these enzymes are          derived versions of the Rossmann fold and bind a          dinucleotide cofactor the SWIRM amino oxidase proteins          do not possess equivalents of the unique inserts with          residues that allow the SIRlike proteins to catalyze          the deacetylation reaction On the contrary the          conserved residues in the SWIRM amino oxidases are the          same as other amino oxidases suggesting that they share          similar catalytic activities as proposed above          The combination with the SWIRM domain which is          predicted to be a proteinprotein interaction module          suggests that these enzymes may be part of a larger          complex like other chromatinmodifying enzymes Whereas          in vertebrates KIAA has been shown to interact with          the histonedeacetylasecontaining complexes             the presence of multiple proteins in this family could          point to the formation of other distinct complexes          Interestingly the SWIRM aminooxidasetype proteins are          absent in           S cerevisiae but present in           S pombe and other crowngroup          eukaryotes Hence it is likely to have been present in          the ancestral crowngroup eukaryote and secondarily lost          in           S cerevisiae We have shown          previously that several functionally linked genes          encoding proteins involved in chromatinstructure          dynamics which are conserved in           S pombe and other crowngroup          eukaryotes have been lost as a group in           S cerevisiae   This implies          that the SWIRM aminooxidasetype proteins may be          functionally linked to these other genes that were          coeliminated along with it in           S cerevisiae These include genes          for proteins such as the SET domain methyltransferase          Clrp the chromodomain protein Swip the PHD finger          protein Mlop the chromosomal actinlike protein          SPACD and the predicted prolylhydroxylase with the          doublestranded helix domain SPACc   Some of          these proteins may be part of a multiprotein          chromatinmodifying catalytic complex of which the SWIRM          amino oxidase proteins are a part          In vertebrates the SWIRM domain is found fused along          with a Myb SANT domain to a JABPAD domain             for example in the human protein KIAA Figure           This latter domain is commonly associated with several          proteasomal and signalosomal proteins and is involved in          ubiquitinmediated protein degradation   In this          case the SWIRM domain may serve to recruit proteasomal          complexes to specific chromatin proteins to effect their          degradation                            Conclusions        We define a conserved domain of about  residues        predicted to participate in proteinprotein interactions        in different eukaryotic chromatin proteins such as Swip        and Rscp Homologs of these molecules with the SWIRM        domain are found in all eukaryotes belonging to the crown        group as well as earlierbranching protists such as the        apicomplexans A version of the SWIRM domain is found        linked to an aminooxidase domain in a class of nuclear        proteins that are represented in most crowngroup        eukaryotes These proteins are present in multiple copies        in plant proteomes and are entirely absent in the yeast         S cerevisiae We predict that these        proteins define a new class of chromatinmodifying enzymes        that are likely to oxidize the amino groups of histones or        other nuclear proteins Alternatively they may oxidize        polyamines in chromatin to alter the charge balance in the        chromatin In humans the SWIRM domain is found linked to a        JABPAD catalytic domain suggesting that this protein        may serve as a link in the regulation of chromatinic        proteins through proteasomal degradation                    Materials and methods        The nonredundant NR database of protein sequences        National Center for Biotechnology Information NIH        Bethesda was searched using the BLASTP program Profile        searches were carried out using the PSIBLAST program          with either a single sequence or an alignment used as the        query with a profile inclusion expectation          E  value threshold of  and were        iterated until convergence Previously known conserved        protein domains were detected using the corresponding        PSIBLASTderived PSSMs   The PSSMs were prepared by        choosing one or more starting queries seeds for a set of        most frequently encountered domains see   for details        and run against the NR database until convergence with the        C option of PSIBLAST to save the PSSM It was ensured        that at convergence no false positives were included in the        profiles This profile database can be downloaded from          or used on the Internet via the RPSBLAST program          All globular segments of proteins that did not map to        domains with previously constructed PSSMs were searched        individually using PSIBLAST to detect any additional        domains that may have been overlooked Hidden Markov        modelbased searches were run using the HMMER package                 Multiple alignments were constructed using the TCoffee        program   followed by manual correction based on the        PSIBLAST results Protein secondary structure was        predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for the        JPRED program
