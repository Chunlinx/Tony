                    Background        Nearly  billion people are at risk of developing        lymphatic filariasis and over  million are estimated to        have circulating microfilariae or one of the various        clinical conditions associated with filarial infection            With tools currently available lymphatic filariasis        in principle could be eliminated Combined drug treatment        regimens using annual treatment with microfilaricidal drugs        are the method of choice for combating filarial infection        and elimination programs using this strategy have commenced        in more than  countries            Demonstrating the success of filariasis programs depends        on careful monitoring of infection levels in human        populations as well as vectors following the introduction        of the drug intervention Due to reluctance on the part of        human populations to submit to regular blood examinations        assessment of infection in vectors offers advantages for        the monitoring of infection after a mass treatment program        has been implemented Two methods of detecting infection in        vector populations that are now being widely used are        dissection and PCR Dissection has been the gold standard        for measuring infection level in mosquitoes however        dissection becomes increasingly costly and laborious in        areas where mosquito infection prevalence drops below         Furthermore in preliminary studies PCR was more sensitive        for detecting filarial parasites in mosquitoes than        conventional dissection and microscopy     The ability        to adapt PCR techniques to detect microfilariae in pools of        mosquitoes suggests that current PCR methods should be        adequate for testing large numbers of mosquitoes in the        context of filariasis elimination programs PCR has already        been demonstrated to be a successful tool for monitoring        onchocerciasis programs      The availability of such        a tool permits rigorous surveillance for resumption of        transmission following completion of control        activities        This study was designed to monitor mosquito infection        levels in conjunction with a mass treatment program for        filariasis in the commune of Leogane Haiti The goal of        this program in Leogane was to develop an effective        elimination strategy that could be adapted to other        settings in Haiti and elsewhere The drug intervention        consisted of annual treatment with diethylcarbamazine DEC        and albendazole and was monitored by collecting data in         wellcharacterized sentinel sites We assessed filarial        infection rates of vectors trapped in the  sentinel sites        and compared PCR with dissection as monitoring tools                    Methods                  Study site          The study was conducted in the plains of the Commune          of Leogane located west of Port au Prince To monitor          the impact of the mass treatment program sentinel sites          were chosen based on estimated community antigen          prevalence inferred from rapid cardbased          immunochromatographic testing ICT of local school          children Amrad ICT New South Wales Australia          Microfilaria prevalence and intensity were assessed in          the sentinel sites prior to the intervention Mass          treatment using single dose diethylcarbamazine  mgkg          and albendazole  mg was carried out at the end of          October  Details of the drug distribution will be          reported elsewhere Research activities in the sentinel          sites were reviewed and approved by the CDC and Notre          Dame Institutional Review Boards and the Ethics          Committee of Hopital St Croix                          Mosquito Trapping          The main vector for           Wuchereria bancrofiti in Haiti is           Culex quinquefasciatus     Some          transmission occurs yearround The trapping of          mosquitoes was done using CDC gravid traps Model           JW Hock Co Gainesville FL  to  per sentinel          site Collections were done in each sentinel site for           consecutive nights every other week Mosquitoes were          collected from traps each morning within  minutes of          dawn After transport to the laboratory at Hopital St          Croix mosquitoes were knocked down by placing trap          containers in a C freezer for ten minutes or by          introduction of a triethylaminesoaked cotton pad and          subsequently separated by species and sex undesired          specimens were noted and discarded males and nonvector          species Female           Culex mosquitoes were divided           for assay by PCR or dissection for the first           mosquitoes caught at each trap the remainder was used          for PCR The samples to be used for PCR assay were          desiccated and sorted until shipment to CDC for          processing Because preliminary PCR experiments showed          inhibition to be an occasional problem when pool sizes of           or greater were used mosquitoes to be desiccated were          sorted into batches of no more than  mosquitoes and          then placed atop a cotton plug which was above  inch          of drierite desiccant in a polypropylene screw cap tube          This ensured desiccation and reduced any concerns about          fungal contamination during storage and transport                          Mosquito Dissection          Mosquitoes were dissected on a glass slide using a set          of dissection needles to separate the head thorax and          abdomen A saline solution was dropped onto each segment          These three body segments were then teased apart and          examined stereoscopically to reveal larval stage worms or          microfilaria Mosquito infection status was noted as well          as the corresponding location of the parasites Ten          percent of dissected mosquitoes harboring  rdstage          larvae were microscopically examined at  to verify          filarial species A maximum of  mosquitoes were          dissected per trap per day Dissection results were          entered into an EpiInfo database Infective mosquitoes          were defined as those

the sentinel sites Table         Median microfilaria level ranged from  to  microfilaria        per  l for microfilariapositive persons Microfilaria        intensity did not differ significantly by sentinel site        Table  Mass treatment with DECalbendazole took place        at the end of October  and tablets were taken by  of        the at risk population     By  months following        treatment microfilaria prevalence declined to           and  in Barrier Jeudi MassonMathieu Mapou and        Leogane respectively        To monitor the impact of mass treatment on filarial        infection level in mosquitoes trapping was initiated in        August of   months prior to mass treatment Because        the number of mosquitoes trapped and percentage of infected        mosquitoes varied from month to month results were pooled        into month intervals for analysis As seen in Figure         total mosquito infection levels as detected by dissection        declined from pretreatment to the first posttreatment        interval in all  sites however these decreases were        statistically significant in only  of the sites Leogane        and Barrier Jeudi With the exception of Mapou larval        infection rates were lower in the second than in the first        month time interval following treatment The numbers of        L larvae recovered declined significantly in only one of        the  sentinel sites Figure  Table  If we adopt a        more conservative definition of what constitutes an        infective mosquito and restrict our analysis to those with        L found in the head no change over time was observed In        fact only  out of  mosquitoes dissected had L in        the head Table                 W bancrofti infection of         Culex mosquitoes was also assessed by        PCR for a total of  pools median pool size          collected over the study period Because pool sizes ranged        from  to  we used Poolscreen  to generate point        estimates and confidence intervals for the level of        filarial infection in mosquitoes As seen in Table  point        estimates of         W bancrofti infection prevalence        declined following mass treatment in all sentinel sites        Because of the relatively wide confidence intervals        significant declines in infection prevalence were observed        in only Barrier Jeudi and Leogane for both time periods        following treatment mirroring the results obtained with        dissection        We also compared changes in infection prevalence for        mosquito pools of constant size n   collected in the        Leogane sentinel site The other three sentinel sites did        not have enough pools of this size to conduct this analysis        Table  Infection prevalence in Leogane decreased from         pretreatment to  in the first three months        following treatment and to  in the second time period        Figure  These numbers agree closely with those        generated when all pools were included in the analysis        There was a moderately strong correlation between larval        infection rates as determined by dissection and PCR Figure         r   p                      Discussion        Careful monitoring of filarial transmission is        necessary both to make programmatic decisions about        stopping mass treatment as well as to assist with        certification of elimination Serologic tools for        assessment of exposure to the parasite are still under        development and testing Assessing infection in humans can        be considered a lagging indicator because the prepatent        period may extend for months after infection In contrast        entomologic measures of filarial infection of vectors        provide realtime estimates of filarial transmission We        compared dissection and PCR to determine their utility as        monitoring tools for filariasis elimination programs        For monitoring mosquito infection status within the        context of a filariasis elimination program mosquito        dissection has been the gold standard against which other        methods are compared Our dissection results show a marked        decrease in infection level from the pretreatment period        to the end of the posttreatment study period in  of the         sites that we monitored Figure  The exception was        Mapou which started and ended the study with almost the        same infection prevalence in the mosquito populations we        collected This can be attributed to the smaller than        desired sample of mosquitoes captured  pretreatment        and  during the second posttreatment time interval and        the low infection prevalence that we observed there        Dissection and PCR assays of captured mosquitoes        generated similar but not identical results We observed a        positive correlation between larval infection rates        determined by these two methods Figure  The proportion        of positive pools detected by PCR was as expected higher        than that obtained by dissection even after using the        PoolScreen program to calculate a point estimate of        infection prevalence This can be accounted for by the        increased sensitivity that is provided by the PCR assay        especially for detection of early larval stages that are        more difficult to detect by dissection Independent of the        method used mass treatment led to a reduction in levels of                W bancrofti in trapped mosquitoes as        assessed by dissection and PCR The reductions evident via        dissection were observed in all  sentinel sites studied        representing an overall decrease of  from the        pretreatment levels to the final study interval  months        posttreatment The decreases in filariainfected        mosquitoes were comparable to the decreases in microfilaria        prevalence seen in the human populations in the sentinel        sites        Although dissection is a very effective way to monitor        infection prevalence in vector populations it is a very        laborious method for monitoring infection prevalence that        requires highly trained technicians and can be cost        intensive Dissection is most suitable for monitoring        mosquito infection levels when the infection level in the        mosquito population is greater than  This will be true        in early stages of filariasis programs The decision to use        dissection rather than PCR may also be influenced by the        trapping method Household collections may yield        substantially higher rates of infected mosquitoes than the        gravid traps that were employed in our study When        infection prevalence declines below  the potential for        missing mosquitoes infected with the earliest larval stages        and for misidentifying the species of filarial larvae found        within mosquitoes increases Another concern pointed out by        Burkot and Ichimori    is that as infection level        declines increasing numbers of mosquitoes must be        dissected in order to demonstrate a significant decline in        infection prevalence This is especially true for infective        larvae In our study the numbers of mosquitoes carrying        infective larvae as detected by dissection were        insufficient to allow for an adequate statistical analysis        of changes in infection prevalence Monitoring transmission        levels based on levels of infective larvae may not be        feasible within the scope of lymphatic filariasis        elimination programs in settings like Leogane where         Culex is the vector because of the        relative rarity of identifying infective mosquitoes Lot        quality assurance methods may provide an alternative        sampling strategy that may prove useful for demonstrating        with the smallest possible number of mosquitoes that        filarial infection is below a preestablished threshold                   PCR assays of mosquitoes permit larger number of samples        to be evaluated for infection prevalence PCR is both        specific and highly sensitive for the detection of parasite        DNA The primary limitations are the cost and the need for        a wellequipped lab In addition PCR methods are also        limited by a lack of robust statistical methods to compare        and analyze data obtained from unequal pool sizes Although        confidence intervals of infection before and after        treatment were overlapping for  of the sentinel sites it        is important to point out that confidence intervals were        not overlapping for the two locations where dissection data        indicated significant declines in larval prevalence        We used a competitive PCR system in order to control for        the presence of inhibitors that could prevent amplification        and detection of parasite DNA The disadvantage of the        competitive PCR is the need to use an ELISA assay to        quantify the product and the competitor adding to the cost        of the assay Work underway is focused on trying to develop        a standardized PCR methodology for all filariasis programs        to employ     Simple standardized methods would permit        comparisons of infection levels across epidemiologic        settings as has been done with PCR assays for         O volvulus in black flies for        Onchocerciasis control programs      PCR methods for        onchocerciasis work reliably for pools of up to  fly        heads an important advantage in terms of cost and        throughput As similar methods are validated for lymphatic        filariasis it is important to bear in mind that assay        sensitivity will decline as filarial infection prevalence        decreases independent of the method used to detect         W bancrofti  Consequently quality        control considerations will become more important as the        program progresses WHO should consider distribution of        controls to laboratories involved in PCR testing to permit        interlaboratory comparisons of results Periodic        proficiency testing represents an additional        possibility        A main concern of mass treatment programs is whether or        not the decreases in transmission will be sustainable over        time and will eliminate completely transmission of        microfilaria to mosquitoes Although infection levels were        decreased transmission of         W bancrofti was not interrupted by a        single cycle of mass treatment in our study This is not        surprising given the intensity of transmission in this        setting and the modest coverage in the first round        Additional follow up will be necessary to determine how        many cycles of mass treatment will be necessary to achieve        interruption of transmission in Leogane These results will        have important implications for the length of lymphatic        filariasis elimination programs                    Competing Interests
