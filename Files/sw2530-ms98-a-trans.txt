                what i mean hobbies do you enjoy   uh well lets see i suppose i could say i enjoy joy crocheting um gardening knitting uh hiking   do you have a lot of spare time to do it in or is it something you kind of have to make time for   well it seems like i dont have time for them but im i dont work fulltime or anything   umhum   i sell Avon and Stanley products   umhum   but its thats not you know the same as an eight hour job   well it cant from what ive heard understood it can  can be   yeah its its up to the person   sometimes yeah well i i enjoy needlepoint although boy i guess i got myself burned out i did too much too fast and   uh uhhuh   for some reason my eyes arent quite what they used to be either   oh   and um   you sound young   yeah yeah i am but i i dont know its just        maybe its the light but   uhhuh   and um i enjoy photography as a hobby   oh good   and boating and horseback riding although im recovering from back surgery so its going to be awhile before i can do either one of those   uhhuh um umhum umhum   and bowling and right now my biggest hobby i guess since um you know recovering is watching television and playing Nintendo with my son     yeah that could be a little boring sometimes i guess too but   and i do enjoy reading   uhhuh   um i do read a lot read quite a lot   uhhuh   uh i enjoy reading different types of things   uhhuh   i enjoy reading novels then uh you know more serious stuff   how how old is your little boy   today is his birthday yeah yeah   oh is it really oh how old     six   oh thats nice my babys expecting her first baby this month say yes   oh really oh how exciting  that could its always   so our children our children are all grown up   do they live close by   just one of them   the one thats going to have the baby well thats good you that will be your new hobby then  taking care of grandbaby   umhum yeah     um my sisters going to have a baby this summer   uhhuh   so but i guess thats a little off the subject   yeah     i dont know ive tried various things ive tried to get interested in things like refinishing furniture woodworking or um ceramics but it just seems like its so expensive to break into something new   um umhum   that um you know with my ive got quite enough of an investment in my photography equipment   yeah   that   we we had for a while done uh well we still do a lot of picture taking in that and uh were in the process of putting our eight millimeter   umhum   uh films and now the kids and i were going to put them on video   oh yeah   and were were in the process of doing that right now and   are you doing that yourself   yeah   how do you do it   uh we bought the equipment uh that you do it with   you dont have to i mean is the something that you dont have to see it as you its not like your   well the you buy this little little piece of equipment and you use your video camera of course and uh your projector   umhum umhum oh okay thats what i wondered   and the combination you the way you connect you know connect them up   do they make good quality copies do you think   uh i think its going to we were a little worried there was a lot of background noise on it but uh we can hook it into our uh stereo system after we get the pictures all done   umhum   we can hook it into our uh a video or uh stereo system and uh put music to the film and that will cut out all the background the noise of the uh recorder running and that   yeah oh well thats nice   because the projector made a lot makes a lot of noise   yeah i remember those weve never had one my parents never had one but um   yeah and uh so thats been kind and our darkroom is very we have a darkroom but its very dusty   oh thats my dream i guess is to have my own darkroom     we were real active in it for a long time but you know you get busy and   yeah um   the kids grow up and   theyre expensive to maintain just the chemicals are expensive   yeah we mainly just did a bit of black and white its   yeah i would still like black and white   uhhuh   to me black and white is photography color is more snapshot   oh you can really get some good really good pictures in black and white   yeah you really can people dont realize that   that umhum   not realize that black and white it nowadays its actually more expensive than uh color   umhum its hard to even find film or anything   yeah   yeah but uh   and i well i used to i learned how to knit when i was little my grandmother knitted a lot   uhhuh   and she knitted all the time   did she   and uh before she passed away and made some beautiful things but ive never really learned how to do more than the basic   oh thats great yeah yeah i dont do a whole it uh time seems to be hard to find for anything you want to do i dont know why   umhum   you   yeah i know   youd think id have a lot of time but   yeah youd think i would too but you know     but i i im knitting an afghan for the baby and i havent worked on this for several weeks  i just havent got back to it   um   whens the baby due   the twenty ninth     time to get busy do you know if its going to be a boy or a girl   i dont know   i dont know   they dont really care

some toll painting for a while and i started doing a still life and its it never got finished   yeah thats something ive its interesting to me people who watch people who are that know how to paint i just felt like thats something ive never been very good at or very good at drawing or anything   well had have you watched any of these things on TV these large brush   ive watched uh ive yeah here and there but they make it look uh i i know that       you know they just make it look so easy but i know it im smart enough to know that its not quite that easy   umhum well once you start it apparently its not bad some of the girls have gone into the call age group Claritin University is just not too far from here   umhum   theyve gone in and uh done a class on the large brush and actually did the painting   yeah   and you know theyve never done anything and they come out pretty nice   yeah ive yeah and i know a girl that used to do it and hers did too but i just dont think see myself whipping out masterpieces in thirty minutes       like they do on the shows   do you enjoy cooking   yeah i like to cook   i like to cook but ive really gotten away from it its with just two my son and myself its just not   yeah i dont do a lot of fancy cooking   to me its just he you know i hate you know hate to admit this but we live on frozen food   well it depends on what it is uh you
