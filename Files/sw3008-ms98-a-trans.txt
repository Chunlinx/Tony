           um fringe benefits are very important in the company in the company i think to provide the employee with a sense of security do you agree with that or   oh absolutely uh are you talking about benefits i cant think of one more important then than the you know the medical   yes at the rising cost of health uh care now its uh if you have to go out and buy your company coverage you probably have to spend three four hundred dollars a month to get anything that even came close to it   insurance right umhum thats right and uh even have dental dental insurance now which is really good   yeah   so uh   we uh weve just got dental insurance after the first of the year its been i think probably oh about eight or nine years since we had dental coverage and it sure makes a difference and   it it really does and uh uh well lets lets see insurance i i guess that would be one of the real biggies you know to a consideration   yeah i think the in the insurance area one of the things that we also got that we didnt have before what we havent had in about eight years is the card for prescriptions where you go in and just pay a minimal amount for prescriptions and uh we have some that are fairly expensive sixty seventy dollars well now we pay eight dollars for them   but with um paying twenty percent   uh no thats just all prescriptions uh   i know well see if you had a seventy dollar yeah okay that would save you   yeah and its a i think its five dollars on generic drugs and eight dollars on a name brand drug so no matter what they are in fact you have to pay the certain basic cost   umhum   for them you dont have to meet any deductible or anything   umhum   but uh   how about paid time off   uh yeah thats uh just vacation and some sick leave not very much though   do uh do you have a certain number of sick leave to you know days that are available to you or or is it   well   pretty much just depends on your supervisor   uh really depending uh on what you need kind of its a case that there if you need more than a couple weeks or eight days or whatever it may be then they they will consider it   umhum   so thats been with the companies ive been with generally at a a executive position theyre a little more liberal even though theyre not supposed to be supposed to treat everyone the same still leave hard you know rule more liberal with time off due to the all the extra hours executives put in   yeah   but uh the uh i think pension costs are making it more and more difficult for them to provide per pension benefits too its uh   oh thats right   yes because it just keeps going an up up and up there too but uh theres   yeah well do as you get closer to that time you start you know you start becoming   yeah the older you get the more you start thinking about the possibilty  pension   all of a sudden you know i can remember when that who cares  so now i think oh wait lets lets maybe we better start getting serious about that   right right yeah yeah uh my son has worked for a company for about six year he graduated from college what in eighty six so five years this fall and he started out with they had a Four O One K plan and he asked me if he should get into it and i said well very small amount uh you can put in there and you keep adding to it and theyre going to match it or so and   umhum   all of a sudden at the end of last year he had a sizeable amount saved up in his Four O One K plan just with the matching funds that the company is putting in and any earnings on investments so   but he cant touch that though right   no no he cant but hes only uh twenty seven years old and hes already got a good start   umhum   even if he changes companies he can you know roll that over into another plan   umhum umhum yeah we had i had that too theres a certain percentage of your salary and the company matches it fifty percent not half not not halfandhalf i meant   yeah   they dont match it exactly but fifty fifty percent which is good   yeah um i wish i had a company that did that but theres oh theres various intangibles also like uh you know taking pride in the company you work for being able to say i work for such and such company or i hold such and such position with this company and thats one of the intangible fringe benefits i guess a certain ego level there   your company has a lot of prestige   well it not the one im working for now but one i did in the past did so   but umhum umhum   i i just felt you know at a i need to find a company like that again   well another thing our company does is as far as uh like uh taking classes either within the company or them offering classes to us or   yeah   or or external you know they pay close pay yes   pay tuition and books or a portion thereof   and uh check they we i think we we have a mandatory we spend at least ten days a year not or not well yeah about something like that uh in taking classes and theyre offered within TI but you we have training plans everybody does   yeah   so i mean they really you know i i think uh our company really has a lot of good really good benefits   oh what you can find there is so many of these things like uh working for a company some of the things they really enhance your experience in case you do have to change companies   oh really   yeah i mean its a just makes you that much more salable shall we say   umhum   if you do have to go and search for another position   umhum thats true everything you everything you learn you its yours and you you it goes with you wherever you go so the more you learn the better off you are   its right thats right yeah yeah the company i used to be with also took care of things like professional dues and subscriptions to like the Wall Street and other professional mans magazines in the financial areas so it uh there are there are more than just insurance and pension theres lots of other things that come up   umhum   back in the heyday of the economy before this recession then of course there were other things available to other people i never even took advantage of them of uh like memberships in clubs people that uh had to entertain and such   umhum   so theres all sorts of fringe benefits     thats true so salary salary is   yeah   salary is what we do work for and what we have to have thats our initial motivation   eh thats right it it keeps your mortgage holder happy   huh     it keeps your mortgage holder happy   thats right thats right   yeah having to salary again being uh uh being able to acquire the the nicer things that you want not just have to live at a a certain level being able to do things or purchase things   umhum   that you want that arent really necessary   umhum     so um  thats about all i have   well i guess that i guess weve pretty well exhausted that   okay fine its been nice talking with you   well nice talking nice talking to you   goodbye   bye
