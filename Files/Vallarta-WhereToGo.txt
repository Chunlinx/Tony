Southern BeachesA boat ride away from Vallarta Yelapa offers a Robinson Crusoestyle getaway for day trips or overnight stays No electricity and no roads keep it a secluded funky beach community populated in part by expats and artists The other south shore beaches are Las Animas and Quimixto appropriate for day trips only These two offer palapa beach dining and as tropical a setting as you

surrounding Quimixto are also noted by divers and snorkelers for their excellent underwater vistas These three beaches may all be reached by excursion boat or for longer less structured stays take the water taxi from either the Rosita malecn  or Los Muertos pierNorthern Beaches and Towns Further north beyond Nuevo Vallarta are a succession of small towns and relatively undeveloped beaches in easy reach by car Just a few kilometers to the east traditional Mexican farming life goes its unhurried way up steep mountain roads where views can be superb and well worth the extra drive The simple and the sensational seem to coexist so easily hereBuceras is a breezy beach community known for its fresh oysters and the palapa restaurants on its wide whitesand beach Independent small hotels and rental

on the Pacific Ocean These two beach towns offer quiet rustic alternatives to Puerto Vallarta Both offer limited mostly casual beach dining and are popular with surfers and backpackersMountain VillagesThroughout the th century the picturesque mountain village of San Sebastin was one of the most populated towns in Mexico renown for its mining activity Now it resembles a quiet ghost town

Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor among his guestsAnother mountain town located in the high Sierra east of Puerto Vallarta is Talpa Accessible by a short flight or a long and winding mountain road

like the backs of great green animals leaning down to drink from the seaBarra de Navidad and San PatricioMelaque are located at opposite ends of a km mile beach backed by a lagoon Both little towns have a languid atmosphere and have remained small enough to enable you to really know the place within the first few hours after arrival yet also offer a pleasant selection of accommodations at very reasonable prices Barra de Navidad exudes a funky charm and is as casual and rustic a Mexican seaside town as youre likely to find Unpaved streets and palapatopped seafood shacks offer an intriguing contrast to the large and luxurious Grand Bay Hotel and golf course just a cent panga ride away on Isla Navidad The combination of an idyllic resort and spicy local color is beguilingManzanillo Manzanillo is a dichotomous placeit is both Mexicos busiest commercial seaport and a tranquil traditional town of simple seafood restaurants shell shops and a few salsa clubsFor years Manzanillo has been known for its wide curving beaches legendary sportfishing and a highly praised diversity of dive sites Now however between its own golf links and those located up the northern coast it is rivaling Los Cabos as the emerging golf capital of MexicoManzanillo has an enticingly tropical geography comprised of vast groves of tall palms abundant mango trees and successive coves graced with smooth sand beaches To the north mountains blanketed with palms rise alongside the shoreline And over it all lies the veneer of perfect weatherbalmy temperatures and yearround sea breezes Even the approach by plane into Manzanillo showcases the promise of a perfect vacationyou fly in over the beach and golf courseA visit to the town itself is as mandatory as a stroll in the plazaa ritual here for the locals Around sunset they gather and gossip on park benches while hundreds of birds congregate on the surrounding telephone wires cooing and calling out until eventually handfuls of rice sold by the plastic baggiefull around the plazas perimeter are tossed out to them Children chase after the birds stopping just short of the splashing fountains their laughter competing with the chimes of the church bells In the background multicolor houses in many hues cascade down the surrounding hillsides and a game of pickup basketball is played on the public court that fronts the harbor Located almost behind the city stretching south along the coast for miles is the Laguna de Cuyutln a stellar birdwatching siteAs you depart the downtown area you pass by the Museo Universitario de Arqueologa de Manzanillo University Museum of Archeology in Manzanilloeasily the regions most impressive collection of regional historical artifactsand the large commercial wharves before reaching the turnoff to Las Brisas This long stretch of golden sand beach on a peninsula separates Manzanillo bay from the San Pedrito lagoon another birdwatching haven Las Brisas Peninsula is where several older budget hotels are located along with a handful of recommendable restaurants In general this section of Manzanillo is quite rundown having never recovered from damage caused by a  earthquakeAbout seven miles west of downtown lies the Pennsula de Santiago Manzanillos best known landmark For many travelers this town is synonymous with the famed allwhite world of Las Hadas the Fairies and its adjoining golf course Set on a southern promontory of Santiago Peninsula Las Hadas gazes across Manzanillo Bay to the town but is a world apart in character Its Moorish architecture which looks something like a setting for Arabian Nights became renown as the place where Bo Derek showed her appreciation for Ravels bolero in the movie Ten Las Hadas was built in the s by the Bolivian tin multimillionaire Antinor Patio as a private superexclusive resort and a respite from Acapulcos excessive glitz Its presence spawned construction up and down the adjoining beaches making Santiago Peninsula the most desirable address in town especially for visitors to ManzanilloAt one time the La Mantarraya golf course on the Santiago Peninsula was considered among the top  courses in the world but its been upshot by newer entries Local legend has it that when the course was under construction preHispanic ceramic figurines idols and beads were dug up at the spot where the th hole now lies it is believed to have been an important ancient burial site The nearby El Tesoro the Treasure beach is also the subject of local loremany believe this beach still may hold buried treasure from Spanish galleons whose crews used the harbor during the th centuryOn the other side of Santiago lies a succession of locally popular beaches including the long stretch known as Playa Olas Altas named after the high waves that regularly break here Just beyond is Playa Miramar prized by bodysurfers and boogie borders for its challenging waves The adjacent beachfront has a collection of colorful beach restaurants for enjoying a casual day at the beachIxtapaZihuatanejo These neighboring towns when combined provide the quintessential Mexican beach experience Ixtapa is a planned resort with modern hotels and slick shopping while Zihuatanejoreferred to by locals as Zihua pronounced seewahis the original rustic beach townZihuatanejo Zihuatanejo became popular among beachcombers from abroad because it had what they wanted a sparkling bay divided into intimate stretches of sand by outcroppings of rock and wooded knolls plus simple pleasures that included swimming sunning and the freshest of fruit and seafood Cheap beer and rum were an added bonusDuring the s Zihuatanejos charm attracted numerous European visitors who have become regulars of this nolongerrustic beach resort A number have been so taken by its balmy beauty that they decided to make Zihua their permanent home giving it a continental airThe town embraces the beautiful Bay of Zihuatanejo with the downtown area to the north and the beautiful long beach of Playa Larga to the east The heart of Zihuatanejo is the waterfront boardwalk Paseo del Pescador also referred to as the malecn Unlike most Mexican towns Zihuatanejo doesnt have

who offer tamales and elotes corn for sale along with sweet homemade popsicles flavored with chocolate cinnamon or vanillaLa Cancha fronts the Playa Municipal where local fishermen pull their small boats onto the sand making it an excellent place to peoplewatch and take in the daily village life Many of downtown Zihuatanejos storelined streets are designated as zona peatonal pedestrian zone making it especially welcoming to those who prefer to explore on footZihuatanejo also has one of the better archeological museums on the Pacific coast The Museo Arqueolgico de la Costa Grande located near the eastern end of Paseo del Pescador traces the history of this area from preHispanic times when the place was known as Zihuatln through the colonial era Most of the exhibits show that the area was an important trading zone for centuries with items from faroff cultures such as the Teotihuacan and ToltecPast the municipal beach lies Playa La Madera once a loading point for lumberhence the name which means wood beach It has fine grayishwhite sand and the swells that enter it break suddenly into small waves that roll gently and then recede with little undertow This beachs calm waters are ideal for children and easy swimming A few beachside restaurants offer drinks and snacks and the everpresent beach vendors offer their wares to the sunning touristsPlaya La Ropa is Zihuatanejos most popular beach a long crescent of golden sand that stretches south past La Madera beach and receives the gentle breezes that blow in from the bay The beach was named for the yards of colorful cloth that washed ashore centuries ago following a trading galleons wreck The waves are generally too gentle and quickbreaking for surfing but you will find jetskis catamarans and windsurf boards for rent here Several beachfront restaurants offer food and drinks Alongside this beach you will find lovely and rather exclusive hotels and BBsPlaya Las Gatas once a walled preHispanic wading pool earned its name from the whiskered nurse sharks that used to frequent the surrounding wall Today Las Gatas is the most pleasant beach for swimming and childrens activities The coral beach has exceptionally clear waters with little or no surf and practically no undertow Located across the bay from Playa La Ropa it is easily reached by a short ride aboard small shaded boats that run from the Muelle the town pier every minutes Open air restaurants some fancier than others offer local delicacies including extraordinarily fresh pinktongued clams Las Gatas is a departing point for dive trips to some excellent sitesAlthough Zihuatanejo has grown more sophisticated with trendy boutiques and candlelit restaurants that overlook the bay those looking for a more developed tourist resort should take

Paseo Ixtapa which runs parallel to the hotellined main beach Playa Palmar This beach offers  km  miles of beautiful white sand and deep azure waters Even though the beach faces the open sea there are several spots where offshore rocks and islands quiet the surf and make the waters suitable for swimming The undertow here however is usually quite strong and extreme caution should be taken For a stunning view of this beach ride the cable car to El Faro restaurant located on the southern end of the beach upstairs from the Pacifica Hotel At the far end of Paseo Ixtapa lies Marina Ixtapa with fine restaurants private yacht slips and the Marina Ixtapa Golf CourseIxtapa also has its share of trendy shops and boutiques plus lively nightlife and refined dining A bicycle track begins at the marina continues around the golf course and heads on towards the northern beach of Playa LindaThe first beach in Ixtapa coming from Zihua is Playa Hermosa which can only be accessed through the Westin Hotel This small beach is dramatically framed by rock formations The surf varies seasonally from minimal to quite rough and has become somewhat of a private beach for Westins guestsPlaya Linda is located km  miles north of Ixtapa This is a long beach with golden sands that seem to stretch endlessly to the north It is the primary outoftown beach with water sports equipment rentals fishing charters and horseback riding The ferry to Isla Ixtapa leaves from the jetty located on the southern end of Playa LindaIsla Ixtapa is among the areas most memorable sites and is easily reached by boat The islands small beaches have managed to maintain their natural beauty despite the throngs of visitors that land daily Palapa proprietors do a great job of keeping all trash off the island It is a perfect place to spend the day enjoying the beach swimming snorkeling and eating fresh fish and seafood at any one of a dozen or so palapa restaurants Hundreds of colored fish dart among the rocks just offshore Boats ride back to the mainland every few minutes with the last boat leaving around pm always doublecheck the departure time of the last boatDay Trips from Zihuatanejo and IxtapaAnother excellent spot to spend a day away from the more crowded beaches of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo is Playa Larga A beautiful uncrowded beach that stretches for miles Playa Larga is located south of the bay between Zihuatanejo and the airport The surf here is usually quite rough and with a strong undertow so it is not recommended for swimming However the many small restaurants that border it make up for this shortfall by offering wading pools that are refilled daily along with hammocks for lazing under the palapa shades and fresh fish and seafood accompanied by icecold beer There is also the occasional musical rendering by a wandering beach troubadourA countryside visit to Barra de Potos located  km  miles south of Zihuatanejo offers a chance to see a small fishing village coconut and mango plantations and a lagoon known for the numerous tropical birds that inhabit itFurther south along the coast is the small town of Petatln and the Laguna de San Valentn which can also be visited

returnAcapulcoIf beach resorts are made for relaxing then Acapulco is the exception that proves the rule Here the energy is turned up more than a few notches and if you do enjoy languid days in the sun likely its only to rest up for playful nights at decadent discos or other nocturnal alternativesThough Acapulco is admittedly past its prime there are still plenty of reasons to visit and numerous ways to enjoy the famously sunny days there Acapulco remains Mexicos most traditional resort for those looking for a beach yet also want to feel as if theyve been to Mexico Where other resorts in Mexico have been accused of being homogenized to meet the tastes of North American travelers Acapulco remains true to her essence from the cacophony of families filling colorful public sands to the classically late nights in glitzy clubsAnd Acapulco has one thing that no other place hasthe absolutely stunning view of Acapulco Bay which day or night is an image as memorable as any youll come across in your travelsAcapulco is more of a city than other Pacific coastal destinations with highrise hotels lined up like dominoes around the edge of the bay It offers more options for dining shopping and other activities than anywhere else along Mexicos western shoreline many are geared for familiesThe one cautionary note concerns the reputed lack of cleanliness in Acapulco especially in the waters of Acapulco Bay Great strides have been made in cleaning up the pollution that was widely reported in the s and s However the water remains less pristine than in resorts to the north and south and most visitorswiselyprefer to swim in hotel pools A public works program put in place in the s ACALimpia has also made progress in cleaning up the beaches and other public areas including the heavilytrafficked Costera More than  powerboat sweepers are dispatched each day to skim any floating debris from the waters surface More important needed improvements in infrastructureestimated at over a billion dollarsare nearing completion which should also improve the cleanliness of the city and bayAs it fell out of favor as an international darling its prices adjusted out of necessity Now some exceptional values in hotels and dining can be found and today Acapulco is considered a valuepacked destination attracting more Mexican national than foreign tourismOther new initiatives are also gaining momentum including new ecotourism oriented excursions and a revival of Acapulcos historic center in a similar fashion to Miamis South Beach districtThrough all the changes that Acapulco has
