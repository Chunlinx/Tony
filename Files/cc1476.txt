                    Introduction        The use of inhaled bronchodilators to treat children        with bronchiolitis remains controversial      The        controversy may be the result of differences in study        populations in choice of bronchodilators or in measured        outcome variables between trials One common confounding        variable of past studies has been the inclusion of children        with a history of recurrent wheezing        The measurement of pulmonary function during infancy is        difficult because of the lack of subject cooperation It        has been shown that analysis of flowvolume loops at tidal        breathing is useful in evaluating lung function in infancy            Morris and Lane   described a rapid rise of        tidal expiratory flow to a maximum value in adult patients        with airflow obstruction In their study the ratio of the        time to PTEF to total expiratory time          t         PTEF          t         E  and the ratio of the tidal volume at        PTEF to total exhaled volume          V         PTEF          V         E  were correlated with conventional        measurements of airway obstruction          Studies have also used tidal breathing flowvolume        TBFV loops to evaluate airway function in healthy        newborns and infants with and without wheezing                 Cutrera         et al    reported a good        correlation between tidal expiratory flow patterns and        conventional spirometric measurements in schoolage        children Analysis of tidal breathing was used to predict        wheezing illness during infancy     Respiratory        function in infants after respiratory syncytial virus        RSVproven bronchiolitis showed a lower         t         PTEF          t         E ratio compared with that of        agematched healthy infants          Several groups have studied pulmonary function in        infants with bronchiolitis with varying results            The recent literature also suggests either a lack of        efficacy or a very small efficacy for albuterol        administration in the management of bronchiolitis           The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the        effect of nebulized albuterol administration on TBFV loops        and wheeze scores in infants with bronchiolitis due to        RSV                    Materials and methods                  Selection of patients          The study was conducted in the pediatric unit of a          community teaching hospital Patients admitted to the          pediatric unit were eligible for the study if they met          the following criteria age younger than  year first          episode of wheezing clinical features of bronchiolitis          rhinorrhea tachypnea and wheezing andor rales and          nasopharyngeal secretions positive for RSV as determined          by enzyme immunoassay Preterm infants and infants with          underlying cardiopulmonary disease bronchopulmonary          dysplasia previous history of wheezing or those needing          admission to the pediatric intensive care unit were          excluded from the study The study was approved by the          hospitals Institutional Review Board Informed written          consent was obtained from all parents before enrollment          of patients                          Study design          Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive          either  mgkg albuterol in  ml saline group A or           ml saline without albuterol group B via a nebulizer          with an air flow of  lmin The same patients were          crossedover to receive the alternate saline or albuterol          treatment  hours after the first aerosol administration          The  hour interval before crossover measurements was          used to exclude any carryover effect of nebulized          albuterol or saline The timing of postaerosol          measurements was based on several previously published          reports      Observers were unable to          distinguish between the two nebulizer solutions by any          characteristics and both nebulized solutions were          dispensed by the pharmacy in identical syringes Block          randomization was also performed by the pharmacy          department and the records were concealed until the end          of the study          Chloral hydrate  mgkg orally was administered           min before the measurements were taken An aerosol          either albuterol or saline treatment was given          following baseline measurements of heart rate          respiratory rate wheeze score arterial oxygen          saturation by pulse oximetry and pulmonary function The          same measurements were also repeated  min after the          aerosol treatment The entire procedure was repeated in           hours with the second aerosol either saline or          albuterol treatment None of the patients received any          other bronchodilators within  hours of the first aerosol          treatment or between the first and second aerosol          administration In those infants who were on supplemental          oxygen the amount of supplemental oxygen was kept          constant during the study period Corticosteroids were          not administered to any patients in the study                          Pulmonary function tests          All pulmonary function tests were performed by two          experienced respiratory therapists A SensorMedics           Pediatric Pulmonary cart SensorMedics Corp Anaheim          CA USA was used to obtain TBFV loops The TBFV loops          were obtained and analyzed by a standard method described          previously   A closefitting face mask Model          VR Ventlab Corporation Mocksville NC USA with          an airinflated cuff was used to ensure that no air leaks          occurred Four representative tidal flowvolume loops          were stored for analysis Each loop was chosen from a          series of breaths during established tidal breathing A          minimum of  loops was collected to select the four          stored loops The loops were selected from tidal breaths          with as stable a volume and shape as possible The means          from these four loops were used as the results for each          child                          Outcome measures          Several aspects of pulmonary function were chosen as          outcome measures These included the ratio of expiratory          time to reach PTEF to the total expiratory time as a          primary outcome measure the tidal volume            V           T  PTEF TEF TEF and TEF and          PT as other pulmonary function tests of interest          Heart rate respiratory rate oxygen saturation and          wheeze score   no wheezing   endexpiratory          wheezing only   wheezing during entire expiration           inspiratory phase audible with stethoscope only            expiratory and inspiratory wheezing audible without          stethoscope   were also measured                          Statistical analysis          To estimate the sample size we analyzed pulmonary          function studies of  infants with a recent history of          wheezing illness that were performed in our pulmonary          function laboratory We calculated the intrasubject          coefficient of variation for           t           PTEF            t           E as  A  difference twice          the coefficient of variation was considered a clinically          important improvement Assuming an  level of           twotailed and  power a sample size of           patients per group was predicted All values are          presented as mean  standard deviation          Nineteen measurements were made all together in each          of the two categories saline treatment and albuterol          treatment The values for each investigated variable          were compared with baseline measurements  measurements          before nebulization with saline and  measurements          before nebulization with albuterol by repeatedmeasures          analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction          for multiple comparisons These comparisons included          baseline before saline treatment versus baseline before          albuterol treatment saline treatment versus albuterol          treatment baseline before saline treatment versus saline          treatment and baseline before albuterol treatment versus          albuterol treatment The wheeze scores in various          categories were compared with a nonparametric Friedman          test followed by Dunns test Improvement after saline          treatment and albuterol treatment from their respective          baseline values were compared with a paired           t test           P   was considered          significant                            Results                  Patient characteristics          Twenty patients were enrolled in the study during the          study period Analysis of one patients flowvolume loops          was consistent with grunting and the subject was excluded          from the study All  infants in our study had a cough             days Eighteen infants had symptoms of upper          respiratory infection    days wheezing             days and breathing difficulties    days          Sixteen infants had difficulties in feeding             days and nine of the  infants had fever             days A family history of wheezing or atopy was present          in nine infants          Exposure to passive smoking and household pets were          present in  and eight infants respectively One child          presented with apnea and four infants had otitis media          at the time of admission The duration of hospital stay          in our study group was    days Five infants          received oxygen supplementation and eight infants needed          intravenous fluids for more than  day All infants were          positive for RSV and none were premature or had          bronchopulmonary dysplasia          All baseline demographic and clinical variables were          evenly distributed between the two groups except for          gender distribution Table  No significant changes          were observed in heart rate respiratory rate oxygen          saturation and wheeze score after aerosol treatments          Table  The PTEF increased both after albuterol and          saline treatments but the difference between the two          treatments was not significant Both TEF and PT          significantly decreased after albuterol administration            P   There were no          significant changes in           V           PTEF            V           E and           t           PTEF            t           E either with albuterol or with saline          Table                             Discussion                  Relationship between tidal flow indices and airflow          obstruction          Morris and Lane   demonstrated that in older          children and adults           V           PTEF            V           E and           t           PTEF            t           E values from TBFV loops correlate          well with specific airway conductance with forced          expiratory volume in the first second and with the ratio          of forced expiratory volume in the first second to the          forced vital capacity They also showed that the values          of           V           PTEF            V           E and           t           PTEF            t           E were significantly lower in subjects          with obstructive airway disease          In children younger than  years of age with          bronchopulmonary obstruction           t           PTEF            t           E and           V           PTEF            V           E values were lower than in the          controls and improved after salbutamol administration            The magnitude of change in           t           PTEF            t           E was significantly correlated with          the concentration of serum eosinophilic cationic protein          an inflammatory marker   The same investigators          showed in a different study that           V           PTEF            V           E            t           PTEF            t           E and PT ratios were significantly          lower in asthmatic children and improved significantly          after salbutamol when compared with controls   In          another study in schoolage children however the           V           PTEF            V           E value was not significantly          different in asymptomatic asthmatics when compared with          agematched healthy controls   In addition forced          vital capacity peak expiratory flow by spirometry and          forced expiratory flow at  of forced vital capacity          FEF             were similar in both groups          Only FEF            and FEF            discriminated asymptomatic          asthmatics from the healthy controls          The tidal flow index           t           PTEF            t           E  measured during the first  months          of life has been shown to be predictive of subsequent          wheezing in boys during the first  years    Alder                    et al    however concluded          in their study that           t           PTEF            t           E is only weakly associated with the          development of lower respiratory tract illness during the          first year of life and the ratio is less precise and an          epidemiologically less useful measure than maximum          expiratory flow at functional residual capacity Clarke           et al    were also not able to          detect any difference in           t           PTEF            t           E between healthy infants who did and          did not develop lower respiratory illness          In older infants aged  months who suffered from          obstructive airway disease Banovcin           et al    reported significant          correlation between maximum expiratory flow at functional          residual capacity corrected for lung volume and           V           PTEF            V           E and           t           PTEF            t           E  They also showed a weak          correlation between           V           PTEF            V           E and airway resistance reported as          percentage predicted   Banovcin           et al  concluded that           V           PTEF            V           E and           t           PTEF            t           E correlate better with measures of          peripheral airway obstruction than with airway resistance          reflecting mainly central airway patency Dezateaux           et al    compared           t           PTEF            t           E with airway function measured by          plethysmography They found a weak but significant          association between           t           PTEF            t           E and specific airway conductance in          infants aged older than  months irrespective of their          previous wheezing status          What determines the           t           PTEF            t           E value There is controversy in          infants about the validity of tests to measure airway          obstruction   Little is known about the determinants          of           t           PTEF            t           E in infancy The relationship of           t           PTEF            t           E to lung function may exist because           t           PTEF            t           E quantifies the degree of active          tidal slowing that occurs in response to respiratory          system mechanics In normal subjects during expiration          the peak flow is reached approximately onethird of the          way through the expiration This is because of the slow          cessation of inspiratory muscle activity at the end of          inspiration If the inspiratory muscle activity ceases          abruptly at the end of inspiration completely passive          expiration results in early peaking of the flow due to          unopposed recoil of the lung and the chest wall          Both           t           PTEF and           t           E will influence the final value of          the ratio           t           PTEF            t           E  In a patient with airway          obstruction slow exhalation secondary to an increased          expiration time constant will increase           t           E  In addition active breaking is          diminished leading to decreased           t           PTEF  Both these mechanisms result in          a low           t           PTEF            t           E value in a patient with airway          obstruction This effect could be further increased in          severe obstruction with active exhalation and no active          breaking In other words           t           PTEF            t           E may not be a direct indicator of          airway caliber but may reflect a neuromuscular response          to respiratory mechanics in airway obstruction          The behavior of           V           PTEF            V           E mainly parallels that of           t           PTEF            t           E  The same mechanisms responsible          for determining           t           PTEF            t           E may be operative in determining           V           PTEF            V           E  The role of several measured tidal          flows TEF TEF TEF and ratios PT in the          evaluation of pulmonary function is mostly unknown In          airway obstruction tidal flows may become flow limited          especially towards the end of the tidal volume because          of dynamic compression   The rate of airflow is          highly dependent on the lung volume at which the flow is          measured Without knowing the lung volumes at which the          tidal flows are measured the tidal flows have limited          value in the evaluation of lung function                          Tidal breathing parameters and bronchiolitis          Low           t           PTEF            t           E values in infants with bronchiolitis          may result from an increased time constant ie          increased           t           E  andor decreased active braking          ie reduced           t           PTEF  Both of these changes can          happen because of airway obstruction Theoretically          sedation may reduce           t           PTEF            t           E by diminishing active braking In          fact           t           PTEF            t           E was found to be lower in awake          compared with sleeping newborn infants   The mean          value for           t           PTEF            t           E    in our study is lower          than that previously reported values for healthy infants              The probable explanation for the low          values of           t           PTEF            t           E in our study population is airway          obstruction          In our study PTEFs have increased with the          concomitant decrease in tidal flows near the end of          exhalation TEF and with the decrease in the PT          ratio Peak flow during tidal breathing is submaximal it          can be increased with increased effort Theoretically it          can also increase due to bronchodilation We cannot          determine whether bronchodilation or increased force of          contraction of respiratory muscles resulting from aerosol          administration is the cause of the increased PTEF in the          present patients          The later in expiration that the flow is measured the          more the measurement reflects the resistance of the very          small airways   A significant decrease in tidal          expiratory flows at the remaining  of tidal volume in          the present study may suggest narrowing of the small          airways after albuterol administration The ratio PT          will be influenced by the values of TEF as well as          PTEF In the present study PTEF significantly increased          and TEF decreased although not statistically          significant after albuterol administration Both these          changes have lead to significant decrease in the ratio of          PT Increased effort during exhalation can          theoretically lead to an increase in PTEF and by dynamic          compression of smaller airways to a decrease in TEF          this leads to a decrease in PT The resistance of          small airways is believed to have a greater effect on          flow at lower lung volumes   Although tidal volumes          remained constant in the present study we do not know          whether the expiratory flows at the remaining  of          tidal volume were measured at identical lung volumes          before and after aerosol treatment          The lack of improvement of tidal flow indices of          airflow obstruction in the present study may be because          of a true absence of bronchodilation in these patients          or because these indices are not sensitive enough to          detect bronchodilation if one existed As the index           t           PTEF            t           E reflects the neuromuscular response          of pulmonary mechanics it may not be sensitive enough to          detect small changes in the airway caliber As we have          not compared TBFV indices with conventional measures of          airway obstruction we cannot be certain whether we have          missed bronchodilation if one existed          The small sample size and variability of the tidal          flow indices might have also contributed to the negative          results of the present study The power of the study was          to detect  improvement in           t           PTEF            t           E  We could have easily missed a much          smaller response because of the sample size although the          clinical significance of such a response is unknown We          have only used a single dose of aerosol and measured the          pulmonary function once after the aerosol administration          Theoretically we may have missed a peak effect of          bronchodilation Although we have used a standard method          of aerosol delivery and a standard dose altered          respiratory mechanics and smallairway disease in these          infants with bronchiolitis may have lead to a decrease in          the delivered dose of bronchodilator resulting in a lack          of response                          Clinical scores in bronchiolitis          In recent years there have been several reports of          improvement of clinical scores such as oxygen saturation          and respiratory distress scores etc after          bronchodilator administration in infants with          bronchiolitis    The failure of clinical scores          to improve in the present study may be because of the          small sample size and the inclusion of patients with mild          disease However the observed improvement in clinical          scores in several previous studies may be due to          mechanisms other than bronchodilation Transient          improvement in oxygenation may have occurred because of          increased minute ventilation secondary to alteration in          tidal breathing pattern following aerosol administration          without bronchodilation An improvement in respiratory          distress scores may be explained by an increase in nasal          and upper airway caliber especially in the studies with          epinephrine In the present study group there was no          clinical improvement with a bronchodilator The          bronchodilators may increase oxygen consumption          precipitate paradoxical hypoxemia and increase the cost          of hospitalization                            Conclusions
