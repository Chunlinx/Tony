                                 CyberLiberty Depends on the Architecture                        Now were getting somewhere Richard asks How is it that commerce can bringabout a change to the liberty of the Net How is it any different from commercein real space We dont ordinarilywe who are not Reds at leastsay that themarket in general reduces freedom So why in cyberspace should it be anydifferent            The answer is simple Its the architecture um Richard            Richard begins his questions with Chapter  but I think the answers beginin Chapter  For the argument of the first part of my book is not that thepresence of commerce on the Net by itself reduces the liberty of the Net Ifthe architecture of the Net remained as it was in  then it wouldnt matterwho uses the Net for what            My argument is that commerce is changing the architecture of the Net and asa byproduct of that change the freedoms of the Net will change Commerce isbringing technologies to the Net that will reduce the initial liberties of theNetnot because commerce is evil Nor because it is against liberty Butbecause the architectures that make commerce more efficient can also makecontrol cheaper The very architectures that make it possible to profit willmake it easier to regulate            Richard pointed to some of these architectures of freedom in his first postHe said that physical aggression against neighbors is ruled out in part by theanonymous participation that is possible online Im not quite sure what heimagines here but he is appealing to a feature of the Net to make hisargument anonymity But anonymity is not a natural or necessary feature ofthe Internet We could just as well imagine an Internet where transactions leftfingerprints And to the extent that they did the consequence that Richardpoints to would change To the extent the Net were architected to limit oreliminate anonymity a certain liberty of the original Net would change aswell            And this is precisely the kind of change my book describes There is anincreasing push to layer onto the Net architectures that facilitateidentification and tracking The technologies are many I describe onetechnology extensively in my bookthe emergence of digital certificates thatwill function as digital IDs But there are any number of other examples thatmake very same point emerging architectures that make tracking andidentification easier            Think about cookies Heres an architecture in the sense I mean the termthat was added to the Web by an innovation of Netscape Corporation Thatinnovation would Netscape argued make it easier for servers to trackcustomers When you contact a site the site can deposit an entry in yourcookie file that will make it possible for that site to gather data about youin the future            That change stripped away a certain amount of anonymity on the Net Nowservers could watch where you browse they could watch pages you skip to theycould know something they didnt before And all this because of a change inthe architecture            The point is not that cookies do no good I love the fact that Amazon knowswho I am and can recommend books to me when I come to their home page theyveyet to recommend my book to me but Im sure theyll get around to that soonenough But the point is that the freedom that there was has been changed by achange in the architecture Sites now get data for free because thearchitecture makes it possible            But more important changes are just around the corner For example            One of the fundamental architectural principles of the original Internet wasthe principle of endtoend First described by network architects JeromeSaltzer David P Reed and David Clark endtoend means that you keep thenetwork stupid and build intelligence at the endsin the applications orthe users            One consequence of this design was that the network could not discriminateSo long as you followed the basic Internet protocols the network would carryyour traffic And one consequence of this consequence of nondiscrimination wasthat new applications could be brought to the Net even if they displaced thedominant existing application No one was in a position to discriminate againsta new entrant because the Net was architected to disable discrimination            Enter broadband cable at least under the architecture initially proposed byATT After acquiring as many cable companies as it could ATT and itsaffiliates are now converting the cable system so that it can carry theInternet But they are architecting this network very differently from how theoriginal Internet was architected They are architecting it so that the networkowner gets to choose the Internet service provider that you get your broadbandInternet service from And because the architecture allows ATT to chooseit allows ATT to control how its network gets used If it doesnt wantyou to stream video through your computer a possible future with broadbandbecause that competes with streaming video to your television set the pastwith cable it now has the power to discriminate And it has that powerbecause its network has been architected to give it that power It has beenarchitected that is to be different from the principle of nondiscriminationin the original Net            Now these are not issues that ivorytower libertarians would ignoreIndeed I can imagine as I write this Richard chafing to intervene and to saythat libertarianism has lots to say to these problems I was Richardscolleague for six years and student for one I know his chafing very wellThe libertarian would talk about externalities and about minimum regulation toavoid externalities and about the value of common carriers and the like            But cyberlibertarians say something different They have been slow todefend the principles of the initial architecture against the changes thatcommerce would impose on that architecture They have been slow because theyhave been slow to see how the Net is changing And more important slow to seehow much of the freedom they enjoy comes not just from the absence ofgovernment but also from a constitution of freedom built into the architectureof the Net            The argument of my book is that we ought to pay attention to thisconstitution and to the freedoms that this initial architecture gave us Andthat we ought to pay attention to the influences that are changing thisarchitecture and therefore changing this freedom            You wouldnt disagree with that would you
