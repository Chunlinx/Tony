            uh are you a TIer   no   okay well we might have a difference uh to talk about on clothing uh   you sound like some guy i talked to yesterday   what   you sound like the same person i talked to yesterday   i am how come we got the same conversation subject   i dont know       okay   i was amazed that they had the same subject on clothing too i never have had that before i noticed it on the weekends occasionally when i call   well so was i     and how could they possibly get the same person thats ridiculous   okay well  have your opinions changed in the last twenty four hours   no no they sure havent what other aspects im i im this is funny you know uh clothing lets see       uh i was curious you know if they just want to talk about the words of uh related to clothing that polyester was coming back have you heard that uh i saw it on the TV that the models were   no ooh gross   they had a new kind of polyester uh whether that they just like to switch materials uh periodically i dont know we might i havent we didnt talk about materials i i prefer you know the cotton with very little in fact when i look for   oh definitely   uh i i try to go for the cottons and i dont know that polyester will although mens shirts are halfandhalf or sixty forty or whatever   i mean polyester especially in this climate polyester just doesnt work too well   yeah i uh im originally from the east and i we used to wear sweaters and things and sweaters are   uhhuh   this isnt necessarily sweater country uh you know i i guess theyre not as popular as they were i dont know about how women if you do you have problems with airconditioning or were you you were uh uh is that a factor   yeah its always yeah it seems like its always cold inside and part of my problem is that im in and out a lot because   thats very bad yeah   yeah weve got a lot of buildings downtown and i have to go to a lot of meetings in different buildings and so im in and out of the airconditioning and you know like i said we have to wear suits and thats   yeah   you know it it gets to be quite uncomfortable at times   at TI i am too in and out and well of course we dont wear ties and jackets certainly not in this kind of weather the the jackets they dont disappear but they you know theyre theyre on a hook usually the vice presidents or the managers and again i used to wear them but i dont i dont bother with it right now       yeah that is a problem uh where did i see an article about where theyre about that subject where theyre trying to have oh i know it was lunchrooms where theyre trying to encourage people to stay at work and so thats why they even downtown this might be applicable   huh   where theyre trying to have restaurants within walking distance but at the same time in other words you go down in a subway or whatever   uhhuh   and go to lunch and they say thats so much more healthy for you than going out in the street in the open traffic and going to lunch youd be better of   is that right   im sure maybe you do have some tunnels down there   oh definitely yeah i mean   and they they say thats so much more healthy for you to you know when you have to go out or go to lunch or whatever its to to walk or however and get to a place that is uh you dont have to go in and out of the of the temperature   i havent heard that   whether that affects how you dress i can imagine uh   the last thing i heard about fashion i think i mentioned it yesterday was that wide ties were coming back   right yeah i uh   i dont know i think i always run a little bit behind It takes me awhile to get used to   well i im for colorful things and i sure i i do enjoy the uh the newer products along those lines what do you think about women and wearing slacks and all that we havent talked about that   oh i wouldnt wear slacks to work   okay   um people dont where i work i mean its just not done   yeah   at all but now i have worked places where they do and even then i still didnt   do you have children i might comment on teenagers how they dress   i dont have a teenager i have a six year old and hes still   oh you have a lot to experience i have two   hes still at the age where i can dress him how i want to   right  well have the opposite then  i have uh well one of theyre almost now teenagers at one twenty almost twenty and one almost sixteen and i learned early on being surrounded by women here that the i i love to take them shopping but i dont pick anything out you know i i just kind of influence but uh the the teen the junior high teenagers really   yeah   i dont know if you can describe how they dress you know you you   well i have a girlfriend who has a daughter thats a teenager and every year before school starts she has me take her shopping for clothes because they fight  too much   i i know what angle that we can talk about here we they want us to talk about clothes around work but uh the way kids in school should dress and ill give you my opinion i dont think that the school should just kind of let the kids dress what is the current style not that its totally ridiculous of course but   well i just read something in fact i think it was today about how the public a lot of private or a lot of the public schools now are going to uniforms   public schools oh i didnt hear that yet   yeah because uh they feel like theres too much competition in the clothing and it it clearly defines you know class lines in where you know the the Guess jeans and the you know stuff as opposed to the people who cant and so it takes peoples concentration the thought behind it is that people wont concentrate or worry about what theyre wearing what everybody else is wearing and it will take their mind off that and you know enable them to you know study better plus they say   right well well whoever said that in my opinion doesnt have any teenagers who didnt grow they wont do that theyll never pass it that will be like     this was  they werent talking about it wasnt talking about actually i i kind of like that idea and i had my son in private school where they do wear uniforms and uh i i really like that   right uhhuh i can uh of course i went to school you know a hundred years ago in college and uh we did wear ties and jackets and this was they have since changed it was an engineering school a city it was in an downtown area like i dont know well you cant compare anything around here to the school in like no UTA here is in Arlington its not exactly downtown but i guess like that and they just historically since it was in the city they wanted us to wear jackets and ties and i did my whole college career which is i guess terribly unusual   huh   we wore jackets and ties for four years and i so subsequently i wanted to get a masters degree in in after i got out of the service and uh they changed drafts so there was a   that is yeah   the styles have certainly changed to where i guess my campus now looks like typical uh college campus i guess   yeah i think well i think for a while kids were dressing nicer in colleges but um nowadays uh i i still i take classes at UTD and they um you know they wear jeans and sometimes they dont even have shoes on   huh the older i get the more more open to other peoples ideas uh you cannot be you have to let them come out with uh whatever they not whatever but some of their ideas too and so you kind of back off and see what people and i know their clothing is changing you know all the time and im im certainly open   uhhuh   to how you should dress uh now of course the subject is work uh or clothes really i guess   yeah   uh and the only again the one thing i am at at work is is certainly a professional look but im not saying that that will not change the professional look will look differently from year to year perhaps   do you spend a lot of money on clothes for work   no i really dont its uh uh go through a lot of shirts and think no i dont really   you know i think and and this may be totally unfair and unfounded but it seems to me like women have to spend more money on clothes for work then men do because men can have a few suits and you know a bunch of different shirts and some different ties but you know women practically have to have you know a whole bunch of different suits   uhhuh right well youre sure right there because not even when i wore a jacket and a lot of the guys when i was up at Spring Creek in uh Plano uh we think he just brought the same jacket even that wasnt a thats not a black mark against the man and youre right that uh women are expected to look more everything matches i guess   yeah and then of course you know accessories you know shoes and hose and earrings and you know all that stuff   right right right   um its just i its outrageous you know because you know you still spend two three hundred dollars on a suit   your work without saying much about it do they ever bring the subject up of asking your opinion on on whether you want things to change on how you dress or   no i ultimate  leave and i havent been at work in awhile so i i dont really know   are the ties oh   you know from what i i went to a concert earlier this week and saw some people and just noticed how theres a lot of the wider ties   uhhuh   but theyre not theyre not the same as the wide   right uhhuh uh TI has several locations different sites have a little bit different dress dress like i said at Spring Creek it was definitely more formal i think because it was newer and uh  type and many many more people wore there was very there was very few production areas   do you think it has anything to do with the ages of people   uh that
