                    Background        SLCCCL normally expressed in high endothelial        venules and in T cell zones of spleen and lymph nodes        strongly attracts T cells and dendritic cells DC                   SLCCCL recruits both nave lymphocytes and        antigen stimulated DC into T cell zones of secondary        lymphoid organs colocalizing these early immune response        constituents that culminate in cognate T cell activation            The capacity to facilitate the colocalization of        both DC and T cells forms a strong rationale for the use of        SLCCCL in cancer therapy In previous studies we have        shown that the SLCCCLmediated antitumor responses are        accompanied by the enhanced elaboration of IFN        IPCXCL MIGCXCL GMCSF and IL but decreased        PGE           VEGF IL and TGF at the tumor        site      In addition there was a marked increase in        CD and CD cells secreting IFN and GMCSF as well as DC        expressing CDc infiltrating the tumors MIGCXCL  and        IPCXCL are glutamineleucinearginine ELRnegative        CXC chemokines that are potent chemoattractants for        activated T cells       These chemokines also have        in common the ability to signal through a G proteincoupled        receptor CXCR expressed on activated T lymphocytes        IPCXCL MIGCXCL and IFN are known to have potent        antitumor activities         in vivo        Both        MIGCXCL and IPCXCL are important for the antitumor        activity mediated by IFN inducing cytokines such as IL              Based on these findings we hypothesized that        augmentation in IFN MIGCXCL and IPCXCL would        play an important role in the SLCCCLmediated antitumor        response Here we show that the cytokines IFN        IPCXCL and MIGCXCL serve as effector molecules in        SLCCCLmediated antitumor responses                    Results and Discussion        Host antigen presenting cells APC are critical for the        crosspresentation of tumor antigens     However        tumors have the capacity to limit APC maturation function        and infiltration of the tumor site        Thus        molecules that attract host APC and T cells could serve as        potent agents for cancer immunotherapy A potentially        effective pathway to restore Ag presentation is the        establishment of a chemotactic gradient that favors        localization of both activated DC and Type  cytokine        producing lymphocytes at the tumor site SLCCCL a CC        chemokine expressed in high endothelial venules and in T        cell zones of spleen and lymph nodes strongly attracts        naive T cells and DCs            Because DCs are        potent APCs that function as principal activators of T        cells the capacity to facilitate the colocalization of        both DC and T cells may reverse tumormediated immune        suppression and orchestrate effective cellmediated immune        responses         In addition to its        immunotherapeutic potential SLCCCL has been found to        have potent angiostatic effects     thus adding        further support for its use in cancer therapy Based on        these dual capacities we as well as others have begun        preclinical evaluation of SLCCCL in several tumor        models                Utilizing two transplantable murine lung cancer models        we have previously shown that the antitumor efficacy of        SLCCCL is T celldependent     In both models        recombinant SLCCCL administered intratumorally led to        complete tumor eradication in   of the treated mice        Studies performed in CD and CD knockout mice also        revealed a requirement for both CD and CD lymphocytes        subsets for SLCCCL mediated tumor regression Consistent        with these findings we found that SLC therapy did not alter        tumor growth in SCID mice In immune competent mice        intratumoral injection of SLCCCL led to a significant        increase in CD and CD T lymphocytes as well as DC        infiltrating the tumor and the draining lymph nodes The        cellular infiltrates were accompanied by an enhanced        elaboration of IL IFN IPCXCL and MIGCXCL at        the tumor site            SLCCCL is documented to have direct antiangiogenic        effects      the tumor reductions observed in this        model could have been due to participation by T cells        secreting IFN leading to inhibition of angiogenesis via        MIGCXCL and IPCXCL as well as T celldependent        immunity     IFN mediates a range of biological        effects that facilitate anticancer immunity MIGCXCL and        IPCXCL are potent angiostatic factors that are        induced by IFN       Both MIGCXCL and        IPCXCL are chemotactic for stimulated        CXCRexpressing activated T lymphocytes that could further        amplify IFN at the tumor site     Hence we postulated        that in addition to IFN IPCXCL and MIGCXCL would        also be important contributors to the tumor reduction in        the context of SLCCCL therapy        To determine the importance of MIGCXCL IPCXCL        and IFN in the SLCCCL mediated antitumor response        these cytokines were depleted in SLCCCLtreated mice        AntiIPCXCL MIGCXCL and IFN antibodies each        partially but yet significantly inhibited the antitumor        efficacy of SLCCCL Figure  p   compared to        the control antibody group Neutralization of IFN caused        a significant decrease in both MIGCXCL and IPCXCL        indicating that these chemokines are largely IFN        dependent Thus an increase in IFN at the tumor site of        SLCCCLtreated mice could explain the relative increases        in IPCXCL and MIGCXCL The converse was also        observed IFN production at the tumor site was found to be        MIGCXCL and IPCXCLdependent as indicated by the        fact that neutralization of these cytokines caused a        significant decrease in IFNFigure  Neutralization of        any one of these cytokines caused a concomitant decrease in        all three cytokines thus indicating that IFN MIGCXCL        and IPCXCL are interdependent in the        SLCCCLmediated antitumor responses Based on these        findings we speculated that the decrease of IPCXCL        and MIGCXCL led to a decrease in IFN by limiting the        influx of T cells producing IFN at the tumor site Because        MIGCXCL and IPCXCL are chemotactic for stimulated        CXCR expressing activated T lymphocytes we determined if        neutralizing these chemokines         in vivo in the SLCCCLtreated mice        would decrease the frequency of CXCR expressing T cells at        the tumor sites Compared to SLCCCLtreated mice        receiving control antibody flow cytometric evaluation of        singlecell suspensions of nonnecrotic tumors from        SLCCCLtreated mice receiving neutralizing antibodies to        MIGCXCL IPCXCL and IFN showed   and          decreases respectively in the gated CD CXCR veT cell        populations Table  The fact that neutralization of IFN        was the most efficient at decreasing the total number of        CXCRactivated T cells may be due to the decrease in the        IFNdependent CXCR ligands MIGCXCL and IPCXCL        Individually neutralizing MIGCXCL andor IPCXCL        only led to a partial decrease in the total number of        CXCRactivated T cells Because MIGCXCL and IPCXCL        share the same receptor CXCR one possible explanation        of a partial decrease in CXCRactivated T cells is that        neutralization of one ligand may overexpose the receptor to        the other ligand Furthermore because murine SLCCCL        binds CXCR receptor SLCCCL may be recruiting CXCR        veT cells directly An alternative explanation is that        residual cytokines such as IFNinducible T cell         chemoattractant ITACCXCL present after         in vivo neutralization of IFN MIG        IP may have remaining activity and attract CXCR veT        cells Our results imply that all  cytokines IFN MIG        and IP play interrelated roles in the recruitment of        CXCRactivated T cells in SLCCCLmediated antitumor        responses While the number of CD and CD cells remained        unaltered compared to SLCCCLtreated mice receiving        control antibody mice administered neutralizing antibodies        to MIGCXCL IPCXCL and IFN showed respective        decreases of   and  in the number of CDc DEC        DC infiltrating the tumor Table  At present it is not        clear why there is a decrease in DC following        neutralization of MIGCXCL IPCXCL and IFN A        plausible explanation is that these cytokines may be        involved in complex interactions with other molecules that        are chemotactic for DC Further studies are required to        delineate the mechanisms responsible for MIGCXCL        IPCXCL and IFN mediated localization of DC at the        tumor site                    Conclusions        Our results suggest that the antitumor properties of        SLCCCL may be due to its chemotactic capacity in        colocalization of DC and T cells as well as in part to the        induction of key cytokines such as IFN IPCXCL and        MIGCXCL                    Materials and Methods                  Reagents
