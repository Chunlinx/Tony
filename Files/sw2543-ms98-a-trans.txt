          okay what kind of music do you like   well i um several years ago a radio broke in my car and i never i got out of the habit of listening to the radio and so   umhum   i havent been listening i i used to just listen to the rock stations but um  lately i have been going back to classical music i dont really know what   umhum   too many of the most popular songs are unless you know theyre in the the news or something but um so i tend to listen to some of the older   umhum   songs that were popular back when i was paying attention and then i like some classical music and some of the   umhum umhum   pieces that have been around a while i havent paid much attention to most of the current music what about you   um i listen i listen to a wide variety of music sometimes ill turn on the classical music sometimes ill listen to jazz uh every now and then country and western um   umhum   ill listen to some of the rock stations i also like the uh the the classic rock stations that play the older more mellow type   uhhuh   rock music um some of the some of the rock stations now are the i guess the top forty stations or whatever they just it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials and   umhum   sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating and uh it gets kind of old and they play the same songs over and over and i just get kind of tired of all that   thats true   umhum   so lots of times ill just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio actually but uh most of my cassettes i guess i dont i dont like hard rock     no   um i have some some rock and some jazz and couple of maybe one or two country and western some uh oh i cant believe i cant think of his name um Garth Brooks i have a couple of his tapes   uhhuh   and um       but its mainly its mainly just the the light rock type stuff   yes i dont i never liked any of the heavy metal music  i never really listened to it because i you know i prefer to have more i guess an established pattern of   umhum   music to listen to but and i back a long time ago when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty and i listened to some of it but i you know now that theres just a million rap groups and   umhum umhum umhum     and uh they try to tend to try to do outdo each other with raciness i think and   oh yeah   so i you know im not attracted to that at all but um it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was a easy access and so now that i do have one i just dont automatically turn it on   umhum   unless theres something im particularly listening to but you know if you go two or three years without having that what i got the most exposure to   umhum   it really changed my lifestyle and kept me from just having a you know easy access to current music and so i did like i say tend to go back to albums and cassettes and things that i had already had purchased but we dont have a CD yet do you   umhum umhum no i dont i sure dont because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like gosh i have to go out and buy a CD player and then start collecting CDs and it just i havent gotten around to doing it yet   uhhuh yeah i i kind of decided to wait until it it was around a while it was kind of like remember when personal calculators first came out and they were really really expensive and then now you can get one for two or three dollars   yeah yeah just like VCRs too  yeah i thought of that too that if i wait itll get a lot less expensive and i can do without it for a while   uhhuh uhhuh sure and also they get better quality with and they learn to have more features and things and without and making them less expensive so were kind of waiting   umhum umhum   to like uh now you know and the price of cassettes has gone down because CDs are so popular so   umhum thats and a CD is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was too right now i think   i havent even priced them i guess they must be   theyre somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece   oh really that is awful   yeah yeah i bought some at Christmas time for friends of mine that have CD players i thought my gosh now i know another reason why im not going to get a CD player for a while   uhhuh   take our time well i cant imagine um you cant record on them and so   right   they wont be as functional as like a cassette player where if you heard something you could record it you know uh if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something that youd heard or that you owned an album of so CDs wont be nearly as handy   umhum uhhuh yeah see ive got a on my stereo ive got a a uh turntable and then ive got a dual cassette so i can record off other cassettes   umhum   but i never realized you couldnt record onto CD i just never really thought about it because i havent really looked into it very much i dont have one and and ive never really looked at one very closely but that that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette player in my car now i guess   uhhuh   you know one of these days when i get a new car maybe i guess all of them probably will have CDs players by then but uh im not planning on doing that for a while i just got mine paid off so im going to stick with the cassettes and and uh you know until   yes  enjoy it   until they now my sister my younger sister has a she does have a CD player that she got for Christmas and shes got the the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto CDs i mean im sorry other way around off CDs onto cassettes um   uhhuh uhhuh well thats good   so i can record some things from her and you know get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to but   umhum   but um i just havent gone to CD yet   why we havent either but we you know we like the the idea of having great um extra quality you know in your music and things but but im satisfied to just have what ive been used to not have to think about the great financial   umhum umhum   sacrifice that that would be to suddenly try to switch over to all CDs or something but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is   umhum   when we had children um i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching and what kind of music i was listening to and activities because um you know i just didnt want them to be exposed to   right umhum   a lot of things and a lot of the lot of the songs have some lyrics that um i just wasnt pleased with you know   oh yeah  and they get worse and worse too   umhum and so i really think weve tried to tone down   umhum   our taste there to make uh you know our children not be exposed to so many negative negative things so early in life   umhum well thats amazing how i used to when i was in college i used to have the stereo on all the time or i had on MTV or something but ever since ive been out of college   umhum   i guess over the last several years i listen to the stereo less and less now i will turn on ive got a small jam box in my bathroom ill turn that on while im in the shower and while im getting ready because theres really not much else i can do and its kind of boring standing there putting on makeup so ill turn the radio on and   uhhuh right   and then i listen to it when im in the car driving to work because again theres you know theres nothing else going on i might as well listen to the radio while im driving to work but other than that ive i really dont   right   i dont listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore i guess im just too busy doing other things that its too much trouble to get up and go decide what i want to listen to and put it on the on the turntable i dont know i just dont dont bother to do it very much anymore     yes i know what you mean i i know my husband he um plays an instrument and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music and he goes out of his way to play marching band music or   umhum umhum   like you say jazz or classical to the children to to give them some exposure to different kinds of music and i think thats really good because theyre learning to like all different kinds and   umhum thats good what instrument does he play   he plays the its a euphonium its like a small a really small not a tuba but i think its hard to explain  i never had known anyone to play one before but its kind of like a small small tuba but its not the kind that sits up on your shoulder   umhum uhhuh ive never heard of that uhhuh   but its a cross between a tuba and and an and you know a horn its a brass instrument      umhum   so he plays that and and a little bit of piano and   uhhuh   but he has some real fond memories of marching band and   umhum   concert band type activities and he thinks thatd be good for the kids   umhum oh im sure it is im sure it is i was exposed to a lot of music when i was younger i my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years and     umhum      so i was i was a real good piano player but then i got interested in a lot of other things and i got real involved in many things and and now i dont have a piano in my apartment or anything i could sit back down and play a few things but not like i used to be able to its kind of sad that ive let that slip away   umhum umhum   and i took guitar lessons i think for one or two years and uh that was about the same time i was taking piano and then i got too busy in high school to really keep up with it between homework
