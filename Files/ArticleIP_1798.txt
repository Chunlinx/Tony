                                 Flytrap on Capitol Hill            The dirty little secret ofmy journalistic career is that despite having lived in Washington for  yearsand having been a reporter for five I have never seen a president in theflesh Well I watched a Clinton speck through binoculars during his firstinauguration and I once saw George Bush running but he was still vicepresident Today is my chance to remedy that            Thepresident is visiting Capitol Hill for a private session with House DemocratsEveryone knows Clinton wont say anything to the press assembled outside butthe horde has gathered anyway We are hoping that hell tell the DemocraticHouse members something about the scandal in private and they will pass it onto us            By the time I arrive at  am the president is alreadyinside the conference room He ducked the press and entered through a sidedoor Nearly  reporters are swarming outside and a dozen cameras aretrained on the microphone bank by the rooms exit Capitol Hill security istreating the press with all the respect we have come to expect We are pennedbehind Tensators and anyone who dares step past the guide ropes is yelled atthen moved back by Capitol police officers Even Bob Schieffer star of CBSnews is herded like livestock            When reporters gather rumorsfollow Among the utterly unsubstantiated rumors circulating today The FBI found DNA on the dress and  Clinton aides are quietly callingmembers of Congress and asking how they would respond to a meaculpa             Cameramenand reporters buttonhole members as they begin trickling out around  and itis immediately and disappointingly obvious that the president said nothingabout Topic A and his Democratic allies didnt ask him about it One by onethe Dems file past and one by one they are drilled with the same question bythe mouthed monster Was there any discussion of the presidents ahlegal troubles            And one by one they answer            Gene Green of Texas Nodiscussion at all  No one brought it up  NOTHING was brought up  ATALL                        Ron Klink of PennsylvaniaNo one did  No one talked about it  No one did  NOONE                        Is it possible dear readerthat  Democratic members of Congresswho are congenitally incapable ofsilence on any subjectcan spend an hour in private with the president and nottalk about the  pound gorilla in the room It is            After afew of these futile interviews I begin to discern three distinct genres ofnonanswer                           The HighMindedDismissal This is the favorite of the savvier Dems notably HouseDemocratic Caucus head Vic Fazio and Minority Leader Richard Gephardt How doesthe highminded dismissal work Put on a tight sour smile when Flytrapquestion is asked sigh deeply then say exactly this sentence Themeeting was very very positive Always very very Never just very Wediscussed issues  Issues that the American People careabout Social Security the patients bill of rights  It never fails Assoon as the horde hears the words Social Security a silence falls Pens stopscratching cameramen turn off their high beams Then reporters turn away andstart talking to each other                           The LogorrheicDismissal The choice of more awkward Dems this requires dismissing talkof Lewinsky then talking endlessly about why youre not talking about herPennsylvanias Paul Kanjorski is todays master lecturing reporters on why hewould not talk about Flytrap why reporters should not ask him about it andwhy they should be ashamed for even mentioning the subject Time spent onFlytrap  minutes Time spent on the issues voters in my district careabout  minutes                           DismissalInterruptus Practiced by a few perhaps more squeamish members Thisinvolves a disjuncture between mouth and brain The mouth becomes literallyincapable of talking about the scandal He has already addressed this once Heannounced that he did not have a relationship with a  a  trails offone wellcoiffed member There was no discussion We did not get into any ofthe diff  says Norm Dicks of Washington swallowing his words If thatwere my name I might not want to talk about the scandal either            Istill dont get to see the president While the Democratsare mouthing these sweet nothings by the front door the president heads out aside door and leaves through a blockedoff corridor Reporters used tocomplain about Reagan avoiding the press How long has it been since Clintonanswered a question            Since Iwas in the neighborhood I thought I should drop by another scandal landmark onthe Hill the House Judiciary Committee Any presidential impeachment will gothrough this committee This is a prospect all America should anticipate withglee The Judiciary Committee offers as fine a display of intellect andsurliness as can be found in Washington If impeachment comes the JudiciaryCommittee may or may not be judicious but it will certainly beintemperate            Todays business is a class action lawsuitreform bill that everyone seems to agree with But the Judiciary Committeebless its heart is a committee that can disagree to agree After a few minutesof collegial discussion presided over with mountainous dignity by Rep HenryHyde RIll Capitol Hills genial uncle the committee reverts to type            Rep Barney Frank DMasswho has never found a subject he doesnt like arguing about and has neverstarted an argument he didnt win introduces an amendment It would and Imhazy on this make it either harder or easier to dismiss class action suitsWhichever it is Virginia Rep Bob Goodlatte vehemently disagrees Goodlatteone of the new breed of Republicans who looks like a choirboy and acts likeSavanarola counters Frank at high
