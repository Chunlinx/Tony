uh part of the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now   yeah its it it was it was heavy when we were there though i didnt see any boats there though   yeah   not not not too many no but uh no i just got back from a weekend where we went and uh had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing it was pretty nice but uh no i i have uh i had a boat last summer that i took out a catamaran that i do did a lot of sailing on and stuff thats a lot of fun but uh my parents are pretty big sailors too theyre kind of into it but   yeah uh all we all we have up here mostly bass boats   oh yeah i guess its pretty uh fishings a pretty big thing huh   umhum lot of lot of fishing going on up here   yeah yeah all right so where about in Texas is that is that centrally located or   its uh well you ever heard of Lufkin   uh no what what major city is nearby   Houston   okay and thats south or north of there or something   let me see Houstons north   yeah okay   Dallas is south   oh okay all right well that sounds pretty good does uh i guess the weather does that stay pretty constant there or   its its gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons probably seventies eighties in the afternoon   yeah okay well thats pretty temperate yeah thats not too bad but uh  yeah have you done uh any other boating then or   no i hadnt done any in a lately uh lately but thats all i used to have uh have a friend that owned his daddy owned a boat shop and we used to when i was in high school we used to go out   yeah   go boating everyday just about   oh thats great yeah i   and we had a new different boat everyday   oh thats fantastic yeah i used to uh kind of be that way myself when i lived in in northwestern Florida in the panhandle i used to sail about everyday id work go to work   id like to do some sailing   yeah its a lot of fun its uh especially if you get a a pretty fast boat like those catamarans are pretty fast you can actually   yeah what do you if you get one like that they have somebody teach you there or they just   well actually i ive known how to sail pretty much my whole life um my my familys pretty into it and uh i took sailing lessons when i was about six and then uh   yeah is it pretty easy   yeah its its kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know um just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it   yeah   so its its not too bad its pretty easy to get the hang of i think and uh generally everybody ive ive known has kind of gotten into it but some people are more motorboaters you know which is fun   yeah that well thats about all we have   yeah yeah a lot of people dont dont see the excitement in sailing but then again they may neer may they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran   umhum   and uh thats when you really start getting into speed you know you can actually some catamarans can actually pull people behind the skiers they get so fast you know   i didnt know that   yeah they get pretty quick but uh     that thatd be something   yeah yeah i havent i havent personally done that but um the races i i work with a guy right now that uh  races catamarans in the summertime   umhum   and uh hes pretty gassed about it hes got a good uh   what kind of what lake do yall use   well he uh hes from Detroit so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes i think and does his sailing um for me i i go back to Orlando uh in about a month   umhum   and so down there basically just go to the coast were about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the East Coast and theres a lot of places there you can go you know   ooh   so uh so thats a good thing   yeah   but yeah so what do you do for a job   uh well i build transformers   oh really okay is that for TI or   yeah no
