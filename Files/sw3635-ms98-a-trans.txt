                 okay im definitely for drug random drug drug testing and any kind of drug testing to try   hm   and get rid of it   hm but dont you dont you find that that sort of imposes imposes a um i mean it it i i   taking away peoples free agency   pretty yes i think so i mean i   how many times do you think drug people have taken away peoples free agency   well not probably not as often as as as youd like to think and and when you when you take and i i mean its like would you like to have somebody would you like to have the police able to come to your house and search for for lets say weapons uh twice a day without telling you um would you like to have them come and find and look maybe for uh oh uh illegal illegal books and and could they come and and and just knock on the door and walk in your house and say i want i wanna find illegal books   no but as long as you are working for somebody you are   yeah well   more or less under their jurisdiction   umhum okay well would would you the place at work would you like them to be able to search your purse and and then every time anytime they wanted to just come and and check to see if you had anything that was maybe against the company i i im its not that im in favor of of you know that i think people should be allowed to take drugs at the job or or you know anything like that of course but on the other hand it its it seems a little bit nasty to me just to have this uh um you know it seems quite an imposition on on personal freedom to have um you know it the the the vast majority of people that are at work arent arent taking drugs and have nothing to do with them and yet theyre being subjected to the to the same kinds of of imposition that everybody else is and and i think i think that thats just unfair if you put it in a different context you see the same either the same you know it it get becomes a little clearer of course you know im my assumption is that that you dont take drugs and and and you of course would never have have nothing to hide in that sense and so it that doesnt doesnt hit home very close right but when its something else it it does hit home and and   right   ive you know it ah it it gets more like a police state um and its a lot less like America to me and and i find that uh i find it pretty offensive to have you know to have to be subjected you know i mean to to subject everybody to that kind of of of uh how you know random search   it wouldnt bother me and i dont think it would bother any of my family i have a son thats a doctor and i have a son thats an airline pilot     and yeah uh   and i think theyre they are among the top ones that should be subject to to that   yeah yeah uh you know and and again again you know in my case i have nothing to hide and im not gonna you know its not gonna hurt me but on the other hand im very uh it it perturbs me to have the this issue   uh one of our freedoms so called   yeah i mean just to to to be able to walk in and say you know now you have to show us this or you have to do that or you have to and   taken away   um it it seems it it seems like its an erosion of of of a lot of what makes uh the the United States what it is and and i i i strongly dislike that um and so   well im for doing it because i think that it is a protection against the majority of the of the citizens     yeah now actually actually i i dont take a a totally strong position on it i mean i think that i think there are certain certain positions   youre just trying to argue with me to show another point   no no no i i think that there are there are certain positions where the the benefits of it outweigh the the the disadvantages of it and and like you say you know maybe airline pilots or or um you know people who who whether   i have a son thats a doctor what about him   uhhuh yeah i i suppose you know i i i kind of wonder about sort of random testing in general i i guess random testing is a way to make people not not feel like theyre being singled out   right   right because  you know it seems like that that um you ought to be able to tell who who has a problem and and uh and be able to deal with them um but but i suppose that has uh some uh some negative side effects too right i mean people still   maybe they would feel like they were being   persecuted or something right um and uh and i supposed that the random testing and i guess the logic is that if as long as   umhum umhum   you know if if if youre not involved then you dont have a problem with it it shouldnt it shouldnt be any an issue for you and and and eventually the people that are actually doing that and causing the problems will be will be caught at it but um i dont know   i just really feel strongly against drugs because i think that theyre theyre tearing our nation apart theyre tearing families apart theyre tearing   umhum umhum   good people that you know uh could would be asset a asset to the community and to the nation and i just think that drugs is   um yeah   i just try so hard i would try so hard to get them out of wherever they were   yeah i i you know its its sort of like  you know i i i dont i just disagree with your position in general its its just that its kind of
