                                 Social Security From Ponzi Scheme to Shell Game            Privatizing Social Securityis a solution in search of a problem Oh the problem with Social Security isreal enough But privatizationthe hot policy idea of the seasonsimplydoesnt address the problem Its as if you were crawling across the desertdesperately thirsty and you meet a fellow who says What you need is somelemonade You say water would suffice He says Oh but lemonade is muchnicer Herehanding you a packet of lemonade powderjust add water andstir            In thisweeks report by a government commission on Social Security a majoritysupported various forms of partial privatization And lemonade privatizationis an appealing drink in many ways But its a testament to the agendasettinginfluence of conservatives these days that on Social Security were debatingthe merits of lemonade when the real issue is Where do you get thewater                        Social Security privatization was ably discussed severalweeks ago in our Committee of Correspondence But in this case at least thatdiscussion seems not to have provided the dialectical pathway toward ultimateand inevitable truth that we had hoped for So let us try again Andladiesand gentlemenI will now attempt to discuss Social Security with no numbersno graphs and not a single use of the word actuarial            Accordingto polls more members of Generation X believe in UFOs than do in SocialSecurity Of course those who delight in this factoid never tell you how manyGenXers actually believe in UFOswhich might be the alarming bit Butbecause it serves their particular generational selfpity GenXers seem morewilling than older folks to grasp the essential truth about Social Securitywhich is that it is a Ponzi scheme Payments from later customers financepayouts to earlier customers The ratio of retirees taking money out to workersputting money in is rising due to  people having fewer children and people living longer This means the Ponzi scheme cannot go on The famousSteins Lawan inspiration of our own Herb Steinholds in brief that whatcannot go on wont The issue is how exactly this Ponzi scheme will stop goingon            Discussions of the Social Security crisisoften confuse three different problems First with baby boomers in their peakearning years Social Security currently brings in more revenue than it paysout in benefits The surplus is invested in government bonds These are specialgovernment bonds Statistics about the federal deficitand both partiespromises to balance the budget over the next few yearscount the SocialSecurity surplus as revenue and dont count these bonds as debt But within acouple of decades the annual surplus will evaporate and Social Security willhave to start drawing on this nest egg For the government to honor these bondswill require huge borrowing essentially replacing these IOUs to itself withreal IOUs to private individuals or a huge tax increase            The second problem is thateven if the government honors these bonds in fullprincipal and interestapoint will be reached well into the next century when the Social Securitytrust fund is exhausted and not enough money is coming in to pay thecurrently promised benefits            The thirdproblem is that even if todays benefit promises can somehow be kept SocialSecurity represents a much worse return on investment taxes paid in forfuture retirees than past and present retirees have enjoyed This is partlybecause some minor benefit reductions are scheduled already raising theretirement age slightly and gradually It is mainly because younger peoplewill have paid much higher Social Security taxes throughout their workinglives The average return on GenXers Social Security investments will almostcertainly be worse than they could have done by investing in the stockmarket            Whether all this adds up to a crisis is a matter ofrhetorical taste The fact that boomers and GenXers will get a worse deal fromSocial Security than their parentsmainly because part of the money they putinto the system was in effect transferred to their parentsdoesnt seemhorribly tragic to me Even after this transfer we will still on average bebetter off than our parents were Wheres the injustice Problem  that SocialSecurity will run dry many decades from now depends on essentially impossiblepredictions about the distant future and in any case can be solved by veryminor adjustments if theyre made pretty soon            No  is a real problem Itshard to imagine the government actually reneging on its IOUs But its alsohard to see an easy way of avoiding that            For allthree problems there are only three solutions cut benefits raise revenues orborrow Privatization is not a solution Privatization means allowingindividuals to invest for themselves all or part of what they and theiremployers put into Social Security Whatever the merits of this ideaand thereare someit does not address the problem at hand Social Security is a Ponzischeme Current payersin are financing current payersout not their ownretirements Privatization assumes an end to the Ponzi scheme Every generationsaves for its own retirement But you cant get there from here without someonepaying twicefor the previous generation and the current oneor someonegetting less or someoneie the governmentborrowing a lot of money            Privatization enthusiasts sometimes admit tothis as a transitional problem But it is not a transitional problem Itis the entire problem As Brookings economist Henry Aaron pointed out in theCommittee discussion if you could pour in enough money to pay for thetransition to privatization the system would no longer be out of balanceThe problem or crisis would be solved Privatization would not be needed            You have to watch closely asthe privatizers describe their schemes They play a shell game Take this partof the Social Security tax and convert it into a mandatory savingscontribution take todays benefit and divide it into two parts give everybodythis new account and that minimum guarantee take this shell and put it thereand bring that shell over here andhey presto But no matter how you divvy itup the same money cant be used twice That is the problem with SocialSecurity now and it is the problem with privatization All youve said whenyou endorse privatization is that if there were water it should be usedto make lemonade Not obviously wrong but not terribly helpful            Privatization is a shell game in a second way It is supposed to bring moremoney into the system because returns on private securities are generallyhigher than returns on government bonds Even members of the recent commissionwho oppose full privatization supported investing part of Social Securitysaccumulated surplus in the private marketplace But as Stein pointed out inthe Committee every dollar Social Security invests privately instead oflending to the Treasury as happens now is an extra dollar the governmentmust borrow from private capital markets to finance the national debt The neteffect on national savings and therefore on overall economic growth is zilchEvery dollar more for Social Security is a dollar less for someone else            If Social Security manages to achieve a higher return byinvesting some or all of its assets privately the rest of the economy willachieve a lower return by having more of its assets in government bonds Inessence the gain to Social Security will be like a tax on privateinvestorsan odd thing for conservative think tanks to be so enthusiasticabout Also the arrival of this huge pot of money looking for a home willdepress returns in the private economy while the need to attract an equallyhuge pot of money into the Treasury to replace the lost revenue will increasethe returns on government bonds Result The diversion will be at least partlyselfdefeating            The size and security offuture retirement benefits ultimately depend on the countrys generalprosperity at that time in the future Checks to be cashed in the year whoops theres a number will be issued in  whatever promises we make ordont make today The most direct way for Social Security to affect futureprosperity as Aaron pointed out in the Committee is to increase nationalsavings of which the Social Security reserve is part by trimming benefitsandor increasing revenues Since we have to do that anywayeven as a preludeto privatizationwhy dont we do it first Then we can argue aboutprivatization at our leisure
