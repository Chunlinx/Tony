              okay what are you are you doing anything in Utah on recycling   well in uh our particular area uh were not other than uh they have a local store that you can take uh bottles and cans and different things to   umhum   in their parking lot and uh in the winter we havent been doing that but uh they dont uh thats about all theyre doing   is it a small town   yes its a rural area   that makes a difference uh here in Dallas theyre trying to   uhhuh   to start some curbside recycling i think theyre doing a test uh personally my husband and i do plastic and glass and newspaper and cans but we have to uh take them you know to to areas and the problem that im finding is that uh a lot of the places ive been taking things have now discontinued the recycling policy like its hard to find a place to take newspapers anymore   umhum yes so thats uh thats basically what happened up here and then uh with all the recycling the price of aluminum cans went down   oh really   yeah it used to be about sixty cents a pound and so people were collecting them and taking them in to recycle uh to get money for them now its down to about nineteen cents a pound   well i noticed a difference uh we go to the Kroger store uh here to take our aluminum cans and i noticed a difference you know id be getting perhaps a dollar for whatever i took in and i think the last bunch i took in which i didnt think was much smaller was maybe twenty six cents   yeah thats thats whats happened and i dont know if thats from recycling i i understand it is but here uh we do we do recycle our newspapers and give them to the scouts and they uh theyre able to make some money uh that way but i have a son in Illinois who uh they pick it up they have a  a recycling uh garbage uh pick up where they have different uh receptacles where they put it in they have some for the cans some for the bottles and newspapers and then they have the regular garbage and uh   umhum   this truck comes before the garbage truck and picks uh and has separate bins to put all the glass and the plastic and all that in that seems to be working quite well there thats uh in uh  Illinois   well you know what is so sad is that people are finally i think willing to do something about this and then all of a sudden uh the the demand isnt there you know its too expensive to recycle but i personally feel that were going to have to   yes uhhuh   pay the price you know whether the government subsidizes it and im you know i sorry to the government government get involved in too much of anything else like that but something has to be done were just uh were using our natural resources were filling up the dumps and   yeah umhum   well ive thats what they in the local the local paper here they were talking about that uh half about half the uh the material in the dumps is newspapers   umhum   they could recycle that uh more than they do then uh um wed be able to save a lot of trees and everything else so ive been i i im all for it i just dont know uh i know my son uh in Chicago where he has this they have uh uh they have to pay extra to have them pick it up even though and and so thats kind of a a burden on my uh my son even though they they put it in different containers they still have to pay extra money to do   uhhuh well and i know uh too my mother lives in a rural area also and it she would have to go like thirty miles to recycle anything and so course so of course she she doesnt and plus uh its difficult for her to   and uh um   drive around just all that much so in a case like that you know they have to make it a little bit easier for people   yes they do   to do that   yeah umhum   and um im hoping that they do this curbside recycling ill be willing to pay a little extra you know if theyll go ahead and pick it up quite frankly itll save me money in gas running around all over town   right yep boy  thats true   and i take my uh paper i always get paper bags and i take them back to the grocery store and use them again   hm right   so you know little bit here and little bit there i guess it all helps   yeah yeah it it really does if we could just get uh people uh all over to do it now i know in uh south of us about a hundred miles south in Utah they do have a uh area where uh they bring all the garbage in and they uh they do have places to recycle and they really encourage this and uh you can bring it and you have different areas um thats a small yeah well its next to Provo Utah i dont know if youre familiar with Utah at all but anyway   not a lot but ive heard the name Provo before   its where Brigham Brigham Young University is uh this   okay   uh there they seem to be having success and but it is a uh its done by the it for profit making for these people   umhum   and they of course are
