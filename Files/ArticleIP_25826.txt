                                  Serbs Kosovars Israelis Palestinians            Ask two Israelis a questionon any subject and youll hear six opinions nine during election season andprobably start a brawl And even on Kosovo a topic you wouldnt think Israeliscould disagree about they are managing to squabble revealing a peculiarambivalence about this blackandwhite issue            American Jews haveuniformly greeted the Serbian brutality in Kosovo with outrage They identifiedwith the displaced Kosovars comparing them to the Jews of the Holocaust Theycommended NATO for bombing quickly rather than ignoring the brutality as Alliedleaders did during the Holocaust One Jewish organization ran newspaper adsdepicting trainloads of bedraggled Kosovars an echo of Nazi concentration camptrains American Jews poured cash into half a dozen relief funds established bynational Jewish groups and at least two Jewish agencies sent relief teams tothe Balkans            Israeli Jews reaction to Kosovo has been equally intensebut much more complicated Like American Jews most Israeli Jews view Kosovo asa reminder of the Holocaust and feel a special obligation to aid KosovarsIsrael has done more for Kosovar relief than any other nonNATO country asPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu never hesitates to note Israel sent a fieldhospital and  doctors to Macedonia and welcomed  Kosovar refugeesoffering them permanent residence Israelis also mobbed a huge Kosovo benefitconcert            But beneath Israelissympathy for Kosovars lurk more perplexing reactions that illuminate theanxieties of a state where a beleaguered ethnic minority seeks independencethe byzantine nature of Israeli electoral politics and the enduring weight ofthe Holocaust in Israelbut not the weight youd expect            Israeli doubts about Kosovo begin with Israeli doubts aboutPalestinians Palestinian newspapers and leaders have compared the ethniccleansing of Kosovo to the Palestinian nakba  of  when thousandsof Palestinians fled Israel and ended up in permanent refugee camps Thisanalogy has been endorsed by the likes of the Economist  which calledthe flight of the Palestinians an unpunished ethnic cleansing Palestiniansalso claim that the Wests intervention to preserve Kosovar autonomy confirmstheir right to independence We will ask the international community tointervene to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and to expel thesettlers from it said Ahmed Abdel Rahman the Palestinian Authoritys Cabinetsecretary citing the Kosovo bombing as exemplar            Most Israelis are merelyirritated with this Palestinian claim viewing it as an unseemly attempt toexploit the Kosovo crisis and as a faulty analogy An Arab invasion of Israelin  prompted the Palestinian flight not an Israeli invasion of Arabterritory But Israels far right has taken the Palestinian claim seriouslyThe far right views Kosovo not as tragedy but as threat a dangerousprecedent Some rightwing Knesset members have called for an end to theairstrikes If the West intervenes on behalf of an independenceseeking ethnicminority in Kosovo one asked couldnt it happen here too in a differentvariation today or tomorrow            The Serbs only exacerbate Palestinian righteousness andIsraeli rightwing paranoia by calling Kosovo Serbias Jerusalem If Kosovois Jerusalem that means that either a Israels hold on Jerusalem isunjustified as Palestinians argue or b Serbias hold on Kosovo is justifiedas a few fringeright Israelis are now hinting            Kosovo ambivalence hasalso become a pawn in next months Israeli election The Israeli left hasblasted Netanyahu for his languorous response to the humanitarian crisis Hetook several days to decide that Israel would help refugees and several moredays to announce support for bombing            But Netanyahu and his allies particularly hawkish ForeignMinister Ariel Sharon are using Kosovo more cleverly Early in the bombingSharon warned that an independent Kosovo could become the heart of a GreaterAlbania that would be a staging ground for Muslim terrorism Netanyahu quicklydisavowed Sharons remarks but Sharon had scored points with the far rightwhere antiMuslim sentiment abounds Israeli media have been full ofunsubstantiated reports that the Kosovo Liberation Army is funded by IranAfghanistan Osama Bin Laden and Hezbollah Calls to Israels farright talkradio station have demanded that Israel send its Muslim Kosovar refugees toIran or Saudi Arabia            Sharon has especiallyexploited Kosovo to court Israels  million new Russian immigrants whosevotes are expected to decide the elections outcome Sharon has visited Russiathree times in the past few months including once in the midst of the Kosovobombing Sharon eagerly sucked up to Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakovimplicitly condemning the NATO bombing during his most recent trip RussianIsraelis are not especially proSerb but they definitely want close ties withRussia So Sharon is using Kosovo to butter up Russia That in turn couldswing Russian voters            The final and most beguiling aspect of Israels Kosovoambivalence is Holocaust remembrance but of a different sort There islingering Israeli sympathy for Serbia rooted in Serbs supposedly admirablebehavior during the Holocaust The premise  Serbs welcomed Jews into theirantiNazi guerilla groups  individual Serbs bravely sheltered Jews from theNazis  Serbs fought the Nazis harder than anyone and  both Serbs and Jewswere victimized by brutal Croats and Bosnian Muslims            During the past decadeSerbia has taken advantage of this version of its World War II history to makecommon cause with Israel In the late s with the blessing of SlobodanMilosevic a group of Serbs organized the Serbian Jewish Friendship Societywhich has propagandized endlessly about Serbias Holocaust decency Serbiaalso tried to ally with Israel over their shared enmity with Muslims Serb andIsraeli cities made themselves sister cities When Iraq was shooting missilesinto Israel during the Gulf War a delegation of Serbs traveled to Tel Aviv toshow solidarity There were rumors that Israel even supplied Serbia witharms            This mythology of Serbian goodness paid off during SerbiasCroatia and Bosnia wars Israelis sided with the Serbs against the Croats whohad been truly monstrous toward Jews during the war And even when it becameclear that Serbs were slaughtering Bosnian Muslims Israel was largely silentand even occasionally sympathetic about Serb misbehavior            As it happens Serbias treatment of the Jews wasnot as the Serbs have portrayed it Its true that Titos Communist Partisanswelcomed Jews into their guerilla units and its true that the Serbs were notas terrible as the Croats and Bosnians But  the Chetniks who are thedirect ancestors of todays Serbian nationalists were consistently andviolently antiSemitic The Chetniks also supported the Nazis for much of thewar and even turned over Jews to them  The Serbian collaborationist regimecooperated eagerly with the Nazis  Serbias Jews fared much worse than mostEuropean Jews Nazis exterminated more than  percent of Serbias  Jewsthe women and children at a camp right outside Belgrade Serbs did not resistor protest this slaughter            Even so vestigial sympathy for Serbs remains todayin Israel and in a much more limited way in the United States Israel hasseen a few small proSerb demonstrations during the Kosovo crisis and Israelimedia frequently refer to the Serbs decency during the Holocaust Suchexpressions of solidarity along with rightwing distaste for the NATO bombingdont begin to outweigh Israeli sympathy for Kosovars and outrage at Serbs ButGod knows theyre more than Milosevic and his people deserve
