                hi Rick how you doing   pretty good   you say you live in your own home or you do not   no i dont im uh renting a townhouse right now but im moving uh the end of May im going to move into renting a house   uhhuh wow ive ive never heard of that before   im uh well actually this will be the second time ive done it   how does   i am uh in grad school right now   uhhuh   and on my kind of salary you just  its kind of hard to come up with money to make a house payment   well i ill bet you end up spending more money renting a house than you would if you put a down payment on it and and uh   yeah well down payment is a tough problem i guess   yeah if you can get by that hurdle   yeah   i can remember when i uh when i brought my house i needed help uh and my folks helped me out to get started and now my rent uh well my mortgage if you will is uh cheaper than uh you know one room uh apartments   yeah well i dont know youre in Massachusetts i think the the market is a little bit different here   its a lot cheaper in uh in uh Texas     oh no im in im in Raleigh North Carolina   oh oh North Carolina   yeah uh its probably what im paying now for an apartment is six twenty five   uhhuh   and this this house were moving into is only five hundred dollars a month   so youll actually be saving money   yeah   how about the utilities for the uh for the house that youre in now   well the one now is is uh its got a heat pump   umhum   so its its kind i mean its not that cold in Raleigh in the wintertime but i mean the air conditioning is probably your biggest threat   umhum   and the new place doesnt have air conditioning and has gas heating so its going to be i know its going to be cheaper       maybe hotter but   i i uh probably make you sick if i told you what my uh my mortgage is with with the taxes   yeah i can imagine i know how things are up there   im paying uh two hundred and thirty dollars a month   what   with taxes   what     i bought   you have some kind of deal   no no deal it when i bought my home uh twenty five years ago it was it was very expensive   oh oh twenty five years ago okay yeah that makes   yeah im an old im an old guy   well that makes it more my parents have the same kind of deal too       theyve had their house that long   well it works that way with uh with anybody who buys its very difficult when you first buy your house uh but once but once you do that and hang on to it youd be surprised what inflation does to uh   yeah yeah   to the housing market and even though were in a slump right now its not going to last forever its going to catch up sooner or later and uh you got you got to live in a house some day uh   yeah yeah see the problem i have now is uh i i want mobile because im not really sure what is going to happen a year from now ive moved like   umhum   three times in the last two years   when you rent the home do they uh force you to lease and guarantee payment   uh yeah they usually do put a a year lease on it   umhum   i was living in Colorado and i didnt have a lease which was really nice   oh the the lease   but i just kind of a verbal agreement yeah im going to stay a year and ill be nice to you  if youll be nice to me   yeah the the lease can work uh work two ways it can work to your benefit too where uh they cant increase your your rent uh if something goes wrong with with a written lease but with an oral lease they can so it works both ways   yeah yeah yeah huh well what would you suggest think it would be a good idea even i think i might be moving to buy a house   well buying a house is is should be your ultimate goal because youre going to have to live somewhere   yeah   and uh even if uh if you hang on to it for five years put a little bit of uh uh money into it youre going to get it back again with uh with premium just like putting money in a bank its forced forced savings   yeah     if uh   yeah   you know living in a house is something youre going to have to do whether you youre doing it alone whether youre doing it with a with a a partner or youre going to have to you know   yeah yeah see im single now and and see i may be going back and getting a PhD   umhum   and i know i cant afford a house if im going to be doing that   you you sound like a young guy and and uh   yeah im im twenty five   all right when i was uh in my early twenty twenty one twenty two years old i was working for a a guy in a gas station   yeah   and he tried to convince me to buy this single family house that he saw for sale and uh   hum   uh the price will sound odd because it was uh you know about thirty years ago but it they wanted uh forty nine hundred dollars for it   wow   and the buying a house was the last thing that i wanted to do   yeah   so i didnt buy it and im sorry now because I i you know i wasted a lot of money uh when youre twenty twenty one twenty two years old you you throw it away you and i wasnt paying rent i was living at home   you wish you did paying it on rent oh well thats the ideal thing   but uh but you know  i was throwing my money away with that on girls cars you know typical things   yeah yeah i had to waste a lot of money on my car that was the biggest mistake i ever bought     you buy a car it depreciates you buy a home and it inpreciates it it it   i know it was the s tupidest thing i why didnt someone tell me that     you you buy a car uh and have it a week and youve lost half of it already   i know i bought a a brand new i bought a Jeep with everything on it   umhum   and it was just i dont know big mistake i dont even use it i rode my bike to class so there   i live uh i live in a a ranch   umhum   uh five rooms upstairs one uh room downstairs a basement full cellar   umhum   uh i ive been painting it white only because uh thats the way it was when i bought it its a white with black shutters on it   hum   uh uh ive got a garage under the house   so where where are you near   uh Boston   outside of Boston   yeah im about thirty five miles south of Boston   oh are you are you near uh i have relatives inlaws that live there   uhhuh where about   what is it Duxbury   uh thats still a good hour ride i guess   north or south of you   im south theyre north of me   okay so youre like at the bottom of Cape Cod   no im not in Cape Cod im uh oh about a you know five minute ride from Rhode Island   oh okay way down there i see i see i was i was up there Christmas my sister got married in Duxbury   and the housing market up here is uh is really slumped so you can buy a houses relatively inexpensive right now   huh Raleigh well uh have you ever do you read uh US News   no i dont   Raleigh was in the top twenty five housing market i mean it was a good place to buy a house but the problem is that the average house cost is really high   what about the tax structure   its i mean its its good to buy a house if you have the money its just that the houses are like   umhum   two hundred to three hundred thousand dollar houses   wow what is the tax structure like up there how much a thousand   im im not really sure to tell you the truth   as my uh   being a renter not even caring about that   you dont care about that huh   no   my uh my taxes exceed my mortgage payment   wow     it wasnt like that when i first   thats like my car where the insurance is almost  you go to the   yeah i can imagine it wasnt like that when i first bought my house uh this gentleman that i was talking to when i did buy my house told me thats what happened to him   hum   and uh this was you know thirty years ago and its happening to me my tax is exceeding my mortgage payment   yeah   im paying a hundred and twenty one dollars a month uh ive got another uh year to pay on my house   hum   and my my uh taxes are a hundred and thirty five     wow that that just doesnt seem to make make any sense why if you have to tax something for something you already own     yeah but theyre going to tax you just like they tax you your automobile theyre going to tax your home   yeah yeah   and then youve got maintenance expenses but the overall cost is is a a lot cheaper now and where youre single nows the time to do it when youre married you know got to have time youre not going to have money youre not going to have   yeah well i did see a house for sale in the area i wanted to move into but i dont know where i could come up with the down payment   what is what the what is the down payments look like now twenty five percent   i dont know i dont know   you didnt even didnt even look huh   i didnt even look uh see im living with two other people so when i when we break five hundred dollars in in three ways   oh it isnt bad   yeah its not bad at all   youre living with three other people   no two other people   two thats still tough     yeah   i cant even live with one           well i dont know i still like being a student i guess   yeah well its its nice to get somebody to help you with the rent and everything but uh at the end of ten years what are you going to have   umhum       nothing   what are you majoring in school   im in computer science actually im uh today i had uh im in a Masters program   oh yeah   and today was my thesis defense and i passed   wow oh i see   so were getting ready for a big party as you can imagine   so youre graduating this year   yeah im going to graduate this semester so actually im going into the uh job market   uhhuh   what i really want to do is pay off my car and then   lots of lots of lots of luck on the job market   yeah   although the computer uh science areas are booming right now but the uh   yeah   the thing thats holding everything back right now is the economy   yeah i i really didnt have any problem i mean i had companies knocking on my door i didnt even like interview they came looking for me   no kidding now thats good   yeah   theyre theyre always looking for a lot of uh good computer people because theres a lot of equipment out there and no one knows how to run it   yeah yeah   i i run a little uh computer business at at my home at night   oh really   yeah im working with uh Texas Instruments home computer   okay   and i do repair work sell software and hardware   hum   uh were supposed to be talking about houses though right  well i run the business in my home   out of your out of your house       yeah thats great     so what kind of a house do you expect to buy when you do buy   uh something on a lake   all right  umhum   or on a body of water this is the ideal house right   yeah right   big garage a big basement just like my parents house except for on the water   huh well maybe some day youll own your parents homes   thats true because i think theyre going to move to Arizona when they get old       my dad is
