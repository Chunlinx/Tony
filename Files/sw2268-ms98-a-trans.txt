          what kind of fishing do you enjoy   well uh normally i like to to go out fishing in a boat and uh rather than like bank fishing and just like you try and catch anything thats swimming because ive had such problems of trying to catch any type of fish that uh i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing   so you like fresh water   uhhuh uhhuh ive never tried like with deep uh sea water fishing   uhhuh   because you get i get sea sick  but one of these days im going hoping theyll have some kind of medicine so i can go out and go uh deep sea fishing now that would be nice   oh i see well i was raised on the Texas Gulf Coast in the summers and during the Christmas holidays wed go down to our house on the coast   have you uh umhum   and so i thought fish came out of the ocean   oh my goodness   and anything that was fresh water was muddy   uhhuh   so i didnt learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties   wow   so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun   umhum umhum oh i bet it is   theres so many different ways to catch fish you know at night you can   umhum   go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that which isnt technically fishing but its a lot of fun   uhhuh   so i i grew up fishing   uhhuh   what area lakes do you like   well uh now i havent done much fishing here in Texas uh because i moved from Ohio   oh i see   uh but uh we did a lot of fishing when we were up there but down here i have a brother that likes to go over on the east in East Texas and do fishing and i cant remember what the name of the lake is and he was just here this past weekend i could have i i think he mentioned it again but i couldnt remember what it was um i want to call it Salt Fork or Lake Fork i i cant remember but he said its one of the best bass fishing places   oh oh oh uh i think i know where uh Lake Caddo or something like that   i you know that may be it that may be it and it   if its supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places they hold tournaments there and everything   yeah yeah yeah and he said that he has never gone anywhere before and hes fished all over the United States in which they can catch the biggest bass that youve ever seen so i would love to go over there they were talking about going over there and some time this spring and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and uh and catch some bass   i would love to do that but they have snakes over there       and im not too welcome around i dont i really dont want to share a boat with a snake   uhhuh uhhuh   i just i i i dont see it   yeah   i just i dont i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something id make some quick arrangements   thats true   and ive heard so many stories about the snakes   uhhuh   you know when they pull in theres a snake instead of a fish and things like that that im just   yeah oh   i dont know whats the largest fish you ever caught   yeah um gosh i think it was only like three and a half pounds and for me thats big thats why im saying i love to go fishing because ive never caught anything really really big um so because its always been you know in the on a lake and uh i know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me   on a lake yeah on a lake on a lake thats not a bad size fish   yeah no thats a good size fish   i i would be impressed i mean you know   yeah yeah so uh but yeah id love to go catch catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing   ive never done that   uhhuh   ive ive seen it uh and and i have no problem going out in a boat uh its just so dreadfully expensive and theres just so many other ways you know when you live down there   yeah   its not a treat   umhum   its what you do every day you know   thats right thats right   uh one of my favorite things was we were forever catching crab and steaming them   yeah   you know out on the on the beach   uhhuh   and you know just uh pitching them out on uh on uh what am i trying to say newspaper   umhum   and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and and thats it   wow uhhuh yeah   and uh the the other little creatures would take care of what was left   thats right thats right   so going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do   right right well do you live like along uh Houston   no   down there   no no i live in Dallas   well i meant when when you were when you were growing up i mean like Galveston   i lived in Dallas   oh okay but you uh   we had a house in Port Aransas   oh okay okay   its a little fishing village that is   thats close to uh South Padre oh Corpus okay   corpus well uh South Padre is on down the bend   okay okay   its like if you drew a line from Austin straight down it would be in that region   umhum umhum   small island   yeah yeah i ive been to Port Aransas but it was when i was a child   uh oh okay   yes because i have relatives who live in Houston so when would go and we would go to Port Aransas or then on down to Corpus or further yeah like what your talking about because i was just wondering we went to Galveston this this summer even with all the oil spills and everything i mean i was   was it bad   oh it was horrible i well never ever go back i dont think uh and yeah and that thats true um   oh i hate to hear that   uh you know the the water was murky and i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there   huhuh   huhuh no i wouldnt want to eat them you know so yeah   no no no you went to Galveston uh i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water   umhum   the uh what is it the Flagship   yes uhhuh   is it still there   it sure is yeah yeah it most certainly is so uh so that it it was it was certain things that were enjoyable about it but uh i dont i think its lost a lot of its appeal   i like that place     that then because of all the oil spills that they have had and uh it always smelled the entire time we were there it was   i didnt realize that had happened for some reason   yeah we went swimming one time in the whole week that we were there and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool       because the water was so awful and   well of course being raised on the water id never swim in it   yeah yeah   huhuh swimming is for swimming   yeah   pool thats why they call them swimming pools   uhhuh uhhuh   thats where you swim you do not swim in the ocean   no no not anymore   no ive seen what comes out of the ocean and i have no desire to share any space with anything like that       but really huge sharks are down there i mean   uhhuh   incredibly large sharks   uhhuh   uh some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night   umhum   it was incredible the size of them that we would see on the the next morning they would have them strung up across the   wow uhhuh   and it you know so if strung up their tails would still hang on the bottom of the  uh just   wow wow yeah now i never knew they were that that big huh   kind of kind of nothing i wont have anything to do with   yeah yeah right well it was nice talking to you   well it certainly was um       maybe you can get  how many have you had very many of these calls   um yeah almost everyday   how wonderful   yeah almost almost every single day from when they started it   how wonderful   yeah   maybe ill be so lucky       okay i enjoyed talking to you   okay  byebye   byebye
