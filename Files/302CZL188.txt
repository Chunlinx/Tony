draw to represent a loons wake come      alive As we look into the sun all is a silvery glitter a captivating      light show with this one color Rounding a bend with the sun now behind      us the show suddenly transforms to green moss yellow sand bluegreen      conifers Next bend back to silver And at every upwelling of currents      interruptive tree trunk or cats paw of wind those silver lines      intensify      Its the quintessential Adirondack scene a favorite of Winslow Homer      But to be on the Raquette in springtime pleases more than the eye You      are also drenched in

heritage      Lonq live Spring Creek Prairie Just outside Lincoln Nebraska      theres a acre tract anyone would love to call home Its called      Spring Creek Prairie and its absolutely beautiful Problem is its acres      of rare tallgrass prairie wetlands springs ponds and pristine creek      and woods are already home to an abundance of wildlife and North      Americas migratory birds Plus Native American artifacts are plentiful      and ruts created by covered wagon traffic on the Oregon Trail are      still clearly visible      To save this precious historical land from developers Audubon worked      with a local bank and purchased this land for preservation In turn      Audubon will apply for a grant so birds and wildlife will continue to      flourish and so that children and adults can come and enjoy this rare      tract in all its natural splendor      In Washingtons Wind River Forest you float above ancient firs and      hemlocks in a construction crane gondola  stories

landowner launched a preemptive strike He simply      clearcut  acres of longleaf pine      There would be no more wood therefore no woodpeckers therefore no      annoying government regulations limiting his property rights just to      protect a bird      Yet even this angry landowner wound up living happily ever after with      the Endangered Species Act Thats because the in genius Safe
