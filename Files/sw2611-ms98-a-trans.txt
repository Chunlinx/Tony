                okay um i was just trying to think about how i how i dress for work you know TI is a very casual atmosphere   uhhuh   and uh what i usually do on the weekend is is lay out five outfits and uh on Monday i i wear the the worst looking one  because it doesnt seem like people are really are you know are that alive on Monday you know so     yeah   and then progressively through the week ill ill wear nicer looking things and then on Friday most everybody wears jeans jeans and sweatshirts or you know jeans and blouses or something like that uh but mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or you know skirts and uh pullover sweaters or uh you know little two piece dress suits suits like but   yeah uh you know thats a good way to approach it ive never thought about um i do plan my clothes a week in advance actually i plan them a month in advance i usually do a month at a time so i dont repeat an outfit   umhum uhhuh   but um ive never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday because really no ones paying attention but anyway um i really i dont work outside of school um i work in the computer lab at school so i can just wear whatever i have on for school and and um and really its i try to dress dress presentable but very comfortable   right   like um in the warm weather its always shorts and a Tshirt or a button up or something like that and then in the winter time its jeans or or pants i usually um you know college is so casual you really dont want to dress up unless you you uh have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that   right like where i work its its pretty casual um   so   its its i guess its more like a a college campus also i mean theres hundreds you know hundreds of people work for TI   yeah   and um a lot of people just just wear jeans and and uh sweats all the time and they dress up like when customers are coming in or uh when we have department meetings or something like that and um       you know a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their the real um higher ups like the the lawyers the TI lawyers and uh   umhum   those that work for the the higher executives those secretaries they uh they really dress up all the time so theres a good combination in the hallways all the time you know   oh well thats good that theyre so casual i mean uh my brother works for TI and hes a computer programmer or computer engineer   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   and um you know whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear uh a tie or a dress shirt everyday but uh he goes to work in his blue jeans Tshirt and tennis shoes and he just loves it   uhhuh and thats very acceptable at TI i believe at IBM they they make you wear a blue suit and uh some kind of colored shirt and a tie   yeah thats what ive heard   uhhuh i would i would hate to be in that atmosphere   but uh i mean they they just moved into the new building he calls it the new building i dont know its where all the executives are   uhhuh   and um and so they were they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans but he just left for Italy today at four   uh oh   and hell be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them   i see   over in TI mean for TI but over in Italy uh   yeah oh TI is everywhere   oh yeah he was so excited about going   uhhuh   but uh he didnt carry any ties or anything because he he just went over there with the that attitude well if i dont take it then they wont make me wear it  because uh he just   thats true thats a good idea   he didnt you know hes not really into all that he would wear it if he had to for his job and all but you know if he had the preference i mean his his preference is um blue jeans and a Tshirt so   uhhuh   but i think thats great about TI and also uh to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the the different designated areas for smokers and stuff i think thats great   the no right yeah and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke smoke area and you dont smoke you almost strangle   oh really do you smoke   because there is so much smoke in the air yeah areas the smoking area you know its closed in and if you dont if you dont smoke and you go in there that everybody that goes in there smokes so its full of smoke when when you go in there   uhhuh i think thats um   i used to smoke a long time ago i used to burn my clothes talking about getting back to clothes  i used to burn my clothes with cigarettes thats one of the reason that i stopped   well um you you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions and uh   yeah she always had uh yeah she always had to have a lot of clothes   see thats how thats how i am but my mama was not raised like that and so   uhhuh no i i wasnt either she my daughter um shes real good at finding sales though you know she she shell buy a lot of she yeah shell buy a lot clothes at the end of seasons you know and uh just have them for the next year   oh me to boy i have to hunt hunt them down uhhuh   and she you know she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and uh buys clothes um when you know when they were coming up i i didnt sew but now ive ive learned how to sew so im well im im still learning how but im getting and im getting much better at it and i   thats great   im going to be able to make my own clothes   i wanted to take a sewing class at school but i just havent fit it into my schedule yet but that i mean that can really benefit   right   um thats something that id be very interested in very interested in learning   right because clothes are some are really expensive you know uh uh a little simple shell shell blouse you know that you can make for about   uh theyre outrageous   say ten dollars at you know at at the most out of a decent fabric   uhhuh   boy runs you like twenty something dollars in the store   yeah its its marked up   just a little shell to go under a suit you know   it is it is really outrageous but uh i mean like whenever i i was growing up and all my mom i never understood this then but i do now but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars or   uhhuh   um or she wouldnt buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that and she always told me it was because i was still growing and she wasnt going to buy me something i was going to grow out of next week   right especially to to pay that kind of money for it   yeah   i have a friend who um she had a she had a baby a little boy and uh she she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus i mean she dressed him   oh no   oh fabulously       and then seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff and she finally learned that you just can not do this you know   umhum   so now she finds the basement sales and just like you know everybody else   thats the best way to shop i mean i always thought my mom was being mean to me but i look back at it now and my child is going to i mean im going to raise mine the same way   right   um i dont know i just ah theyre just so outrageously priced its just incredible i try to uh always catch the sales   yes and yourself right   always   and yeah and you just have to keep buying them you know if you if you if youre not buying the most expensive clothes out there the the quality is really not that great you know for the price that you pay   yeah it it depends on um yeah theres theres always a reason why theyre on sale   right   so that that has a lot to do with it   right   but um   like i bought i bought the most   well   beautiful sweater uh sweater from uh i believe it was Ross Dress For Less and it was it was really pretty it was just you know it was just plain a plain uh round you know round uh necked       uh sweater sweater   uhhuh   and it had uh like it was embellished around the the top you know it had uh leather leather designs and um some other other little things on it and i just thought it was so pretty and i got i got it at a real good price i think maybe it was nine ninety nine or something and it was so pretty   oh thats great   and after i wore it a couple of times i realized why it was   huh oh   why it was it was so cheap there was in the middle of the back of it there was its like there it had been slit and they had like just sewed it back together   oh no   right in the middle of the the back you know wasnt a seam or anything you know   uhhuh   and thats why it was so cheap although its not its not really noticeable         um from the outside but but still its you know its really not not not a good quality       and then i was told by somebody that works for JC Penneys that um Ross Ross is just one of those places that sells sells seconds   the defect   yeah yeah um they dont really buy the first quality they buy the second and uh places like JC Penneys that theyll reject the seconds theyll send them back every time but   uhhuh   places like Ross Dress For Less and uh TJ Max um uhhuh   TJ Max does that yeah we have a TJ Max over here and um
