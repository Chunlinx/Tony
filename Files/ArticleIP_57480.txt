                                 Lessons of the WTO Summit            TheIndian press has grown a little smug since the collapse of the Seattle tradetalks and the victory of the Indian representative in the Miss Worldcompetition in London this weekend The Hindu said Sunday that the big revelation of the World TradeOrganization conference was that perhaps for the first time developingcountries insisted on being heard It also noted an incredibly sloppyorganisation in one of the wealthiest cities in the worlds richest countrywhich it said bordered on the ludicrous Ministers of some of the smallerdeveloping countries were denied entry to halls where closed talks between thelarger countries were on When they did manage to get past security they foundno chairs for them And senior government delegates complained that as thenegotiations stretched early into Friday morning there was no drinking wateravailable either The ambassador of one small developing country told theHindu  Seattle was a lesson in humility to a group of developedcountries which thinks it owns the WTO            In aneditorial Monday about the crowning of Yukta Mookhey  azoology graduate from Mumbai as Miss World  the Times of India said itwas not her achievement alone That India produces such beautyphysical andintellectualis entirely due to the fantastic genetic pool it draws upon andthe cross fertilisation of ideas it swears by the paper said While takingto modernity with great gusto we have made this otherwise terrifying monsterin our own image While other civilisations with their insect originsfumble with such ideas as the timeless and ethereal qualities of a womansbeauty our beginnings attest to these ideals from time immemorial  TheIndian achievement is a combination of lightness and gravitas of bridging thegap between the highbrow and the middlebrow and rediscovering for itself theinextricable link between the body mind and soul The paper contains muchmore in this selfcongratulatory vein            TheFinancial Times ofLondon called the collapse of the WTO talks a disaster and a calamity forwhich the United States and the European Union were mostly to blame The

of the globewith nuclear weapons being decommissioned andUnionists and Nationalists entering into government together in NorthernIrelandwe are in danger of reaching a state of affairs where there is nothingleft to protest An editorial in Australias Sydney Morning Herald Monday said it was the failureamong WTO member states to put the common good above vested interests and notthe street demonstrations that caused the collapse of the conference Toignore this in favour of viewing the resulting impasse as a victory of theforces of light ordinary people or at least their selfappointedrepresentatives over the forces of darkness that is proponents of freetrade is to create a false misleading and ultimately harmful dichotomy thepaper said            TheJerusalem Post saidthe Seattle riots proved that the prediction of the end of history waspremature An editorial in Sundays paper said The ideological struggles ofthe twentieth century may have culminated over the past decade with theunquestionable triumph of capitalism over socialism but that has not meantthat strongand strongly feltdifferences of opinion over what our capitalistfuture will look like do not abound In Japan AsahiShimbun said Sunday that the failure of the talks had damaged thecredibility of the WTO and given the United States a black eye The papersaid it is clear that one of the organizations greatest challenges is toconvince the public of the advantages of freer trade but that the conferencecould not have come at a worse time Washington lacked leadership in paintinga future for the WTO and its conference was void of passion and vision            Following the death afteran attempted robbery in Monaco of billionaire Syrianborn banker Edmond JSafra the Jerusalem Post
