                                 Cold Comforts            Years ago when he wasstill a film critic Paul Schrader wrote an evocative study of the directorsOzu Bresson and Dreyer that he called Transcendental Style in Cinema How odd that the style of Schraders new movie Affliction  is astorturously untranscendent as a work of cinema can get Maybe thats the pointThe tragedy is the protagonists inability to transcend his terribleupbringing Based on a grim novel by the Baron of Bleak Russell Banks and setin a frigid town in northern New Hampshire Affliction tells the storyof Wade Whitehouse Nick Nolte a parttime police officer and fulltimeflunky whos constitutionally unequipped to survive a succession of personaland professional crises Wade cant get on his preadolescent daughterswavelength and compensates by suing his exwife Mary Beth Hurt for custodyThen his mother dies he finds her in bed semifrozen and he ends up caringfor his elderly father James Coburn a stuporous and abusive drunk Grainyhomemovielike flashbacks show Coburn taunting the boy for being a sissy andthen beating him senseless when he tries to fight back            When a wealthy Bostonunion leader is killed in an apparent hunting accident Wade has a hunch thatthe man was murdered Who done it Either the only witness Wades buddy JackJim True or a third partyperhaps at the behest of the towns capitalistoverlord Holmes Osborne Late at night Wade drinks and holds forth on hissuspicions in a low rasp over the phone to his younger brother Rolfe WillemDafoe a Boston academic who subtly feeds the flames of Wades alienation Iget to feeling like a whipped dog says Wade Someday Im gonna biteback            A ffliction is an affectless piece of moviemaking Itfeatures frozen landscapes gray skies mudspattered cars and longprotracted shots of people walking in and out of buildings that seem to haveturned themselves inward to escape the cold Nothing expresses anything Formuch of the film you cant decide whether the murder plot is a product ofWades escalating paranoia or if Schrader is just inept at shaping a whodunitAs it turns out the vagueness and even the infelicities are part of Schradersdesign The film is uncompromising all of a piece its desolateness unleavenedby incidental pleasures Not a whodunnit at all its more like a postmodernwestern the parable of an unruly patriarch driven to madness by a long line ofunruly patriarchs before him an impotent vigilante in search ofsomethinganythingto shoot            Wade lives on the edge ofhis emotionshe has no perspective to retreat to even in a crisis OK I canttake credit for that line Its from Rolfes literary narration which ishelpful in clarifying peoples motives but ultimately annoying since only aninexpert storyteller needs that much pompous clarification It doesnt helpthat the waxen bugeyed Dafoe inhabits a different universe from the otheractors an effect that Schrader intended but that would have worked better withsomeone elseDafoe always acts as if he has beamed down from a Martian theatertroupe He ends up embodying only the movies numbing obviousness            Nolte embodies its volcanic undercurrents and he keepsAffliction off life support Like Wade hes a heavyweight too big andtoo unstable for the room The sagging flesh on that square head encases smallbabyish features and the belching sounds that come out of that barrel chestare like an infants squalls after a thousand shots of bourbon and  timesthat many cigarettes Noltes eyes are slits in dough and his huge gesturesmight be an attempt to compensate for their tininess Part of what Nolteconveys is the struggle of a clay man to convey a lot of elusive thoughtsahopeless prospect that only leads to rage and despair At one point he grabsand twists his face into a Munchian scream Wade it turns out has ahorrendous toothache but Nolte isnt playing the physical pain Hes playingthe metaphorthe toothache as existential agony            Not too many actors could have embodied thistitans dominating father but Coburn is Saturnlike in his awfulness At oncelethargic and vicious he is roused from his decrepitude only by the prospectof inflicting discomfort or pain When Wades girlfriend Margie Sissy Spacekconfronts him about a crude remark he fixes her with a leer while licking saltoff the back of his handa gesture more wolfishly obscene than anything hecould say We know why she packs her bags after that and could have donewithout Dafoes concluding lines about the lives of boys and men beaten bytheir fathers whose capacity for love and hope has been destroyed at birth            Perhaps Id haveresponded more fully to Affliction if it had been in Swedish In moviessuch as Winter Light  we give Ingmar Bergman the benefit of thedoubt because he grew up with  hour nights herring and StrindbergDyspeptic storytelling is in his blood The first time I saw Affliction it struck me as both arid and pretentious the second arriving with nonarrative expectations I found myself more tolerant of the pacing and moredrawn in by the performances If you dont have the luxury of seeing the movietwice youd do well to leave your hopes for a good thriller at thedoorunless the thrill you seek is that of a great gutsy actor on the highwire            Sam Peckinpah might have been fortunate in croaking beforehe could realize his dream of bringing Max Evans postWorld War II westernnovel The HiLo Country to the screen This is another of those Last ofthe Cowboys sagas with the young ranchernarrator Pete falling under thespell of an embodiment of the Old West here a character called Big Boy Healso falls in love with a married woman Mona the embodiment of Sexthe kindof woman who sends men into spasms of uncontrollable lust such that theydkill their good buddies or drink themselves into an early grave When Big Boyand Mona start doing the wild thing Pete finds himself pulled in two differentdirections neither especially interesting Mixed in with this is a lot ofelegiac folderol about herding the oldfashioned way on horseback rather thanin trucks or boxcars            If Peckinpah had made this movie it might have hadsome of the ingratiating rowdiness of his The Ballad of Cable Hogue or Junior Bonner  But Brit Stephen Frears directs in adistanced and selfconsciously classical style He keeps the horizon line atthe center of the frame so that the movies point of view seems static evenwhen the images are gorgeously evocative Its pretty but its all at armslength with an aura of doom that palls our enjoyment of even the pictureswellstaged fisticuffs and bronco busting            As Big Boy WoodyHarrelson is a popeyed cartoon but I admit to finding his hamminessand hispronunciation of such phrases as You scumsuckin dawgshugely entertainingLess companionable is Billy Crudups Pete whose higharched cheekbones areemblems of the movies frozen classicism But what sinks The HiLoCountry is Patricia Arquettes Mona whos supposed to convey sleepysensuality but seems merely to be on Quaaludes Whatever surprises Arquettemight once have had are long gone the only thing mysterious about her is thoselong distracting fangs            Annette Bening on the verge of becoming a major actressbefore she got sucked into Warren Beattys orbit burned up on entry But shesastonishingly vivid in her new film In Dreams  Its a poetic butultimately disappointing stab at expressionistic horror courtesy of NeilJordan  The Crying Game   Bening plays a childrens book authorplagued by dreams of little girls being lured away by a big bad wolf in humanform No student of the genre will be surprised to learn that shes establishedsome kind of psychic link to a serial killer Robert Downey Jr BesidesBening the films chief interest is the unmatched intensity that Jordan bringsto her visions which are both lyrical and ghastly and so frightening thatits hard to imagine how the movie can deliver a demon worthy of them Itcant of course which is the problem with mainstream horror pictures Themore deliriously abstract and unhinged their imagery the more of a clunk thereis when the evil actually materializes and the genre conventions kick in            Bening has one amazingscene In despair she slashes her wrists and ends up in a hospital where sheattempts to explain her bond with the killer to a psychiatrist Stephen Reawith an incongruous New York accent Both haggard and elfin she moves in andout of sanity now distraught with grief now giddy with superior insightSomeone else made her trash her house and scrawl imprecations on the walls butcutting her wrists she says giggling was all her own work Bening plays thescene on a cascade of emotion so that she really seems to be speaking from adifferent world In Dreams betrays her supernatural brilliance The lasthalfhour is like a sance after the ghost has left Everyones at the tablestill trying to get worked up but the spell has been irreparably broken            I want to thank critic Michael Sragow for encouraging me tocatch the commercial flop Babe Pig in the City before the movie endedits nightmarishly brief run in theaters Sragow unfashionably named it thebest film of the year in SF Weekly  You could wait for video but ifyou can find Pig in the City playing anywhere on a big screenan houraway in a strip mall only at  pm in the middle of a blizzardsee itbecause youd have to go back to the silents to find its like visually and nosilent picture could have had this kind of soundtrack Directed by GeorgeMiller the movie is in a different league from its unassuming predecessor Thetalking animals and discombobulated cityscapes are so exquisite that I startedto snivel about  minutes in and more or less kept it up for the next hour anda half This is my candidate for the most overlooked big budget film of thedecade maybe of the century Pearls before swine indeed
