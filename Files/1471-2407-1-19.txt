                    Background        Prostate cancer PCA is the leading cause of death in        the American male over age  according to recent data            To date the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of        this disease including how normal prostate cells become        neoplastic remain unidentified Moreover the treatment        efficacy of this disease remains limited especially when        it recurs A thorough understanding of the neoplastic        process could facilitate earlier detection of the disease        lead to more specific therapies for PCA and ultimately        improve survival        PCA is one of several types of cancers in which IL has        been found or is thought to play a pathophysiological role        Some researchers think IL may play a role in PCA because        of what IL does in other model systems of cancer biology        For example early investigators observed that transfection        of untransformed B cells with a plasmid for constitutive        expression of IL conferred the tumorigenic phenotype on        the cells     IL is a key factor in myeloma        progression and survival      and also in Kaposis        sarcoma a solid tumor     In myeloma the standard        therapy for treatment includes prednisone which acts by        inhibiting IL synthesis Experimental antiIL therapies        for myeloma and Blymphoproliferative disorders have been        shown to be of some use in limited clinical trials                 therefore this is an intenselystudied target        for myeloma therapy        As mentioned above IL is a cytokine that functions as        a necessary growth factor in several cancer types most        studied in multiple myeloma     It is an essential        factor in the development and maintenance of B cell        neoplasms     and likely plays an important role in        many other types of cancer IL signals through a set of        signaling proteins of the JAK and STAT kinase families            The JAK and STAT kinases are activated by        phosphorylation initiated by the homodimerization of the        ILIL receptor complex on the cell surface The major        IL signaling intermediates are JAK and STAT            Homodimerization of the ILreceptor complex induces the        autophosphorylation of JAK The nowactivated JAK        phosphorylates STAT which forms homodimers can cross the        nuclear membrane and function as a transcription factor        inducing various genes including genes involved in the        cellular transformation process            An association between autocrine IL and PCA has been        known for some time      The change in prostate cell        phenotype from paracrine ILstimulated to autocrine        ILstimulated is believed to be a contributing factor in        the progression from benign hyperplasia to neoplasia            IL is also implicated in the development of cancer cell        resistance to chemotherapy in PCA patients      In        other studies a chimeric protein consisting of an        antiIL Ab fused to         Pseudomonas exotoxin was found to        inhibit proliferation of prostate carcinoma cell lines            Exogenous IL activated androgen responsive gene        expression in the absence of androgens in human LNCaP cells            More work is needed to clarify the role of IL in        prostate neoplasia        While there is some evidence suggesting ILmediated        neoplasia in PCA development      a system suitable        for following the transformation of prostate cells during        PCA development remains lacking We chose to use the        NRP and NRP cell lines derived by Danielpour et        al     to examine the question of ILmediated        neoplastic progression via STAT activation The  lines        were derived from the same part of the rat prostate        following treatment in vivo with         N methyl         N nitrosourea The NRP cells are        immortalized but not transformed require several growth        factors for in vitro survival and do not give rise to        tumors in vivo The NRP cells are transformed grow in        the absence of exogenous growth factors and are        tumorigenic         These lines come from        epithelial cells While prostatic epithelium is resistant        to neoplastic transformation it is not resistant to the        development of hyperplasia Studying the neoplastic        transformation events in a cell type inherently resistant        to this type of change can yield much valuable information        about the transformation process in prostate cells                    Materials  Methods                  Cell lines and growth media          The tumorigenic NRP and nontumorigenic

     AG          The tyrphostin protein kinase inhibitor AG was          purchased from Calbiochem It was dissolved in DMSO and          stored at C in singleuse aliquots NRP and          cloned NRP

         temperature Apoptotic cells cells staining with          FITCannexin V were quantified by measuring green          fluorescence in FL on the flow cytometer CellQuest          software was used to acquire and analyze the data          STATView software was used to perform statistical          analyses                            Results                  Determination of the phosphorylation state of STAT          in NRP  NRP cells          We had very preliminary data from a microarray          experiment comparing the RNA of NRP to NRP cells          which indicated that STAT might be overexpressed on          NRP cells relative to NRP cells data not shown          Since STAT is active only when phosphorylated we          decided to confirm these preliminary results by looking          for phosphoSTAT in both cell lines by intracellular          flow cytometry We observed that STAT was constitutively          phosphorylated in NRP but not NRP cells Even          when treated with testosterone as described in Materials          and Methods NRP cells did not exhibit phosphorylated          STAT Figure  These data indicate that the          overexpressed STAT observed in NRP cells in the          gene microarray was putatively active as a transcription          factor since the amount of phosphoSTAT in NRP          cells was increased relative to NRP cells                          IL is produced constitutively by NRP and          NRP cells          In order to determine if IL was the activating          ligand for phosphorylation of STAT we examined IL          expression in untreated NRP and NRP cells by          intracellular flow cytometry While both cell lines made          IL NRP cells displayed a different pattern in          that there was a peak of cells negative for IL Figure           This may have been due to heterogeneity of the          NRP cells since the parental lines had not been          subcloned by us Therefore we derived  clones of          NRP cells by limitdilution cloning and examined          these for level of IL expression We observed that           clones were highlypositive for IL while the rest          expressed little IL thereby accounting for the  peaks          we observed in the parental NRP line Figure                           IL receptor was expressed on the surfaces of          NRP and NRP cells          When we examined NRP and uncloned NRP cells          for expression of the IL receptor we observed that all          NRP cells expressed the IL receptor while the          uncloned NRP cells had a population that apparently          did not express the receptor Figure  In studies          currently underway we are analyzing the  NRP          clones we derived for differences in IL receptor          expression and to see if there is any correlation with          levels of IL expression                          Effect of dexamethasone treatment on NRP and          NRP cells          To examine the role of autocrine IL on NRP and          NRP cells we looked at the effect of dexamethasone          treatment on IL expression on both cell lines and on          high and low ILexpressing clones of NRP cells          Dexamethasone is known to inhibit IL synthesis by          acting at the steroidresponse elements of the IL          promoter  NRP and NRP cells were routinely grown          in the presence of dexamethasone so the effect on          proliferation was not quantified In the following          experiments we used dexamethasonefree medium and also          treated the serum twice with activated charcoal to          remove endogenous steroids stripped serum then added          defined amounts of dexamethasone for carying out the          experiments We observed that dexamethasone treatment of          NRP cells inhibited IL synthesis without affecting          NRP growth as expected In contrast dexamethasone          treatment of NRP cells did not inhibit IL          synthesis instead dexamethasone treatment apparently          enhanced IL production panel B This effect was          observed for high and low ILexpressing clones of          NRP Figure  panels C and D and therefore was          independent of IL production by the cells However          clones expressing low amounts of IL expressed less          enhancement of IL production that clones expressing          high amounts of IL Figure  panels C and D                          Inhibition of JAK induced apoptosis in NRP but          not NRP clones          In continuing our studies on the role of IL in STAT          phosphorylation we used the JAK phosphorylation          inhibitor AG to see if inhibiting JAK          phosphorylation would inhibit survival of NRP or          NRP cells as had been described for LNCaP cells          previously     We examined clones of NRP          selected by amount of IL expression each had  high          ILexpressing clones and  lowILexpressing clones          were used for these experiments Treatment with the JAK          inhibitor for  hrs induced apoptosis measured by          cellular binding of FITCannexin V in NRP but not          NRP clones Table  We detected no effect of the          vehicle DMSO at the highest concentration used Our          data imply that JAKmediated phosphorylation of STAT          was essential for the survival of NRP cells but that          NRP cells did not require activated JAK for          survival regardless of amount of IL produced by the          cell Further experiments are underway to determine if          STAT requires phosphorylation by a different kinase          such as JAK in NRP cells                            Discussion        We observed that STAT was constitutively phosphorylated        in NRP but not NRP cells Figure  Treatment of        NRP cells with testosterone did not increase the level        of phosphorylation in NRP cells data not shown Even        after testosterone treatment STAT was not phosphorylated        in NRP cells data not shown There is evidence that        androgen treatment may increase the survival of PCA cells        through activation of STAT     Further experiments        are underway to test this possibility STAT another        signaling intermediate in the IL pathway has been        observed to be activated in nontumorigenic cells and may        function as a check for STAT phosphorylation a possible        oncogenic event      We are investigating whether or        not STAT is phosphorylated by JAK in NRP cells and        whether STAT phosphorylation is required for the survival        of NRP cells These results would explain why we saw an        effect of AG on NRP cells in the absence of        phosphoSTAT in these cells Table         We looked at the effect of antirat IL Ab on both        NRP or NRP cell growth rate but were unable to        detect an effect using Hthymidine incorporation to        measure proliferation data not shown We think this is        due to failure to reach high enough Ab        commerciallyavailable antirat IL concentrations        necessary to neutralize the IL produced by the NRP        cells highest concentration achieved was only  gml        We are limited in performing Ab studies by the lack of        commerciallyavailable ratspecific reagents However we        are using alternative strategies in more experiments        currently underway to determine the role of IL in STAT        activation to answer this important question in NRP        cells        We found that dexamethasone treatment of NRP cells        inhibited IL synthesis without affecting cell growth In        contrast dexamethasone treatment of NRP cells did not        inhibit IL synthesis instead dexamethasone treatment        eliminated the IL negative peak and enhanced IL        production albeit to a smaller extent in low        ILexpressing clones Figure  panel D Enhancement of        IL production by dexamethasone treatment has been        previously observed in Kaposis sarcoma cells     In        the case of NRP cells the steroidresponsive element        for dexamethasone on the IL promoter may have been        mutated to a form that does not bind steroid receptors        Mutations in the IL promoter region may play a role in        the tumorigenic effects of constitutive IL expression in        prostatic carcinoma cells     Such polymorphisms have        been described for the IL receptor in Kaposis sarcoma        and are believed to play a role in ILmediated        progression of this type of cancer            We observed that inhibition of STAT activation by        treatment with AG which inhibits JAK activation        resulted in apoptosis of NRP but not NRP cells        Table  A possible explanation of the data would be the        use of JAK for phosphorylation of STAT in NRP cells        which would not be inhibited by AG IL receptor        binding activates JAK as well as JAK which in turn        phosphorylates STAT     This in fact has been shown        to be the case for vsrctransformed fibroblasts            Another hypothesis is that STAT activation in NRP        cells is not dependent upon a signaling cascade but is        constitutive possibly due to a mutation not unlike that        contained within the cSTAT plasmid generated by Bromberg        et al     We are investigating in detail the        signaling pathway in NRP and NRP cells to answer        these important questions        The importance of STAT activation via IL in prostatic        cancer development has been suggested by previous        investigators For example IL acting via its receptor        has been shown to activate STAT in LNCaP cells IL given        exogenously since LNCaP cells do not produce IL        resulted in increased growth of the cells concomitant with        activation of STAT     LNCaP cells transfected with a        plasmid conferring constitutive IL expression        demonstrated increased growth relative to untransfected or        shamtransfected cells     However other        investigators have observed that IL treatment of LNCaP        cells reulted in terminal differentiation and inhibition of        growth associated with STAT activation       The        molecular basis for the apparent contradiction is unknown        at this time Continued use of the NRP and NRP cell        lines in parallel experiments should be useful in        elucidating the discrepancies among various        laboratories        It is possible that exogenous or autocrine IL is not        required for constitutive STAT activation in NRP        cells For example viral IL might be incorporated into        the genomes of prostatic carcinomas as has been described        for Kaposi sarcoma          The route of        introduction of the viral IL is believed to be through        previous herpesvirus infection      Another        possibility is that the insertion of the oncogene BRCA        results in the constitutive activation of STAT in NRP        cells as has been described in Du prostate cancer        cells     Du cells do not make IL nor are they        dependent upon it for continued proliferation in vitro        However they were dependent upon STAT activation for        survival as demonstrated by experiments in which        antisense oligomucleotides for STAT were incoporated by        Du cells     We are currently performing similar        experiments to determine if IL is a necessary ligand for        the activation and survival of NRP cells        In summary we have demonstrated that a major difference        between NRP and NRP cells is that NRP cells        overexpress the gene for STAT relative to NRP cells        and untreated NRP cells Furthermore NRP cells        express constitutivelyactivated STAT while NRP cells        do not Moreover we found that while both cell lines        synthesized IL constitutively only the IL production        of NRP cells was inhibited by dexamethasone treatment        Figure  Finally we demonstrated that while both cell        lines expressed the IL receptor on their surfaces the        patterns were different NRP cells had a subpopulation        of cells which did not stain with antiIL receptor Ab        while all the NRP cells stained with Ab to the IL        receptor Although the results presented above give us more        insight into the role of IL in PCA they do not tell us        if constitutive STAT activation is a determining factor in        the change to prostate neoplasia or if antiapoptotic        factors induced by STAT play a role in prostatic        neoplasia                    Conclusions        We have shown that NRP and NRP cells exhibit        fundamental differences in the regulation of IL        production by dexamethasone and in the requirement for        JAKmediated events for survival The tumorigenic line        NRP expressed phosphoSTAT under normal growth        condition while the nontumorigenic line did not These        data indicate a very important role for STAT in conferring        the neoplastic state on prostatic epithelial cells and        point out the future direction of our laboratorys        investigations                    List of
