                                 From Clay to Silicon                        I find as you suggested that computers are having an impact on studentwriting More and more students compose at the keyboard and some are evenbecoming comfortable editing onscreen Students spends lots of time usingcomputers and right now that means theyre writing and reading a lot sinceusing the Web and sending email requires lots of writing and reading            In the bookstore yesterday I was looking over Clifford Stolls new bookattacking computer use in education I havent read the book so I cantsummarize his stance but on one page he was complaining that students spenttoo much time interfacing via computer to the detriment of facetofaceexperience He cites a teenage boy who boasted of spending his entire summervacation online and quotes one yearold girl who insists the only way tomeet boys to is log on I think Stolls probably overestimating how much timeteenagers spend wired though I do see that computer technology often blindsus to the possibilities of using more traditional technologies I remember oncea colleague who came running into my office complaining that his email wasdown and he needed to get some vital information from a colleague severalstates away While we scratched our heads figuring out how he could email hiscolleague from my workstation a third friend came up and suggested Why notuse the telephone We hadnt thought of that            I would argue that all writing is a technology and to emphasize thetechnological aspect of writing I have my students spend an hour writing in anold unfamiliar technology I give each student  ounces of childrens modelingclay a wooden skewer a length of inch dowel and a writing assignmentTheir task is to fashion the clay into a writing surface then do the writingassignment using the clay and the wooden stylus When they are done we talkabout how this was different from the more conventional writing technologiesthey are used to pencil and paper computer few seem to use typewritersanymore As Sam Johnson might have put it writing on clay really concentratesthe mind It forces you to think about elements of writing that have becomemore or less automatic in a more ordinary setting Here are some of things mystudents find You look at writing differently if you have to prepare thesurface Inscribing on clay means you cant use cursive very easily or evenrounded print characters Clays not easy to edit And its not that easy toread the final product You cant put a lot of writing on four ounces of clayand you can really only use one side so you have to make all the space countClay could get heavy if you had to carry around more than a few pages of itAnd clay allows you to play with document design in ways you might not withpencil and paper            Will computer use improve student writing Not necessarily although theressome suggestion that writing a lot does help and students are writing morewith computers than they were before so far as I can tell Its certainlyeasier to revise on a computer Students tend to forget that cut and pasteonce involved literal scissors and glue a laborious process that I used to getme through a dissertation almost  years ago I myself can write for longerstretches using a computer with less physical and psychological strain thanwhen I was using an electric typewriter New writing technologies have theirdownsides inevitably There was a complaint voiced in the New YorkTimes when typewriters were coming into favor in offices that thetypewriter depersonalized the written word since the reader seemed furtherremoved from actual contact with the human element in writing To some extentthis was true but it was also a bit silly since before the typewriter therewas a great emphasis on people developing uniform depersonalized handwritingto ensure legibility The computer allows us to revise true but in thatprocess I see that we lose what I call the archeology of the text the stagesthrough which it passes from first to final draft I used to miss that Now Idont            But heres something to ponder and let it be my farewell to this chatwhich Ive found interesting and hope that the readers over our shoulders didas well The next generation of text processing with computers promisessophisticated voicetotext programs Is the keyboarding of text only atemporary phenomenon then Will we or our children be talking their essaysinto microphones composing peripatetically and out loud like Wordsworthwriting his poems or bosses dictating letters to secretaries in s TVsitcoms I trust that that will still count as writing though I imagine sometechnophobes will insist that it is not writing since the composition will beuntouched by human hands In any case Jesse I leave it to you to have thelast word            BestDennis
