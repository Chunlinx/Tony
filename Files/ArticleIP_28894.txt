                                  Cody Shearer            On Tuesday May  Chris Matthews interviewedKathleen Willey on CNBCs Hardball  the cable program that aspires to beto the Clinton scandals what Nightline was to the Iranian hostage crisisand Robert MacNeils PBS show was to Watergate Casual viewers may have thoughtthey were watching some kind of best of Monicagate retrospectiveisntKathleen Willey awfully  But to conspiracy theorists Flytrap triviabuffs and media creatures for whom the end of the scandal is likely to meanextinction Willeys reemergence yielded a small ambiguous but nonethelesstantalizing tidbit            On Jan  last year shortly before she was totestify in the Paula Jones trial Willey reportedly had a frightening encounterwith a jogger near her house in Richmond Vaa complete stranger whononetheless seemed to know quite a bit about Willeys children her car andher cat Though Willey declined to identify the man on Hardball KennethStarrs office she said had asked her not toMatthews seemed to have apretty good idea who he was Is it someone in the presidents familyfriends He pressed Willey Is it somebody related to Strobe Talbott Is it aShearer            Whats a Shearer youask A Shearer is a member of a semiprominent journalisticpolitical familyconnected to Bill Clinton in a number of ways To hardcore Clintonhatersthese connections are evidence of Clintons true political colorsthesocialdemocratic New Left McGovernite antifreeenterprise Americahatingtendencies he has so brilliantly camouflaged            The Shearers are also the kind of people Republicanmugwumps despise most viscerally privileged socially and professionallyambitious dissenters whose liberalleft politics dont prevent them fromenjoying the prerogatives of membership in the establishment Lloyd Shearerthe patriarch of the clan was for many years the editor of Parademagazine which during the Reagan era interspersed its celebrity profiles andsensible recipes with anxious warnings about the dangers of the nuclear armsrace His son Derek a former professor at Occidental College served inClintons Commerce Department and then as his ambassador to Finland Derek alsocoauthored a book called Economic Democracy  which served as somethingof a manifesto for Tom Hayden when the former SDSer abandoned radicalism forthe California Senate in the early s Worse yet Dereks wife RuthYannatta Goldway was elected mayor of Santa Monica in  on aprorentcontrol ticket To a Southern California Republican this is likesaying she was the president of North Korea Dereks sister Brooke worked onHillary Rodham Clintons staff and is married to Deputy Secretary of StateStrobe Talbott the presidents buddy from his Oxford days long suspected bythe right of being soft on communism But Matthews did not suggest that any ofthese Shearers were stalking Kathleen Willey in a quiet Virginia subdivision ona damp winter morning The Shearer in question he declared was Brookes twinbrother Cody            This is not the first time Cody Shearers name hasfloated to the top of the murky stew of supposition innuendo and sleaze thatpasses for political discourse in America these days Joe Conason who debunksrumors about Clinton and his circle with the same dogged zeal with whichMatthews advances them defended Shearer in a recent Salon columnShearer could not have been Willeys stalker Conason declared because he wasin San Francisco Jan  Three days later flying home to Washington Shearerhappened to bump into his brotherinlaws old boss former Secretary of StateWarren Christopher And as a result of being smeared by Matthews Matt Drudgeand Rush Limbaugh said Conason Shearer had been subject to death threats andother forms of terror The most disturbing instance was the appearance a fewdays after Matthews interview with Willey aired of an armed man on CodyShearers lawn The man who later surrendered turned out to be Pat Buchanansbrother Hank Go figure Matthews has since apologized for mentioningShearers name on the air            For his part Conasondeclined to explain why the bare possibility of Shearers involvement in theharassment of Willey was so gleefully seized upon by Clintons own designatedharassers If Cody Shearer did not exist Richard Mellon Scaife would havegiven someone a grant to invent him Or maybe like Lee Harvey Oswald in DonDeLillos Libra  Shearer is both real and inventeda creature ofmultiple coincidences who seems at the same time to be operating in the serviceof a grand impenetrable design When members of the vast rightwing conspiracytalk about their counterparts in the vast leftwing conspiracy Cody Shearersname is bound to come up sooner or later            Is Shearer a private citizen unfairly sucked into thevortex of public scandal If so the vortex is awfully good at finding him Inpublished reports Shearer is most often described as a journalist or afreelance writer His byline has been rather scarce during most of the Clintonera Through the s he cowrote with Maxwell Glen a syndicated column onpolitics and culture which addressed such motley topics as truckingderegulation and the ill effects of skin magazines on the male libido In the column dug up several embarrassing incidents of drunkenness in the past ofJohn Tower whose nomination to be secretary of defense was derailed byquestions about his alcoholism and sexual irresponsibility            A conspiracy theoristmight infer that in helping to sink Tower Shearer was already acting as thecats paw of a Democratic dirty tricks operationor at least that the Toweraffair whetted his appetite for political dirtdigging and skullduggery In anycase it was Shearer who during the  presidential campaign introduced theworldthrough the unlikely medium of Doonesbury to Brett KimberlinKimberlin you may recall was the convicted bomber habitual liar andallaround sociopath who claimed to have sold drugs to Dan Quayle Was Sheareracting on behalf of the legendary Clinton opposition research outfit whichhad floated damaging rumors during the  primaries about Paul Tsongas healthand Jerry Browns drug use Or was he just an enthusiastic freelancer            A similar question arose during Sen Fred Thompsons longcomprehensive and inconclusive hearings into the Democratic Partys campaign fundraising shenanigans There Shearers name popped up in thecourse of Sen Don Nickles angry questioning of Terry Lenzner the privateinvestigator who would later in the thick of the JonesLewinskyWilleyWhoKnows Who Else matter be accused by Dick Morris among others ofcoordinating efforts to smear and intimidate those women Shearer hadapparently acted as a liaison between Lenzners firm Investigative GroupInternational and the CheyenneArapaho tribe The tribe had donated more than to the Democratic Party hoping according to testimony that theadministration would intervene on its behalf in a dispute over drilling rightson tribal land Lenzner had been retained to uncover compromising links betweenNickleswho opposed the tribes claimsand local oil interests Lenznerwhile he admitted that he had accepted the tribes retainer has denied thatCody Shearer had ever worked for IGIthough the firm did once employ hissister Brooke            Shearers efforts as a freelance political fixerhave not been limited to domestic affairs Much to the embarrassment of hisbrotherinlaw and the consternation of others in the State Department detailshave recently emerged about Shearers efforts in  and  to arrange forBosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to surrender to the International WarCrimes Tribunal in the Hague According to his lawyer Shearer took less than from an associate of Karadzics in France in the fall of  Accountsvary as to what happened next but it appears that Shearer was either duped bythe Serbs or doublecrossed by them Karadzic as the saying goes is still atlarge            Cody Shearer is a manwith many connections able to convince Bosnian Serbs Cheyennes andunintentionally Washington Clintonhaters that he is a player a person whomakes things happen But he may just be a person who things happen to happento a guy with a penchant for pretending to be what others want to believe thathe is Every time he turns up on the sceneand even when as in the case ofKathleen Willey he doesntpeople ask Whats he doing here He probably askshimself
