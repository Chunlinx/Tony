                                 A Novel Predicament                           Please send your questions for publication to prudenceslatecom                                                         DearPrudence                                                      An old and trusted friend Jane who lives inLos Angeles and works in television suggested I send her the manuscript of anovel I wrote because she had a friend who knows an agent who was looking forworks by women about women I sent the manuscript and waited for a responseJane reported to me that her friend loved the book Months passed withoutfurther information This week Jane told me that the woman she gave my book toturns out to be a psycho and she doubts whether this woman even had an agentin mind when she requested my manuscript She apparently had a crush on Janewho says she has since cut off all contact with her                                       My problem is that Iwant my manuscript back and while Jane apologized profusely for the way thingswent she refuses to retrieve it for me saying that the woman wouldmisconstrue this as an overture I hesitate to contact the woman myselfbecause I dont want to get in the middle of a weird situation I also get theimpression that Jane thinks that her being upset supersedes any responsibilityshe has for getting my book back                                       Bruised and Confused in the Big Apple                        Dear Bruise            Guess what Youve beenhad Ditto for Jane As for getting your manuscript back its pretty clearthat Jane isnt going to ask and you dont want to so lets try Prudiesstandby a lawyer letter Surely you have a friend who is an attorney who wouldwrite a formal letter to Psycho With a Crush requesting the return of themanuscript That way Psycho WAC will not have any information about how toreach you merely the address of a law firm Even nut cases usually payattention to letters from lawyers This is your best shot Whether you chooseto continue your friendship with Jane or not is another issue but Prudiewonders why you would let your one and only copy of a manuscript out of yourhands Lets hope this experience has advanced your education from Psycho toKinko            Prudie hopefully                                             DearPru                                                      This is kind of adifferent problem from what Ive seen in your column but here goes I am notyet  and continue to move up in my rather buttonedup company where most ofthe male executives are married to shall we say plain women The girl I amseeing now like the one before her hasand this isnt politically correctamajor pair of hooters You might say this is my type She is very wellspoken has a good job and is not a bimbo by any stretch of the imaginationShe just has these  well anyway theyre attentiongetting What is thebest way to deal with this                                       Junior Exec                        Dear Junior            You and your breastedAmerican girlfriendto be politically correctneed not feel there is anythingwrong with her centerfold figure Prudie would suggest however since you areon your way up the corporate ladder in a buttonedup industry that yourladyfriend not dress them up so that undue attention is directed their wayConservative clothing at businessrelated functions ought to put you both atease            Prudie modestly                                             Prudie                                                      When a person inthe process of seeking your advice reveals rather personal foibles should younot be alerted to the probability that such a person is quite apt to be awhacko weirdo misfit or plain loser Then again such a person could be abright Yale student who is demonstrably adept at putting on advice columnistsI guess my question really is How can you tell whether a letter is sincere orfraudulent                                       REL Shelbume Vt                        Dear RE            You cant tell thoughsome things have the ring of truth and others dont Lets call it instinctPrudie feels sure you would agree that whackos weirdoes misfits or losershave need of adviceas do bright Yale students So whats the problem            Prudie problematically                                             DearPrudence                                                      I need to addressyour answer to the grocery grazer question  should have spoken tothe store manager about the stealing We are trained to handle cases of thissort in the following way We would put a person within sight of the customerwhos stealing without actually confronting her If she hesitates for anythingwe would then ask her if she needed any help  again letting her know she isbeing watched without accusing her of anything Also the security cameraswould be watching the whole time as well This procedure would be repeatedwhenever she is in the store This is designed to make her a littleuncomfortable about stealing from us while at the same time keeping a payingcustomer in the store We cannot take any action without seeing the stealingourselves If we didnt do it this way we would have more lawsuits than wecould handleand lose a bunch of customers besides Neither of these things isgood for business Thank you for listening to me                                       Sincerely                                       WDW                        Dear WD            Prudie and countlessreaders who had something to say about this thank you for the information abouthow store people want to deal with this problem Many people wrote to say theybelieve the woman should have been reported and a few pointed out the hygieneaspect that scoops are there for a reasonhands carry germs If enoughcustomers become familiar with the way stores deal with grocery grazersperhaps these pilferers can be encouraged to cut it out            Prudie gratefully
