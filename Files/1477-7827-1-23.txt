                    Background        As in the majority of mammalian species successful        embryonic development in the pig requires temporally and        spatially specific gene expression essential to placental        and embryonic differentiation during early gestation        Expressing the appropriate transcripts during development        of the pig conceptus is essential for expansion of the        trophoblast and placental attachment to the uterine        surface Prenatal mortality in the pig ranges from  to         by term     the majority of which occurs during        periimplantation conceptus development     The        periimplantation period is the most critical stage of        conceptus development as a rapid morphological        transformation of the trophoblast occurs just prior to        conceptus attachment to the uterine surface     Rapid        transformation of the trophoblast termed trophoblastic        elongation occurs during days  to  of gestation        Trophoblastic elongation is initiated when a conceptus        reaches a  mm sphere and then rapidly transforms into a        long filamentous thread greater than  mm in length        within  hrs     The process of trophoblastic        elongation is characterized by four distinct morphological        stages spherical ovoid tubular and filamentous        Elongation of the conceptus is a shortlived phenomenon        that results from cellular remodeling and migration rather        than through cellular hyperplasia     Secretion of the        conceptus produced maternal recognition signal estrogen        occurs simultaneously with rapid elongation of the        trophoblastic membrane      Conceptus release of        estrogen induces an acute phase response by the endometrium        that alters the uterine environment which may be        unfavorable for less developed littermates             Because the pig has a diffuse epitheliochorial type of        placentation rapid trophoblastic elongation provides an        essential biological function to satisfy the conceptus        necessity for maximal placentaluterine contact to ensure        adequate nutrient exchange throughout gestation            It has been estimated that approximately  genes        must be appropriately expressed for successful        preimplantation and early fetal development     A        number of mRNAs hypothesized to be involved with early        porcine conceptus development have been evaluated Yelich        et al    characterized gene expression for retinoic        acid receptors RAR   and  as well as retinal binding        proteins RBP during early porcine conceptus development        and trophoblast elongation Results indicate expression of        RAR and RBP increase during transition to conceptuses of        filamentous morphology Estrogen receptor has been        localized in the porcine conceptus and its expression        appears to be enhanced during trophoblastic elongation            which follows a pattern similar to aromatase expression                   At present knowledge of genes regulating rapid        trophoblastic elongation in the pig is far from complete        Due to the limited insight on the transcriptional        regulation of this critical developmental process the        objective of the present investigation was to utilize        suppression subtractivehybridization SSH to characterize        and analyze differentially expressed genes during rapid        trophoblastic elongation in the pig Identification and        characterization of gene expression patterns during rapid        trophoblastic elongation in the pig will provide a better        understanding of the events required for successful        implantation and embryonic survival                    Materials and Methods                  Conceptus Collection          Research was conducted in accordance with and approval          by the Oklahoma State Institutional Animal Care and Use          Committee Twentyfive crossbred cyclic gilts were          checked for estrus twice daily in the presence of an          intact boar and naturally mated at the onset of the          second estrus and again  hrs later Gilts were          hysterectomized between day  and  of gestation as          previously described for our laboratory     After          removal of the uterine horns conceptuses from each          uterine horn were flushed into a sterile petri dish with           mL of physiological saline Due to the limited time          frame when conceptuses are in tubular transitional          development  hrs and difficulty in determining when          tubular conceptuses are in the uterus following mating          one uterine horn was removed on day  of gestation in          a subset of gilts Conceptuses were flushed into a          sterile petri dish from the uterine horn and evaluated to          determine an appropriate timedelayed removal of the          second horn corresponding to the predicted time          conceptuses would be in a tubular morphology as described          by Geisert et al     Morphology of conceptuses          collected following flushing from the uterine horns was          recorded and conceptuses of identical morphologies were          transferred to cryogenic vials snapfrozen in liquid          nitrogen and stored at C until extracted for          RNA                          RNA Isolation          Total RNA was extracted from individual conceptuses          and pools of conceptuses of identical morphologies as          previously described in our laboratory     Briefly          conceptuses were denatured for  min on ice using  l          of denaturing

 rpm for  min          at C The aqueous phase was recovered placed in a          sterile tube and  l of Rnaid binding matrix BIO           La Jolla CA was added vortexed briefly and rotated          for  min at C Following rotation the suspension          was centrifuged at  rpm for  min and the aqueous          phase was discarded The remaining pellet containing the          glass beads bound to total RNA was washed three times          using  l of  RNA wash BIO  La Jolla CA and           ethanol solution followed by centrifugation at           rpm for  min at C The pellet was dried at C          for  min and resuspended in  l of nucleasefree H            O The resuspended solution was          heated at C for  min and centrifuged at  rpm          for  min Approximately  l of the aqueous phase          containing the purified total RNA was transferred to a          sterile tube and stored at C Isolated RNA          concentrations were estimated based on absorbance at the           nm wavelength Purity of RNA was determined from the           ratio                          Suppression Subtractive Hybridization          Suppression Subtractive Hybridization was performed          using the Clontech PCRSelect cDNA Subtraction Kit          K Clontech Laboratories Inc Palo Alto CA as          described previously     Forward and reverse          subtractions were conducted for two different comparisons          during trophoblast elongation The first comparison was          made between spherical  mm and tubular  mm          morphologies allowing the isolation of gene products          differentially expressed during the onset of rapid          trophoblastic elongation The second comparison was made          between tubular  mm and filamentous  mm          morphologies encompassing gene expression changes during          the transitional completion when the conceptuses have          began to cover the surface area of the uterine horns          Driver and tester cDNA was produced from  g total RNA          for each morphology of each comparison following the          manufacturers guidelines Briefly synthesized cDNA was          digested with the restriction enzyme Rsa and the tester          cDNA populations were divided into two tubes and ligated          to both adaptor  or adaptor R Prior to ligation at          C overnight  l from each adaptor ligation for each          tester population were combined to serve as an          unsubtracted control and were diluted into  mL sterile          water following ligation The subtractive hybridization          was performed by adding  l driver cDNA to each tube          one containing  l of adaptor  and the other          containing  l adapter Rligated tester cDNA tester          cDNA

Following the first          hybridization the two samples were combined          simultaneously with the excess addition of  l freshly          denatured driver cDNA and hybridization was continued

min and stored at C                          PCR Amplification of Subtracted Products          Two PCR amplifications were performed on the          subtracted and unsubtracted tester products Primary PCR          amplifications were conducted for each tester using          diluted subtracted products following the second          hybridization or the diluted unsubtracted cDNA One

added to           l of secondary PCR master mix containing nested primers           and R to ensure specific amplification of          doublestranded templates containing both adaptors          Secondary PCR was performed at C for  sec C for           sec and C for  min cycle number varied between           and  cycles Primary and secondary PCR products          were analyzed on a  agarose

Continuous fluorescent data acquisition          was collected during final ramp enabling the generation          of the melting curve graph to confirm that detectable          fluorescence was

spherical  mm        to filamentous   mm morphology is required to        establish adequate placenta to uterine contact necessary        for survival     Characterization of the specific        subset of genes regulating periimplantation conceptus        development and trophoblastic elongation in the pig        provides valuable information concerning key developmental        events essential to embryonic survival after trophoblastic        elongation            Previous information regarding genes critical to        development in early pig pregnancy is limited Using        semiquantitative RTPCR Yelich et al    evaluated        periimplantation gene expression profiles for        hydroxylase aromatase brachyury and leukemia        inhibitory factor receptor all of which are more greatly        expressed in filamentous conceptuses Messenger RNA for        retinoic acid receptor  retinal binding protein and        transforming growth factor  is also increased in        filamentous conceptuses     Using a ribonuclease        protection assay Wilson et al    indicated enhanced        cyclooxygenase expression was specific to filamentous        conceptuses An autocrine effect of conceptus estrogen        synthesis has been suggested as filamentous conceptuses        have greater gene expression for estrogen receptor         compared to its spherical and tubular counterparts                   Suppression subtractive hybridization allowed isolation        of candidate genes expected to be differentially expressed        during rapid trophoblastic elongation Differentially        expressed genes identified using SSH striking particular        interest were interleukin IL and        metallopanstimulin MPS both of which are suspected        to be upregulated in the elongated conceptus MPS        expression is notable in proliferating cells and has been        identified as a nuclear protein that binds to DNA            Further analysis indicates cells stimulated with        transforming growth factor  TGF exhibit a fold        increase in MPS gene expression     TGF and its        receptors are localized in the trophectoderm of porcine        conceptuses between days  of gestation     MPS        may have roles in transcriptionalmediation of the        embryonic response to TGF having effects on continued        intrauterine elongation However MPS gene expression        needs to be quantitatively analyzed across the stages of        conceptus development IL was the most predominant clone        sequenced during SSH and was also the most abundant clone        represented when mapping expressed sequence tags derived        from a porcine early embryonic cDNA library in a study by        Smith et al     We have more thoroughly examined and        confirmed IL gene and ligand expression in developing        conceptuses as well as the endometrium Changes in        conceptus IL gene expression and ligand release in the        uterine horn dramatically increase during the process of        elongation Ross and Geisert unpublished results        Increase in IL gene expression was specific to the        conceptus as endometrial expression was unchanged between        cyclic and pregnant gilts Following completion of        conceptus elongation IL gene expression and secretion        rapidly decline and expression levels are more than        fold lower in day  compared to day  filamentous        conceptuses It is possible IL plays an important role        in triggering conceptus elongation and initiating        uterineconceptus crosstalk in the pig        In the present study three transcripts OSUT SAHH        and HSC were confirmed to be differentially expressed        analogous to the pattern predicted using SSH Although no        confirmed identity was found in GenBank the novel gene        OSUT displayed a very dynamic enhancement of gene        expression during trophoblastic elongation When compared        to spherical conceptuses there was almost a fold        increase in mRNA expression for OSUT in tubular        conceptuses while expression in filamentous conceptuses        increased over fold Given the substantial increase in        gene expression and temporal relationship to conceptus        development OSUT may play an important role in        trophoblastic elongation Future studies will attempt to        identify the gene and its translated protein to determine        the biological function during conceptus development        Gene expression of SAHH was similar between spherical        ovoid and tubular conceptuses but there was nearly a        fold increase in gene expression in filamentous        conceptuses SAHH may have significant impact on the        conceptuses ability to use folates during this transitional        stage of development Folates have long been known to be an        essential requirement for developing embryos predominately        during neurulation     Vallet and coworkers           have previously shown the increase in maternal folate        binding protein activity occurs in the uterine lumen of        cyclic and pregnant gilts between days  postestrus        The increase of folate in the uterine lumen is temporally        associated with the increase in conceptus SAHH gene        expression        Sadenosylhomocysteine SAH is the resultant product        following the release of a methyl group from        sadenosylmethionine SAM a universal methyl donor            Methyl donation from SAM has crucial developmental        impacts governing DNA methylation    as well as        methylation of amino acids proteins carbohydrates and        polysaccharides     Sadenosylhomocysteine hydrolase        is the only known enzyme capable of SAH hydrolysis The        breakdown of SAH which is reversible results in the        release of free homocysteine which is converted to        methionine while being used as a substrate for the        reduction of methylenetetrahydrofolate MTHF to        tetrahydrofolate THF Elevated levels of methionine can        then be used in the synthesis of SAM while THF has        downstream effects on uracil to thymidine conversions        involved with DNA repair and synthesis            SAHH functions as a protective enzyme for adenosine        toxicity by preventing nuclear accumulation of SAH           and may explain the nuclear localization of SAHH in cells        that are transcriptionally active in Xenopus embryos            Vanaerts et al    demonstrated that high        concentrations of homocysteine are associated with        embryotoxicity during early gestation in rats These        authors suggest the toxicity may be associated with the        reverse hydrolysis of homocysteine to SAH resulting in the        dramatic reduction of the SAMSAH ratio to a point where        methylation reactions are inhibited Miller and coworkers           have revealed that the lethal nonagouti a x        mutation in mice is characterized by deletion of the SAHH        gene resulting in embryonic death prior to implantation        Addition of an inhibitor to SAHH deazaaristeromycin        inhibits inner cell mass proliferation and differentiation        during in vitro development of nonmutant embryos                   As in other species SAHH is likely a biological        regulator of the SAMSAH ratio controlling the occurrence        of transmethylation reactions to the degree of which they        are necessary for successful porcine conceptus development        Establishment of the maternalfetal interface is extremely        competitive among littermates in early swine gestation        Advanced conceptuses those that elongate first have a        much greater advantage with regards to acquiring ample        placentaluterine contact and also limit the available        uterine capacity for those conceptuses lagging in        development     While gene expression for SAHH was        present at all stages evaluated an approximate fold        increase in relative expression for this transcript over a         hour time period is noteworthy It is possible that        increased expression of SAHH by filamentous conceptuses        serves as a protective function at the level of the nucleus        by reducing SAH to homocysteine thereby maintaining the        SAMSAH ratio at appropriate levels for SAMmediated        transmethylation reactions to occur Increased SAHH        expression by advanced conceptuses suggests there would        also be increased homocysteine released into the uterine        lumen that may have an embryotoxic effect on neighboring        conceptuses lagging in development        Gene expression for HSC was similar in spherical        ovoid and tubular conceptuses followed by a fold        increase in filamentous conceptuses Gene expression        changes for HSC during early development have previously        been associated with neurulation in Xenopus    and        chick    embryos Negative mutations of HSC in the        nervous system of Drosophila larvae resulted in both        developmental defects and lethality     The increased        HSC gene expression during trophoblastic elongation is        temporally associated with neural tube development in pig        conceptuses        Traditionally heat shock proteins are known for their        function during cellular stress as molecular chaperones        responsible for the folding refolding and transport of        newly synthesized proteins HSC is a constituitively        expressed member of the  kDa heatshock protein HSP        family Members of the HSP family have also been proposed        to be involved with HSP chaperones regulating signal        transduction pathways     Unlike HSP HSC does not        exhibit increased gene expression when exposed to heat        stress or other agents such as sodium arsenate in the        gastrula and neurula Xenopus embryo     Tsang           suggested because of their ability to bind and transport        folded and unfolded cellular proteins HSP family        members may function as a crosslinker to couple cellular        proteins to the cytoskeletal matrix Association of HSP        with the cytoskeleton suggests that conceptus produced        HSC may be directly involved with the complex process of        conceptus remodeling during trophoblastic elongation        Through the method of SSH we have detected several        genes that may serve a vital role in differentiation        neurulation as well as attachment and maintainence of        pregnancy in the pig Detection and confirmation of IL        SAHH HSC and OSUT as being differentially expressed        during the period of rapid trophoblastic elongation        contributes important information towards understanding the        mechanisms involved with this essential biological event in        the pig
