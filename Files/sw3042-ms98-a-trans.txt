April showers for June yeah uh i dont know where where it came from but its been really we got a lot of uh   oh i hope they come this way   were in central Texas and it feels like we live in Houston   oh really   yeah its it it you know like it rained today and then it just kind of steamed everything up you know uh its been great because we havent had to use our sprinkler system but its uh   uhhuh     its hard to plan anything outside just because they show up out of nowhere and then theyre gone weve had some with really really high winds that have trashed trees and everything else its just   oh my now see every everyone up here with their gardens theyre not going to have much of a garden this year because its so dry   yeah well i hope you get some of that weve had enough we have had plenty and were still uh forecast for more yeah   yeah really   so   well gee uh does California is California getting rain then   uh im not real sure i think a lot of this is coming out of i think whats happening of its coming out of Canada and its meeting whats coming out of the Gulf   out of the Gulf oh   and its just causing chaos and i mean these are good these are good summer rains you know electrical storms and and all that so its been   yeah   its been uh wet and weve mowed our yard i think   uhhuh   three or four times in the last two or three weeks i mean just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing and   oh my gosh   and one one week it just rained thunderstormed for a day straight and you couldnt get out there you just couldnt get out there by the time you finally got there well your lawn mower wouldnt sink we were you know   uhhuh   yeah lawn mower broke  so     oh well see now we need we could use two days straight of rain   oh   its really drying up up here   well what always works for me is if i water my plants or we wash the car it usually rains if not that night the next day   no no i was telling everyone hang your clothes out on the line and its surely going to rain whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains   yeah yeah yeah um   uhhuh weve had real hot weather   hotter than usual   yeah yeah weve you know and uh let me think i got out of school in May in March i was wearing shorts   wow   i was wearing shorts in March up at college and uh we we what they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring   hum   is what they said what happened   huh i guess that means youre going to get a double long summer   i hope that oh i dont know but i hope it doesnt mean were going to get an early winter   because you surely wouldnt get no i wouldnt think so i wouldnt not as early as it came i mean your talking September maybe thats a little early still the   yeah uhhuh yeah i was wearing shorts in March you know it was nippy but um   uhhuh   like it was still in the seventies   yeah   you know high sixties low seventies in March   yeah yeah we were there we were in New Jersey last October and it was hotter there than it was here it was just like a heat wave and i was like oh i want to go home   uhhuh yeah uhhuh yeah we havent   because uh we had we packed to cool off you know brought short sleeve sweaters and everything and we just died it was really hot so but i like it here i wouldnt i wouldnt trade it for snow any day yeah   oh my gosh huh really see i like i like the snow but i like to watch it fall and i just like it where its deep enough you know but not too deep   right and i can handle a vacation in it and you know but my husband is from New Jersey and he wouldnt go back either he did all the shoveling and everything else he said it was a pain so   really   well is it weird at Christmas time without snow   no i dont think so well see last year we had snow at Christmas time   oh   so it really wasnt it was weird because we had snow  its like wow it actually fell on the right day so uh no its not in fact uh you know were used to running around in         you know Spring clothes in December and so when it throws in a real cool winter we get broken pipes and and all that kind of stuff and because Texas is just just isnt built for you know real cold weather for long periods of time   yeah well its real dry down there you dont have the humidity either do you   no not not where we are now in Houston stuff theyve got it theyve got it where no hair spray works its so humid at times but here its its just about right its its pretty dry and not too dry where you know you just it hurts to breathe but were just about right were just having this all this rain and   uhhuh yeah   late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable made it the humidity real high but no i like it well were right in a good stop because were   yeah muggy huh   you know we get over in the over the hundreds in the summer but its its not its a dry heat and its not really   uhhuh   as hot and muggy as it would be being over hundred plus ninety degree humidity ninety percent humidity   yeah see thats whats bad up here is when we do get the real   so   you know hundred and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it so youre like real mucky and you you know your legs stick together just from walking you know so um   oh yeah yeah i know what so we like it where were at if its not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff   uhhuh yeah   so but no its interesting when it gets really cold here and people forget that theyre live in Texas and they dont know how to drive in snow and you know but uh       i wouldnt trade it for anything  i was born in Texas and i visited other areas and im just a sun person i think gotten used to it   oh thats good   well i dont know well i guess thats really about all   yeah weather is not real hard to talk about  it doesnt last real long either i thought the weather is the last thing you talk about but in this case its the only thing to talk about but well Michelle its great talking to
