                                 Fur Enough            The New York Timesleads with a new poll purporting to show that most Americans now condemn theSenate for its handing of the impeachment trial with Republicans taking mostof the blame The Times also gives prominent topfront play toyesterdays testimony by Vernon Jordan which is the Washington Post lead The Jordan news is according to thePost  no news The only exception is that yesterday Jordan told Houseprosecutor Asa Hutchinson that he now remembers having breakfast with MonicaLewinsky on one occasion something he denied in previous questioning Thiscould be significant explains the paper because Lewinsky also insists that atthat meeting Jordan told her to make sure notes shed drafted to PresidentClinton were not found Jordan still denies that USA Todayleads with a Portland Oregon jurys award of  million to four abortiondoctors it found were threatened by antiabortion activists Wanted postersof abortion providers and by their web site comparing such doctors to Nazi warcriminals The verdict is also the top nonlocal story at the Los AngelesTimes  It is also fronted at the WP but runs inside at theNYT             The NYT says its phone poll of  adults suggests that the publicviews the impeachment process not as an honest investigation of possiblecrimes committed by Bill Clinton but as a Republican drive to undermine himThe paper finds that most Americans think impeachment by the House was adequatepunishment of Clinton that the Senate didnt need to call witnesses to reach adecision and doesnt need to make public the videotaped testimony it decidedto take anyway The paper sums up the popular sentiment thus Enough alreadyThe poll finds that just under half of all Republicans feel the whole thingwill make it harder for Republican candidates to win elections in             The first sentence of the LAT antiabortion web site story mentionsthat the site featured blooddripping fetuses a fact not mentioned byUSAT  Nor by the NYT or the WP  Why the silence            The USAT and LAT stories explain that the judge definedthreat in such a way that the jury could consider the impact on the mentalstate of the plaintiff doctors of nationwide violence aimed against otherdoctors and clinics USAT points out that this definition departs fromthe standard laid down by the Supreme Court in  which limited threat tothose words that produce or are likely to produce imminent lawless actionThe LAT says however that the trial judges approach reflects currentappellate case law The paper effectively sums up the troubling side of thewider definition of threat by quoting one of the defendants lawyers sayingthat under it virtually any document that criticizes an abortionist by nameis threatening I think the effect on political protest will bedevastating            One of the annoying tics of newspaper coverage of jury awards is thetendency to not cover the final money judgement with the same vigor as theinitial sum Therefore its a good start that USAT reports that most ofthe defendants in this case have preemptively gotten rid of their assets andhence that the plaintiffs will probably never collect a cent of the millionsmentioned in the headlines            A frontpage story at USAT and stories inside elsewhere describe whatthe Post calls a Perry Mason moment yesterday at the Microsoft trialLead DOJ trial attorney David Boies got a Microsoft senior VP to admit thatthere was a major inaccuracy in the video the company played in the courtroomin an attempt to show that disengaging MS internet browser from its Windows software makes the latter run slower The inaccuracy Boies said drawing on aframebyframe analysis revealing the continued presence of a browser screentag was that the browser had not actually been removed Later in the dayafter what the Post describes as the VPs frantic phone calls back tocompany HQ he changed his account to say that the software in the video reallydid have the browser removed but that the screen tag usually signifyingbrowser operation had mistakenly not been removed The Wall Street Journal sees the Microsoft defense asreeling and says the VP with the balky video is the third straight companywitness to retreat on the stand from a stakedout position            The LAT reports that the city of Beverly Hills may be about toimplement an unprecedented consumer notification procedure relating to one ofthe towns most cherished substances fur The city council has says thepaper agreed to hold a special election on requiring all local furriers to putwarning tags on their garments that would read This product is made with furfrom animals that may have been killed by electrocution gassing neckbreaking poisoning clubbing stomping or drowning and may have been trappedin steeljaw leghold traps Todays Papers cant help but notice that thisstory includes far more detail about methods of extinguishing life than any ofthe stories about that antiabortion web site
