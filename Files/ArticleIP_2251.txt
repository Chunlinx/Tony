                                 Does Everybody Do It            Campaign finance is anarcane and confusing subject filled with unspoken understandings One of theseis the distinction between rules that must be obeyed and rules that can besafely flouted In the Republican primaries for instance aides to Bob Doleadmitted that they were going to exceed legal limits on how much they couldspend an act commentators compared at the time to running a red lightMeanwhile Bill Clinton and his aides were helping to develop the socalledissue ads produced by state partiesads which in theory werent supposedto be coordinated with his reelection effort And neither party even botheredto claim that the tens of millions being raised in socalled soft moneywhich cannot be legally used for federal elections was being spent on anythingother than the federal election None of these clear violations was deemed tobe especially scandalous even by prudes at places like Common CauseMeanwhile though a Dole supporter named Simon Fireman is confined to hisBoston apartment where he wears an electronic collar and ponders the million fine he must pay for enlisting his employees at Aqua LeisureIndustries a maker of inflatable pool toys in a scheme to contribute to the Dole campaign            A similarinvisible line separates the campaignfinance violations that become majormedia scandals and those that go unmentioned or rate only as footnotes in thepress It is not immediately obvious why reporters are so fascinated by JohnHuangs possible use of his position at the Commerce Department to raise moneyfor his party while they largely ignored the last two secretaries of commerceClintons Ron Brown and George Bushs Robert Mosbacher who were using theentire department as a fundraising vehicle Why is Newt Gingrichs use ofGOPAC to raise undisclosed contributions a scandal being investigated by theHouse Ethics Committee while Republican National Chairman Haley Barboursfront for avoiding disclosure the National Policy Forum rates as anonstory            In fact there is no logic to any of it Whats consideredan outrage and even whats considered a crime are matters determined largelyby accident Advocates of reform are always happy to have a highprofilescandal like the presently unfolding Indogate to help them sensitize thepublic to just how seamy the whole business of campaign financing is The lastthing theyre about to do is explain away the latest revelations as just anexotically textured version of what goes on every day And press coverage islargely driven by how big a fuss is made by members of the oppositionnot byany barometer of relative venality Right now Republicans are making anenormous fuss about the Democrats so the story is huge But we must pause andask Are we making an example out of the DNC for misdeeds that everybodycommits Or did John Huang and James Riadyand perhaps Harold Ickes and BillClintonreally do something unusually bad in the last campaign cycle            Muchhinges of course on facts we dont have Huang may have asked all his Asiancontributors whether they were legal residents of the United States and beenmisled by them Theres no hard evidence that he did DNC business at Commerceor government business after Clinton moved him to the DNC in  Butassuming for purposes of argument that most of what has been alleged byRepublicans is true the Indonesian scandal potentially involves threecategories of wrongdoing  accepting illegal contributions  trading favorsfor contributions and  misusing a government position to raise campaignmoney Actually there is a fourth questionwhether Huang violated federalconflictofinterest rules by dealing with his old company theIndonesianbased Lippo conglomerate while he was a midlevel official at theCommerce Department But thats a matter of personal corruption unrelated tothe Democratic Party financing so I wont dwell on it here even though itspotentially the most serious charge against Huang                           Question  The DNC has now returnednearly half of the  million in soft money raised by Huang from Indonesianand other AsianAmerican sources Assuming that these contributions wereillegal because the contributors werent legal residents something that hasbeen fully established only in the case of one  Korean contributiondid Huang and the DNC do anything out of the ordinary                            Answer Notreally                        There areexamples beyond number of simply illegal contributions that the press andpublic just shrugged off Even Pat Robertson got busted in  for the use ofa Christian Broadcasting Network planehis travels were valued at  Ifone focuses on the narrow category of contributions that are illegal becausethey come from foreigners even though it is arguably no worse than any othercategory of violation there is still little novelty to the Huang affairFederal Election Commission files disclose many examples of money takenillegally from foreign nationals Japanese interests contributing to candidatesin local races in Hawaii South Americans giving to the Democratic Party ofFlorida and so on Just a few weeks ago the RNC returned  to aCanadian company called Methanex after the contribution was disclosed inRoll Call  s recent  million contribution to the CaliforniaRepublican Party may fall into this category as well The same goes forcontributions that are illegal by virtue of their having been made in the nameof another an issue that has surfaced in connection with Al Gores Buddhisttemple fundraiser The FEC has frequently disallowed contributions made toboth parties under aliases            If the Huang case is novel it would have to be as adeliberate and systematic violation of the laws regarding contributions bynoncitizens In terms of being systematic there isnt much of a case Bothparties have employed ethnic fundraisersJewish Korean Greek Chineseformany years Newt Gingrich held a Sikh fundraising event last year inCalifornia in  was Yung Soo Yoo who makes John Huang look like a pikerwhen it come to sleaze One of the cochairs of AsianAmericans for Bob Dolewas California Rep Jay Kim who is under investigation by the FEC for takingillegal contributions from four Korean companies            According to those withexperience in fund raising it is often a delicate matter to establish whetherethnic donors are eligible to give When someone offers to write you a checkfor  you do not ask to see a green card The reality that neither partyis in the habit of investigating its donors is illustrated by variousoutrageous incidents In  for example Republicans got contributionstotaling  from a JapaneseAmerican with Hong Kong connections namedMichael Kojima No one bothered to ask where Kojima a failed restaurateur withexwives suing him for nonsupport got the money Ironically enough hisbiggest creditor turns out to have been the Lippo Bank of Los Angeles where heowed             Huang wasnot really an innovator he was simply more successful than his predecessors inboth parties in tapping ethnic subcultures for cash What Huangs higherups atthe DNC can most be faulted for is not following suspicions they should havehad about the huge sums he was reeling in Instead they looked the other wayIn  the DNC abandoned its own procedure for vetting contributions forlegality We dont know exactly why this happened but its a good bet that ithad something to do with the pressure coming from the White House to raiseextraordinary amounts of money for the upcoming  race The culture offundraising rewards quantity not care It discourages close scrutiny and toomany questions The less you ask the more you get And given that there hasbeen no real enforcement of these rules in the past fundraisers havent losta lot of sleep about contributions turning out to be tainted If the money goesbad you simply return it with the appropriate regretful noises                           Question  Is the Lippo scandal anegregious example of a political quid pro quo                                       Answer Definitelynot                        Examples of favors inexchanges for campaign contributions are plentiful Consider for instance therelationship between Bob Dole and Chiquita In  Dole introducedlegislation to impose trade sanctions on Colombia Ecuador and Costa Ricabutnot Honduras where Doles favorite bananas are grown Why was a senator fromKansas so interested in bananas It might have had something to do withChiquita giving  to the Republican Party in the last campaign cycle orthe generous offer by its CEO Carl Lindner to let Dole use the company jetSen Dole has taken this position because it is right for America Dolespokeswoman Christina Martin said earlier this year To suggest any otherreason is totally absurd Or there is the relationship between             This kindof treatment for big contributors is quite routine In the Indonesia casehowever there is as yet no evidence that President Clinton did anything abouthis backer James Riadys concerns over trade with China and Indonesia beyondlistening to them Nor is there likely to be any evidence Big foreignpolicydecisions simply arent susceptible to personal favoritism the way EPAregulations are                           Question  Did John Huang break new groundin exploiting his government office for campaignfundraising purposes                                       Answer No                        The honor here actually goesto Robert Mosbacher George Bushs secretary of commerce As Bushs campaignchairman in  Mosbacher invented the Team a designation for the corporate contributors who gave  or more in soft money to the RNC WhenMosbacher became secretary of commerce members of the team were rewarded invarious ways including being invited by Mosbacher on trade missions around theworld and often being given ambassadorships Thats part of what the systemhas been like for  years Mosbacher said when questioned about it at thetimea judgment the press apparently agreed with Mosbachers last act ascommerce secretary was a tour of  cities to meet with business executivesabout how he could help them with exports When he left the department shortlythereafter to run Bushs reelection campaign he turned to the same executivesfor contributions            In his ownuse of the Commerce Department to dun corporations for campaign funds RonBrown was Mosbachers disciple though he proved to be an even greater talentthan his master As chairman of the DNC in the period leading up to the election Brown followed the path laid by Tony Coehlo the infamous chairman ofthe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Coehlo as documented inBrooks Jacksons Honest Graft  was the first to try to compete with theRepublicans for corporate soft money Brown devised for the DNC a ManagingDirector program to match Mosbachers Republican Team             When Brown became secretary of commerce in the managing directors were not forgotten Fifteen DNC staff members wentwith him to Commerce and they knew who the new administrations friends wereOne of those who went with Brown was Melissa Moss who took over the Office ofBusiness Liaison at Commerce This was the office that selected participantsfor the highprofile trade missions to such places as China and Indonesiawhich became the focus of Browns career at Commerce On these trips Brownfunctioned as a personal trade representative for companies like Boeing andATT According to an article in the Wall Street Journal by areporter who went along on Browns China trip seats on his plane wereessentially sold off in exchange for softmoney contributions            JohnHuang was merely a cog in this machine When he left the Lippo Group in Huang became a deputy assistant secretary in the International TradeAdministration the section of the Commerce Department that handles tradeissues Under oath Huang has claimed he had only a passive role in theforeign trade missionswhatever that means It all  But thats the CommerceDepartment Mosbacher created and which Brown perfected To present the Huangstory as something new reflecting the uniquely severe moral failings ofWilliam Jefferson Clinton is absurd            So if in fact both parties are equally implicated in allthe categories of campaignfinancing sleaze raised by the Lippo case why isthe Indogate scandal such a big story There are three reasons reformersreporters and Republicans Reformers are happy to have any good example toillustrate the evils of the system Reporters are trying to compensate forsuggestions that they are biased in favor of the Democrats And Republicanswho have been the black hats of the campaign business since Watergate areseizing an opportunity to finally turn the tables            The Republican outrage may behypocritical but in another sense it is sincere GOP leaders are furious atlosing an advantage in corporate fund raising that dates back  years to theelection of  when William McKinleys legendary money man Mark Hannamobilized American business to stop the Democratic populist William JenningsBryan In the s the Republican advantage in total donations was still ashigh as  and never less than  In the  election cycle however RonBrown whittled it down to  thanks to corporate contributions In  theDemocrats nearly caught up in the chief corporate category soft money Withthe help of Huang and others they raised  million this yearalmost asmuch as the Republicans  million The way they did it was simpleimitation
