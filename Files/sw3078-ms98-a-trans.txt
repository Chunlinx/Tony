        okay well what do you think   it um im trying to remember exactly how the question was worded what what   womens roles and how theyve changed   change in the last generation or two   yeah     well one thing and i dont know how how long a span a generation is considered whether were talking you know twenty years or or or whatever but it seems to me there are more and more women   yeah   its obvious there are more and more women working outside the home some of them of course are finally climbing corporate ladders uh whereas when i was growing up it was either secretary or teacher   oh yeah uhhuh oh really are you working outside the home   yes i work at TI   oh okay yeah but i still notice a lot of not necessarily prejudice but i work with a um some men that are very chauvinistic still   so do i   yeah it is its its very hard to deal with because i mean they know that it offends me what the way they act but they do it anyway so i dont know though its really weird because my i came from a very my family has a lot of strong willed women in it and so ive ive never really you know nobody ever said well you could only be a secretary or a nurse to me i mean you know my my parents were very strong and said you can do whatever you want to do so i got really lucky there but its real funny i have a niece and a nephew now and my nephew is   right   seven years old and something was said about my niece being a doctor and he said well she cant be a doctor she can only be a nurse  i thought golly youre seven years old and youre already opinionated     well and probably probably he hasnt seen any female doctors   well yeah thats the only thing i could figure because im im sure that he didnt get that from my my mother or his mother   probably not but but on if he watches television if he gets a coloring book the doctor is is frequently   yeah   uh she portrayed as a male and the nurse well im just im just thinking of pictures that ive seen and and you know uh uh i i suspect no no message was ever intended to be while what you have to be this gender   oh really yeah   to do this job but it does sometimes come through and when i said um that   yeah   that those were the only two professions folks seemed to do it wasnt necessarily that that was what i was told to do or or whatever it simply thats what i observed growing up was   yeah   um about the only women you know it a woman at that time could uh clerk in a grocery store or any other kind of store   uhhuh be a teacher   yeah and i went into teaching that was uh what i had started out doing early on   uhhuh   and left that when i decided to get married and leave Texas for a while   oh really   so and ive never gone back to it in the last in the intervening nineteen years its just uh i i love to teach i dont want to have to deal with the discipline problems and so forth so thats a whole another story   right yeah yeah my daddy was a that was his i guess second profession he was a teacher   uh okay undying admiration comes from me thats thats for sure   huh well thats neat well um it was real funny i went to a seminar that was just it was is a satellite seminar it was really neat and it was just for women   uhhuh   and they talked about the Cindrella Cinderella syndrome and i had never heard about that had you   uh uh not by that term anyway   well its about how women or not necessarily women but little girls are taught that your prince will come and hell do everything and hell make everything right   oh   and um it was really neat because she totally reworked this the story about Cinderella um networked her way to this ball and then  it was really neat it was great the way she turned the story around and said you know she left her calling card in the form of a glass slipper and     very interesting very creative   yeah it was really neat but you know i i hadnt even thought about about fairy tales that they really do leave that impression im sure with a lot of little girls   well i hadnt thought about it but but very likely i went to a seminar a conference just uh Friday afternoon uh that was put on by by TI but it it dealt with um the minority issues of promotion within the business   oh really   and they had had invited three speakers from uh one from Xerox and one from Pepsico and and another company out of Denver and the these gentlemen were all uh VP or higher were were from minorities but in addition they were also addressing um women or including women in in the entire focus of   right huh   the minority issues and so uh it was a very interesting discussion in the afternoon uh the questions and so forth that that their  three uh uh speeches engendered uh just talking about well how how does your company deal with this and and and so forth and it was refreshing to hear that uh companies are beginning to address the issue of of uh   yeah   so few women beyond a certain level so few in the board room and and so forth and so they they shared some of the ideas they their companies were had uh instituted as far as uh uh   yeah uhhuh   giving a leg up mentoring processes and so forth that they had in place   right well thats neat   and then one of our VPs shared what what are some of the things that TI is doing to um come up with some similar results   yeah huh well thats neat   im beginning to find more and more female engineers   yeah oh really   although not um not many of them yet have moved into manager positions thatll part of thats because so many of them are are still real young and theyve got to learn the business first and then they can move up   uhhuh yeah right well i work in a computer industry also and um ive found very few women that are higher up in the MIS departments   um   i i can only think of one out of all the people that ive talked to so its its amazing that yeah theyre out there but theyre just slowly moving their way up but hopefully it will all happen and by the time my little niece gets up there she can  yeah   she can pick whatever she wants to be and if she would like to be the traditional Cinderella and find that prince thats okay too but there   right oh yeah yeah i dont want here to be neglected of anything like that but   yeah but there are other options that are available   oh yeah well um i lost my train of thought  no thats okay um well ive lost it   im sorry   hum oh well um yeah its its uh i think its gotten a lot better over the years but like i said i i felt very fortunate that i grew up around strong willed women anyway   uhhuh   so because i i some of the women that i have worked with are so wimpy that you can understand why men get frustrated with them
