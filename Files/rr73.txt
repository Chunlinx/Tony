                    Introduction        Threedimensional D collagen gel culture has been        used as an         in vitro model of         in vivo tissue contraction a common        feature of fibrosis as well as the resolution of        granulation tissue that characterizes repair           Shortterm cocultures of monocytes with fibroblasts result        in the inhibition of collagen gel contraction   while        cocultures of fibroblasts with neutrophils or with        neutrophil elastase NE augment contraction          Results in the linked study   demonstrated that D        collagen gel contraction was augmented in extended        cocultures of fibroblasts and monocytes Since MMPs play a        prominent role in connective tissue degradation            the current study an extension of this linked study was        designed to explore the potential role of MMPs in this        process                    Materials and methods                  Cells and cultures          See Supplementary material                          Preparation of collagen gels for threedimensional          coculture          Collagen gels were prepared as described previously            For longterm coculture the medium was changed          every  days The areas of floating gels were measured          using an image analyzer          To investigate the effect of PGE            on collagen degradation          indomethacin  M or PGE             M was added to the          medium                          Gelatinase activity assay          Gelatin zymography was performed by modification of a          previously published procedure to identify MMPs  and                                       Immunoblot analysis of metalloproteinases          To further identify the MMPs produced immunoblots for          MMPs  and  were performed                            Results                  Effect of coculture on gelatinase activity          As shown in Figures and  fibroblasts alone          routinely released primarily MMP into their surrounding          medium as identified at the molecular weights of  kDa          latent form and  kDa active form Fig  Over           days elastase appeared to partially convert some of the          latent  kDa form to the  kDa form With increasing          incubation time MMP present in culture medium          gradually decreased Even at day  however there was          readily detectable MMP consistent with ongoing release          Fig a Coculture of monocytes and fibroblasts          increased both bands of MMP and resulted in more of the           kDa form Fig b Coculture of fibroblasts with          monocytes also induced the release of MMP Fig b          which was present as the latent  kDa form Addition of          elastase nearly completely converted the latent  kDa          MMP to the active  kDa form With increasing culture          time the amount of detectable MMP in cocultures          decreased In contrast to the cocultures monocytes          cultured alone released no gelatinolytic activity data          not shown          Neutrophil elastase NE augmented and PGE            inhibited the conversion of  kDa          MMP to the  kDa form in fibroblasts cultured alone          Fig a In cocultures indomethacin resulted in a          marked increase of conversion of MMP from the  kDa to          the  kDa form most readily observed in the absence of          NE where conversion was minimal Fig b The addition          of exogenous PGE            decreased the conversion of MMP to          the  kDa form MMP Neither indomethacin nor PGE            induced release of gelatinase          activity in monocytes cultured alone data not          shown                          Effect of coculture on MMP          No detectable MMP was observed in cultures of          monocytes Fig  In fibroblasts alone a trace of          MMP was occasionally detectable In cocultures of          monocytes and fibroblasts however there was marked          induction of MMP which was present at a size          corresponding to the latent  kDa form Fig  The          detectable MMP in cocultures was maximal at earlier          times decreasing with increase cultured time and          becoming undetectable by  days Fig  The presence          of neutrophil elastase for the first  days converted          latent MMP to active  kDa and  kDa forms          Indomethacin augmented the induction of MMP in          coculture Fig           In contrast PGE            reduced the amount of total MMP          and decreased the conversion of the  kDa form to the          lower molecular weight forms in the presence of elastase          Neither indomethacin nor PGE            had an effect on MMP in cultures          of monocytes or fibroblasts alone                          Effect of coculture on MMP          Neither fibroblasts nor monocytes alone released          detectable MMP Fig  In cocultures of monocytes          and fibroblasts however MMP release was readily          detected in a size corresponding to the latent  kDa          form Fig  MMP release was greatest at the earliest          time points evaluated and decreased with time becoming          undetectable by  days of culture Addition of NE for          the first  days resulted in conversion of the  kDa          form to active  and  kDa forms          Indomethacin augmented the induction of MMP while          PGE            reduced the conversion of MMP to          lower molecular weight forms Fig  Neither          indomethacin nor PGE had an effect on MMP on          fibroblasts or monocytes cultured alone                            Discussion        In pulmonary emphysema various inflammatory mediators        have been suggested to cause tissue destruction and loss of        structure      Several lines of evidence        support the concept that neutrophil elastase contributes to        the pathogenesis of emphysema    Evidence including        the marked expansion of macrophage numbers in smokers        lungs and in studies from genetically altered mice also        supports a role for macrophagederived proteases in        emphysema    These concepts are not exclusive and        it is possible that several proteolytic and inflammatory        mechanisms contribute to the development of emphysema        In the linked study   extended cocultures of        fibroblasts and monocytes augmented collagen gel        contraction and degraded the extracellular matrix NE added        to cocultures resulted in a concentrationdependent        degradation of collagen The current study suggests that        this increased degradation of extracellular collagen may be        due to NE activation of latent MMPs induced in the        coculture conditions        NE has been demonstrated to result in the augmentation        of contraction   It also has been suggested to play an        important role in the development of emphysema In animals        instillation of NE can result in the development of        pulmonary emphysema   Individuals deficient in         protease inhibitor moreover have an increased        susceptibility to the development of emphysema            The current study suggests the possibility that NE can        collaborate with MMPs leading to the degradation of        extracellular matrix        The MMPs are a family of proteolytic enzymes           Most are released as latent precursors Proteolytic        cleavage of the latent forms can result in generation of        active proteases    The MMPs differ both in their        substrate specificity and in their mechanisms of        activation Since some members of the MMP family are        capable of activating other members    it is likely        that proteolytic cascades may regulate MMP activity A        further degree of regulation of MMP activity is afforded by        the family of inhibitors tissue inhibitors of        metalloproteinases TIMPs          Recent studies in genetically altered mice have        suggested an important role for multiple proteases in the        development of emphysema Mice deficient in MMP MMP        or NE are resistant to the development of emphysema or skin        blisters    Mice overexpressing collagenase        however develop emphysema   The current study        proposes a possible collaboration among proteases that is        responsible for the tissue degradation associated with the        disease        According to results from this study several proteases        are induced in cocultures and activated in the presence of        NE It is likely that other proteolytic enzymes may also        play a role beyond those evaluated in the current study In        this context fibroblasts are known to express cell surface        proteases which may have a major role in regulating the        activity of other mediators in the extracellular milieu            It is of interest that PGE          appears to be able to regulate the        protease activity responsible for extracellular matrix        degradation        It is unlikely that PGE          functions directly as a protease        inhibitor It seems more plausible that PGE          regulates proteolytic activity by        altering the production of antiproteases or by altering        the production of components essential in the proteolytic        cascade leading to collagen degradation   The sequence        of proteolytic events by which NE leads to collagen        degradation is incompletely defined PGE           however could potentially modulate        the proteolytic cascade resulting in collagen degradation        at a number of steps Both PGE          and a cascade of proteolytic events        that lead to extracellular matrix degradation have the        potential for serving as paracrine regulators Such a means        of regulation may be particularly important in tissue        remodeling It seems unlikely that tissue remodeling is        accomplished by individually active fibroblasts Rather        coordinated activity within a tissue would seem to be a        more appropriate means to accomplish alteration in tissue        structure Paracrine regulation would seem to be ideally        suited to accomplish such an effect                    Conclusion        This study demonstrates that monocytes and fibroblasts        in coculture can release MMPs and degrade extracellular        matrix Activation of MMPs by NE can augment this process        PGE          can modulate this proteolytic cascade        These data support a role for collaborative interaction        among inflammatory mediators leading to tissue destruction        in diseases such as emphysema                    Abbreviations        D  threedimensional MMP  matrix metalloproteinase        NE  neutrophil elastase PGE
