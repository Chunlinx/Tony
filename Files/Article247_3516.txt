                                 Idiots and Their Boats            Chatterbox is grateful to the many people who wrote in to share personalstories and their views about methodological challenges as a way to helpChatterbox figure out whether vacations are more dangerous than work life andhanging around the house To view most of the comments scroll down to thebottom of this item and click on the

genuinely thoughtful or informative but a recent                   Slate               redesign makes it easier to zoom through to the good stuff            As several people noted the percentages Chatterbox cited in his previousitem Do Vacations Kill overstate some vacation dangers in the sensethat say the higher incidence of drowning                deaths compared withfalling                deaths reflects the much greater number of people whoswim as compared with the number who climb mountains Similarly the recentincrease in the number of amusement park deaths may show not thatamusement parks are more dangerous than they used to be but that more peoplego to them though if more people are spending vacation time at amusementparks  as compared with say spending them at art museums  that maybe making their vacations more dangerous in the aggregate On the other handseveral other people noted given that people spend a lot moretime at work than they do on vacation  on a perhour basisvacation dangers may be understated by the data in the previousitem            Given these difficulties Chatterbox still feels unequal to the task ofproving that vacations either are or arent more dangerous than ordinary lifePerhaps inspiration will strike later this week But that doesnt meanChatterbox is done with the topic of vacation dangers Today he turns hisattention to the ways boats can kill you            We take for our text Boating Statistics by the US Coast Guard whose expertiseon these matters is unmatched According to the report  to  people dieevery year in boatrelated fatalities which significantly do not includedrownings and other waterrelated deaths by people who go out on boats unlessthe boat itself is somehow responsibleas would be the case for instance ifsomeone died from falling off a boat rather than dying during adeliberately planned swim or scuba dive though if during a deliberatelyplanned swim or scuba dive someone were struck by a boat propeller and killedthat would count as a boatrelated fatality In   the numberwho died in boatrelated fatalities was   That comes out to deaths per  boats this is approximate the Coast Guarddoesnt have data on every single boat in the United States During theprevious decade the fatality rate varied from about  to about  deaths per boats  even as the number of boats counted by the Coast Guard rosefrom about  million to about  million The worst year was  when there were  boatrelated fatalities  or  fatalities per boats  But if  was a notbad year relatively speakingfor boatrelated deaths  it was a terrible year relatively speakingfor boatrelated injuries                there were   a recordhigh                           Eightytwo percent of s boatrelated fatalities occurred onboats shorter than  feet in length More than half of these occurredon boats less than  feet in length Forty percent ofboatrelated fatalities occurred when someone who did not own the boat wasoperating it Open motor boats were responsible for the vast majority ofboatingrelated fatalities  with canoes and kayaks rankinga very distant second  Open motor boats were also responsible for thevast majority of boatrelated hospital admissions  with cabinmotorboats ranking a distant second and canoes and kayaksranking an evenmore distant sixth presumably if you get into a seriousaccident on a kayak or canoe its more difficult to get yourselfto a hospital             A shockingly high proportion of boating accidents percent involve alcohol  and given peoples incentive to lie aboutsuch things and the difficulty of administering breathalyzer tests under suchcircumstances this statistic surely understates the problem According to theCoast Guard a boat operator with a blood alcohol concentration above percent is more than  times more likely to be killed in a boating accident asa boat operator with a blood alcohol concentration of zero According toJeffrey Hadley a research associate at the Johns Hopkins School of PublicHealths Center for Injury Research and Policy an unbelievably highproportion of people who kill themselves on boats are malebased on hisresearch in Maryland its something like  percent That should be evidentnot only by the high correlation between accidents and alcohol consumption butalso by the other major factors causing boat accidentsexcessive speedcareless or reckless operation inattention to whats looming up aheadinexperience By comparison equipment failure registers hardly at allThese are guys who get drunk and behave in stupid ways that arecharacteristically though of course not exclusively male            Apologia Aug  Readers of an earlier version of this item may have beenpuzzled by its erroneous assertion that the number of boats in the UnitedStates as counted by the Coast Guard rose from about  to about between  and  That should have readand now doesreadabout  million to about  million Sorry for the mistake
