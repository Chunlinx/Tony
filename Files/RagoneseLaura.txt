                     Um         Hi Im Laura Ragonese and Im currently living in Huntersville NC         Ive been there for about two and a half years but I grew up in a small town in Connecticut and I basically came down here um just first for the University but then I landed a job so Ive been staying here working         Um and I happened upon Charlotte and Huntersville area just on the Internet         I was looking for a city down south and I kind of wanted an idea as to something new something upcoming and from what I understand Charlotte is a quite growing city         So it seemed like a really good place to come to and so far I really like it         Um Im going to tell you a story about a trip I took with my sisters         Um I have four sisters and were all about a year and a half apart and were going to visit my grandmother who lives in Cape Coral in Florida         So I think it was maybe four years ago four four or five years ago and um we left actually just three of my sisters and I went         And um we left Connecticut and we were driving down we were driving in my sister Dianes um Ford Escort which shed had for about a year and a half and uh we were driving and everything anticipating good weather and I think we were just about right outside of Savannah GA and I was driving the car and her car is standard and um the clutch went out on the car         So I was driving and I said to my sister Diane Di I dont think I think something is wrong with the clutch I said Because it seems to be on the floor meaning it it wasnt didnt feel like it was connected         And I um she said Pull off the side of the road so I pulled off into this um I guess it was like a rest stop         But there werent any pay phones a lot of truckers few people whatever so we stopped and definitely the clutch was broken         So my sister has a CB and so we tried to radio some people that didnt work         This woman came through with a cell phone so we called for help and this         honkytonk kind of guy         I dont know where he was from he was operating basically his machine shop or his repair shop right out of this truck         He didnt have a license plate on his truck                  He didnt have a decal saying where he worked or anything         So it was kind of shady         But so it was about three or four oclock anyway so we sat on the curb and waited for this guy         He comes first and assesses the situation and said I think that your clutch cable snapped and its not really a big deal we can rig it up so you guys can get to where you got to go you just have to get it fixed         So fine so he leaves         And we flag down an officer and he comes and he tries and tells us he proceeds to tell us there was a black belt wait the murder belt         I dont know         this guy was crazy this cop he said that we were in a really bad section of where people were like murdered and killed and like thrown like behind like the rest stop         So my sisters are sitting on the curb thinking Oh my God were going to die right         And not to mention its getting later in the day and it was about I think it was late March early April it had to be         But anyways so the sun had started descending going down         Anyways this guy comes and he fix he must have left about four times I dont know where he was going but I dont know where his shop was but every time he comes back with some crazy thing and he eventually fixed our car with some uh chicken wire I think he rigged it up with         We have no idea                  Anyways we got in the car and it got us to Savannah GA         And we arrived in Savannah um it was Mardi Gras was it Mar no it was St Patricks Day and let me tell you there were some crazy things going on         The woman the desk attendant the hotel we checked in well first we couldnt find any hotels because it was booked apparently Savannah is like really crazy around St Patricks Day         So um we got there and this woman had long green nails on it was kind of crazy         Um she was like OH you guys came for the perfect time its um St Patricks Day and were having parties and parties and all this stuff         So I couldnt go out I think I was like  years old and you have to be like  uh  in some clubs and  to drink and we decided not to go out considering everything that had happened that day         So we woke up the next morning we went down and we drove down to FL         I think it took us in all about  hours maybe  because she Cape Coral is on the West Coast         So we got there and my grandma is of course excited to see us and we unpacked our stuff and everything and we proceeded to lay out in the driveway and my younger sister Nancy um being her first time in the sun decided she didnt want to use sunscreen because she really wanted to get a good suntan she got a good suntan she got a sunburn         After we yelled at her for about three hours she decided to slap some sunburn on the back of her suntan lotion on the back of her leg and it left a nice white print like hand print on the back of her leg and the rest of her got sun burnt         So then we basically um we visited with our grandmother and I have some step family that lives down there so one night we went out with our cousin Teddy         and we uh went out to some clubs with him and everything         Um and then we went to lets see For I want to say its Fort Myers Beach I think the beach is on the West Coast we went down its about an hour from my grandmas and uh its a really nice beach its uh was pretty warm that day         I think we all got some color but they were having an epidemic of red tide and so all the fish were washing up on the shore and um luck be it since we were having such a good time um Allison Nancy and I decide we are going to take a walk along the beach and there were fish strewn everywhere so we were careful not to step on them         However Allison wasnt paying attention and she stepped on a fish and it got a barb which is one of its defense mechanisms stuck in her foot so it was really painful and her foot swelled up and everything         So we go to this gas station and they tell us we have to go to the hospital so we go to the hospital in Cape Coral and I think we were there for probably ten hours
