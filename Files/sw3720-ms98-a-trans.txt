                okay yeah Donna um you said you have three children what uh kinds of activities do you spend with them is it you know   okay um we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old and um   uhhuh   uh my husband lets see he coaches basketball with Brian um so he spends time doing that with him planning and um practicing out side   uhhuh   um hes a real sports kind of person so he plays tennis with with the kids we all kind of play tennis as a family except the baby plays on the play ground we take turns with her um   umhum   uh lets see we have a computer and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer um uh lets see what else we do oh i suppose we watch a little TV together we really dont watch i think as much TV as a lot of people we dont have HBO we do get the Disney channel for the kids   umhum uhhuh   uh my kids have the Nintendo which they play and my husband sometimes joins them with that   umhum   uh my little girl Jennifer likes to do crafty things and ill take some time and do that with her and of course we always read a bed time story at night and even the the older kids sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story um   uhhuh thats neat   basically the story person because my husband doesnt have he gets home from work late or whatever and and usually once in a while hell read the story to the little one but thats basically my job um   yeah so do you find it difficult to find time or is it pretty natural uhhuh   it is it is hard because you know at the end of your day you want time for yourself and and it and thats kind of cutting into your your time   yeah yeah   and with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late but you know on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine they go upstairs at nine   uhhuh   and um now this weekend well have a baby sitter come and uh my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and um probably not too late maybe maybe Brian will still be up and   umhum   spend some time with him but it is its really hard you have to be a very unselfish person to to spend a lot of time with your kids i think   yeah yeah do you work during the day   uh no i dont work i last year um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities that was two days a week and even just those two days   umhum   just seemed like it was a lot i dont know how i admire people that that can do it all but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i i want it kept it is hard   yeah yeah i can imagine yeah   um even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything and thats another thing ill take one of the kids with me grocery shopping um usually on the weekend and   umhum   thats kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son and and theyll be my helper and then theyll get to pick out some of the favorite snacks that they get to pick out so try to do things like that but it you know its its uh   umhum yeah yeah   and then of course they have a pretty um busy social calendar too  you fit it in with all that the that   uhhuh yeah so what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general you know in America   i i think a lot of people a lot of people sit sit their kids in front of the TV and HBO and rent movies and and   umhum   kind of leave them to their own means um i think you know its very very easy to fall into that trap and im not um totally innocent of that because theres times when you just stay here watch a tape but um   yeah umhum yeah   um i think different parts of the country i think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas theres a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids people are real   umhum   sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and you know but um   oh thats good yeah yeah well families are facing a challenge i know that with im a newlywed and were you know thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years and   what umhum umhum and its its very hard because when you get used to two salaries its very hard to to cut back to one and um um   yeah   but you know if you have the type of job i have a friend thats a nurse and she can pick her hours and thats a a great career i i wish i would have gone into uh nursing  because she has such a flexible schedule but its very hard to uh   umhum yeah   spend time with the children and uh and your husband and   umhum   do everything at once   yeah but i do feel like its important that you make the time for children because   well i think its a big its a big um responsibility you just dont have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single   yeah yeah   when you have children you have to say now this is different and you do have to give things up i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um   umhum   for the at least for the first two years of their lives i mean if you can possibly swing it because they   yeah
