                                 Why Chatterbox Cares            Is Chatterbox obsessed with Flytrap Yes Is this obsession justifiedChatterboxs proClinton friends along with Anthony Lewis Molly Ivinseveryone associated with the movie Primary Colors  and the Americanpeople speaking as one say no Even Chatterboxs guru Charles BhagwanPeters of the Washington Monthly one of the few journalists who gavecredence to the Gennifer Flowers tapes early on argues that the voters rightlydont care much about Flytrap because theyve known the rough contours ofClintons character for years            Lets concede what the voters apparently believe Clinton has been a goodpresident especially considering the alternatives Chatterbox fully expectsthat within weeks of his leaving officewhenever that happenswell want himback So why care about Monica Four reasons in order of ascendingimpeachability             The ease of his corruption We knew Clinton had affairs and liedabout them to the press and public We didnt quite know the unhesitating gracewith whichif the current charges are truehe orchestrates a campaign todeceive the courts Hey honey you dont have to turn over those gifts if youno longer have them in your possession It was especially shocking to seeNew York Times columnist Anthony Lewis who worships the legal processand has taught at Harvard Law glide smoothly over the distinction betweenlying to your friends and lying under oath True if Clinton lies about sexthat doesnt mean he necessarily lies about Social Security The slope isntall that slippery But its a slope Does anyone doubt that if Clinton liedunder oath about sex he also lied about Whitewater About what was given inexchange for campaign contributions Maybe it stops somewhere but where             The overconfidence What kind of alarmingly selfdeludeddefendant knowing what Clinton must have known about his own behavior wouldhave failed to settle the Paula Jones case So she upped her demand to million Pay it There is a failure of judgment here One day Clintonshypertrophied faith in his ability to pull anything out of the fire with aflurry of lastminute salesmanship will prove wrong Actually its alreadybeen proven wrong since the election on the fast track trade issue andmaybe on Iraq             The role mottle Christopher Hitchens has complained about theannoying cloying quality of the modern babble about role models Hes rightUnfortunately Hitchens didnt design the human brain which learns byimitation As Chatterboxs Darwinian mentor Robert Wright notes we give ourpresidents a lot and in exchange we ask them to be a little better inthe moral example department than the rest of us See this piece byWright for the basic Darwinian story Does Clinton want to restore the familyin the ghettos That will require suppressing the very impulses that Clintonhimself has so conspicuously failed to control             Social equality Clintons defendersincluding those ordinaryfocusgrouping Americansoffend the most when they suggest that a certainlatitude in moral and criminal matters goes with the presidents exaltedposition Director Mike Nichols says men who get a lot accomplished havepowerful libidos Whats the problem The big chief gets many women Thatsbeen true through most of human history Its not supposed to be true inAmerica America in this sense is a conspiracy against human natureand notjust in that we expect monogamy when the rule of history has been polygamyMore perversely we also expect social equalitynobody is better than anyoneelse we all play by the same ruleswhen the characteristic of previous humansociety has been the instinctive ranking by status What Clinton is saying isthat he doesnt have to play by the same rules Hes too important to be suedwhile in office Hes too important to be subject to the intrusiveoutofcontrol sex harassment inquiries that bedevil his subjects He boostedthe GNP and brought us disaster relief and we should be grateful and showerhim with fleshy offerings Hey man whats the fuss about He gave a blowjob to the economy is the manonthestreet interview Chatterbox expects tosee any moment now            Chatterbox always suspected that Democrats who focus compulsively on theincome charts exLabor Secretary Robert Reich for one would be all toowilling to trade off Americas precious social equality for a minor increase inincome equality and prosperity Now Clinton is making that deal explicit Animpeachable sin Maybe Maybe not But more than reasons  through  it goesto the fundamental character not of Clinton but of our nationalenterprisesomething thats worth impeaching even a good president topreserve            Chatterbox has spoken                           ITS EVERYWHERE Note that Clintons ultimate sinthe sin ofcorporatism of seeing society as a single body with individual humancomponents performing different social functions and having different unequalrightsis the same as Kenneth Starrs sin Starr thinks his role is so goddamnimportant that his prosecutors get a special right to criminalize free speechas obstruction of justice Less obviously Clintons sin is the same onereporters commit when they denounce Starr for impeding our ability to gatherinformation for the publicas if the press were a separate institution withspecial privileges and inevitably obligations the eyes of the social corpusnobly gathering information on behalf of poor ignorant citizens Better tostick to the socialegalitarian line Reporters are citizens with thesame rights and obligations as other citizens same as Sid Blumenthal same asMatt Drudge same as your mother which include the right to say nasty thingsabout Kenneth Starr
