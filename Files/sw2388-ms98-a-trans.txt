        okay well uh so what do you think about golfing are you a spectator or a player     oh im definitely a player i guess uh there is some question about that when i total up the score but       yeah i know how you feel about that thats true whats whats uh whats the best part of your game do you think   oh i like to uh i think putting is probably my uh forte   umhum what is your worst then           i guess i have the most trouble with chipping how about you   well i think  i think my best part actually is chipping or at least it was last year i havent been out this year its kind of been uh kind of strange i hadnt been able to get out yet but uh my biggest problem is staying in the fairway   for you know with drives and stuff um   yeah i used to have a lot of trouble with that with a wicked slide and so forth but i think ive overcome a good deal of that   umhum yeah ive ive gone in the past years from uh having a wicked slice to having a wicked hook to back to having a wicked slice i mean its just uh       and i cant seem to find the middle space you know but ive got a friend of mine working on it uh ive trying to help me out ive been going to the driving range with him and and it seems to be doing some um   yeah ive always threatened to take lessons but ive never gotten around to it   yeah well lessons are are okay if you do it right i think i did i took some lessons uh a couple of years back but to tell you the truth that  for a while hurt more than it helped because i it turned out that i couldnt do anything right after that   oh really   um and even you know like i said my chipping which is one of the best things in my game i couldnt do that i couldnt couldnt drive couldnt you know in in fact it was it wasnt as much at that point that i was hooking and slicing i just i was topping the ball i was you know i was doing a lot of things wrong at that point but i was trying to think of so many different things at the same time because you know it was it its kind of a funny story whenever i went for for my first lesson the uh the instructor takes me out there and he says all right well take a swing and let me see how you look so hes hes bending down on one knee right so i take a swing and and all of a sudden his head just goes down and and then all of a you know he just kind of slowly brings his head up and looks at me and he says weve got a lot of work to do  so     built that confidence right up there huh   oh yeah i was feeling real good then so  he broke me down from i mean he started me from the very beginning as far as changing just about everything i did and uh uh   that can be bad i mean you know a lot of people say     well thats like i said   its best to take your lessons right at the beginning before you learn the bad habits i guess   oh yeah oh thats definitely true in fact if uh if i ever you know have a son or anything im definitely going to uh you know  teach him have a lesson or something is that yours or mine     i think thats mine       let me just quick catch it and ill be back   all right     im back   okay     yeah uh they uh   my uh i have an interesting anecdote   whats that     my uh my uh son who goes up to AM hes had the pleasure of having a hole in one   oh yeah   yeah   well uh you know the only person ive ever known that had a hole in one was my brotherinlaw but uh and he he said he got his luckily so i dont know thats thats but i mean   yeah well i guess theres a certain amount of luck in any hole in one   i came so close once just once i mean thats the only time ive ever been any anywhere near but i mean i it was i used to live out in Midland Texas i dont know if youve ever been out there but its you know a real windy place   oh thank God ive never been to Midland   but uh       yeah i i played on a course out there and like i said its a very windy place so its you know the wind was blowing and it was cold and it was like it was about a hundred and i dont know a hundred and seventy or a hundred and eighty year par three and i you know the wind was right in my face so i just pulled out a seven wood right and i put that thing i mean it rolled right by the cup and only ended up three inches off but you know over over past the hole but i mean thats as close as ive ever been you know       because im not you know thats one of my problems is controlling my my my irons on a par three so i have a lot of trouble hitting the greens   yeah   so do you do you like watching it though i mean   well one of my uh well control and uh and contact are a big problem and they still are this one of the things i was doing wrong was too much back swing and hurrying my back swing   yeah well thats thats exactly what my friend has has figured out that i do is my i can actually see the club on my backswing and and uh   yeah   and he says that what i do is im actually crossing the plain is what this is his words his technical words for it crossing yeah   that sounds like the exact same words my friend tells me   yeah because it because i ended up into an inverted C where the weight was on the wrong foot or something so   yeah   i ive found that i actually do of uh i get a lot uh better control and distance if i dont you know dont take as big a back swing   yeah if i can convince myself not to try and kill it i sure you always get a lot better results   yeah whats funny is the idea that uh you know what i consider you know like a threequarter backswing or even a half backswing uh my friend says thats you know thats a full backswing and you dont want to go any further than that so i mean its a now its a matter of trying to convince myself that thats right   yeah   so i dont know its going to be interesting   well you have to prove it to yourself just by doing it a few times   um thats probably true well   its a frustrating game golf   oh isnt it though i dont know why i do it     its getting more expensive unfortunately too   oh  thats thats one of the worse things about it it really is but uh you know   like you i havent played any or not much this year i played a couple of times but   umhum   i went out skiing in February and took uh little tumble down the slopes and so im nursing a wounded wing right           you know thats it you have to be healthy too thats another point i guess   yeah   well i think thats about it   yeah well i love the game so uh i enjoyed talking about it   yeah i do too yeah       well you take care yeah good luck   okay  enjoyed it byebye     bye
