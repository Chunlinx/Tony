                are you there okay now tell me your favorite team   umhum uh baseball   yes   well ive been kind of  been intrigued with the Rangers uh more so with uh uh their management than anything else id i dont follow baseball that that closely but uh since you know since i live here so close to Arlington uh thats the team that ive been kind of following   okay i think its a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think theyre headed so well have to talk about the future with the Rangers   umhum right   what are your thinkings on what they can do what theyll be able to do   well i think that uh you know with uh so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money its um you know i think im not real sure about that do you know anything about Ruben Sierras uh   well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his   yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the Rangers will go up a little bit   yes and the Rangers go up a little bit umhum   yeah but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty five million thats a lot of money   i think the entire baseball yeah theyre the ones that probably are paying the highest   yeah they are   and i think this is absolutely ridiculous   umhum and i really think i really think that uh that they ought to   no   im not real sure that they should pay him that much money i think they should uh uh pay him what his salarys going to be uh and let him because hes got one more year before he turns into a a free agent   thats right   and then uh who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway but if he doesnt then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the six you know the six million dollars a year this year     what i saw on the news today that Buechele Buechele was back just to visit   uhhuh   im awful sorry hes not still   oh yeah but you know what he that was a great deal for him   oh im sure it was   yeah it was a great deal for him and and uh he just signed on uh i think it was like a five year deal with uh   Pittsburgh yeah   Pittsburgh so you know hes real happy there as far as the Rangers are concerned i think i think they need some definitely need some pitching   yes sir   uh and so i you know i   well what do you think of Howse who is the coach for the pitchers   um the pitching coach   yes   well you know i was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a a a black guy that was going was helping out uh   his assistant   his assistant and i think thats a a great addition i mean he seemed to know what he was doing and and uh   umhum i really wish they could see fit to get rid of Howse   oh you dont like Howse huh   no no i really dont       and im not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that but im not fond of Howse and im not fond of Grieves       oh Tom Grieve   yeah   yeah im im not sure that um that theyre ready to get rid of of uh Tom Grieve yet but Howse might be a different uh situation and i think youre probably right that they that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe and um   well im just gullible enough that i think Bobby Valentine is um uh doing all right and im sure well   you do huh thats contrary to uh popular belief you know   oh i know i know so but i would like so much for these Rangers to get their act together and give um oh uh Nolan Ryan the support he needs   oh i know you know its too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the Rangers you know   i understand   they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead and and uh   well i just  oh i have so many mixed emotions about all this but i think with their new stadium they should go and lets us have   yeah
