                              French Lessons in Lallans            Once upon a time as they say in all the bestfairy tales one of the most unlikely treatiesever envisaged was forged between two countrieswho were poles apart in almost everything excepttheir mutual dislike of the nation that separatedthem geographically  The Auld Alliance a treatyof accord between France and Scotland was bornToday nearly seven hundred years later it remainsintact despite the vicissitudes of time and a languagebarrier that only the French have ever made mucheffort to surmount            In The Luck of

other way  ButScots have long been inured to such slurs  As aproud Scot myself I feel that a much more probablereason for this apparent lack of linguistic ambition isto be found in the regional dialect  There are partsof Britain in which regional dialects can be as incomprehensibleas Tocharian to the innocent abroadand the farther north one ventures through Englandthe more incomprehensible they seem to become  Itgets worse in Scotland  Strangers listening to any ofthe Scottish dialects will soon realize that they are asreplete with gutturals as any Teutonic dialectTongues created by God

of a large publishing company in darkestHertfordshire England and I became involved inconversation with one of the employees a charmingyoung French translator  The subject of regional dialectsin our

lay claim to being a native of EnglandsNorth Country as most of my ancestorsleft the Borders during the Industrial Revolutionand I was born farther south in Yorkshire  HoweverI did live a large part of my life in Seahouses asmall fishing village on the north NorthumbrianCoast  Even though I consider Northumberland andthe Scottish Borders to be home technically I amstill a Yorkshireman and having been raised in thatcounty of virtually unshakable local accents it wasnatural that my tongue would give me away and thatI would be called a Yorkie when living in NorthumberlandBut on return trips to my birth placethe Northumbrian influence would show and Iwould be baited as a Geordie  I have since goneinternational Im a Pommie in Australia and anAussie when back in England            While in Northumberland I did serve my timeon a coble a traditional fishing boat working out ofthat tiny harbor not far from the Scottish borderand it was during those years at sea that I learnedsome of the more subtle intricacies of Northumbrianin particular that most flexible of all wordsAye   To most people in the Englishspeaking worldAye means yes as in that wellworn phrase Ayeaye skipper  But the initiated know that there is agreat deal more to this little gem than meets the earso to speak            I remember walking down to the harbor earlyone very misty morning with a friend from Yorkshirewho was coming out on the boat to watch ushaul the creaves lobster pots  As we neared thevillage we met an older fisherman heading in theopposite direction  He glanced up as we passedshook his head and uttered a terse greeting            Thick eh            Aye I replied            That was the sum total of the conversation  After afew minutes of deep reflection my Yorkshire friendcould contain himself no longer            What was that all about  he asked            He said that it was very foggy today and hethought that the boats would probably not be goingouthe asked me if I was of the same opinion  Isaid that I agreed with him            My friend lapsed back into thought stunned bythe hidden complexity of such a brief exchange  Unknownto him the conversation down at the harborwould be even more perplexing            The smaller boats had no radio or radar so itwas customary during adverse weather conditionsfor the fishermen to congregate around whateverspot at the harbor offered the maximum shelter fromthe weather of the day  After an appropriate periodof time some sort of taciturn group decision wouldbe made on whether or not the boats would go outthat morning  Sometimes the men would stand forseveral hours all attention turned to the prevailingconditionsand anything else that might happenby  As we joined the inevitable group gathered atthe end of the old lime kilns one man looked upThe conversation went something like this            Aye  In a short rising tone as if to sayWhos this stranger with you            Another fisherman turned his head            Aye aye  These were two levelsoundingwords meaning So your mates going out with youis he  It was more of a statement than a question            Another voice added            Haye  With an expulsion of breath and goingdown at the end Hell be lucky to go anywheretoday with all this fog its far too thick            And another            Aye he  This had a long dip in the middlewith a short ending Thats right very lucky to getout  Hell be lucky to climb down onto the boatSilence for a while  Then a more resigned soundcame from within the group  It was almost a sigh            Aye  I think everything that you all just saidis correct I dont think that the mist will clear notthis morning            Aye  A short sharp high note with a hint ofcontradiction You never know it could well seewhos right            Silence again  An old bomb of a car bounced pastwith several roughlooking youths inside            Aye  Quite strong starting low rising to theend as if to say Going far

Aye aye  First one level second one descendingWell not do any good down here  I thinkweve made our decision            The men started to move off each going his ownway  My skipper turned to me            Aye  Short to the point Thats it my bonnielad            My Yorkshire friend looked inquiringly into my face            Does this mean were not going out to sea            What could I say

risk of ambiguitythan a spoken sentence  The stage directionswithin a writtenprinted sentence are rudimentarybeingalmost always of just the following fourkinds in descending order of

DisambiguatorWritten sentences that in isolation appear ambiguouswill snap into focus when enmeshed in a larger discoursemoreover written language has the advantageover spoken language in that it

New Literature            This brief article describes and illustrates thestruggle of Hieronymus Stoat  toproduce a completely new literature  In his ownwordsThe concept of things happening is inherentlybourgeois and ultimately capitalistimperialistWe must I believe strive to rout out these corruptinginfluences on literary art to debourgeoisifywritingletter to the author                         This achievement could only be brought about by acompletely new style of writing in which nothinghappened            Stoats first attempt a novella untitled like allhis work opened thusThe haddock looked at the wall for sixtytwoyears  The light was on                        He was dissatisfied with this even before the ink wasdry  Although little appeared to happen a numberof events were implicit  For instance the momentsixtytwo years were up the haddock presumablystopped looking at the walla momentous event inthe context  And more subtly the lights being oncontains the event of its having been turned on  Butmost tellingly it was argued by critics that the haddocklooking at the wall constituted a happeningeven if it were rather drawn out and somewhat uninteresting            Absorbing these criticisms Stoat came to the realizationthat the problem lay in verbs  Whereveryou have a verb things happen  By definition  Hethus tried to write in a completely verbless way  Hisrevision of his untitled novella now beganPale haddock  Endlessly white wall  Ambientlucency                        This was better  To make up for the missing verbshe attempted to add interest by scattering adjectivesand adverbs everywhere  But after a time he had torecognize that even though the text did not actuallydescribe anything happening the mind had an extraordinaryfacility to make things happen unbiddento the haddock and wall in the light  And theadjectives actually helped  Quite interesting thingscould happen with a vivid imagination            Now this was as bad as describing happeningsAfter all the text had no meaning outside thereaders mind so if that mind became full of imaginedevents as a result of reading the text then ithad failed in its quest for happeninglessness  SlowlyStoat came to the realization that substantives toowere the problem  Write a noun and the reader willconjure up an image  Moreover the image will bedoing somethingan event will be happeningWhat if they too were expunged then  He tried itand came up withPale  Endlessly white  Ambient                        With horror Stoat realized that this was worse  Thetext provided a backcloth for all sorts of imaginingsAmazing events were enacted in the minds of readersconjured by these suggestive qualifiers virginsdreamt of knightsatarms on white chargers dirtyold men elaborated prurient extravagances            Reluctantly he was forced to discard nearly allof these signifiers  Even prepositions could conveythe impression of happenings  The single word up for instance was so loaded with connotation that ittoo had to be avoided  Stoat flirted briefly with aform of writing that used only the definite and indefinitearticles but soon became disenchanted withsuch lifeless passages asA the the a the a a the                        He ruefully concluded that even this could stimulatean overheated imagination            Meaning that was the problem  Where wordshad meaning they would engender images in thereaders imaginations  These images would start tomove and things would start to happen  What wasneeded was a meaningless language  How aboutLatin

that are not guessesAnd in cosmology what is the Big Bang theory ifnot a guess            Guesswork on word origins is not and probablycannot be science since the matter is not involvedwith wellestablished general theories  But hunchesand logic and experience surely play a crucial roleat least  Take for instance the slang word kiesterbuttocks  Bill Bryce I have read writes that itcomes from the Yiddish  But in my more than years of speaking reading and listening to Yiddish Ihave never heard that word or read it also Ivenever heard any Germanspeaking person use it andsay that it derives from Kies meaning small roundstones gravel  But in the largely Italian neighborhoodwhere I was born and raised I heard it oftenSo I guess that its an adaptation of chiostra  referringto a round thing like a circle or a globe  And Imust or rather want to say that one of the primereasons for my enjoying Mr Cochranes article isthat he demolished the antiempathy argument byusing logic and facts                              In your review of Death Dictionary XXII  you appear to believe a correspondent who assertedthat most of all the people who ever lived are alivetoday  In an earlier discussion of join the majority That has not been true even for the past two centuriesToday there are about  billion living peopleIf you add the estimated populations from thealmanacs for    and  you get billionand the real figure for the period wascertainly much higher  A similar result is arrived atby calculating in a different way the almanac estimatesa world population of  million in AD  ifthey had quietly reproduced themselves everytwentyfive years with no increase in the rate ofpopulation growth almost  billion people wouldhave lived and died since then            I suspect that your correspondent was misled bythe word exponential in most statements of Malthusiantheory  The statement would be true for a pureexponential series for example in the series     it is clear the          but humankinddoes not increase by such a series                              I agree with Ashok Mohapatras basic thesis inPoliticking with Words  XXII   but I think hissearch for elegant formulations obscured his judgmentin the selection of examples he cites to make hispoint regarding the new German dictionary  pStating that many words and usages exiled fromEast Germany now found a place as free citizensin the world of linguistic glasnost he cites onlyone Republikflucht  which is a true East Germanneologism ie a new crimeleaving the countrywhich didnt exist before and has since been eliminatedfrom the penal code  He is downright silly toclaim that Meinungsfreiheit it should be one wordand capitalized as all German nouns are Weltreiseobviously not Wettreise which would mean a tripto make a betonly Phileas Fogg combined thetwo and Freizeit have now found a place in theworld of linguistic glasnost            Pomposity of expression is no substitute for clarityof meaning  Meinungsfreiheit Weltreise  andFreizeit were descriptive nouns used in the Germanspeakingworld well before the East German regimecame into being although it and the Nazis beforeconnected the latter two with staterun programscapitalizing on the human desire to travel and havetime for oneself  Meinungsfreiheit is a term both regimesclearly shunned I suppose in a sense it wasliberated  Stasi is

glasnost            Mr Mohapatra is on solid ground in buttressinghis argument with the two widely diverging definitionsof capitalism  But I am astonished that in hisdiligent search he did not come up with the mostglaringly telling example of all juxtaposing definitionsthose for Democracy   It would have been interestingand enlightening to learn how the communiststate which called itself a

about trackingthe word balagan along its etymological course backfrom the modern Hebrew into which according toMilton Horowitz quoting Herman Wouk the wordwas borrowed from Russian            The entry for the Russian word in the TolkovyiSlovar Russkogo Yazyka Moscow  reads asfollows as transliterated and translatedBalagan Pers balahana balcony   A lightwooden structure for shows at fairs   An amateurtheatrical production with primitive scenery a theatricalstyle based on imitation of this primitive stagecrafttheatrical term  Balagan art  Balagan conceptsin Meyerholds productions  II By

temporarywooden vendors booth at a fair                        The RusskoAngliiskii Slovar compiled under thegeneral direction of Professor AI Smirnitsky SixthEdition EP Dutton  Co New York  definesthe Russian word in English as followsBalagan   wooden structure booth for presentationsshowbooth  show extended meaningfarce tomfoolery preposterous piece of buffoonery                        Does not one come away from these definitions of theRussian word with the impression that whoever infectedMilton Horowitzs software may have takenthe discouraging word directly from Russian ratherthan from Hebrew  According to Wouks footnote asquoted by Mr Horowitz in modern Hebrew balaganhas come to mean mess foulup snafu fiasco  Butthe Russian meaning of a booth for crude vulgar buffooneryseems to fit better the trick title that appearedon Mr Horowitzs computer screen  Myguess is that the joker who named the program Balaganwas a Russianspeaking immigrant either to Israelor America who may well have been aware ofthe words currency in modern Hebrew but forwhom the meaning remained the Russian one            Also interesting is the indication in the TolkovyiSlovar that the word is of Persian origin and that inPersian it means balcony  Balahana looks a lot likeour English word balcony  so I looked up balcony inThe Random House Dictionary of the English Language where I found the etymology given asbalconye  It balcone  balco scaffold  OHGbalcho beam                                       Websters Third New International Dictionary gives asimilar etymology stating that balcony is ultimatelyof Gmc origin  The Tolkovyi Slovar states that theRussian word for balcony balkon is borrowed fromItalian which took it from Persian not the Germaniclanguages            So which authorities are right the Americandictionaries or the Tolkovyi Slovar  Did the Italianstake their word balcone from some Germanic tongueand pass it on into English Russian and other languagesor did Italian take the word from the Persianbalahana  as Russian did balagan  at least accordingto the Tolkovyi Slovar  Etymologies in the OEDThe Random House Unabridged  and Kluges EtymologischesWrterbuch der deutschen Sprache havecognates of balaganbalcony popping up in Slovene blazina  Greek and most significantly in Lithuanian balienas  purportedly the most conservativeof the IndoEuropean languages  I suggest thatthese scattered avatars of balaganbalcony evidencedescent from a single ProtoIndoEuropean rootmost prolifically in Italian and Persian                              In response to the

There has recently been some opinion in VERBATIMXXI   concerning the acronym AWOL   Isuppose it doesnt matter all that much whethersomeone is absent without leave or absent withoutofficial leavein either case he or she is probablyin for a heapa trouble  But for my two cents worthwhen I was in the US Army early s KoreaLand of the Morning Calm sometimes referred to asFrozen Chosen I was in a battalion personnel unitand handled daily Morning Reports from each batteryThis included manpower accounting  We alwayssaw the term and heard it and used it as absentwithout leave  While we had few or no realinstances of AWOL it was reported daily  The use ofWO for without meantto us anywaythat aperson who was gone missing couldnt be foundetc was absent and had been granted no leaveofficial unofficial or what have you  This wasAWOL   There could be leaves of unofficial natureoften called hippocket leave but those werenot reported as any kind of leave they compensateda person some time

quoll  is noticed in thesame glossary of an Australian language that compiledby James Cook navigator and explorer in  Some years elapsed before the British decidedto establish a penal settlement in the land whichCook when he took possession of it in  primarilyto forestall the French named New South WalesBut in  Captain Arthur Phillip landed at BotanyBay near the present Sydney with a mixedparty of convicts and their military custodians andsought to use what little knowledge had been passedon to him of the indigenous inhabitants their languageand the new lands flora and fauna            Somewhat to his surprise and that of others inthe party the Aborigines of Port Jackson as SydneyHarbour was named did not recognize the wordInstead they appeared to think it was an Englishword and borrowed it as they did other words likegammon and fellow  with glee using it of the cattlewhich the invaders had brought with them and apparentlythinking it meant edible animal            This was to give Phillip and others their firstintimation that there was more than one Aboriginallanguage but so distinctive and so immediatelymade a symbol of the country was the animal itselfand the word rapidly took on in English and indeedin French  And when in  Phillip King landedat the Endeavour River in the north of what is nowQueensland where Cooks glossary was obtainedhe found that the local Aborigines did not recognizethe word using a name something like menuah insteadIt was to be more than a century before theexplanation became clear and in the meantimeseveral other possibilities were floated  It was at firstthought that Cook and the naturalist Joseph Bankswho was at his side had erred either in their understandingor in their documentation and it was latersuggested that an Aboriginal informant had misunderstoodthe question and replied I dont know orsomething a little less polite  It was  before thelinguist John Haviland identified the word in theQueensland language Guugu Yimidhirr where it denoteda particular species of kangaroo and evidencedthe fineness of distinction that characterizesAboriginal languages  By this time of course thenumber and complexity of Aboriginal languages waswell known and the Port Jackson language orDharuk as it is now known was long extinct            As a footnote and in illustration of the sense ofAboriginal humor which might

no such answer  The first task then isto track the word back to its earliest recorded occurrencein Australian English to see if the context yieldsany clues as to origin  And it does  Both forms

the Year                              Conversational Joking Humor in Everyday Talk            There must exist some standard somewhere forwhat passes as witty funny hilarious but itprobably changes hourly and depends on the agereligion race financial condition location andother characteristics of the observer  We oftenlaugh appreciatively at what is clever though it maynot be funny humorous or even mildly amusingTake for example the three quotations from ClarenceDarrow given for April  in Witty Words inwhich it is easy to see from the subtitle quotationsare arranged for each day of the yearThe first half of our lives is ruined by our parentsand the second half by our childrenWhen I was a boy I was told that anybody couldbecome President Im beginning to believe itI have never killed a man but I have read manyobituaries with a lot of pleasure                        These are as the book title suggest witty one couldcertainly agree that they are facetious but they arenot funny and certainly not hilarious  Sometimesthe shock of recognition when one encountersa wellphrased truism is enough to trigger a welcomingresponse which might manifest itself in a smileto indicate the pleasure of the experience  But asmile is not a response to something hilarious  Irather suspect that Eileen Mason was satisfied withthe title of her book then the publisher came alongand stuck in

indexes one of people one of holidays andone of subjects            Professor Norrick might be offended to find areview of his book so closely associated with what hemight consider to be trivial but he does expend agreat deal of text describing the various forms ofhumorsorry I cannot resist the punctuationthat come from oneliners and clichs many ofwhich after all are quotations  There is little humorin this book either in the joking or the situationsdescribed largely because of the analytical approachnothing makes a joke fall flatter than havingto explain what is funny about it especially when itwas not particularly funny to begin with  It is hardto tell why Norrick persists in interspersing the recordedconversations with irritating Heh heh hehheh hehhehheh or Ehhehheh ha ha ha  Butthese are natural conversations and it evidentlytakes so little to make people laughan apt metaphorseems to send them into paroxysms of laughterthatone need no longer wonder at the successof standup comedians who rarely say anythingfunny but focus on reminding their audiences oftruisms            Humor as we are told endlessly by those in theentertainment profession is a serious business Norrickdemonstrates that it is serious for linguists toowhich we might have suspected once Freud got hishands on it            Laurence Urdang                              Caught in the Web of Words James Murray and theOxford English Dictionary            Although this book was not reviewed in VERBATIMencomiastic reviews of it have appeared internationallyand this is merely a notice to let readersknow that it is available in paperback albeit at aformidable price            Laurence Urdang                              Puzlpack Version  for IBM PSs or compatibles            Puzzle solvers seem to fall into two categoriesthose who use reference books to help them find theright answers and those who eschew any aids whatsoeverI have always fallen into the latter categoryIf I could not identify a missing word in a quotationI marked that down to my own failing one that wasnot likely to be remedied by looking it up in Bartlett after which it would be promptly forgotten mercifullynot all clues in puzzles are quotations so someof them worked out besides the word that had tobe supplied was usually a very common one and itsonly connection with the quotation was that it happendedto appear in it like be in To be or not to beFor many years the crossword puzzles published inBritain like those published in VERBATIM have beenof the cryptic kind differing from the typicalAmerican variety by a diagram that does not crosskeyevery letter of every word and by clues that arenot simply straightforward matter like the solutioners for bitter vetch and other otherwise uselessbits of information for one thing many of the cluesare anagrams which is where Puzlpack comes in  Tosave space here is what Puzlpack can do from theblurb Find all singleword anagrams EIPRST yieldsESPRIT

worthsbut experienced puzzlers might  The program issimple to load and once in place easy to use it isalso extremely fast  The OED on Compact Disc has afacility for finding blank tile substitutions but itdoes not include all possible inflected forms            If everyone had this software there would beno point in using anagrams in clues I suppose onthe other hand not everyone does and the use ofsuch aids is probably ruled out in competitionswhere the entrants are controlledthat is notworking at home  It is also useful for puzzlemakers            Laurence Urdang                              A Catalogue of Cats            In view of the abundance of the worldwide populationof the domestic cat it comes as somethingof a surprise to learn that no authority can categoricallystate where the name for this group of smallsoftfurred carnivorous animals started or when  Weknow the cat was domesticated both in the East andWest in the early historical period the ancientEgyptians being credited with having been the firstpeople to have done so and at one period in theirhistory to have worshiped it as sacred  The name isfound in Latin and Greek in the first to fourth centuriesand in the modern languages as far back as theirrecords go            Almost certainly a loanword in Old English it iscatt  Welsh and Cornish cath  Gaelic cat  Old Irishcat  Dutch and Danish kat  Middle Dutch katte

some sort of word for the cat            What is also a mystery is why the use of theword cat was so often attached as a prefix to otherwords  In some examples I feel the word also sufferedcatachresis

maritime items                           Cat is abbreviated from catamaran  used intrade names like Hobie Cat   A catamaran is a raft oflogs lashed together or a boat formed of two hullsheld together

        The cathead is a heavy piece of timber projectingfrom the bows of a vessel for hauling anchorsfitted with a stock into position clear of the shipsside  It was so called because in the days

the Random House Unabridgedfor electricity  where one would expect tofind the main definition appear cross references toelectric charge and electric current  neither of whichoffers a definition akin

nature than we did before            Like modern dictionaries dictionaries preparedin the past contain entries considered important bytheir editors either for personal reasonsand thereis nothing much criticizable in following a personalopinion if it is that of a qualified observeror becausea given word had become traditional in thecontemporary cultural context  Thus for instancewe can readily understand retaining a definition forawful striking awe but few would agree that thatwas either the dominant sense or even a commonsense in the s in America yet no other definitionis provided  It must

eg akkumpane            The conclusion is that such books seldom haveanything to teach us except in the most general wayabout the way the language was used in anothertime partly owing to the lack of sophistication oftheir compilers partly to their conservatism whichtempts them to include terms and definitions thatare no longer current  Such entries must be retainedfor they are encountered in reading  Some conservativedictionaries published earlier in the th centurylisted a huge number of Scotticisms on the justifiablegrounds that they would be useful inreading Burns but most school editions containingBurnss poetry later on supplied glosses so an ancillaryreference proved unnecessary  With all the dialectsand longlived speakers of English today thelexicographer risks inaccuracy in labeling a wordphrase or sense obsolete or archaic  there is sure tobe someone who speaks a form of English in whichthe expression is extant  For another thing we mustpay close attention to historical informationnotabout the language but about the culture  For instancejust because we now know that the alkahestor alcahest  phlogiston  and the philosophers stonedo not exist they must still
