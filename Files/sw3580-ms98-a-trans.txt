        uh well uh to begin i guess uh space       is uh real important i think so its real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time i guess so   yeah i i i i agree its its definitely new frontier stuff   uh so uh but uh im not too up to date on the space on the space frontier but uh but i guess theyre going going pretty far into it now um Star Wars is not too far  i dont think but uh   yeah i i worked on some of it at TI once upon a time   oh have you   yeah   so what do you know about it   well actually im i im quite versed lately i get on a computer network all the time and people are talking about about the current space program all the time theyre talking about new rockets that theyre designing now that you know are just like science fiction you know its like they take off you know and then they land with the with the       you know the afterburners are going you know not like space shuttle landing you know gliding down but straight down to the landing pad   really oh my gosh   yeah its called VCX or something like that also called Delta Clipper which is a decent name for something like that   well well i dont know you think youd you think youd uh go up in space you had a chance   oh yeah i think i would i think thatd be neat   would you i think i would just just sitting here talking talking about it if the time came itd be real nervous       id be scared i think thatd be worse than   yeah   Six Flags  roller coaster thatd be pretty hairy   well you know i had a car uh uh a tire come off of a car so you know thats like i know what its like to   yeah imagine     depending depending on what was left of my technology to get me home   right right       so uh well i guess theyre talking about people going to the moon and stuff now or where ever   yeah theyre talking about doing that again too   and opening up those stations or what ever filling them i dont know if well ever see that but   umhum well least uh have a space station supposedly in the next few years   oh really   yeah and theyre gonna put   thats all  beyond my imagination really but science fiction books   yeah   i mean you look at the Jetsons you know a cartoon show and its not too far fetched what what they all had in those cartoons so you never know   oh yeah yeah   and they had stuff on the Jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would come become possible and now you we have lot of those so   umhum   so you never know what what may occur but as far as me seeing it no   yeah     i dont know i dont know but       i think its real vital important for the future you know generations to come so   umhum yeah i i its its its something definitely that uh yeah its its uh got the extra little oomph of interest   yeah   yeah   im sure itll draw a lot more interest too once it becomes you know like its more possible   yeah   when they start showing the drawings and all that im sure you know when they   yeah i wish uh like uh Boeing or or uh McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy a a space shuttle sooner or later   right   and just make it you know purely commercial   uhhuh   id go up you know and do things and you know   so did they scratch those uh that Star Wars deal you know the one we was all worried about Russia and all that   oh no its still probably going but i dont know whether it it research will go on   yeah but the economy the way it is all over them they probably cut back on   oh yeah   on that because its not   well theyre theyre gonna be cutting back so much on just you know the number of troops weve got in Europe and the number of troops we have here   right yeah i know and then   but uh Russias still gonna have missiles theyre still gonna be subs and things   yeah and we dont know whos handling handling them now so thats a whole different story now   yeah latest i heard it was just gonna be Russia that Russia itself that was gonna have them   oh really   at least that was you know thats what everybody says oh yeah yeah we want only Russia to have them   uhhuh   and now they say yeah yeah youre republic you dont want those you dont want those  give them to mother Russia   some crazy Hitler over there from one of those little       republican republics or whatever theyre splitting it all up now and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of you never know   umhum     but that the guy thats taken over for Gorbachev hes supposed to be uh hes supposed to be on our side isnt he or pretty much   one hopes   yeah i think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects so   umhum   but that way  you cant never tell that   yeah   you know you know kiss some butt but       but uh
