                                 Hungary for Invasion            Quoting a senior officialin the Clinton administration the Guardian of Londonclaimed Monday in its main frontpage story that the Pentagon is pushing for aground attack on Yugoslavia to overthrow President Slobodan Milosevic Keyfigures in the Pentagon are proposing that the White House consider afullscale armored invasion of Serbia in which Nato would capture Belgradetopple Milosevic and haul the leaders of his regime before a war crimestribunal wrote the papers Washington correspondent The invasion would belaunched from Hungary he said The report like most others that have promotedthe ground war option contained the now familiar dampener that NATO stillexpects Milosevic to fall before a land invasion becomes necessary Moredampeningly still the Daily Telegraph of London led Monday with the news that BritishPrime Minister Tony Blair currently the most hawkish of the NATO leadersfailed to sway his allies in favor of deploying ground troops            The press of each alliednation had a different take Monday on both the war and the weekends Washingtonsummit The main German newspapers led Monday on NATOs new Strategic Conceptwhich includes out of area military deployment if Western interests arethreatened The conservative National Post of Canada welcomed this extension of NATOsrole but warned in an editorial that it should not be a euphemism for globalhumanitarian interventions more properly handled by the UN SpainsEl Mundo andEl Pas both led onNATOs pledges of military and economic help to Yugoslavias neighbors inreturn for their support against Milosevic In Italy  La Stampa of Turin led onClinton playing the Yeltsin card while Corriere della Sera ofMilan splashed the news that NATO is ready to block even Russian tankers toenforce its oil embargo against Yugoslavia In Paris Le Figaro led on the cost ofthe war warning that Europe is coming under pressure from the United States topay a larger share of it            An editorial in the Sunday Times said theoil embargo and the use of Apache helicopters against Milosevics tanks mightyet obviate the need for a ground war but a report from Albania in theSunday Telegraph implied that the United States might never put thehelicopters into the air Reporter Tim Butcher wrote that the final elementsof the deployment are still not in place and that there is no indication fromany NATO source of a willingness yet to employ the Apache in Yugoslaviawhere its lowflying tactics will expose it to ground fire He said that thelevel of paranoia about the Apaches which are being protected by  UStroops suggests that they are intended to break Serb morale without actuallyengaging in battle The Albanian press has had a field day reporting thatthey are armed with nuclear weapons he added            Last Friday the independent Albanian dailyGazeta Shqiptare claimed that the Serbs have started using chemical andbiological weapons against the Kosovo Liberation Army It said that a shellcontaining radioactive materials and neurotoxins had been fired Thursday nearthe KosovoAlbanian border and paralyzed a KLA soldier Traces of altropinean antidote to chemical weapons had been found by the KLA on the bodies ofdead Serb soldiers it added            In a commentary in theSunday Telegraph  military historian John Keegan accused mediacommentators of becoming dangerously obsessed with what politicians such asClinton and Blair are saying about the progress of the war instead of focusingon what is actually happening in the field Last weeks euphoric discussion ofthe significance of the deployment of  Apache helicopters shows howunrealistic media assessments of the evolution of Natos war effort is hewrote The United States lost  helicopters in Vietnam out of ahelicopter force many times larger than that It also did not win the Vietnamwar In another example of Apache skepticism the Sunday Telegraph sdefense correspondent pointed out that the Pentagon had promised April  thatthe Apaches would be getting up close and personal to the Milosevic armorunits in Kosovo within days while three weeks later Task Force Hawk is stillweeks away from performing any sort of combat mission            Writing in the papers Review section Oxford historianNiall Ferguson said that the slaughters in Kosovo and at Columbine High Schooland the nail bomb attack last week in Londons black neighborhood of Brixtonare all linked to one personAdolf Hitler From beyond his unknown graveHitler has a hand in all these apparently unrelated events he wroteCriticizing Clintons and Blairs overuse of Third Reich analogies in theirantiMilosevic rhetoric Ferguson said it would not do for them to say that thecurrent airstrikes against Serbia are based on the lessons of the past            In the s it was notHitlers opponents but rather his appeasers who like NATO leaders todayexaggerated the effectiveness of air power Does anyone out there want toargue that Hitler could have been defeated by a policy of air strikes todegrade the Nazi military machine without the deployment of ground forcesother than in a permissive environment he asked Invoking the memory ofthe Second World War Clinton and Blair have picked a fight with one littleHitler Milosevic Ferguson concluded They should not now be surprised ifeven in the obscurity of Littleton and Brixton they have to fight some evenlittler Hitlers too            In a frontpage story the Sunday Telegraph revealedthat Blair has regularly consulted Margaret Thatcher on the Kosovo conflict Ina number of telephone calls all initiated by Blair and some lasting as long as minutes she urged him to stiffen the spine of the Americans as she haddone when she chided President Bush for going wobbly during the Gulf War            In an editorial on the Littleton massacre the Independent onSunday warned against dismissing it as a problem unique to guncrazyAmerica The problem it said is a wider one to do with the increasingsolipsism of the world in which our teenagers live Not only do they retreatinto bedrooms which seem as selfcontained as an astronauts capsule each withits own TV stereosystem and wiredup computer but into an increasinglyselfreferential and selfvalidating worldview The things that once linkedteenagers to the value systems of the rest of society have gone as have theframeworks of reality which placed social restraints on the individualsfreedom to think say do or buy whatever is desired            Last Fridays bombing of a Serbian TV station was muchcriticized in Europe over the weekend Le Monde s editorial Sunday said the action might beterribly counterproductive because it wont change the minds of Serbs whobelieve Milosevics propaganda but it will appear pointlessly destructive ofhuman lives to those who dont It could also have devastating effects onWestern opinion by giving the impression that NATO is only bombing buildings inBelgrade because it is incapable of taking on the Serb military units inKosovo where Milosevic appears to have all the time he needs to emptyvillages mine frontiers bury his tanks and armored vehicles and installartillery batteries opposite the KLA bases in Albania            In Hong Kong theSouth China MorningPost led Monday with what is said was the biggest protest in Beijingsince the Tiananmen prodemocracy movement began  years ago this month Thestory also made the front page of the New York Times and the Financial Times of London whichsaid that more than  members of a mystic cult called Fa Lun Gong causedacute embarrassment to security forces by virtually surrounding the compoundwhere Chinas leaders work It said the cult claims  million members andsees human corruption in everything from homosexuality to rock and roll anddrugs
