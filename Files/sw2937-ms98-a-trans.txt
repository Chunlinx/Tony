                okay Pat can you tell me uh what actually they want what everyday occurrences are   define everyday occurrences   right or do you have   every time you use a credit card every time you log in to a computer terminal particularly where you have access to a network to a network   yeah   anybody can with the right kind of skill and tools get very much involved in those things which are on your system that you dont particularly want exposed thats why we have such security measures for our corporate information yeah if you absolutely   thats a point um um actually um uh using credit cards the information that the person that you give it to   umhum   has of uh  available to them is very limited thats to just your name i guess um you dont have to tell where you live you dont have to put your phone number down some people uh ask you for it but youre not required to give that information   thats right when was the last time that you used a credit card that they didnt ask for your drivers license as well   oh very very few up here yeah yeah they just dont they dont ask for a drivers license um   really um well most of our checks are even printed with our address our social even our drivers license numbers are printed on there   yeah see my   because they require that   yeah my checks are its just my wife   umhum   and my name no address   umhum   so its just names on the check so no one can you know i mean they can i suppose with a little leg work if they wanted to   umhum umhum   but the average persons not going to do that anyhow   right but were talking about people who are interested in invading your privacy people who have a reason to do that   okay   people who are interested in building data bases of information about your financial background your educational background   um   uh one of the biggest fraud scams that ive heard of recently is people who have access to such information and they find out whos a widow and what shes worth and then they present themselves to her as a uh a rich suitor   oh okay thats yeah i   and bilk her out of anything that she has those are   ive read articles about that but people have to be pretty gullible um either that or or especially widows um   umhum umhum umhum there are very vulnerable people though older people are very vulnerable to such things and they tend to to   old people right right and and some people some of the older people today uh their husbands handled all the finances so now they find themselves left out in the cold and theyre really really not savvy as far as it comes to finances to handling their own personal affairs   umhum uh well on the other hand how can you be savvy with so much out there today there are so many clever scams and and many of them are computer based and theyre based on information thats available   yeah   in the public realm   im im still not convinced that they can get you if youre if youre aware first of all you never should give your your uh credit card numbers over the phone to anyone   umhum thats right   which is which is kind of basic   umhum   um they people may generate lists are if you subscribe to a magazine i guess they sell lists of names to other people but theyll send you junk mail usually   umhum umhum thats right umhum   um and you can stop that easy enough just go to the post office and just have your name taken off   umhum did you have you registered for a conference recently   uh yes i have   okay did they ask for your fax number   no they did not   okay i registered my people for several conferences in the past six months and theyll ask for your telephone number and theyll also ask for a fax number you would think on the surface that that is for rapidly sending you confirmation of your registration or your hotel or something like that not at all those fax phone number lists are being sold in exactly the same way your street address numbers are sold and you now get solicitations brought over your fax   right   and you dont expect it from that source therefore youre not as uh   yeah but thats uh   you know youre not as leery   isnt doesnt corporate have a didnt they put a stop on that   uh some some cases but that it it exists is what im saying those avenues exist   yeah right yes they do exist and if someone wants to really find out about you i suppose if they wanted to go to all that trouble they could   umhum   uh   i heard a story not long ago this guy saw a really attractive young woman and he said hey id like to know this girl more so he wrote down her license plate number and he called a friend in motor vehicles and got her address and her telephone number and then he called a friend that he had in the credit bureau and he got her financial standing   yeah   okay from that he also got her social security number and certain social security information is uh a matter of is it is accessible if you know somebody in the government so before it was over with he knew that she was divorced she had two children what school they went to what her average income was he knew that shed gotten a boat in the divorce because he was able to get those public records   right   he knew all about her   yeah you could do that if you really wanted to   and he introduced yeah he introduced himself to her he said i think our kids went to school together at such and such school she i dont really remember that   yeah   and i mean you know he was relying on her not remembering or   right yeah   or not being willing to admit that she didnt remember him and just moved right in on her   yeah yeah thats and you can do that anyone can do anything thats public record whether its divorce or anything like that um whether you purchase a home thats all thats all public record   sure umhum umhum umhum thats right   um what they do with that information people are really um go out and do it i suppose somebody does the leg work and they generate a list   umhum   um uh its uh  i think lists are generated from lists now   umhum thats true im still getting lists from many many years ago   and right   or getting junk mail from a list that had to have been made years ago   yeah we had uh weve got a an account at Sears Roebuck   umhum   and we had moved from one town to another town and theyve got our address listed now with with double towns in it and ive trie d and tried and tried to get it off but you just cant get it so   umhum   since then weve gotten solicitations from other people listing both towns so i know damn well that Sears has sold their list of names out to somebody else   umhum of course   but there isnt anything you can do about that   no you cant stop them from selling your lists although some of them really are honorable organizations and they will say if you prefer us not to put your name on a mailing list then we will not   right some of the some of the charities now will will do that if you chose choose not to have your your name   umhum umhum   put on a list and i i do that you know we have our charities that we give to and then we say yes no just dont   umhum umhum   because you do it and then youre on everybodys charity list   umhum and you have to really do some research or you do not find out who is legitimate and who is not and sometimes finding out who is legitimate and who is not is more difficult than finding out public information about people   thats right thats exactly right uh most of the funds that a lot of these organizations collect   umhum umhum   go to fund the organization i mean very very   absolutely   little of the funds get out to do uh anything worthwhile   thats right   um it all started with the government the government started keeping tabs on you and whether they   umhum   those list that Internal Revenue has whether they leak out to the public or not im really not sure maybe in some cases they have in the past uh once a list is out its out forever   oh yeah you bet you bet and with computer technology now look how spooky it is for how accessible these things are   yeah but the bulk of it probably ninety seven to ninety eight percent of all those lists are going just for solicitations um some people maybe are using them for ulterior motives im not really sure   umhum umhum   but the bulk of them is and its junk mail and you can you can you can get off those junk mail lists you just tell the post office   umhum umhum umhum   so that will limit that amount of stuff   sure   i read uh i read and article where this this man uh sent sent to everything they could possibly get and he was getting reams and reams of paper all kinds of periodicals and magazines and letters and notifications and what he was doing with them he was storing them up and he was using them for fuel   umhum umhum way to go neat     during the winter time   thats great   what i do is on all the credit card solicitations   umhum   if they have a return envelope with it i write across the face of it no thank you your rates are too high and i mail it back to them   umhum umhum umhum   because now they have to pay the postage so now its costing them something to do that   yeah they dont put as many of those prepaid envelopes in there anymore   they dont   not as many as ive seen in the past   oh up here they do well theyre still doing it well its just like up here we dont theres very very few times ive had to show my drivers license for to use a credit card   um umhum yeah   uh and im not sure why you know why its so prevalent down there and maybe it will catch up up here   um thats possible i really dont understand that either but my stars some of it sometimes its very difficult now the gasoline credit cards require your license plate number as opposed to your drivers license   yeah weve got the   although some of them have a blank on there for it they dont generally enforce using it   weve got the ones you just stick your card in the pump   um ive not seen one of those   yeah so whatever you whatever brand that you buy you just drive up to the pump you put your credit card in it and then it says you know please commence pumping and then when you pump then when youre through   umhum umhum   you put the nozzle back and it says do you want a receipt and if you can push yes if you want one and if you dont want one you push no
