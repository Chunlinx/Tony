Where to GoPROVINCE OF SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFETenerife El Hierro La Gomera and La Palmatelephone code TenerifeArea  sq km  sq milesthe largest islandPopulation Tenerife is not only the largest of the Canaries geographically it also offers the tourist more sights more attractions more towns and cities to explore and more contrasts than any of the other islands Where else can you look around a banana plantation and then take a short drive halfway up a mountain for a snowball fightTenerife has been welcoming visitors from cold northern climes since the th century However the focus has changed from the cloudy green north coast where Puerto de la Cruz was once the favorite resort it is still enormously popular to the hot dry arid southSanta Cruz de TenerifeThe capital of Tenerife and the administrative center for the westerly Canaries Santa Cruz is not a city in which tourists spend a great deal of time The main square is the Plaza de Espaa in the middle of which stands a foursided cross a memorial to the dead of the Spanish Civil War The huge drab gray building adjacent to the Plaza is the Cabildo Insular local government headquarters which also houses the tourist office and the Museo Arqueolgico with important exhibits illustrating the life and death rituals of Guanche society see page  The museum is open TuesdaySunday ampm and the entrance fee is a mere  pesetas free on Sundays Back on the seafront discover the Iglesia Matriz de la Concepcin Church of the Immaculate Conception Dating from the early th century this is the towns most important historical building and contains several interesting relics including Nelsons faded battle flagPuerto de la CruzPuerto as this town is often abbreviated to has neither good beaches nor the abundant sunshine of the south yet for many travelers it is the most complete resort on the island It has been attracting convalescing northern Europeans for over a century and it maintains much of its colonial grandeur The seafront promenade has been quite heavily commercialized but not at all spoiled and the atmosphere is always lively without being boisterous The main square Plaza de Charco is the hub of both tourist and local life and its numerous cafs restaurants and shops are busy at all hours Just off the square the old town around the Puerto Pesquero is remarkably oblivious to change Among the narrow streets with faded wooden balconies and carved doors are the Casa de Miranda now a crafts shop and restaurant and oldest of all the Casa de la Real Aduana Customs House built in  facing the tiny portThe problem of Puertos lack of a decent beach was brilliantly addressed by the late Csar Manrique who designed Lago Martinez which is open daily am to pm This hectare acre complex of tropical lagoons cascading fountains and sunbathing terraces is cleverly landscaped with lush palms and blackandwhite volcanic rocks to fit perfectly into the seafront where the surf crashes spectacularly against the rocksThere are numerous places on Tenerife competing for the attention of tourists but there is one just to the west of Puerto that absolutely should not be missed Loro Parque open daily ampm admission  ptas r has the worlds largest collection of parrotsmore than  species and subspecies It is also home to the most eclectic array of animals including gorillas chimpanzees tigers jaguars alligators sealions dolphins and numerous other creatures that are exhibited in carefully and creatively designed spaces Look also for the underwater world of the aquarium and shark tunnel and the newest and undoubtedly most inventive display The Planet Penguin the largest Penguinarium in the world covers  square m nearly  acre and has been created as a natural habitat for these engaging creatures The temperature of their iceberg is kept at between  and  C  F with  tons of artificial snow falling on it daily through openings in the roof The surrounding sea is chilled to  C  F Visitors are conveyed around on a moving walkway that allows the King Gentoo and Rockhopper penguins to be seen cavorting on land and in the water Look also for the dolphin sea lion and parrot shows and animal feedingsJust north of Puerto on the road to La Orotavo there are two places both open daily ampm that have similar themes but exhibit them in rather different ways The oldest of these and closest to town is undoubtedly the Jardn Botnico Botanical Garden founded by royal decree in  Covering some  hectares  acres it has palms of every variety and the centerpiece is a huge South American fig tree whose enormous branches and roots have become intertwined into one great tree house Further on Bananera El Guanche provides fascinating insight into how a Canarian banana plantation operates By way of a multilingual introductory video show a surprisingly informative and entertaining brochure and exhibits in its sqm nearly acre park which boasts besides numerous bananas a superb collection of exotic trees shrubs flowers and cacti from all over the world open daily ampm admission  ptas rLa Orotava is a remarkably wellpreserved unspoiled old town set on a steep hill high above its old port Puerto de la Cruz Stately mansions ancient churches and cobbled streets are its trademarks The twin towers Baroque faade and Byzantine dome of the Iglesia Nuestra Seora de la Concepcin dominate a fascinating skyline that has remained virtually unchanged for centuries Continue on up Calle San Francisco to the Casas de los Balcones Houses of the Balconies The balconies in question are inside the houses courtyard and are some of the finest examples of their kind This splendid thcentury mansion and the Casa de Turista built in  opposite are now shops dedicated to Canary handicraftsNorth of PuertoEl Sauzal is important for its wines and this industry is shown to its best effect at the Casa del Vino La Baranda open TuesdaySaturday ampm and Sundays and holidays ampm admission free See how the wine is made in the museum then enjoy wine tastings and purchase your favorites from the shop There is also a bar and restaurant both with fine views over the coast Tacoronte nearby is renowned for a muchvenerated thcentury figure of Christ Known as the Cristo de los Dolores Christ of Sorrows it stands in the local church of the same nameLa Laguna declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO late in  is Tenerifes second largest town and known as the ecclesiastic and cultural capital of the island However it is not wellvisited by tourists Start at the Plaza del Adelantado and a short way along Calle Obispo Rey Redondo is the cathedral of La Laguna with its landmark twin bell towers It is a surprisingly modern structure in spite of its design consecrated in  over  years after the city was founded Continue on the same street to the towns oldest church Iglesia de Nuestra Seora de la Concepcin Church of the Immaculate Conception built in  Its sevenstory belfry and watchtower were added two centuries later The interior is outstanding with exquisite timber carvings on the ceiling and pulpit and an enormous Baroque altarpiece with Flemish panelsWest of PuertoA full days outing from Puerto de la Cruz along the unspoiled north and west coasts covers some of the islands most spectacular sights and scenery Sleepy Icod de Los Vinos is the home of the botanical freak that is Drago Milenario a yearold Dragon TreeContinue west on the coast road from Icod to Garachico and after  km  miles the tortuous descent begins There are marvelous views looking directly down onto this compact little town of  inhabitants set on a small peninsula with the waves crashing all around The peninsula is actually formed from the volcanic debris that was deposited following a disastrous eruption in  when most of the town and its inhabitants were destroyed The best place to survey the aftermath of the petrified lava is from the beautifully preserved thcentury Castillo de San Miguel A lucky survivor this fortress note the heraldic arms above the doorway is now devoted to handicraft sales There is no beach to speak of here but a very cleverly designed set of pools built into the rocks more than compensates Despite the destruction Garachico is a little gem Neat houses boasting typically attractive Canarian balconies line cobbled streets and old churches adorn pretty squares Unmissable also is the large uninhabited rock out in the bay and it has managed to gain for itself a place in the spiritual life of Garachico Without a patron saint of its own the town has elevated the rock to be its saintFarther along the coast road  km  miles past Buenavista del Norte lies the most westerly point on Tenerife the Punta de Teno From here there are panoramic views across to La Gomera and looking south to the massive cliffs of Los Gigantes Turn back to Buenavista and take a marked turn inland to Masca Be warned though this is absolutely not a drive to be undertaken by inexperienced or nervous drivers Initially the road although ascending through the arable mountainside is no problem but this soon changes once the entrance to the vertiginous valley is reached One glance at the narrow steeply twisting road on either side will be enough to realize why up to only a few years ago the picturesque tiny village of Masca could only be reached on the back of a donkey All around is some of the most dramatic scenery on the island However if you are driving you wont have any time to savor it The road clings precariously to the side of lush green mountains cleft by deep dark ravines and often zigzags on itself in the tightest of hairpin bends And it is far from unknown to have to reverse back down and around these bends allowing other vehicles to pass A stop at Masca is not just a pleasure but also a relief Relax at one of the restaurants down from the road and enjoy the stupendous scenery before continuing south on an equally difficult drive to rejoin the main road at Santiago del TeideA little farther south turn off towards Puerto de Santiago then walk out to the edge of the marina jetty to get the best view of the enormous sheer cliffs up to  m  ft high known appropriately as Los Gigantes The GiantsThe Central AreaThere are several approaches to Las Caadas National Park and Mount Teide The park is well signposted from the road via La Orotava but if you are coming from the north then the most picturesque route is via La Esperanza The small town soon gives way to a lush forest of giant pines and eucalyptus trees Four km  miles south at Las Races is where Franco met with his coconspirators in  see page  An obelisk in the forest commemorates the event As the road gains altitude and temperatures fall the views become ever more spectacular The Mirador Pico de las Flores looks out over to the southeast and the Mirador de Ortuo offers a panorama of the northern coast Highest of all at over  m  ft Mirador las Cumbres reveals Teide in all her gloryThe entrance to the National Park is El Portillo de las Caadas where there is a visitor center open daily ampm If you wish to walk in the park pick up a leaflet or ask for information about the daily guided walks Note that during winter the environment can become quite harsh and you should never undertake walks without consulting staff at the visitor center first At this point it is quite likely that you will be in the clouds temperatures are very low and in winter there may well be snow on the ground The landscape becomes very lunarlike it was around here that some of the filming for Planet of the Apes took place The ascent to the top of Mount Teide can be made by climbing or by the new cable car telefrico an eightminute ride open daily ampm admission  ptas r Most visitors choose the cable car but its worth noting that even after leaving the cable car it is still a good climb to the summit at  m  ft However if you really want to venture that far you have to go in person and with a photocopy of your passport to the Office of the Parque Nacional del Teide Calle Emilio Calzadilla   Santa Cruz de Tenerife Even then there is a daily limit of just  people for conservation sake allowed up the last  m  yards to the summit Once there you should be able to count off all the other Canary Islands and on a good day see North Africa Impressive as Teide is it is basically no more than a peak on the edge of a giant volcano which long ago erupted or imploded Left behind is the vast Caldera volcanic crater which is most apparent from the area known as Los Roques Los Roques are a group of giant flamboyantly shaped lumps of volcanic rock rising out of the crater often visited and photographedThe East and South CoastCandelaria is a town with deep religious roots Legend has it that well before Christianity came to the Canaries an image of the Virgin was washed ashore here and worshipped by the Guanches who were quite oblivious to its Christian significance The Spaniards later built a church dedicated to the statue Sadly both the statue and the church were destroyed in  when a tidal wave reclaimed the Virgin The present oversized basilica was built soon afterwards The splendid new statue of Nuestra Seora de la Candelaria the patron saint of the Canary Islands is the object of a major pilgrimage in midAugust The Guanches are not forgotten either ten chieftains stand guard in a row with their backs to the Atlantic These idealized cavemen are truly noble savagesJust south and inland from Candelaria is Gmar which with the exception of one curiosity is easily overlooked However those with an interest in the history of these islands will be intrigued by the Pirmides de Gmar wwwfredolsenespiramides The step pyramids also known as the Chacona pyramids here didnt become evident until the early s They came to the notice of the Norwegian anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl internationally acclaimed for his transoceanic crossings with prehistoric vessels and theories about human migration After studying photos he came to the conclusion that the Chacona pyramids were similar in principal to those in the Old and New worlds Subsequently he took a personal interest and began to relate their existence to preHispanic civilizations that either lived or visited the island Today on view are not only the pyramids themselves but models of Heyerdahls vessels a video detailing his summaries and transoceanic crossings and various other interesting audiovisual displaysThere is little else of interest after here until you reach the south of the island The most popular tourist destinations in Tenerife are the adjacent resorts of Los Cristianos and Playa de las Amricas Los Cristianos used to be a small fishing port with a quiet little beach It now plays host to hundreds of thousands of mainly British and fewer German vacationers each year and its small beach inside the port is woefully inadequate Traces of the old town can still be found around the port though it is difficult to locate anything but British or German bars and restaurants along the crowded beachfrontPlaya de las Amricas was born in the s and has quickly developed from a bare shoreline to the highrise highenergy highly packaged resort it is today Here the beachside bars are not Spanish nor even international they are mainly English In the evenings of course the hundreds of English bars compete with each other some even advertising which British beers they sell on local English radio stations for this lucrative and ever thirsty market Discos too are ever popular with the younger crowd but when they spill out in the early hours of the morning goodnatured boisterousness can sometimes result in rowdiness Beware also of the dangers of muggingsOn the other side of Playa de las Amricas but with a border as indistinguishable as that with Los Cristianos is the newly popular area of Costa Adeje but here it really is rather different The walltowall hotels fast food places and other such popular activities with the English and Germans gives way to much more elegant spacious cleverly designed resort hotels offering such extensive facilities that you dont even have to leave the propertycreating a much more agreeable ambiance than that of its two near neighborsThere is of course no shortage of entertainment facilities and Puerto de Coln has become not just a favorite place to wander around and watch the boats but a center for some really neat and unusual adventures that merit description A submarine trip will appeal to most people and Submarine Adventure will take you under the ocean on a minute trip in their yellow submarine Through the picture windows you can monitor the progress and the fish yourselves The highlight is when the submarine passes some wrecks on the sea bed which have become a haven for fish notably an array of stingrayssome of which are frighteningly huge Safari BOB Diving has a more novel way of getting you underwater BOB stands for Breathing Observatory Bubble and these are said to be the first in Europe It is rather like a vertical scooter and consists of a large bubble over your head and a steering apparatus by your waist You get about  minutes of submerged time in the waters north of the port open MondayThursday Saturday and the cost is  ptas r per person Speed Boat Safari NautiOcio Watersports is the latest and fastest water adventure following an instructor you will drive your own boat exploring small bays and caves and stopping for swimming and snorkeling all equipment provided  ptas r per personEl HierroArea  sq km  sq milesPopulation El Hierro has hardly any tourist facilities no natural spectacles and no good beaches but it is pretty quiet and totally unspoiled More than enough attributes for many to pay a visit However the configuration of the roads makes exploration a frustrating affair as it is impossible to make a circular tour as roads just do not join upIn the southwest corner of the archipelago El Hierro was at one time considered to be the end of the known world and for that reason it was used as the zero meridian which has long since relocated to GreenwichValverdeThe only Canaries capital located inland Valverde was built high on a mountainside to protect it from pirate raids and is a very small town with only a parador and a few other places offering tourist accommodationThe Rest of the IslandFrom Valverde follow the road to Isora a neat little village of welltended gardens There are three miradors to enjoy on the road to El Pinar The name comes from the pinewood forests that in places make up a gentle rolling landscape of fields and trees reminiscent of northern Europe As the road descends south the greenery eventually peters out into volcanic badlands and at the tip of the island is the fishing port of La RestingaThe switchback road down to Frontera passes fertile cultivated fields and the occasional disused lagar winepress The bell tower of the church here is something of an oddity being divorced from its body and set on top of a small hill next to it From a distance the tiny tower set against the massive cliff side seems terribly remote but as you approach it the illusion disappears and the main road passes within feet of the church and tower The cliffs here and all along the stretch of north coast known as El Golfo were once actually part of an immense volcanic crater However some  years ago one side of it slid violently into the sea leaving behind a gigantic bay with a semicircumference of  km  miles and cliffs of up to  m  ft Although the last eruption on the island was over  years ago El Hierro actually has the highest density of volcanoes in the archipelago There are over  cones on the surface with an additional  covered by lava flowsThe road west leads to the village of Sabinosa and just south of here though only accessible by a long journey is the Ermita de los Reyes and the forest of El Sabinal The forest is made up of juniper trees sabinosas which are incredibly and grotesquely twisted stunted gnarled and in some cases almost bent double by the windThe Mirador de la Pea  km  miles west of Valverde is the newest the most impressive and arguably the only real tourist attraction on the island Those familiar with the work of Csar Manrique see page  will not need an introduction The views are marvelous and the restaurant is one of the best on the islandLA GomeraArea  sq km  sq milesthe sixth largest islandPopulation La Gomera is indeed a dramatic and rugged mountainous island It has a coastline that is dominated by dramatic cliffsthere are very few beaches and the interior is full of vertiginous mostly verdant valleys that are often lined with narrow fields stepped into the sides of the mountains For extra effect these valleys are more often than not covered by a ceiling of cloud whisked in by the trade winds which seem to perpetually hang over the island In the center there is the unusually dense growth of trees and fauna in what is the Parque Nacional Garajonay open TuesdaySunday ampm Less than  km  miles from north to south this amazing island has been declared a Property of Humanity by UNESCO In fact a third of the island  hectares  acres has been designated into seventeen protected areas Such terrain though makes for difficulty in getting around and even the Romans had they ventured this way would have found their legendary ability to build straight roads put to an impossible test In fact almost nowhere on the island will you find a straight stretch of road everywhere you go the roads twist and turn continually often turning back on themselves in hairpin bends Making driving even more complicated is the fact that the roads although improving are often of poor quality and the directional signs leave much to be desiredJust  minutes away from Tenerife La Gomera nevertheless remains unspoiled and authentic with its steep green terraced hills and tranquil valleysSan SebastinCapital and main port of the island this small town will always be important as the place where Columbus took leave of the known world on  September  on the voyage which revealed the New World The Columbiana starts in the main square A pavement mosaic shows the route of Columbuss voyage and next to the large tree is the Casa de Aduana the old Customs House According to folklore Columbus drew water from the well here took it to the New World and used it to baptize America Leading off the square the Calle del Medio is the only street of any consequence in town and features more connections with the great navigator The Iglesia de la Asuncin built between  looks and feels so old that you can easily imagine Columbus praying in a dark recessas a plaque here tells us he did in  A little way up the street is the modest Casa ColumbianaCasa de Coln which is supposedly where he stayed in La GomeraThe NorthThe road from San Sebastin climbs steeply and the views soon become quite dizzying The highest peak on La Gomera Alto de Garajonay is  m  ftthis is no great height by Canaries standards yet the island often gives the impression of being a fearsome maze of eerie crags The small town of Hermigua is the largest on the island after San Sebastin Stop at the crafts center of Los Telares to take a look down into its green and fertile valley and ask if you can try the local liqueur mistela whilst watching women making blankets and rugs on their antique looms After this there are fine views of the impressive cliffs and Agulo is a pleasant small town whose main feature is the domed Iglesia San Marco which adjoins a monumental laurel tree in the plaza This church was originally a mosque during a brief period of Moorish occupation in the th centuryA turn inland just before the village of Las Rosas is one of the entrances to the Garajonay National Park declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO The Centro de Interpretacin information center has a small museum displays and gardens The road then continues through the hectare acre park to the La Laguna Grande restaurant a hospitable roughandready sort of place which is very popular with walkers Unlike the national parks at the peaks of many of the Canary Islands there are no views from here aside from at Garajonay itself and an almost perpetual thick mist clings to the ancient mosscovered trees As there is little rainfall on La Gomera this mist spawned by the mystical trade winds assumes great ecological importance having given life to this subtropical forestThe SouthThe main road from San Sebastin leads past three mighty volcanic plugs which are nicknamed the Chinese Hat the Lion and the Face of Christ after their respective outlines The windy pass of Degollada de Peraza offers spectacular views to both the north and the south and the road splits here Rather than continue on to Garajonay turn left on an equally windy road that leads to Playa Santiago Besides San Sebastin this is one of the few waterside communities on the island The unpretentious little port and beach is almost totally unspoiled by any outward signs of tourism even though the cliffs immediately to its east are home to the Jardn Tecina a really special selfcontained resortContinue inland passing the new airport and at Igualero turn west onto the minor road that crosses to Las Hayas Stop in the small village of El Cercado where almost next door to each other there are the Rufina and Malria two small stores where the owners make ceramic goods in the traditional manner Watch as little old ladies fashion the clay and then be tempted to purchase the end results or other goods and antiques that are on sale Be surprised also by the prices they are nearly as steep as the islands cliffs and valleys From Las Hayas continue along to the main road at Arure where immediately after turning left there is a small bodega selling wines not only from La Gomera but from throughout the Canary Islands too La Gomera actually has about  hectares  acres of vineyards mostly cultivated on uneven land with steep slopes and small terraces A stop at the highest point of this road is a must The views from the combined miradorrestaurant Escuela Csar Manrique of the Valle Gran Rey the multitiered valley not the town of the same name below are stupendous The small town of Valle Gran Rey even has a beach of some size albeit of black sand and accompanying restaurants Follow the road back through the valley continue on past Arure and then make a right at the Tjunction with the other main road and this leads all the way back to San Sebastin de La Gomera passing La Laguna Grande and the entrance to Garajonay along the wayLa PalmaArea  sq km  sq milesthe fifth largest islandPopulation La Palma the most northwesterly of the Canaries has two nicknamesLa Isla Bonita the beautiful island and La Isla Verde the green island and both are suitable Beautiful it certainly is and very green too Not only that but its statistics are very impressive The highest peak Roque de los Muchachos rises  m  ft above sea level making it the steepest island in the world in relation to its total area It is also the only one of the Canary Islands to have even very small streamsSanta Cruz de la PalmaThe island capital is an appealing townclean and bright with traditional and modern architecture sidebyside creating much charm especially when compared with many of the other islands rather bland capitals The importance of the town is such that during the Renaissance era it was the third most important port of the Spanish Empire after Sevilla and AntwerpThe heart of the town is the small triangular Plaza de Espaa set a couple of streets in from the seafront on the Calle Real On one side of the triangle is the Iglesia Matriz de El Salvador Church of the Saviour built in  The ceiling of this big stone church is made of tea heart of pine and is a fine example of the Mudejar Muslim under Christian rule style of intricate wooden paneling Next to the church are some splendid examples of th century colonialstyle mansions notably the Casa Monte Verde dating from  but having been rebuilt in  The longest side of the triangle is taken up by the ayuntamiento Town Hall built between  and  with stone brought from La Gomera this is considered the most important Renaissance building in the Canary Islands While the arches are Italian Renaissance the interior which you are free to inspect is Spanish colonial with formidable carved wooden ceilings and doors and a ceremonial staircase with frescoes painted by M Cosso around The Calle Real is a delightful street in which to stroll and enjoy the atmosphere At its southern end it takes on the improbable title of Calle ODaly named after an Irish banana merchant who settled on the island Look also on the parallel Avenida Maritimo at the wonderfully charming row of old houses known as the Casas de los Balcones Houses with balconies built in the th century they have become symbolic of Santa Cruz Colorful and characteristic and with a Portuguese influence they have overhanging balconies and those facing the sea were once used as lookout postsDue to the steep dorsal shape of the island there are only two main island routes to follow the loop south of the Caldera de Taburiente or the loop north of it The southern route is the more interesting of the twoThe Southern LoopHeading west from Santa Cruz the first stop of interest is Las Nieves a village built on the mountainside The first indication of it is a roadside bar followed by the thcentury Santuario de Nuestra Seora de las Nieves Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Snows This holds the venerated thcentury terracotta image of the Virgen de las Nieves which relates to an ancient miracle when the Virgin appeared in Rome during August snow Every five years the image is carried to Santa Cruz in a procession known as La Bajada de la Virgen the Descent of the VirginThe next place of interest is the Centro de Visitantes Visitors Center of the Parque Nacional de la Caldera de Taburiente located at Km  on road TF open daily ampm and pmpm The English brochure is quite helpful giving general information on the geology and geomorphology flora and fauna helpful hints on camping as well as a very useful color diagram of the hiking possibilities At the heart of La Palma Caldera de Taburiente park covering  hectares just over  square miles is a giant crater  m  yards deep with a diameter of  km  miles and is a  km  miles in circumference It was created some  years ago and has since been colonized by nature into a green fertile valley The best place to see this is from the Mirador La Cumbrecita which is  km nearly  miles away on the road next to the center Following it the road finally climbs into a craggy forest surrounded by mistshrouded peaks with tall pines clinging to the most precarious ledges There are wonderful views from here weather permittingwhich it doesnt most of the time including the Roque de los Muchachos and the monolithic Roque Idafe said to have been the sacred altar of the first Guanche natives on the island You can enjoy the Caldera by car but to get the most from the area you have to walkThe main road then continues west through the city of Los Llanos de Aridane and then turns south following the mountainside to Fuencaliente The most southerly point on the main road it is famous for its wines But rather than continue directly back north on the eastern side of La Palma take the road down to the Faro de Fuencaliente that will lead you in a near circle to the most southern tip of La Palma and then up through a winding twisting road back to Fuencaliente The first stop is at the Bodegas Carballo where you can sample and purchase some surprisingly strong local wines In  the local volcano San Antonio erupted covering once fertile land with ash leaving a layer of lapilli approximately  m  ft deep By the end of that century farmers had developed a technique of digging trenches that enabled them to reach the fertile layer of earth found under the cinders where they planted the vines that were then covered with the extracted ashes This somehow allowed the plants to resist adverse weather conditions and even the grape plague phylloxera that decimated vines all over Europe in the second half of the th century Just across the road you can stop to pay a visit to the edge of the volcanic crater of Volcn de San Antonio and the mirador beyond it open daily ampm In an exposed windy location this looks considering the damage it did exceedingly benign Just south of here are even more recent signs of volcanic activity the volcano of Tenegua that erupted in  fortunately without casualties These eruptions sent an everwidening stream of molten lava rushing down the green hillside here and you can see it now petrified and black as the road runs right through the once deadly mass Surprisingly pltanos bananas seem to take a liking to this environment and can be seen thriving all around you Once down to sea level you will come across the Playa de Zamora a small beach of jetblack sand squeezed in between the surrealistic lava fields A short distance away next to the twin lighthousesone old and one newis a tiny fishermens cove with a stony beach that has a tiny restaurant well a shack really that serves up the most delicious fresh fried fish see page  After that there is nothing of note except of course the lava fields and views until you rejoin the main road at FuencalienteHeading back north towards Santa Cruz a stop at the Cueva de Belmaco is in order Here you will find the Parque Arqueolgico de Belmaco Archaeological Site of Belmaco The first stone engravings found in the Canary Islands were discovered here in the th century and the ten natural cave dwellings with their magnificent rock engravings were the home to the Benahoritasthe ancient settlers of Benahoare the original aboriginal name for La PalmaThe Northern LoopThis is really of little interest and the roads often leave something to be desired However a trip up the eastern coast from Santa Cruz to just south of Barlovento isnt too long and the rather serpentine road runs through some pretty scenery Make the first stop the miradores of Bartolom and La Montaa with the latter being a little higher and affording beautiful vistas along the coast in both directions Head next for the seaside village of San Andrs and its natural swimming pools at Charco Azul blue pool A little inland from San Andrs and Sauces is the Bosque de Los Tilos the largest wooded area in the whole Canary Islands and designated a Biosphere Reserve under the protection of UNESCO Heritage of Mankind is the information center above the restaurant open MondayFriday ampm The final destination though is a lovely remote site just before Barlovento where after a tortuously twisting journey down through banana plantations you will reach the Piscinas Fajana literally swimming pools built into the rocks and fed by the ocean waters that often crash into them Showers and toilets are on hand as is the pleasant La Gaviota the Seagull a restaurantbar and the views north of the cliffs falling straight into the ocean and being pounded by waves are breathtakingThe goal in the north for most travelers is the Roque de los Muchachos the highest point in the island at  m  ft above sea level There are several ways up to it but always be aware of the weather what looks fine from sea level takes on a different perspective at nearly  m  ft And of course it can change dramatically and quickly so go prepared clotheswise and know that you might not see much but clouds Besides the views the other attraction up here is the futuristic Observatoria de Astrofsica regarded as the most important observatory in the Northern Hemisphere and home to some of the worlds most important telescopes including the m inch William Herschel telescope However as it is only open to visitors for a few days each summer most will have to be satisfied with just seeing it from the outsidePROVINCE OF LAS PALMAS de GRAN CANARIAGran Canaria Lanzarote and Fuerteventuratelephone code Gran CanariaArea  sq km  sq milesthe third largest islandPopulation Gran Canaria is second to none for its combination of perfect beaches and sophisticated nightlife for its history and hubbub marvelous natural scenery sightseeing and shopping Almost circular in shape with a coastline of  km over  miles with over  km  miles occupied by diverse beaches Gran Canaria is the classic volcanic cone in profile and its mountainous character causes the climate to change radically with latitude and altitude You can leave a wet and chilly Las Palmas in the morning and an hour later be enjoying a hot sunny day in MaspalomasGran Canaria is known not without reason as the continent in miniature The coastline ranges from aweinspiring cliffs to golden dunes Inland you can choose between stark mountains and tranquil valleys in fact there are  protected areas that cover  of the islands surfaceLas PalmasBustling Las Palmas population the largest city in the Canaries and the seventh largest in Spain is a major commercial and historical center a cosmopolitan resort and a vital seaport all rolled into one It is one of the busiest ports in the worldThe real hub of Las Palmas is the Parque de Santa Catalina This square is effectively one gigantic outdoor caf that buzzes day and night and is just a short walk to Playa de las Canteras This superb golden beach stretches for  to  km  to  miles and a natural reef just offshore means that the water couldnt be calmer Las Canteras and the area behind it reflect the citys cosmopolitan nature Like the city in general it has seen better days and is losing younger tourist trade to the smarter modern resorts in the southAway from Las Canteras make your first stop Doramas Parque a pleasantly landscaped park named after a Guanche island chieftain and adjacent to the park is the Pueblo Canario Canary Village This is a romanticized version of a Canarian village where you can shop for handicrafts and watch displays of folk dancing and singing The man who conceived it was local artist and designer Nstor de la Torre  and a museum of his exotic art is in the PuebloFurther south is Triana one of the older barrios suburbs Today it is known for its upmarket shops and the long pleasant pedestrianized street of Calle Mayor de Triana offers just about everything for both tourists and locals Adjoining Triana is Vegueta the oldest part of the city where Spanish forces first set up camp in  History lurks behind every wall and this is a delightful place just to wander around Christopher Columbus knew these streets and he prayed at the Ermita de San Antonio Abad before setting off on his first Voyage of Discovery to the New World The present building dates from the th century Close by on Calle Coln is the beautiful thcentury Casa de Coln this elegant house with its charming courtyard was formerly the residence of the islands first governor and Columbus is said to have stayed here on three occasions Now an atmospheric museum it recreates the Age of Discovery with exhibits of navigational instruments charts weapons and everyday items of the periodAround the corner stands the vast Gothic and neoClassic bulk of the Catedral de Santa Ana with its Diocesan Museum of Sacred Art which is not pretty but certainly impressive and best seen by night when floodlighting softens its harsh grimy front Facing the cathedral are several green bronze statues of the aboriginal mastiff dogs after whom the Canary Islands are said to have been named from the Latin canesJust down from the cathedral is the modernistic Centro Atlantico de Arte Moderno CAAM Atlantic Center of Modern Art With five floors of exhibitions this is the southernmost contemporary art center in the European Union and focuses on the work of young Canarian creators Nearby the Museo Canario holds the islands most important collection from Guanche times with the highlight being the room of skulls and mummies depicting the Guanches fascination with death see page The hills surrounding here and on the southern approach to Las Palmas are full of apartment buildings and the like and would not normally merit any attention However the city government readily realized that these areas looked at the very least rather bland To counteract this they had the ingenuity to brighten them up and nowadays all the buildings are painted in the most unusual and very attractive array of pastel colorsSouthern ExposureThe southern resorts of San Agustn Playa del Ingls and Maspalomas the biggest holiday complex in all of Spain let alone the Canaries are linked to Las Palmas and Gran Canaria international airport by the fast and featureless autopista motorwaySan Agustn is a restrained area of apartments catering for more mature and discerning vacationers Playa del Ingls is more robust as the very name Beach of the English might suggest although it attracts numerous German visitors as well This is a funandsun sprawling resort of highrise hotels shopping malls and fastfood restaurants The nightlife at the more than numerous discos bars and clubs can be hectic During the day people can sun themselves on the golden beaches that stretch for  featureless kilometers  miles so there is room enough for everyone Maspalomas is famous for its dunes that cover an wide area of  hectares  acres which are sufficiently large and unspoiled to constitute a miniSahara of great beauty They are a protected nature reserve but you are far more likely to see naturists than naturalists here Playa de Maspalomas is the stretch of dunes close to the landmark lighthouse and is home to a small but ever growing number of topclass hotelsAs you might expect there is the usual plethora of family attractions nearby the most important of which is Palmitos Parque that provides an excellent day out for all the family Performing parrots amuse with circus tricks and caged birds of every imaginable hue are kept in beautiful gardens The real stars however are the exotic freeflying residents AquaSur is at  square m over  acres the largest waterpark in the Canary Islands The other major attraction Sioux City is a recreation of the Wild West with gunfights lynchings saloon gals and lassooing tricks etc The Friday evening Big Wild West Show with barbecue is great fun for childrenWest of Maspalomas the coastline becomes dominated by towering rather barren looking cliffs that every now and again form natural bays and coves wellsuited to become resorts in their own right However this area is overdeveloped what is surprising is that development continues apace especially given the lack of building space Developers however have resolved this problem very innovatively by literally building into the cliff sides themselves and this often leaves visitors with the rather surreal sight of walltowall development taking up every inch of these steep bays Nevertheless some of the places retain a certain charmPuerto Rico is the most attractive beach resort on this coast But it too has been grossly overdeveloped so its lovely sheltered golden beach can become unbearably crowded Its marina is the focal point for numerous marine adventures that will suit all tastes Lneas Salmn has eight boats and runs a frequent and inexpensive ferry service between Puerto Rico Arguinegun and Mogn offering a charming way of getting to know this part of the coastline Afriyachts Puerto Rico has two catamarans that run fivehour cruises Dolphin cruises are popular too and glass bottom boats operate from the port Sport fishing will appeal to the more adventurous and this part of the coast is just the place for it consequently numerous boats operate from Puerto RicoPuerto de Mogn should be a lesson to all resort developers in how to provide accommodation that is functional very attractive and totally in sympathy with its surroundings The accommodation here is an interpretation of local townhouses that are ablaze with bougainvillea arranged in pedestrianonly squares with narrow alleyways and arches leading to an attractive marina This is lined with stylish cafs and restaurants jazz and piano bars and small boutiques All that is lacking is a good beach A submarine trip also dives from here and one of the best nautical trips is an excursion aboard the Windjammer San Miguel a fine old transatlantic sailing ship built in Northern Coast and HinterlandArucas is a workaday town overshadowed by an immense thcentury neoGothic cathedral that stands out like a sore thumb The road west from Arucas follows a truly dizzying route through the mountains past several caves Some provide shelter for goats but others are inhabited by people and are complete with running water and electricity The route passes through the tidy small town of Moya It is well worth stopping to see its church precariously perched on the very edge of a ravine An act of faith indeedJust off the coast road is the Cenobio de Valern Convent of Valern This is badly signposted Take the turn off just before Gua away from the sea This convent is actually a series of Guanche caves cut into a steep mountainside According to island lore the daughters of noble families spent their youth in these small cells serving the native gods At the age of  they were allowed to marry or to remain in the sanctuary for life More prosaically the caves were probably also used for grain storage Around this area you could spy some modern cave dwellersContinue south towards Agaete which is the most attractive of the small northern towns Agaetes port Puerto de las Nieves is a haven of calm among the formidable rocky cliffs that make up this inhospitable stretch of coast From here the coast road ascends very sharply amid sparse windblown greenery and the drop seawards can be frighteningly steep An alternative route is to drive  km  miles inland to the fine viewpoint at Los BerrazalesCentral SightsThe mountainous center of the island makes for very tiring driving You will rarely get out of the lower gears but the wonderful panoramas are ample reward Pine forests almond groves gnarled mountains sheer cliffs and cloudy mountaintops beckonThe best and certainly the most popular vantage point is the Cruz de Tejeda Cross of Tejedaat  m  ft one of the few points inland where you are almost guaranteed to meet fellow tourists A small cluster of cafs fruit and souvenir stalls and men with donkeys await you at the summit The magnificent panorama includes two rock formations that were once worshipped by the Guanches The most distinctive is the statuesque dark broody bulk of Roque Nublo at  m  ft and it takes little imagination to understand the primitive inhabitants fascination with this formation the other is the Roque BentaigaAs the Cruz de Tejeda is the hub of the island there are any number of routes to and from it and almost all have something to offer so consider ascending on one route and descending via anotherFrom Las Palmas you have two options The most northern route runs through the peaceful valley town of Teror The old whitewashed houses often built around graceful patios boast fine traditional carved balconies The major landmark here is a typically large Canarian church the Baslica Nuestra Seora del Pino Our Lady of the Pine This commemorates the miraculous discovery in  in the branches of a pine tree of a sacred effigy The Blessed Virgin of Teror is also the patron saint of Gran Canaria Alternatively take the main road that runs inland from close to the cathedral and heads southwest through the towns of Santa Brgida and Vega de San Mateo offering panoramic views of the east of the island Because the climate here is exceptionally mild many Canarians and foreign residents have built very desirable homes in these hills with the gardens around their villas often being magnificent A small diversion along this route is certainly worthwhile Just a few kilometers out of Las Palmas follow the signs to Bandama the road open ampm leads up to the nearby Caldera de Bandama one of the islands finest natural features and a spectacular mirador in its own right This volcanic crater almost a kilometer more than a half mile across is green fertileand drops some  m  ft down A scenic spiraling road leads to the top where the Real Club de Golf enjoys such a picturesque location that even nongolfers are tempted to pick up a club The views from here take in the mountains fertile valley and vast stretches of the coastline from Las Palmas to the distant southFrom the west of the island drive north from Agaete and then turn inland following the signs to Tejeda for a really pleasant and not unduly difficult mountain ascent The valleys here are wide and their slopes play host to some small farms it is one of the few places in the islands where you will come across farm animals Of interest too are the fantastic views across the ocean on a fine day to the snowcapped Mount Teide floating majestically above the clouds and the mountain peaks and lush valleys of Gran Canaria itself Before reaching Tejeda turn off to the village of Artenara to the southwest and what is undoubtedly the best restaurant view on the island The place in question is Mson de la Silla not easy to spot parallel to the main road A dark tunnel leads through the rock with no hint of what is to come then emerges on the other side of the mountain to a bright degree mountain panorama To the left the head of the valley green and dotted with whitewashed little villages it leads up to Tejeda itself but the more dramatic vistas are directly in front and to the right Here the scenario is dramatic indeed jagged peaks fill the horizon and many smaller ones are spread throughout the valley giving the impression of looking down on a minor mountain rangeLanzaroteArea  sq km  sq milesthe fourth largest islandPopulation Lanzarote is a startling place representing the triumph of civilization over a hostile environment and the entire island has been declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO Its pockmarked lunarlike surface  km  miles long and  km  miles wide is dotted with more than  volcanoes yet onions potatoes tomatoes melons and grapes all spring in abundance from the black ash Its most unusual farm crop however is the Cochineal Beetle that when squashed emits a red dye used as coloring for Campari and lipsticks Newer to the tourist scene than either Gran Canaria or Tenerife Lanzarote seems to have learned from the excesses of its sister islands Here small is beautiful and harmony with the environment is the philosophyThe South ofthe IslandArrecife the principal port and latterday capital is a characterless place with just two saving gracesthe Castillo de San Gabriel and the Castillo de San Jos The thcentury Castillo de San Gabriel situated close to the center of town houses a small museum of no great standing But it is worth the walk across the small drawbridge and over the lagoon onto the small island that the castle used to deter pirates The Castillo de San Jos a few kilometers to the north is a far more interesting proposition Built in the th century this wellpreserved fortress that once guarded the harbor it overlooks now houses the late Csar Manriques small but impressive International Museum of Contemporary Art This includes works by Picasso and Mir and is also notable for the contrast between the modern exhibits and the ancient structure that houses themThe islands major resort is Puerto del Carmen and its long golden beach stretches for about  km  miles and comfortably accommodates its visitors The sea is calm and ideal for families Restaurants of every conceivable type bars and shops line the Avenida de las Playas Lanzarotes one outbreak of mass commercialismThe old town just west of the beach has a charming small harbor area with traditional bars and restaurants and an array of marine adventures awaiting you Of these the Blue Delfin and the Princesa Ico both glass bottomed catamarans offer a variety of trips sport fishing charters leave from here also If you prefer seeing the area from the air albeit attached to a motorboat then Paracraft offers you the chance to paraglideThe road west leads through the beautifully tended village of to the rather more earthy Salinas de Janubio Salt Flats at Janubio Every spring for the Corpus Christi festivities the flats provide the salt that local artists dye into a variety of colors and pour onto the streets of Arrecife to create religious and secular designs see page  A little farther north are two more natural spectacles Los Hervideros is a section of rocky coast where the crashing waves break ferociously against the cliffs and sea caves El Golfo by contrast is a placid emeraldgreen lagoon set beside a cliff that resembles a gigantic petrified tidal wave just about to break This is actually the inner rim of a volcanic cone half of which has disappeared beneath the sea The strata colors and manic whirls are a fascinating sight Note that El Golfo is not apparent from the roadside Park your car on the rough ledge just off the main road on the left as you begin the descent into the village of El Golfo renowned for the quality of its fish restaurants and follow the rough footpath over the cliffThe newly created resort of Playa Blanca on the south coast the third major tourist center on the island is host to the Fuerteventura ferry a marina and a good golden beach However just a few miles east along unpaved roads are the best sands on the island collectively known as the Papagayo parrot beaches You will need a fourwheeldrive vehicle local directions there are no signposts and little else as on Papagayo naturism is the norm The Ganges Seis is a taxi boat that will drop you off there in the morning and return to pick you up in the afternoon An alternate way to get there is to take the Catlanza sl a modern catamaran that sails out of Puerto Calerothe highlight is when it drops anchor  m  yards off the Papagayo beachPuerto Calero just a few minutes south of Puerto del Carmen but with an entirely different ambiance is a rather new and dominated by its modern marina that is lined by a row of restaurants offering all kinds of cuisine Besides the Catlanza catamaran it is also the home port of Submarine Safaris which offers the opportunity to explore under the local waters The trip that lasts one hour and when it settles onto the seabed  m  yards or so down divers go out to feed the fishThe highlight of your trip to Lanzarote and the magical ingredient that makes this island so special is to be found in the Montaas del Fuego Mountains of Fire The Parque Nacional de Timanfaya which encompasses the mountains in its  square km  square miles starts just north of Yaiza and its boundary is marked by an impish devil motif This desolate national park was formed largely over the course of  cataclysmic months during  and  Eleven villages were buried forever and many of the people left the island for Gran CanariaDrive on and turn left at the small roundabout to the Montaas del Fuego Your introduction to the inner sanctum of the mountains leaves no doubt that at least one of these volcanoes in fact the very one that you are standing on is not dead just sleeping In fact less than  m  ft under the surface the temperature reaches as much as  C F and at the surface level it can at certain places get to  C F A guide demonstrates this by pouring water down a tube into the earth then beating a hasty retreat Seconds later a geyser erupts startling the diners in the adjacent restaurantCars are not allowed any farther into the park and from here coach toursincluded in the admission price depart to explore the incredible landscape Any badlands that you may have seen up to this point have been a mere appetizer for the main course The words lunar and alien are worked to exhaustion in attempts to describe the area and still scarcely do justice to the dramatic scenery This was caused by a massive eruption the volcano was active from September  to April  during which  houses were completely destroyed The last activity of the volcano began in  and lasted  yearsWith rain so rare and underground water sources extremely limited you may wonder how Lanzarote manages to survive as an agricultural island The black topsoil is the secret discovered by the farmers in their adversity The porous volcanic particles that make up the topsoil are useless in themselves but act as a sponge for the moisture of the night air obtaining water for the plants and eliminating the need for rain They are therefore piled on top of the crops and only need replacing around once every  years The other Canary Islands also use this methodThe most impressive example of this type of farming is the vineyards around the valley of La Geria Each vine is set in its own minicrater protected from wind and excess sun by a low semicircular wall of lava stones other crops are also protected in this manner The horseshoe patterns thus formed stretch way up the mountains and apparently into infinity producing an almost hypnotic effect Not only do the vineyards look good the end product also tastes very good and there are several bodegas in the Geria valley where you can sample the excellent local malvasa Those with an interest in wine will want to pay a visit to the Museo del Vino de Lanzarote El Grifo not too far away at San Bartolom de Lanzarote The Monument to El Grifo a Manrique creation adorns the entrance to this bodega that has been producing wines since the th century It is the oldest in the Canaries Enjoy the exhibitions of winemaking tools stroll through the vineyards and of course partake of the wine tasting sessionsThe North of the IslandOn an island so dominated by the works and creativity of one man it would be inappropriate not to pay a visit to the Fundacin Csar Manrique Taro de Tahiche Manrique lived here and as you might have come to expect it is rather unusual Built in  it is located over a river of lava formed from the eruptions between  and  and takes advantage at its lowest point of five volcanic bubbles to create the strange but nonetheless impressive living spaceThe geographic center of Lanzarote lies  km  miles northwest of the capital at Mozaga focal point of the islands viniculture Here the late Csar Manrique designed and erected a huge white modern sculpture Monumento al Campesino dedicated to the peasant workers of the islandA few miles north of La Santa home to the Club La Santa a timeshare development resort where athletes of the highest level come for both training and relaxation is the tiny village of Caleta de Famara It has windswept beaches with views of the daunting cliffs of the Famara Massif that lead up to the Mirador del Ro and Graciosa island There is not much to do along this coastline except sunbathe and windsurf but as the currents can be dangerous here be sure to take careTeguise is a fine old town of cobbled streets and gracious mansions and was the island capital until  Now it is calm and quiet for six days of the week On Sundays a handicrafts market comes to town where you can buy a timplea small ukulelelike instrument used by local folkloric musicians Several of its old buildings have been converted to craft and antique shops and restaurants Overlooking the town is the thcentury Castillo de Santa Brbara The views from this windblown point are worth the trip alone High on top of the extinct volcano of Guanapay the castle now hosts the Museo del Emigrante Canario where sepia photos and nostalgic exhibits tell the sad story of how mass emigration to South America was the only option left for many Canarian familiesCosta Teguise just north of Arrecife is a totally modern resort comprising several urbanizacines with timeshares hotels and apartments designed for a wealthy clientele It is no surprise to realize that the King and Queen of Spain have an official residence here and it is where they welcomed the New Milennium There is a handful of good sandy beaches particularly Playa de las Cucharas where water sports thrive and windsurfing is particularly popular Look for the championship golf course and the Ocean Park Water ParkThe coast road east passes the town of Guatiza where prickly pears abound and where cochineal beetles are still cultivated see page  Csar Manrique also cultivated the spiny flora into a beautiful Jardn de Cactus complete with a working windmill that produces its own gofio see page  There is more Manrique design to admire at the caves of Jameos del Agua opened in  this was the first attraction designed by the great creator where his landscaping talents have embellished and transformed a grotto and underground lagoon into a short fantasy journey Ethereal mood music accompanies your descent into the cave lushly planted with luxuriant foliage Peer into the black lagoon and you can pick out the very rare tiny blind albino crabs Munidopsis polymorpha which live here Resist though the temptation to throw coins into the crystal clear lagoon the attendant corrosion of the metal kills the crabs Finally you emerge from the cave into a South Seas paradise complete with its accompanying swimming pool In the evening the Jameos del Agua is transformed into a nightclub where folklore shows are regularly staged The Cueva de los Verdes Green Caves found a short distance away across the main road are part of the same system and were blasted through the earth by exploding lava There is a guided tour that includes some memorable sound and light effects evoking the menacing volcano most effectivelyAt the northern tip of the island is the small fishing port of Orzola This is the embarkation point for the tiny island of Graciosa a ferry service run by Lneas Maritimas Romero four times a day JulySep and three times the rest of the year With superb beaches and a complete lack of tourist development this is the place to get away from it all for the dayFor an unforgettable view of Isla Graciosa and much more drive up to the Mirador del Ro admission  ptas r This is yet another of Csar Manriques creations and one that certainly shouldnt be missed The views from here really are wonderful indeed and it is probably the most spectacular mirador in all the Canaries Huge cliffs curve down to the beach with Graciosa just across the water and with the two other smaller islands Montaa Clara and Alegranza in the background Combined with Graciosa and a small section of the northwest coastline of Lanzarote they form the Parque Nacional del Archipilago Chinijo The only sound here is that of the wind gently whistling through El Ro the waterway separating Lanzarote and Graciosa Besides its huge picture windows note in the barrestaurant some more of Manriques creative sculpturesAnother addition to the islands burgeoning tourist attractions is the Guinate Tropical Bird Park just south of the Mirador del Ro Within its  square m  acres of carefully tended landscaped gardens you will find over  species of rare and exotic birds and animals a new area where you can discover the world of Tamarind monkeys and of course performing parrots entertain in the theatreFuerteventuraArea  sq km  sq milesthe second largest islandPopulation Beaches on Fuerteventura still outnumber hotels At the last count there were  beaches along the  km  miles of coastline  km  miles of which are of yellow sand and  km  miles of black sand and stone giving it the best selection of beaches in the Canary Islands Enhancing these even more Fuerteventuras coastal shelf allows for the existence of shallow transparent waters that often acquire a beautiful turquoise color The island is situated less than  km  miles off the coast of North Africa and most of its sand is blown here from the Sahara giving a new meaning to the term desert islandFuerteventura is barren and windswept almost to the point of desolationor grandeur depending on your point of view So sparse is the population that the density  inhabitants per square km is the lowest of the islands Goats survive better here than people and they outnumber the human inhabitants However the harsh terrain can only support so many goats The females survive for their milk and famous Majorero cheese Blanco white or Rojo red according to the color of the crust A few lucky males are kept for breeding purposes but the rest are destined for the dinner tableThe wind whistles with great force in Fuerteventura and may even have given the island its name a corruption and inversion of el viento fuerte the strong wind However it is a wind that seems to be bringing good fortune to the island as the presence of so many windsurfers proves With the growth of tourism the island has become one of the worlds leading windsurfing centersThe NorthThe once sleepy fishing port of Corralejo has been transformed into the busy Lanzarote ferry terminal and a bustling resort popular with the British Although the old port area still has colorful fishing boats and some good fish restaurants the town is in the main somewhat less than inspiring and one of the least pleasant of the resorts in the Canary Islands favored by the BritishThere are two routes south to Puerto del Rosario the capital FV follows the east coast of the island and just a few minutes from the center of Corralejo there are some magnificent long white beaches and dunes stretching for some  square km  square miles These along with Isla de los Lobos have been declared a national park and are popular with nudists The island lies  km  miles offshore and its beaches are even more secluded than those on the mainland The fishing here is outstanding Glassbottomed ferryboats depart regularly from Corralejo The rest of the route to Puerto del Rosario once named Puerto Cabras Port of the Goats because in the th century it was used mainly for the raising of goats has nothing of interest for tourists and the town itself is a rather drab placeThe inland route south to Puerto del Rosario follows the FV and a diversion west along the FV will bring you first to the Zoo Safari Caldern Hondo There you can opt for either a halfhour camel trip or a  hour safari to the lunar landscape of the Volcano Caldern Hondo Next comes the lacemaking town of Lajares And if you really want to get away from it all continue on to El Cotillo This tiny fishing village on the east coast also boasts some excellent beacheswonderful for windsurfing plus a handful of local bars and some basic restaurants Heading back south from El Cotillo the FV rejoins the FV at the small town of La Oliva This is not especially attractive but it does feature two places of interest Just off the main road stands the Casa de los Coroneles House of the Colonels Its name derives from its thcentury tenants who once ruled the island The decaying creamcolored building still exudes a certain haughty if melancholy grandeur By contrast the nearby Centro de Arte Canario is bright and modern exhibiting the works of some of the finest living Canarian artistsA little further south just past Tindaya the road makes a dogleg towards Puerto in the east and if you look very carefully to your right you will see at the base of one of the mountains the Monumento a Don Miguel de Unamuno Unamuno a writer and vicechancellor of the famous University of Salamanca the oldest in Spain made himself unpopular in  with the dictator of Spain General Primo de Ribera His criticisms of the dictator resulted in his being exiled to Fuerteventura Although he fled to the somewhat more civilized Paris after a few months he loved to describe the beauty of the islands in his writing His most famous quote states that the Canaries were an oasis in the desert of civilizationThe Central AreaThe central mountain range is encircled by two roads the FV that initially heads west from Puerto del Rosario then drops south alongside the mountains to Antigua and Tuineje before meeting up with the main north to south FV just north of Gran Tarajal and the FV that loops around off the FV north of the range dropping into the Betancuria valley and continuing south through winding terrain to Pjara and Tuinije where it meets up again with the FV As you can join this loop from the north south or center and even cut across the mountains at one point you can start out from most parts of the island Starting from Puerto del Rosario take the FV diversion off the FV and follow it until you see the signs for the Mirador de Morro Velosa soon a gate man will demand  ptas r per person but this will prove to be a worthwhile investment At the summit and with commanding views of the surrounding mountains and with the Atlantic Ocean shimmering in the distance is a delightful combination of caf bar and viewpoint that owes its creative design to none other than Csar ManriqueBetancuria by far the most attractive and visited inland town on the island is an oasis of greenery on this barren island Although the riverbed here is almost perpetually dry the town is fortunate to have a high water table Because of its theoretical invulnerability at the heart of the island it was made Fuerteventuras first capital in the early th century However in  somehow the ravaging Berber pirates overcame the mountains which still provide a difficult drive today and destroyed the original cathedral The present thcentury church Iglesia de Santa Mara is a splendid building and hosts many interesting treasures Look at the unusual wooden beams between the flagstones on the floor the wooden altar and choir and the decorated pulpit Adjacent to the museum is a leather factorycumshoeshop set in an atmospheric old building Wander round this lovely little town and admire the view from across the bridge where there is an unpretentious restaurantbar and a gift shop Just south of Betancuria is the neat and pretty village of Pjara but a stop at Antigua on the other side of the mountains is in order This is reached either by continuing on the loop past Tuineje or backtracking from Betancuria and taking the FV across the mountains In either event once in Antigua the islands capital from you cant miss the traditional old windmill found just to the north of town and this is your destination Actually the Centro de Artesania Molino de Antigua Windmill Crafts Center is much more than just that and has something for almost everyones tastes Interesting crafts and a visit inside the windmill certainly but also ethnographic and archaeological exhibitions modern art an audiovisual room rooftop view points and an intriguing cactus garden not to mention a nice restaurantOf the coastline south of Puerto del Rosario the new cosmopolitan development of El Castillo also known as Caleta de Fuste is of most interest Activities here focus around the attractive horseshoeshaped beach where windsurfing is a particularly popular sport and the welldesigned marina In the marina there is an area where you can view the fish that frequent its waters and a small number of activities use the harbor as a homeport The Oceanarium is a catamaran that will take you out to visit the dolphins and whales and the Nautilus is a semisubmersible submarine that has twenty individual seatsThe SouthThe main attraction is the km mile long sandy shores of Janda that run from the narrowest part of Fuerteventura down to Morro Jable At the northern tip of the Janda sands are the beautiful beaches of Costa Calma not blighted as yet by overdevelopment Here a low cliff backing and a scattering of rocks and coves give the beach far more character than some of the seemingly endless stretches farther southThe Playa de Sotavento is worldfamous as a windsurfing center with activity focused on the F school at the Sol Elite Gorriones Hotel This has one of the best and most isolated beach locations in all of the islands Here the beach is very wide and flat usually empty and as the tides go out also very wet The dunes behind and a little farther to the south form an idyllic beach backdrop Urbanizaciones spread relentlessly all the way down the coast to Morro Jable which has some similarities with its northern sister Corralejo both are ports and resorts but in most other aspects are quite dissimilar Whereas Corralejo is flat rather dingy without many hotels and restaurants of much class and doesnt have much of its own beach Morro Jable built along the cliffs is bright and airy boasts numerous fine hotels and restaurants and has miles of wonderful beaches It is interesting to note that while Corralejo is a mainly British resort Morro Jable on the other hand is frequented predominantly by Germans There are more fine beaches towards the southern tip of the island but you will need a fourwheeldrive vehicle to get there Jable incidentally is the name given to the huge quantities of sands of organic origins that are frequently blown to the surrounding beaches Windsurfing obviously is all the rage around here and numerous companies operate in and around Morro Jable and the other beaches of Janda The Diving Center Flix  Km  miles north of Morro Jable offers dives and equipment rental Consider Unisafari based in either Janda or Corralejo whose professional guides will take you on a sevenhour jeep safari to the most wild least explored parts of the island
