             do you know about the space program   well actually at this point my understanding of the space program is a little on the limited side um     i think they keep it that way purposely   yeah well thats to an extent thats understandable   yeah its gonna take uh i think its gonna take a long time before they uh get that space colony out there   yeah   they uh i remember uh six five six years ago they showed on uh one of the scientific channels you know not Discovery but one of those old ones   umhum yeah   they had some professor on there who was uh building a it was like a it was kind of like a space station but it was supposed to be for people you know and uh experimental stages   yeah   and its supposed to be about ten miles long   oh its supposed to be more of a colony than a than a research lab   right right well they they were all gonna be research scientists out there and they were just gonna build it up and make it bigger and bigger   yeah   and but the initial stage was supposed to be about ten miles long which is i mean huge for i guess for space   yeah like a central unit and then everything else kind of rotating out from that   um no it was more like one big long thing it wasnt uh anything circular ive seen a circular pattern too uh  but i dont know if uh you know how far along they went with the circular pattern   yeah yeah   but uh like i say this was a long time ago and uh they this is one big long one that they had planned on and they had thought out how they were gonna uh regenerate the air with plants and stuff and they had a   oh okay they they had thought that out or hadnt   no they had they had thought out they had thought it out only the only thing was it was really really expensive and it was   yeah   not if you got to think about it was five or six years they said you know by nineteen ninety seven or nineteen ninety eight we would actually be able to uh to start launching this thing   yeah   and theyd have to take several projects to go up there before and add on piece by piece   yeah so it was all modular like you send up a small section itd be liveable for a couple of people and they send up another section and bolt it on and   umhum umhum right and then theyve and once it got big enough they would send more people up once it got established and they got all the systems working   yeah yeah well that sort of thing could work um   yeah pretty fascinating   what did they did did was there any indication what theyre going do about uh gravity   no it was pretty it was no it was a it was a gravity free environment they uh they had shown they had shown like at some sort of uh simulation on how it would be up there and they showed people floating around so uh   or were they just gonna let you bob around hm yeah   at at the point i dont think there was any kind of uh you know gravity control whatsoever   now what what theyve started figuring out lately is that gravity or some form of it makes it a whole lot easier to stay up there for long periods   uhhuh hm   some of the uh i ive heard little bits of stuff about some of their things they found out about that was was it one and a half year stay some Soviet cosmonauts spent up in space   uhhuh umhum   and they had some problems digestive tract problems and uh uh minor circulatory uh little problems but they could eventually become pretty big problems or if people people with with problems to start with that werent really noticed yet   hm yeah i can see that oh umhum   they they could generate into big problems um   hm no uh these these people definitely didnt look into any kind of stuff like that they were just talking about the space station itself and how were they gonna put it up there and spend all this money they uh   yeah thats why a lot of the um designs for space stations have been circular   umhum umhum   so they can get them spinning centrifugal force comes close enough to uh uh simulating gravity that theres very little problem with uh uh gravityless uh side effects   uhhuh hm   you know i dont know if you saw it was it two thousand and one that uh that double wheel arrangement   uhhuh yeah uhhuh right right right   thats uh one of the more popular theories   hm   they also have them where you got a long central cylinder kind of like a like a cross connection tube and a lot of pods sticking out from that central core kind of like a big pine cone like deal   umhum umhum umhum hm   or a bottle brush almost where the pods are all rotating in enough of a a   hm hm   a rotation speed so that the centrifugal force pretty much is one uh is is equal to earth gravity   uhhuh uhhuh   so   thats pretty neat hm then i would id mean it makes sense you know i never had thought about it you ever see the uh the EPCOT Center   no no ive not   the uh at the EPCOT Center in in uh i think its the the AT and T display they show a a bunch of uh future space pods and what life would be like out in space   yeah   its its pretty neat i still think its a long ways away though   well actually it needs to be put off for a little while for now just because theres so much money going into it that would be a whole lot better spent on on local problems   umhum yeah yeah   um the health care and and uh law enforcement uh   umhum yeah and and i tell you the  you know its expensive   oh yeah   just just i mean space programs themselves you know i uh i work in the uh in the satellite telecommunication business and putting up satellites is ridiculous expensive and these things are unmanned just a bunch of electronics we shoot out in space you know   umhum uhhuh uh the bulk of them probably have arent even pressurized   uh no no
