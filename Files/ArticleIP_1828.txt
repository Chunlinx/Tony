                                 New Yorks Loneliest Liberal            Ruth Messinger the favoriteto become the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York is being treated hereas a kind of anthropological curiosity After Messinger gave a major address afew weeks back the Daily News sardonically endorsed her as the Mayorof Mars observing with a characteristically light touch that her speech hadfurnished evidence of life on the Red Planet Messinger hasnt just lost theReagan Democrats who read or at least edit the citys tabloids A recent pollfound Mayor Rudolph Giuliani beating her by  points Among Jews bearers ofthe New York liberal tradition that Messinger represents Giuliani leads by thestaggering ratio of to            You haveto pity Messingerfirst because the brand of liberalism she is identified withwas the universal philosophy of the citys elite until a few years ago andsecond because nobodys listening to the second thoughts shes been havingabout it A couple of weeks ago Messinger gave a speech before a businessgroup in which she proposed to reduce the citys budget by  billion toforce workrule changes on unions to permit private contractors to competewith city agenciesthe kinds of innovations common in Republicandominatedcities like Indianapolis and Phoenix She even said in what passes in politicsfor a mea culpa  You learn a lot in two decades and I have TheNew                York                Times editorial page applauded but nothingMessinger does will remove the scarlet L from her brow Ed Koch the formermayor says I believe in epiphanies but adds that when he looks atMessinger he sees a younger version of Bella Abzug the hatwearingmegaphonic incarnation of the New York Left of the previous generation            Thats fatal and a bit unfair Messinger is actually notthat kind of New Yorkershe can keep her hands in her lap when shetalks Shes a child of the middle class who attended Brearley New Yorks mostrarefied girls school and Radcliffe from which she graduated in  Shehas a masters in social work Messinger is widely respected for herintelligence her studiousness her belief in the fine distinction But theressomething of the killjoy in her Shes brisk and pinched and a bitcensoriousyou have the feeling that she has a moral position on say Frenchfood            Messingers supporters claim that shes been typecast based on her milieuthepredominantly Jewish Upper West Siderather than her beliefs The problem withthis is that Messinger has a history of beliefs that look rather embarrassingin retrospect In  while a member of the City Council she hosted acomingoutofjail cocktail party for John R Hill who had murdered acorrections officer on the first day of the Attica riots In  she returnedfrom a trip to Sandinistaled Nicaragua to assert that women thereparticipated in everything and were ready to die for this freedom            In the City Council Messinger was generallyconsidered a staunch voice for tenants for children for the homeless and thepoor In the mids she proposed extending rent control from individuals tobusinesses a suggestion very few realestate developers have forgotten In she endorsed Frank Barbaro about the closest thing the city has recentlyhad to a Democratic Socialist candidate for mayor She consistently argued formore spending even as it was becoming clear that the Wall Street boom of thes was flattening out            Ofcourse practically everyone including Koch wanted to spend more than thecity hadthats what it meant to be a New York liberal In The Future OnceHappened Here  historian and polemicist Fred Siegel quotes Mayor RobertWagner circa  as saying I do not propose to let our fiscal problems setthe limit of our commitments to meet the essential needs of the people of thiscity The problem as Siegel notes is that the definition of essentialneeds grew exponentially forcing New York and other cities not only to raisetaxes but to scant such traditional services as parks and sanitation in favorof a whole new range of social services            By the time David Dinkins became mayor in  this kindof spending had made New York ungovernable The economy was dead the budgetwas in perpetual crisis and crime was shooting through the roof Dinkins didnothing to reverse the trend and in  four prominent Democrats includingKoch and Robert Wagner Jr son of the former mayor abandoned Dinkins infavor of Giuliani Dinkins was New Yorks first black mayor and his electionhad been heralded by Messinger among others as the dawn of the RainbowCoalition It turned out to be the last gasp of traditional liberalism            Crime anda broad sense of civic disorder probably had more to do with Dinkins defeatthan spending did But Messinger like Dinkins cannot find a way of soundingconvincing when she deplores crimeshe has spent too many years thinking aboutit as a civilrights and civilliberties issue Nor can she bring herself tosay that Giuliani was right about the merits of arresting lowlevel offendersand cracking down on qualityoflife violations            Dinkins lost to Giuliani by only four pointsNow it appears that many of the Jewish liberals Catholic union members andHispanics who had stuck with Dinkins are going to decamp in favor of aRepublican with the personal appeal of a Torquemada A Giuliani victory by morethan say  points is bound to be seen as a repudiation not merely ofMessinger but of everything she stands for But the truth is that urbanliberalism is not as bankrupt as the election is making it appear Reformerssuch as Harvey Robins a former top Dinkins aide and Ray Horton anindependent budget monitor have been arguing that the city could save billionsof dollars by targeting longstanding perquisitessuch as the endless array ofpaid holidays for city workers or large amounts of down time for cops andteachersthen investing the savings in parks and libraries and in restoringthe citys neglected neighborhoods They have made plausible arguments forraising some taxes and lowering others            Messinger has at least beenalluding to the new reformist thinking while Giuliani merely mocksgoodgovernment proposals as so much eyewash In fact in a truly remarkablepublicrelations coup the mayor has managed to gain a reputation as a pitilessreformer without reforming anything except the Police Department He hasdisappointed conservatives by treating rent control as part of natural law andby making no serious inroads on the citys bloated labor costs To hack away atthe mayors reputation Messinger has recently taken to issuing press releaseswith headlines like He Just Keeps Lying  And Lying  And Lying  Butit doesnt seem to matter Messinger cant break Giulianis stereotype orbreak out of her own
