                      WHERE TO GO        France is a large country of infinite variety so a great        many factors come into play as you decide which parts to visit Do you        want to see historic sights and tour museums and art galleries Is        weather important Do you want to lie on beaches or hike in mountains        Are there children who need to be entertained Do you want to do a lot        of driving or restrict your trip to destinations easy to reach by        train        To make the geography if not the choice simpler weve        divided the country into just five regions Paris and its vicinity        known to the French as the IledeFrance the Northeast Picardy        ChampagneArdennes Lorraine Alsace Burgundy and the Jura the        Northwest Normandy Brittany and the Loire Valley the Southeast        Savoie the Rhone Valley Provence the Cte dAzur and Corsica and        the Southwest BerryLimousin Prigord the Atlantic Coast the        Pyrnes and LanguedocRoussillon        It would be impossible to name every place of interest in a        guide of this size so we aim to give you a representative overview of        the country rather than an encyclopedic listing of mustsee sites        You will still have plenty to choose from        Depending on how much time you have you may want to combine        two or three of the regions in order to get a sense of the great        diversity of French life Paris and the wine country the mountains or        the Atlantic or Mediterranean coasts        The itinerary for a first visit to France is bound to        include Paris Ideally divide your stay  sightseeing in the capital        at the beginning spending a leisurely time at a seaside resort or in a        sunny village in the hills then shopping in Paris at the end A        relaxing vacation for example might combine Paris and the        IledeFrance with Normandy and Brittany And for stark contrasts  of        climate countryside cuisine and temperament  combine the capital        with Provence or Corsica        However the mix shouldnt just be geographic Frances        cathedrals museums and palaces deserve your attention but theyll be        much easier to appreciate if you alternate them with time at the beach        or on country walks And if you feel like being idle France is full of        quiet places where its a simple joy to do absolutely nothing        Many people do not have the option of going to France        outside the main holiday periods  Easter July and August But if        its at all possible plan your visit for the spring autumn or even        the winter when the big sightseeing destinations are far less crowded        Its best to visit Paris in early summer and autumn and the island        church of MontSaintMichel on the Normandy coast can be pure magic        in the mists of December        You will also have more opportunity to meet the French        themselves in the summer months many Parisians flee the city and the        whole country is full of foreign visitors You may find that you spend        as much time talking to Americans Germans Scandinavians and        Britons as to the natives        A tip for visiting the big museums in peak seasons go at        dinnertime on a lateclosing day        Getting Around        Even if youre the kind of traveler who likes to improvise        and be adventurous dont turn your nose up at the tourist offices        Tourism is a major factor in Frances economy and every effort is        made to enhance your visit Frances office de tourisme in your own        country and branches in larger towns throughout France can help you        with information brochures lists of hotels and bed and breakfasts        names of Englishspeaking guides and so forth Smaller towns will have        a syndicat dinitiative which provides the same services The official        Maison de la France Web site wwwfranceguidecom is also a        good starting place the section called Discover the Regions of France        directs you to local Web sites of tourist offices around France        The Handy Travel Tips section at the back of this book        page contains detailed practical guidance on the technicalities        of travel in France but here are some general thoughts to help you        plan your trip        First of all how are you going to travel The excellent        system of roads and public transport now enhanced by the Channel        tunnel makes the combination of car and train an attractive        proposition Take the train for long journeys and rent a car at your        destination to explore the back country Several special rail cards        include reduced rates for car rentals and even bicycle rentals        With the highspeed TGV train  grande vitesse from        Paris you can make it to Dijon for a visit to the Burgundy vineyards        in an hour and a half Lyon in two hours or to Avignon for a Provenal        adventure in under three Services also operate down the west coast to        Rennes Bordeaux and the Pyrnes The one frequently mentioned        disappointment of French trains is the relatively uninspired diningcar        service Dont despair make up your own picnic hamper from the local        market before you get aboard  cold meats salad Camembert grapes        baguette and wine can add a terrific sparkle to the countryside        flashing past the window        For drivers in a hurry the network of toll autoroutes is        first class linking up most of the major cities and still expanding        Otherwise its more fun to explore the country along the goodquality        secondary roads routes nationales with a number preceded by an N        Its wise to buy a detailed map of the areas you plan to tour these        will also show you the smaller D roads which are even more        pleasant        French drivers are adventurous and even aggressive but not        unskillful Patient driving is always a good idea but timidity is not        helpful in the Paris rush hour In fact its wise to drive as little        as possible inside Paris the priphrique ringroad runs around the        city and its worth staying on it until youre as close as possible to        your destination The mtro subway is the fastest way to move around        the city but the buses both in the capital and the other big towns        are best for taking in the sights Unless you feel really safe in        French metropolitan traffic keep your cycling  you can rent a bike at        many railway stations  for the villages and country roads Even so        Paris recently created miles of cycling lanes that crisscross the        entire city making bicycling much safer and more popular        If you have plenty of time at your disposal consider        renting a sailityourself canal boat or cabin cruiser and drifting        slowly along the Canal de Bourgogne from Dijon or the tributaries of        the Loire or the Canal du Midi from Toulouse down to the sea at Ste        Its great fun helping the keepers open the locks With a couple of        bikes on board you can always explore the countryside as you travel        Larger boats for up to  people plus crew offer organized gourmet        cruises        There is a great variety of places to stay from luxury        grand hotels what the French would call a palace and converted        chteaux and abbeys to simple country inns auberges and gtes ruraux         often a converted farmhouse where the farmers wife cooks your meal        Additional alternatives are house and apartment rentals and camping or        caravanning        However and wherever you choose to travel in France one        important piece of advice even if you cant speak French properly        its well worth learning just a few words The French always appreciate        that you have made the effort to say Bonjour Sil vous plat or Merci        beaucoup        The French are also a very courteous people Outside the        big cities make a habit of saying an appropriate Bonjour or Au revoir        when entering or leaving a shop or caf As you stroll around ramparts        or along the streets of small towns you will find that the local        people will acknowledge you with a Madame or Monsieur and a nod of the        head Respond in kind and youll soon feel at home        Being Berlitz well try to help you with some of the        simplest phrases at the front of the book The rest is up to you        Amusezvous bien        PARIS AND VICINITY        Paris and its immediate surroundings are a magnet for        tourists students businessmen artists inventors  in short        everyone except perhaps the farmer and fisherman who may well come to        the city to protest government policies A vibrant city Paris sets        tastes and fashions for France and the world        For years ambitious French people saw Paris as the only        place to make their fortune and so people from every region of France         with every local cuisine to feed them  are represented in the        metropolis Renewed pride in Frances provincial cities is reducing        this trend but Paris retains its aura of superiority  and its lack of        a distinctive cuisine        Before Paris became the national capital it was the home        of the medieval dukes of the region that is still known as the        IledeFrance  which by gradually asserting itself over other duchies        such as Burgundy and Normandy imposed its name on the whole country        The Paris basin is a treasury of national monuments Roughly bounded by        four rivers  the Seine Oise Aisne and Marne  the IledeFrance was        the birthplace of the first great Gothic cathedrals including        SaintDenis Senlis Chartres and Beauvais It was the cradle of the        French monarchy its surrounding greenery and dense forests also        provided good sites for later kings and nobles to build their chteaux        away from the troublesome mob of Paris at Fontainebleau Chantilly        and Versailles        All the interesting sights around the capital make for an        easy day trip by car or local train enabling you to keep your Paris        hotel if you wish although you would probably enjoy a change of scene        and find the local country inns less expensive        Paris        The city and the people of Paris share a boundless        selfconfidence that exudes from every stone in its monuments and        museums bistros and boutiques from every chestnut tree along its        avenues and boulevards from every street musician mannequin butcher        and baker from every irate motorist and every charming matre        dhtel        Youll readily forgive the bombast of some of the        monumental architecture when you see what makes this the City of Light        Stand on the Pont Royal in late afternoon and look down the Seine to        theglasspaneled Grand Palais bathed in the pinkandblue glow of the        river This unique light brings a phosphorescence to the most        commonplace little square or side street To make sure the message is        clear Paris offers golden nighttime illumination of its major        historical buildings To celebrate Bastille Day  July or the         Liberation August blue white and red laser beams are bounced off        the Eiffel Tower Arc de Triomphe and Htel de Ville        The Right Bank still conjures up an image of solid        bourgeois respectability Historically the stronghold of merchants and        royalty today it remains the home of commerce and government Faubourg        SaintHonor offers the luxury of jewelry shops and haute couture the        ChampsElyses claims the firstrun cinemas airline companies and car        showrooms        The Left Bank has in contrast always presented a bohemian        and intellectual image dating back to the founding of the university        and monasteries today the Sorbonne the Acadmie Franaise the        publishing houses and the myriad bookshops continue to exercise an        intellectual magnetism        An unceasing flow and interchange of citizenry from one        bank to the other takes place across the bridges of the Seine But        despite these migrations immigrations social change and urban        renovation time seems to stand still in many Paris neighborhoods        Areas may go in and out of fashion but each will remain instantly        recognizable to the visitor        Paris is one of the worlds most densely populated        capitals Its nonstop street scene derives from the fact that nearly        every one of its  arrondissements or districts has shops offices        and apartments side by side and on top of each other Get out and        explore the streets the open markets the cafs You will find that        each quartier has its own personality different people to watch and        something special to offer        The Seine        The river plays a central role in all visits to Paris Its        an excellent focal point giving new visitors an easy reference to        establish their location its a spectacular vantage point for many of        the citys great landmarks and its bridges and quays offer history        entertainment shopping and exercise Despite the roar of the traffic        on the voies express you can take delightful walks along the banks and        rest quietly on benches beneath poplar and plane trees        A guided boat trip will also give an excellent        introduction displaying in leisurely fashion  and with informative        commentary  sites including the Eiffel Tower the Palais de Chaillot        and Trocadro Gardens the Grand and Petit Palais the Palais Bourbon        the Louvre NotreDame and of course many of the beautiful        bridges        The PontNeuf neuf means new is in fact Pariss oldest        standing bridge completed by Henri IV in  It consists of two        spans straddling the Ile de la Cit and was initially populated with        streetsingers charlatans prostitutes pickpockets and above all        bouquinistes selling old books and pamphlets out of boxes Established        booksellers on the island were enraged and drove them off to the banks        of the Seine where theyve been ever since        The centrally situated Pont Royal built for LouisXIV in         commands some splendid panoramas with the Louvre and the        Tuileries Gardens on the Right Bank the Muse dOrsay on the Left the        Grand and Petit Palais downriver and the Palais de lInstitut de        France home of the Acadmie Franaise upstream        The Pont de la Concorde truly the bridge of the French        Revolution was erected between  and  Stones from the        demolished Bastille prison were used for its support structure         galling for Royalists since it had originally been named Pont        LouisXVI        The Pont AlexandreIII is undoubtedly the most romantic        with its Belle Epoque lanterns and melodramatic statues of Fame and        Pegasus        Right Bank        EtoileConcordeLes Halles        Start at the Place de lEtoile officially Place        CharlesdeGaulle but nobody calls it that preferably at the top of        Napoleons gigantic Arc de Triomphe from which youll get a good view        of the pointed star formed by the avenues radiating from the arch in        a tour de force of geometric planning        Over the years the Arc de Triomphe  m  ft high and        m ft wide  has become a symbol of the nation Napoleon        himself saw only a lifesize wooden and canvas model of the arch        LouisPhilippe inaugurated the final version in  complete with        basreliefs and statuary celebrating the victories of the Revolution        and the Napoleonic Empire        Victor Hugo was given a

from the Place de lEtoile house some        of the ritziest streets in Paris Avenue Foch is a particularly good        address The ChampsElyses stretches in a straight line from the Arc        de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde bordered by chestnut trees all        the way The first twothirds are lined with car salesrooms cinemas        shops and expensive caf terraces        After the RondPoint theres a pleasant shady park that        stretches down to the gigantic Place de la Concorde Despite its name        the square has had a tumultuous history  home to a busy guillotine in        the Revolution and the site of the Germans last foothold in Paris        in   and handles some aggressive traffic today In the center is        the most ancient monument in Paris the m ft tall

destroyed by fire during a        workers uprising in  Fragments of the royal palace are still        standing by the Jeu de Paume museum in the northwest corner of the        Jardin des Tuileries The gardens are popular with children who enjoy        watching the marionette shows riding donkeys and sailing boats on the        circular ponds In the summer months there is a ferris wheel Their        parents are happy admiring the geometric lawns neat flowerbeds and        classical statuary to which has recently been added a collection of        modern and contemporary works by such artists as Rodin Giacometti        Dubuffet Henry Moore and Roy Lichtenstein        At the eastern end of the Tuileries stands the pink Arc de        Triomphe du Carrousel roughly contemporary with the larger arch at the        Etoile visible in a straight line beyond the Obelisk This imposing        vista was originally planned for Napoleon to see from his bedroom in        the Louvre which was then a

     Shaped like a boat with the Square du VertGalant as its        prow the Ile de la Cit is the ancient heart of Paris settled by the        Celtic Parisii people as early as the third century bc In the        middle of the th century it fell victim to the urban planning of        Baron Haussmann The much praised but often insensitive prefect of        Paris swept away most of the medieval and thcentury structures        leaving only the Place Dauphine and the Rue Chanoinesse as testimony to        the islands rich residential life        The baron was also seriously thinking of replacing the        triangular Place Dauphines gracious gabled and arcaded redbrick        architecture with neoGrecian colonnades  but fortunately was forced        out of office before the wreckers could move in The place was built in         by HenriIV whose equestrian statue can be seen on the nearby        PontNeuf Today its sidewalk cafs shaded by plane trees are a world        away from the roar of the city        The massive Palais de Justice housing the law courts of        modern Paris holds echoes of the nations earliest kings who dwelt        here and of the aristocrats and Revolutionary leaders who in turn        were imprisoned here before execution        It also conceals a Gothic masterpiece the SainteChapelle        The delicate walls of thcentury stained glass Pariss oldest and        harmonious proportions give it an ethereal quality in startling        contrast to the ponderous palace surrounding it It was completed in         by the sainted King LouisIX to house precious relics such as        Christs crown of thorns The stainedglass windows depict        scenes from the Bible        Between  and  the chapel served variously as a        flour warehouse a clubhouse for highranking dandies and finally as        an archive for Bonapartes Consulate        The sinister prison of the Conciergerie  named after the        royally appointed concierge in charge of commonlaw

where husbands lovers wives and mistresses were allowed one        last tryst before the tumbrels arrived        The site of the great cathedral of NotreDame de Paris has        had a religious significance for at least  years In Roman times a        temple to Jupiter stood here followed in the fourth century by the        first Christian church SaintEtienne A second church dedicated to        the Blessed Virgin joined it  years later Both were left derelict        by Norman invaders and Bishop Maurice de Sully authorized construction        of the cathedral to replace them in  The main part of NotreDame        took  years to complete and in its transition from Romanesque to        Gothic it has been called a perfect expression of medieval        architecture with its majestic towers spire and breathtaking flying        buttresses        Despite its huge size the cathedral achieves a        remarkable balance in its proportions and harmony in its faade The        superb central rose window encircling a statue of the Madonna and        Child depicts the Redemption after the Fall Look for the Galerie des        Rois across the top of the three doorways The statues representing        the kings of Judah and Israel have been remodeled after the drawings of        ViolletleDuc the original ones were pulled down during the        Revolution since they were thought to be the kings of France The        heads discovered in  are now displayed in the Muse de Cluny        see page  Inside the marvelous light is due in part to two more        outsize rose windows dominating the transept To the right of the        entrance to the choir there is a lovely statue of the Virgin and        Child        As with many other Gothic masterpieces the name of the        first architect is unknown but the renowned Pierre de Montreuil is        credited with much of the thcentury construction During the th        century more damage was done by the improvements of redecorators of        the Ancien Rgime than by Revolutionary iconoclasts For the present        structure we must be grateful to the great restorerarchitect Eugne        ViolletleDuc who did extensive renovations from

purity of tone was achieved by        melting down its bronze and mixing it with gold and silver donated by        LouisXIVs aristocracy        If you have the energy to climb the steps to the top of        the south tower you will be rewarded with a stunning view over the        city During renovations and cleaning undertaken in  a lowwave        electronic system was installed to keep pigeons

times President Georges Pompidou lived        here on the Quai de Bthune much preferring it to the ponderous        Elyse Palace In the thcentury Htel Lambert on the corner of Rue        SaintLouisenl Ile Voltaire carried on a tempestuous affair with        the lady of the house the Marquise du Chtelet        The islands fine church SaintLouisenlIle is as        elegant as the mansions  bright and airy with a golden light        illuminating an attractive collection of Dutch Flemish and Italian        th and thcentury art and some superb tapestries from the th        century        One of the most notable mansions with highly ornamental        interiors is the Htel Lauzun  Quai dAnjou built in the s by        the great architect of Versailles Louis leVau        Today one of the islands greatest attractions is the        quiet poplarshaded streets to the western end of Quai dOrlans where        you have a wonderful view of the apse of NotreDame        Left Bank        Latin Quarter        Whats the origin of the name Perfectly simple from the        th century when the citys first university moved from the cloisters        of NotreDame to the Left Bank the young came to the quartier to learn        Latin        In those days luniversit meant merely a collection of        people  students who met on a street corner or in a public square or        courtyard to hear a teacher lecture from a bench or from an upstairs        window or balcony These days the students attend overcrowded        classrooms but the tradition of lively openair discussion continues        often over an endlessly nursed coffee or glass of wine in one of the        sidewalk cafs on the Boulevard SaintMichel in the streets around the        faculty buildings or in the everpresent cinema queues        The narrow streets near the exquisite th to        thcentury Flamboyant Gothic church of SaintSverin  Rue de la        Huchette Rue de la Harpe and Rue SaintSverin  give the feeling of        a medieval world updated by the cuisines of many countries and stuffy        little cinemas        In the Place SaintMichel students buy textbooks and        stationery and linger around the ornate Second Empire fountain        Directly behind the square sits the main building of the Sorbonne        Founded in  as a college for poor theological students by Robert de        Sorbon LouisIXs chaplain it took shape as a university under the        tutelage of Cardinal Richelieu Students protesting overcrowding        antiquated methods of teaching and stifling bureaucracy made the        Sorbonne a focal point in  When the police invaded its precincts         which for centuries had guaranteed student immunity  the rebellion        erupted into the streets The Sorbonne has since been integrated into        the larger Paris university system and lost its independence        Around the corner is the huge domed NeoClassical        Panthon It was originally intended as a church for LouisXV but is        now a secular mausoleum of some of the nations greatest heroes In the        crypt are interred the remains of Voltaire and Rousseau Hugo and Zola        assassinated Socialist leader Jean Jaurs and Louis Braille the        inventor of the alphabet for the blind The most recent hero to be so        honored was the World War II Resistance fighter Jean Moulin        Further up Boulevard SaintMichel away from the river is        the large Jardin du Luxembourg Despite their thcentury origins        these gardens avoid the rigid geometry of the Tuileries and        Versailles The horse chestnuts beeches and plane trees the        orangery and ornamental pond were a major inspiration for the bucolic        paintings of Watteau Every day these gardens attract a crosssection        of Parisians from earlymorning joggers to children sailing boats on        the pond and students reading on the quiet benches        Montparnasse        In the s Montparnasse took over from Montmartre as        the stomping grounds of the capitals artistic colony or at least of        its avantgarde American expatriates such as Ernest Hemingway F        Scott Fitzgerald Gertrude Stein John Dos Passos and Theodore Dreiser        also contributed to the freeliving mystique        While other quarters are known for their palaces and        churches Montparnasse named after a thcentury

that you can ignore and those you have        to look at twice and then there is the Eiffel Tower Monuments usually        celebrate heroes or commemorate victories or honor kings or saints        but the Eiffel Tower is a monument for its own sake a proud gesture to        the world Its construction for the Worlds Fair of  was an        astounding engineering achievement  pieces joined together by        rivets soaring m ft into the air but standing on a        base that is only m ft square        Like many other Worlds Fair exhibits the tower was        slated for destruction in  But nobody had the heart to go through        with it although there was no shortage of people who hated it        Maupassant for example signed a manifesto against this vertiginously        ridiculous tower and Verlaine rerouted his journey around Paris in        order to avoid seeing it Nowadays everybody seems to love it It has        a popular brasserie on the first platform an elegant gourmet        restaurant on the second and a view from the top stretching for miles        on a pollutionfree day        The tower dominates a quiet residential district that        houses embassies and government buildings        Bois de Boulogne        These hectares  acres of parkland on the        western edge of the city constitute one of Baron Haussmanns happier        achievements He transformed the old

      different ways to enhance nature by tidying it up while imitating a        natural landscape the French garden  which Versailles epitomizes         deliberately imposes a formal pattern        Resuming a tradition of classical Rome in his work at        Versailles Andr Le Ntre used the paths and avenues of trees and        statuary to divide flowerbeds ponds and fountain basins into        intricate geometric patterns Pause for a moment at the palaces        western terrace alongside the Galerie des Glaces for a first view of        his harmonious subtly asymmetrical arrangement of the grounds        As you make your way through the gardens look back        occasionally at the changing perspectives of the palace Directly        beyond the western terrace is the Axe du Soleil Path of the Sun        leading down to the Bassin dApollon LouisXIVs solar obsession        continues Adorned with sculptures of Greek mythology this and the        great Bassin de Neptune and Bassin du Dragon in the northeast corner        served as centerpieces for royal garden parties        Beyond the Bassin dApollon is the Grand Canal on which        the king kept his Venetian gondolas Today you

Madame de Maintenon where the aging king increasingly took        refuge        The picturesque Petit Trianon where MarieAntoinette        tried to hide from the Revolution has the allure of a dolls house in        comparison with the rest of Versailles Its gardens with ponds        mounds and shady woods are English in style  a relaxing change from        the formality of the chteau The childlike playfulness of the doomed        queens hideaway is reinforced by the Hameau a hamlet of thatched        cottages where she and her retinue pretended to be milkmaids and farm        boys        Chartres        One of the most moving experiences on a journey through        France is your first view of the silhouette of Chartres cathedral        towering over the city and the wheat fields of the fertile Beauce        plain Its a pleasant onehour drive from Paris and there are regular        train departures from the Gare de Montparnasse        This unquestionable masterpiece of French civilization        marks the transition in the th century from the solid sober        Romanesque style of the Churchs beginnings to the more airy assertive        Gothic of its ascendancy Apart from a few decapitated statues it came        miraculously unscathed through the Wars of Religion and the        Revolution        As you face the harmoniously asymmetrical western faade        the southern tower the Clocher Vieux is a prime example of        Romanesque simplicity whereas the taller northern tower the Clocher        Neuf is already lighter with its slender more ornate steeple        On the central porch the Portail Royal the stately        deliberately elongated sculptures of Old Testament figures contrast        with the freer more vigorous statuary that adorns the churchs        northern and southern porches        Perhaps the most famous feature of the cathedral is its        stainedglass windows Their unique Chartres blue and deep red        bring an ethereal light into the nave especially when the        lateafternoon sun is shining through the western rose window depicting        the Last Judgment Among the oldest and most famous of the windows on        the southern side of the choir is an enthroned Mary with Jesus on her        lap NotreDame de la Belle Verrire The church is dedicated to Mary        representing her times in the various sculptures and

abortive Canadian raid on Naziheld Dieppe on August        Rouen        Rouen is the ancient center of Normandys thriving textile        industry and the place of Joan of Arcs martyrdom  a national symbol        of resistance to tyranny Gustave Flaubert was born in Rouen and used        the city as a setting in Madame Bovary        Normandys capital suffered devastating bomb damage in         and many buildings have since been lovingly restored or        reconstructed The charming medieval and Renaissance center around the        cathedral has been renovated and is now reserved for pedestrians Rouen        continues to work on its monuments and public buildings and recently        has finished quayside renovations aimed at bringing life back to the        riverside with new promenades        To tour the center of the city start your walk at the        western end of the historic district on the Place du VieuxMarch The        old and new Rouen come together around the bright and airy market halls        and the attractive modern Eglise SainteJeannedArc Nearby is a        monument to mark the spot where Joan was burned at the stake in         Inside the church are

always the citys bustling        commercial center Its timberframed houses of the th th and th        centuries are marvelous examples of sturdy Norman architecture        achieving a pleasing irregularity in the way the plaster is set in        oblique forms between the solid oak posts and collar beams supporting        the balconies The elegant Renaissance arched clocktower of the Gros        Horloge is Rouens emblem its Eiffel Tower The ornamental gilded        clock face has only one hand for the hours        East of the Gros Horloge stands the great Cathdrale        NotreDame made famous in modern times by Monets many Impressionist        studies of its faade The asymmetry of the two towers embracing the        delicate tracery of the slender spires creates a distinctive        silhouette        The cathedral was constructed over several centuries and        the faade offers a remarkably harmonious anthology of Gothic        architecture The north tower the Tour SaintRomain has the sober        simplicity of the cathedrals early Gothic beginnings in the th        century while the taller more elaborate south tower the Tour de        Beurre is Flamboyant Gothic of the th century According to local        belief Catholic burghers subsidized this Butter Tower in return for        the privilege of eating Normandy butter during Lent The austerely        sculpted porches flanking the main entrance are from the early period        and the more ornamental elongated central porch and the gabled upper        windows were added in the th and th centuries The main spire is        neoGothic of the th century        The rather severe interior of the cathedral contrasts with        its elaborate exterior but the impact of the doublestoried nave is        lightened by the tall arches of the choir In the Chapelle de la Vierge        beyond the choir is the monumental Renaissance Tomb of the Cardinals        of Amboise with superbly sculpted allegories of the cardinal virtues        On the south side of the choir is the more modest tomb of the most        heroic of medieval English kings portrayed recumbent above the        inscription in Latin Here is buried the

 Flamboyant Gothic in the country Note the masterful Renaissance        carving of the oak doors on the central and north portals In the        interior the same exuberant artistry can be admired in the sculpted        wood organ frame and the stone tracery of the spiral staircase        Turn north on Rue Damiette graced by some of the towns        handsomest old houses The street leads to the

du Calvados a flat undramatic shoreline broken by a few        unspectacular chalk cliffs and sand dunes And then at am on        DDay came the first of a fleet of  vessels to turn the beaches        into beachheads with their now famous code names Sword Juno Gold        Omaha and Utah        Today the visitor will find an atmosphere of rather bleak        serenity that is in itself as evocative as the remaining concrete        bunkers and blockhouses some simple monuments on the sites of the        action and the miles of crosses in the military cemeteries        To see where the British and

conditions        that prevented the Americans from setting up their own artificial        harbor to land their equipment More eloquent than any museum are the         white marble crosses of the American military cemetery on a cliff        overlooking Omaha Beach at CollevilleSaintLaurent        The Utah Beach museum and monument are km miles        inland from La Madeleine near

MontSaintMichel        This island sanctuary at the border between Normandy and        Brittany is truly a merveille de lOccident  a Wonder of the Western        World  That first glimpse of the towering steepled abbey rising from        the sea on its rock is a moment you will not forget        Unfortunately the crowds of tourists in the summer can be        overwhelming and some visitors prefer to admire it from a distance        The view of the illuminated mont at night is spectacular from the other        side of the bay If you do decide to go in summer start early in the        day        The bay around the mounts granite outcrop has been        steadily silting up in recent years so that its an island only during        very high tides These are most dramatic during the spring and autumn        equinox when the sea comes in at a rate of nearly m ft a        minute over a distance of km miles This proved highly dangerous        to pilgrims who approached the abbey across the sands the causeway        joining the island to the mainland was not built until         On what was once a Celtic burial ground originally named        MontTombe the bishop of the nearby town of Avranches began by        building an oratory in the eighth century  at the prompting he        claimed of the Archangel Michael Then in  Benedictine monks        started work on the flatroofed abbey you can see in the Bayeux        Tapestry propped up on a platform with blocks of brown granite brought        from the Channel islands of Chausey km miles away        By the th century the abbey was surrounded by a        fortified village The pilgrims flocked here throughout the Hundred        Years War paying tolls to the English who controlled the surrounding        territory  though they never succeeded in breaking through the mounts        defenses After a period of steady decline the monaster y was        dismantled even before the Revolution It was saved from total        destruction only to end up ignominiously as a state prison        Beginning on the upper terrace with a splendid view of the        bay the hourlong guided tour conducted in English French or        German takes you through three levels of abbey buildings the church        cloister and refectory at the top the Salle des Chevaliers Knights        Hall and Salle des Htes Guests Hall in the middle and the        storeroom and almonry underneath        The abbey church combines a sturdy Romanesque nave with a        markedly lighter and more airy Flamboyant Gothic chancel The choir and        chancel do not stand on the islands granite core but on a platform        formed by three crypts with the massive columns of the Crypte des Gros        Piliers doing most of the work        In a magical space looking out over the sea the        beautifully sculpted columns of the cloister create a perfect framework        of grace and delicacy for a moments meditation With the cloister the        monks ethereally lit refectory the grand Knights Hall and the        elegant Guests Hall together make up the masterpiece of thcentury        Gothic architecture that earned the abbey its name of laMerveille        Future access to the island has been the subject of lively        debate  with suggestions of replacing the causeway with a bridge or        with boat service And there have been proposals to control sales of        fast food and souvenirs        Brittany        The province of Brittany as its natives will tell you is        a country apart proud of its regional culture and

often with characters in contemporary        dress all grouped in a square and entered via a triumphal arch The        elaborate interiors and decorations are attributed to rivalry between

  Baroque pulpit        More than  Old and New Testament figures are sculpted        on the calvary at Guimiliau The elegant Renaissance style lends an        unaccustomed sophistication to the

Parc Rgional dArmorique You can fish for perch and carp in the lake        or for trout in the Rivire dArgent Silver River or just glide        around the lake among the swans At the top end of the lake you wander        into dense forest through a fantastic chaos of rocks and grottos that        according to local tradition are variously inhabited by the Devil and        King Arthur himself        Carnac        Like the wild countryside of the interior the megalithic        monuments of Brittanys menhir country on the south coast take you back        into the legends and mists of time        Carnac is surrounded by fields with thousands of gigantic        stones menhirs arranged in mysterious alignments and patterns set up        over centuries beginning as early as bc Scholars have suggested        that the alignments are associated with cults of the sun or moon or        are astronomical arrangements for predicting such phenomena as        eclipses        The alignments occupy three main fields a short walk north        of town Le Mnec the biggest has menhirs in rows plus        menhirs in a circle or cromlech around part of the hamlet of Le        Mnec The field of Kermario has a dolmen chamber built of flat slabs        on pillars and menhirs in rows Among them is the Giant of        Manio a menhir over m ft high shaped like a clenched fist        Most impressive is the Kerlescan alignment  menhirs that form what        local legend calls a frozen army The best time to see them all is        early morning looming out of the mist or at sunset throwing dramatic        shadows        The Muse de la Prhistoire  Place de la Chapelle        exhibits artifacts representative of local life during the Paleolithic        Neolithic Bronze Iron and

longest river in France  flowing an        impressive km miles from its source in the Vivarais        mountains south of SaintEtienne to its estuary west of Nantes  but        the region of the most interesting chteaux from Chambord to Angers        covers barely a fifth of that distance        The route we propose for visitors driving from Paris        bypasses Orlans on the autoroute exits at Blois and after a side        trip to Chambord heads west on the N to Angers Just reverse the        route if youre coming from Brittany        For centuries the Loire river was a vital highway between        the Atlantic and the heart of France Commercial traffic declined        during the th and th centuries revived briefly with the advent of        the steamship in  then succumbed to silting and the onslaught of        the railways Today the Loire is a sleepy waterway running deep only        with heavy rains or spring thaws and its sandbanks and mud flats        become islands during the summer        Blois        Situated on a hill overlooking the Loire the town itself        invites the visitor to linger in the narrow winding streets that lead        from the cathedral to the chteau pausing to admire the handsome old        houses on the Place SaintLouis and the Rue PorteChartraine        The royal chteau of Blois is interesting for its variety        of styles  ranging from the th to th centuries  built around one        central courtyard The entrance to the chteau is through the        brickandstone gateway of the late Gothic LouisXII wing completed in         Across the courtyard on the righthand side is the chteaus most        distinctive feature the splendid FranoisI wing It was built only a        dozen years after the LouisXII wing but reflecting the contrast        between the debonair Renaissance prince and his dour predecessor is        a world apart in elegance and panache        The open loggias of its magnificently sculpted octagonal        stone staircase dominate the faade They served as a kind of        grandstand for courtiers watching important personages arriving on        state occasions The little beasts carved on the balconies and        elsewhere around the chteau are the royal familys personal emblems         including Louis XIIs porcupine FranoisIs salamander and Anne        de Bretagnes ermine        Of particular interest on the first floor of the        FranoisI wing is the woodpaneled cabinet study of Catherine de        Mdicis conniving queen mother and regent to three kings of France        Many of the carved panels each different were believed to conceal        poisons as well as jewels and state papers On the second floor in         her son HenriIII used not poison but a dozen men armed with        swords and daggers to do away with his archrival Duke Henri de        Guise        Chambord        Upriver east of Blois in a huge densely wooded park        surrounded by km miles of high walls the brilliant white        Chteau de Chambord is the most extravagant of all the royal        residences in the Loire Valley To have easy access to the wild boar        and deer which can still be seen from observation platforms in the        park FranoisI built himself this glorified room hunting lodge        Construction began in  and was largely finished by         Apart from its sheer size the roofline is the most        striking aspect of the chteau  a surprisingly harmonious blend of        cupolas domes turrets spires and chimneys It is believed that        Leonardo da Vinci whom Franois brought to the Loire Valley in         participated in the design especially of the central fourtowered        donjon  which makes a dream palace out of a classically feudal castle        keep  and the celebrated doubleramped spiral staircase in the        donjons center which enables people to go up and down without        meeting        The interior is sparsely furnished        From Blois follow the N along the right bank of the        Loire before crossing over to Amboise for a brief look at the exterior        of the chteau that housed many of Frances kings Although a large        part of the chteau complex is no longer standing it remains an        impressive site An unusual feature is the huge spiral ramp of the Tour        des Minimes wide enough to allow access for horses and provisions        Some of the interior has been refurbished in recent years and there is        a collection of interesting furniture Leonardo da Vinci spent his last        days in a small manor house nearby the ClosLuc now a museum        illustrating his talents A bust in the chteau gardens marks the site        of his grave Chenonceaux unlike the chteau the town is spelt with        an x is on the south side of the Amboise forest        Chenonceau        One of the most elegant Renaissance chteaux Chenonceau        and its famous long gallery are raised on arches to span the Cher        river The chteau was owned by a series of women including the        beautiful Diane de Poitiers mistress to Henri II and Catherine de        Mdicis        In the apartments in addition to fine thcentury        Flemish tapestries and French Italian and Spanish furniture youll        see Dianes neatly kept household accounts No one knows whether        Primaticcios vivid contemporary portrait of her as Diana the goddess        of hunting does full justice to her beauty        After Henris death his widow Catherine de Mdicis took        Chenonceau for herself and added the galleried floors of ballrooms and        reception halls that complete the bridge across the river        Tours of the chteau are selfguided and there are        impressive formal gardens and a large park Boat rides are available on        the river when the water is deep enough        Loches        To the south of Chenonceaux on the Indre river the        medieval village of Loches is as much an attraction as the chteau        itself The Collegiate Church of SaintOurs is an interesting piece of        Romanesque architecture it has two steeples at either end of the        nave which is surmounted by two octagonal pyramids in place of a roof        In the interior the narthex or entrance hall has some fine although        partially mutilated sculptures Over the nave the two hollow pyramids        appear to be designed in the style of chimneys for a castle        kitchen        Stroll along the Rue SaintOurs and the Rue du Chteau        then wander around the ramparts Particularly interesting is the        thcentury donjon keep that formed part of the towns southern        defenses Two thcentury additions served as prisons for royal        enemies        At the other end of the fortifications the terrace of the        Logis Royal Royal Lodge affords a delightful view over the village        and the Indre Valley Architecturally the lodge offers an interesting        transition from sober Gothic to more decorative Renaissance An        interesting feature is Anne de Bretagnes private oratory built around         and a masterpiece of Flamboyant Gothic style        AzayleRideau        With walls of dazzling white stone beneath gray slate        roofs the picturesque chteau at Azay reflects the waters of the Indre        river km miles southwest of Tours        It was erected in the early th century by FranoisIs        corrupt treasurer Gilles Berthelot  part of it on a Venetianstyle        foundation of timber piles closedriven into the bed of the river        Berthelots wife supervised the design and the delicacy of its forms        especially the slender conical turrets at each corner and the        doublearched loggias of the main staircase are the result The moats        and turrets  though Gothic in style  are purely decorative and the        staircase is noted for its innovative straight flights and landings        rather than the old spiral form that was designed to fend off        invaders        Madame Berthelot had the large vaulted kitchen built        almost on a level with the river so that an indoor well provided the        closest thing to running water and an unusually hygienic stone drain        sent back the slops You can see the kind of utensils and cake tins her        cooks would have used  at least until the chteau was confiscated by        the king for Berthelots misdeeds        There is a popular son et lumire on summer evenings        Saumur        Heading west from AzayleRideau toward Angers you cannot        miss the towering Chteau de Saumur The town is also known for its        sparkling wine and for the caves where about percent of Frances        cultivated mushrooms are grown The fascinating Muse du Champignon        Saint Hilaire Saint Florent explains the whole process and displays        fossils found in the caves as well as a troglodyte familys home        Angers        The capital city of Anjou is a perfect base for exploring        the Loire Valley from its western end this bustling university town        offers firstclass modern shopping in the pedestrian zone

th and thcentury Gothic Cathdrale SaintMaurice If        not the most beautiful the chteau is certainly the most formidable in        the Loire Valley a real defensive fortress its black ramparts still        forbidding despite having had their towers decapitated on the orders of        Henri III The chteaus proudest possession is the great thcentury        Apocalypse Tapestry narrating the gospel of Saint John in moving        detail Seventy pieces of this remarkable work survive out of an        original hundred        The beautifully restored ruins of the Eglise Toussaint

Victor Hugo        Gutenberg Paganini and George Washington here in Angers youll see a        plaster bust the bronze of which stands in the United States        Capitol        SOUTHEAST        The

resorts around        Mont Blanc Western Europes highest mountain can be as exhilarating        in summer as in winter Though less energetic life is equally        refreshing down on the lovely lakes of Annecy and Le Bourget        The Rhne Valley region around Lyon is the epicenter of        French gastronomy        And further south in Provence the climate and the slow        Mediterranean lifestyle take charge There are Roman ruins and        feudal fortresses to explore but you will also want to do some serious        lounging under shady trees and in sidewalk cafs        We also

duchy voted to become a part of France in  The French had little        interest in the Alps until the mountainclimbing craze was launched by        the conquest of Mont Blanc in  But it wasnt until  with the        first Winter Olympic Games at Chamonix that skiing  at the time only        crosscountry  attracted international attention Today the slopes are        packed in winter and some of the newer resorts lack the charm of the        traditional villages but the scenery remains unbeatable        However the high mountains lakes and spas of Savoie are        not just for skiiers Vast fields of wildflowers welcome the spring        visitor and in summer horseback riding mountain biking tennis        rafting hanggliding and paragliding now join the more traditional        activities of climbing and hiking        Even in summer you should keep a sweater and sunglasses        with you  for sudden changes in temperature and for the brilliant        sunlight Its also important to take the rarefied atmosphere into        account when exercising        Chamonix        The neighborhood around the church has enough        oldfashioned charm to retain something of the towns thcentury        pioneering atmosphere For a fuller sense of what it was like when        mountainclimbing and skiing were in their infancy spend an hour or so        in the Muse Alpin tracing the

station for an even more        spectacular view        Annecy        The old town of Annecy would be pictureperfect even        without the addition of a river running through it  complete with        swans a pristine Alpine lake alongside and a backdrop of snowcapped        mountains        Strolling along the waterfront promenades and through the        narrow streets and taking boat trips on

The Rhne Valley has always been        a central artery a channel for river road and rail traffic between        the north and the south It was the main path of the Romans invasion        of Gaul and the key to Lyons commercial wealth in the Middle        Ages        The farmers of the Lyon region benefit from a subtle        mixture of the cooler and damper north with the first hints of        Mediterranean warmth and light Some of the best food in the        country is produced here poultry from Bresse freshwater fish from the        Savoie lakes Charolais beef pears apples and cherries

part of any visit to Lyon superchef        Paul Bocuse is based here and has many local rivals In addition to the        great shrines of haute cuisine in and around the city you should seek        out the little bars and cafs and the oldfashioned bistros that the        Lyonnais call bouchons after the bunches of straw or foliage that        served as a sign for the restaurant        Its not easy to find your way around Lyon as the city is        built across the looping confluence of the Sane rhymes with Rhne        and Rhne rivers with hills on either side and a peninsula in the

deterioration in the cave walls and        the caves had to be closed to the general public A careful replica        that was created at LascauxII makes a satisfying alternative        Anthropologists

of        mammoths bison horses and reindeer are between  and        years old The Combarelles cave farther to the east is a long        winding gallery where the pictures are engraved rather than
