                okay   the public school systems well everybodys known has known theyve needed renovation for years but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it   uhhuh   the first direction that i can see or i wish i would love to see them go with kids learn at different rates and for too long theyve kind of lumped everybody together youd learn at this rate and thats the only way its going to happen   yeah thats true     youve got some kids thatll pick up on it in the first three minutes youre talking about it and the rest the other fifty seven minutes youve been talking about a subject youve bored them   yeah yeah thats thats very true um i guess i can relate to that because i have two kids that are opposites like that uh one picks up real quick and the other one doesnt and youre right they do get bored uh really fast if they already know what youre talking about what do you propose that they do what what is your suggestions   the educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with uh the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person   uhhuh out of each child   out of each child some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff other kids are going to be   each individual child   really into math some are really going to be heavy into reading   right   instead of pushing the scales too far either direction i mean its great to be well rounded and have be exposed to all this stuff   yeah thats   but why not hit the points the kids really interested in because if hes interested hes going to study it and hes going to learn it and hes going to remember it   thats true the only i think the only thing that they would argue about that is that you know every child needs to learn every subject i mean thats that might be the only thing but i mean i i definitely agree with you  um   they need exposure to every subject they dont need to be masters of it   right right thats true   everything i learned about ancient Rome has has not helped me anywhere in my adult life   um yes i definitely agree  theres no doubt about that i uh i i mean i can relate to that because im im going to college right now and i feel like i mean im taking this history class and i mean its so boring and i just hate it  and i think why do they make us take this stuff i mean what does this have to do with getting you know a computer science degree or whatever you know   what what type of history class is it that youre having to take   uh American History we have to take um like this is like early seventeen hundreds through i dont know i think like mid eighteen hundreds and then we have to take another one thats mid eighteen hundreds on up to basically present   well the early ones they could actually combine two two levels of it the one from seventeen hundred until   yeah   say the end of the Civil War combine that into one and then from eighteen sixty five to present and make that your second step because   yeah thats well thats basically what theyre doing   to a point to a point the bottom you know the early parts of it youre giving the foundations of the nation and but even then theyre skimming over theyre very trivial almost trivial with it   yeah oh yes definitely i agree   they want if i mean if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter i mean theres   yeah theres   they make all these people out to be oh they were great men and theyre the father of the country and all this he had just as much dirt on him as anybody else if not more       the man was not a saint   yeah thats true yeah any way this this um school system thing i i tell you i saw something on the news oh i dont know maybe  two weeks ago and they were talking about i dont know where youre from but im from the Dallas area and they were talking about the Plano school system that they had one school that uh if the students did something wrong i mean whether it was behavioral or uh you know they werent learning properly or something they took these students and put them basically in a closet with no windows they had a a table or not a table but a desk in this closet and they had to sit in there by themselves well parents were getting really angry  about this because they said why is my child being put in this closet well how is that helping my child you know and uh the the thing you know they said well were giving them isolation time and this helps them to think   but a lot of kids i mean if a child has uh claustrophobia i mean thats just going to terrify him you know and   if if the isolation concept really works that good why are our prisons overcrowded   uh thats true thats true but no i mean they were uh i mean i definitely agree with parents i think that is a very wrong way to handle uh disciplining a child putting them in i mean they were they were called they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms they didnt call them closets but they showed these rooms on uh you know on the news and i mean they looked like a closet to me you know with a desk in it a real small but they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms i said now what good does this i mean how is this helping i mean either way you know i i definitely had to disagree with that i think that is thats not the way to handle a child you know discipline a child by putting him in a closet   the the um as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that level the public school system i want to see changed too when i was brought brought up if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough you were going to get spanked well then the extreme came in and now we can no longer spank them so we now isolate them   right right yep uh   okay weve swung the pendulum both ways lets find a middle ground instead of there has to be some sort of discipline and there has to be some sort of punishment   right   short of physically isolating the child and short of physically hitting the child   well   lets put him into a situation where okay you crossed the line you broke the rule youre going to have to pay for it   right   but its going to tax you physically   uhhuh   i i dont   have the i mean instead instead have have them pick up around the school yard have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yard do something to beautify the school property   yeah thats true   but you cut you know the the kids having to give up his quote play time to   uh   pay his debt for what he did wrong but hes seeing something c onstructive come out of it   well um i have to i think one of the positive things i mean one of the things that can come out of uh is not just discipline discipline okay but okay for instance one of the things they do at uh my kids school uh they have what they call uh caught being good slips and when the kids are in halls and stuff and if theyre being really good i mean just being excellent theyre not you know cutting up and so on theyre just standing in line doing whatever they are supposed to they get one of these caught being good slips and then when they collect them at the end of each week they get to go to this little what they call their caught being good store and then they get to spend these like money well see to me thats positive reinforcement is much better much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids because theyre going to be good and try and earn those things you know to get the positive part of it i mean theyd rather much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked so theyre definitely going to work towards being good you know rather than trying to act up and be bad you know   i think that not only applies inside the public school system but in society itself weve been too long theres been too much negative reinforcement how much day like the caught being good slips how about just the John Q citizen out there on the street   yeah well thats true  i think i think really though i mean thats one thing that i mean my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be spanked but i really do try to use positive uh reinforcement with them at home also and it really helps and i mean they they dont get spanked very often but they they do when they deserve it you know but uh i dont think any kid should be exempt from being spanked i mean i i think i wouldnt mind if a teacher spanked my child but you know thats just my personal opinion and thats not going to i mean i dont think that law will ever change they are never going to let a a teacher spank a child again but i dont think i mean some kids dont get dont get spanked at home and some kids need to be spanked at home i mean dont you think   i most most most wholeheartedly agree     but i dont know   i mean theres a point of over kill but somewhere in youve got to find an even line   right right well theres so many parents that say you can deal with a child without spanking them which is true you can but there are times when a child needs to be spanked i mean they do things that they need that   need that shock effect where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked   right
