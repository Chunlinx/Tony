                      a brief History        Humans inhabited the Balearic archipelago as early as         bc  having most likely journeyed to the islands from the coast of        mainland Spain Neolithic islanders lived in caves and rock shelters        examples of which can still be seen on both Mallorca and Menorca and        hunted the only large animal on the islands a type of mountain goat        now extinct Many of the Balearic Islands are strewn with rocks and        boulders and these early peoples built simple stone houses and cleared        fields by piling the stones into dividing walls        Another skill with stones was evident in the islanders        deadly use of the sling which brought them onto the world stage and        into written history Indeed the name Balearic may come from the Greek        ballein to throw  The Carthaginians absorbed the islands into their        trading empire and founded the main ports but they quickly learned to        respect the slingers eventually recruiting thousands into their        armies By  bc the Romans had pacified most of Spain and sent out        an invading force Having conquered the islands they named them        Balearis MajorMallorca and Balearis MinorMenorca        The Romans built roads and established towns including the        towns of Palmaria Palma and Pollentia near presentday Alcdia In        the fifth century as the Empire crumbled tribes called barbarians by        the RomansGoths Vandals and Visigothspoured into Spain The        Vandals who destroyed almost all evidence of the Roman occupation        settled in North Africa becoming a sea power A Byzantine expedition        from Constantinople ousted the Vandals from the Balearics in         The Tide of Islam        Ignited in the Arabian peninsula by the teachings of the        Prophet Muhammad Islam spread like wildfire with its armies reaching        the Atlantic coast of Morocco by  Determined to impose their new        religion in Europe a predominantly Moorish army led by the Arab        general Tarik landed on the Iberian peninsula in  In just seven        years nearly all of Spain was under Moorish rule        The Muslim world which reached from Baghdad to the        Pyrenees soon fragmented with Spain becoming an independent        caliphate Under tolerant rulers the capital city Crdoba was        transformed into one of Europes greatest centers of scholarship and        the arts At first the caliphs were content to accept tribute from the        Balearics without imposing Islam But by  disturbances in the        islands prompted the Moors to deploy their newly expanded navy the        Emir of Crdoba conquered both Mallorca and Menorca at the beginning of        the tenth century By the th century the caliphate had splintered        into a mosaic of fractious states at one point and the Balearics        became an independent emirate        The Reconquest        The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the        Muslims After the recovery of Jerusalem in  it took four hundred        years of sieges and battles treaties betrayals and yet more battles        before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the        Moors        On  September  a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of        Aragn and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the presentday        resort of Santa Pona The defenders retreated inside the walls of        Palma but on the last day of  the city fell and pockets of        resistance throughout the island were also defeated Jaume I proved to        be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the        Moorsconverted by force to Christianityas well as of the islands        large Jewish and Genoese trading communities Mallorca prospered        The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual        tribute to Aragn and were left in peace The islands tranquility        lasted until  when Alfonso III of Aragn smarting over a series        of humiliations at the hands of his nobles found a pretext for        invasion The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed In contrast        to Mallorca Menorcas economy was devastated for decades        Jaume I died after reigning in Aragn for six decades but        he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he        had fought for so long to unite At first this resulted in an        Independent Kingdom of Mallorca under Jaume II followed by San and        Jaume III But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by        his cousin Pedro IV who then seized the Balearics for Aragn        Attempting a comeback Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in                A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic        Monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella completed the Reconquest defeating        the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula Granada in         However the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the        Balearics politically or economically        The Spanish Empire        As one tumultuous age ended one of glory and greed began        Christopher Columbus the seafaring captain from Genoa whom at least        three Mallorcan towns claim as their own believed he could reach the        East Indies by sailing westwards In the same year that Granada fell        Columbus crossed the Atlantic landing in the Caribbean islands        Spain exported its adventurers traders and priests and        imposed its language culture and religion on the New World creating        a vast empire in the Americas Ruthless avaricious        conquistadoresextracted and sent back incalculable riches of silver        and gold The century and a half after  has been called Spains        Golden Age  However the era carried the seeds of its own decline        Plagued by corruption and incompetence and drained of manpower and        ships by such adventurism as the dispatch of the illfated Armada        against England in  Spain was unable to defend her expansive        interests Burgeoning trade in the Balearics was interrupted by        marauding pirates based in North Africa as well as by the powerful        Turkish fleet        French and British Ties and Occupation        The daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella married the son and        heir of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian of Hapsburg The Spanish        crown duly passed to the Hapsburgs and Spain remained in their hands        until the feebleminded Carlos II died in  leaving no heir France        seized the chance to install the young grandson of Louis XIV on the        Spanish throne        A rival Hapsburg claimant was supported by Austria and        Britain who saw a powerful SpanishFrench alliance as a major threat        In the subsequent War of the Spanish Succession  most of        the old kingdom of Aragn including the Balearics backed the        Hapsburgs Britain seized Gibraltarin the name of the Hapsburg        claimantand retained it when the war was over In  Britain        captured Menorca and the magnificent harbor of Mahn Ma for the        Royal Navy England clung to it even when Bourbon forces captured        Mallorca at the end of the war        Menorca changed hands between Britain France and Spain        five more times in less than a century Britain finally ceded the        island to Spain in the year  under the terms of the Treaty of        Amiens        By  Spain was once more aligned with France and        Spanish ships fought alongside the French against Nelson at Trafalgar        Napoleon came to distrust his Spanish ally and forcibly replaced the        king of Spain with his own brother Joseph Bonaparte A French army        marched in to subdue the country The Spanish resisted and aided by        British troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington drove the French        out What British historians call the Peninsular War  is        known in Spain as the War of Independence        In the th century practically all of Spains possessions        in the Americas broke away in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars and the        few that remained were lost at the end of the th century The        Balearics further neglected were beset with poverty and outbreaks of        disease However toward the th century things began to improve on        the islands with Mallorca reaping the rewards of successful        agricultural crops and Menorca launching an export shoe industry        The beginning of the th century in Spain was marked by        still more crises assassinations and near anarchy The colonial war        in Morocco provided an almost welcome distraction but a disastrous        defeat there in  led to a coup in which the general Primo de Rivera        became dictator The dictator fell in  and when the elections of         revealed massive antiroyalist feeling in Spains cities the king        followed him into exile        The Republic and Civil War        The new republic was conceived amid an orgy of strikes        churchburnings and uprisings of the right and left In February         te leftwing Popular Front won a majority of seats in the Cortes but        across Spain new extremes of violence displaced argument        In July  most of the army led by General Francisco        Francowith the support of the monarchists conservatives the        clergy and the rightwing Falangerose against the government in        Madrid Aligned on the governments side were the Republicans        including liberals socialists Communists and anarchists The ensuing        Spanish Civil War was brutal and bitter and support for both sides        poured in from outside Spain Many saw it as a contest between        democracy and dictatorship or from the other side between order and        Red chaos Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany backed Francos Nationalists        while the Soviet Union supported the Republicans although less and        less towards the end of the war Volunteers from Britain and the US        arrived to fight on the side of the Republicans The war lasted three        years perhaps one million Spaniards lost their lives        Mallorca and Menorca found themselves on opposite sides        during the war Menorca declared itself for the republic and stayed        with it to the bitter end Mallorcas garrison seized it for Francos        Nationalists Early in the war the Republicans used their one        battleship to support an invasion of Mallorca but it ended in failure        A decisive factor was the presence in Palma of Italian air squadrons        used to bomb republican Barcelona        New Horizons        Exhausted after the Civil War Spain remained on the        sidelines during World War II and began to recover economically under        the oppressive lawandorder regime of Franco There had been a        foretaste of elite foreign tourism in the s but it was the late        s when the rest of Europe began sunseeking pilgrimages to Spain        Tourism exploded into an annual southern migration transforming the        Spanish economy landscape and society Eager to capitalize the        country poured its soul into mass tourism which triggered a rash of        indiscriminate building on the southern and eastern coastlines with        scant regard for tradition or aesthetics But after so many years        closed off from the rest of Europe of equal significance was the        injection of foreign influences into Francos once hermetically sealed        Spain Mallorca and Menorca in particular saw explosive growth in        tourism by the s the Balearics were one of Europes most popular        holiday destinations        Franco named as his successor the grandson of Alfonso XIII        who was enthroned as King Juan Carlos I when the dictator died in         To the dismay of Franco diehards the king brilliantly managed the        transition to democracy then stood back to allow it full rein even        intervening during a brief attempt at a military coup After many years        of repression new freedoms and autonomy were granted to Spanish        regions including the Balearics and their languages and cultures        enjoyed a longdesired renaissance        More a part of Europe than ever before Spain joined the        European Community now European Union in  giving further boost        to a booming economy The tourist industry continued to expand and        though it became one of the top two income earners in Spain a        realization that unrestricted mass tourism was leading to damaging        longterm consequences also began to grow By the late s a new        emphasis on quality and especially in the Balearics on safeguarding        the environment had finally taken roottoo late for many        environmentalists but hopefully still in time to preserve much of the        natural beauty and unique character of the Las Islas Baleares
