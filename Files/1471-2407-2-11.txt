                    Background        With breakthroughs in molecular biology basic        immunology and biotechnology great progress has been made        in the field of tumor immunology An increasing number of        tumor antigens have been identified     Tumor vaccines        have been successful in eliciting tumorspecific CD        andor CD T cell responses However when T cells        reactive against tumor antigens are expanded ex vivo and        then transferred back into tumorbearing hosts results        have been mixed in treating both melanoma      and        lymphoma       Several explanations for these        variable results have been suggested by studies of T cell        immunity in mice involving experimental tumors derived        from inoculation of cell lines In some circumstances CD        and CD T cells were rendered inactive in tumorbearing        hosts     The inactivation of CD T cells has been        attributed either to the tumor cells themselves or to bone        marrowderived cells       whereas antigen        ignorance or loss of memory have been postulated to        underlay that of CD T cells      Other studies        have suggested that tumor cells can secrete        immunosuppressive factors such as TGF or express Fas        ligand to induce apoptosis of infiltrating lymphocytes              Furthermore the tumor vasculature appears to be        quite different from normal blood vessels in terms of        structural organization interstitial pressure and flow        patterns     and in reduced lymphocyte and natural        killer cell homing and adhesion        The        existence of significant barriers to effective        immunological destruction is further illustrated by a mouse        model of concurrent multistage tumorigenesis and        antioncogene autoimmunity wherein progenitor dysplastic        lesions are infiltrated and disrupted while solid tumors        are not     The hypothesis is that the        microenvironment of certain types of solid tumor can serve        to locally suppress T cell infiltration In such cases one        of the challenges for tumor immunology is to find effective        means to overcome these barriers to productive efficacious        antitumor immunity        Herein we sought to modulate antitumor immunity in a        transgenic mouse tumor model in which an oncogene SV        large T antigen Tag is expressed in islet beta cells        under the control of the rat insulin promoter Rip            Several lines of RipTag mice have been generated and        characterized Depending on the temporal and spatial order        of Tag expression the RipTag mice are either        immunologically tolerant or responsive to Tag             Mice in the RipTag line begin to express Tag during        embryogenesis The mice show systemic tolerance to Tag        mounting neither humoral nor cellular immune responses to        Tag upon immunization of purified protein             RipTag mice display a reproducible pattern of multistage        tumor development from normal islets to        hyperplasticdysplastic islets to angiogenic islets to        varying grades of solid tumor with a welldefined        angiogenic progression     All RipTag mice succumb        to hypoglycemia and tumor burden by  weeks Mice with        transgenes encoding T cell receptors from Hkrestricted        CD and CD T cell clones specific for Tag have been        generated      When RipTag was crossed to TCR        transgenic mice TCR carrying Tagspecific CD T cells        temporal induction of T cell tolerance to Tag was detected        in the pancreatic draining lymph nodes in the double        transgenic mice     The T cell tolerance is manifested        in reductions both of idiotypic CD T cell abundance and        of the T cell proliferation response to Tag in vitro        Another line of RipTag mice RipTag has a different        spatial and temporal order of Tag expression     Tag        expression begins at approximately  weeks of age Several        weeks later a spontaneous autoimmune response to Tag is        readily detectable with significant lymphocyte        infiltration of hyperplasticdysplastic islets Mice in        this line readily mount a humoral and CTL response to Tag        and as such are nontolerant Infiltration of premalignant        lesions is variable and occasionally intense but is        minimal in solid tumors Crosses of RipTag mice to        transgenic mice that either increased the abundance of        antiTag CD T cells TCR    or rendered the tumor        cells costimulatory RipB    dramatically        enhanced the infiltration of premalignant lesions but not        of solid tumors     Additionally ex vivo stimulated        Tagspecific CD T cells were transferred into RipTag        Like many of the adoptive transfers of tumorspecific T        cells in clinical cases          no significant        lymphocyte infiltration into solid tumor was detected            If however RipTag mice were treated with lethal        radiation and subsequent reconstitution with bone marrow        from RAG deficient mice prior to T cell transfer modest        lymphocyte infiltration into solid tumors was noted            however this study did not assess the efficacy of that        response Sublethal irradiation has been successfully used        to decrease tumor burden in combination with a        cytokineproducing tumor vaccine in a murine renal cell        carcinoma lung metastases model            In the current study we sought to achieve efficacious        antitumor immunity by disrupting the evident barriers        presented by solid tumors in the RipTag model We chose        the RipTag line for its phenotype of rapid largely        synchronous tumorigenesis and its systemic tolerance        reasoning that effects of experimental manipulations could        be readily distinguished Lethal dose radiation followed by        bone marrow transplant can significantly impair the        responsiveness of antitumor CD T cells dendritic cells        eosinophiles and macrophages     and is a clinically        undesirable therapeutic modality Therefore we        hypothesized that sublethal radiation might be more        effective and clinically acceptable in promoting antitumor        immunity The results presented in this study suggest that        sublethal radiation is effective in augmenting adoptive        antitumor immunity in the RipTag model underscoring        the potential value of perturbing the tumor        microenvironment as well as the lymphoid compartment to        enhance antitumor immunity                    Materials and methods                  Mice          RipTag mice carry the SV early region under          control of rat insulin II promoter     The          transgenic mice were maintained on CHeBFe background          with  generations of backcross RipTag mice have           incidence of spontaneous insulinoma TagTCR          referred to hereafter as TCR transgenic mice expressing          a T cell receptor transgene with specificity to Tag were          generated in the BDF background and backcrossed to          CHeBFe for  generations     About  of the          splenic CD T cells in this transgenic line express the          TCR transgene     All RipTag in all treatment          groups received the same diet throughout the experiment          All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance          with NIH and University of California San Francisco          guidelines                          Intervention and regression trials          The Intervention trial was initiated when RipTag          mice reached the age of  weeks Mice were sacrificed at           weeks of age for the determination of tumor burden          The Regression Trial started at the age of  weeks          about  days after birth The end point was at           weeks of age In both cases cohorts of RipTag mice          were set up for survival study Mice were euthanized when          they became moribund                          Radiation of

in DMEM containing  FBS filtered through          a  M sterile nylon filter counted by hemacytometer          and suspended in complete medium The cells were adjusted          to a density of    cellsml and injected into the          intraperitoneal space of RipTag mice Each mouse in          the treatment received  ml of splenocytes             cells In the group that received both radiation and          splenocyte transfer mice were irradiated at R one day          prior to splenocyte transfer                          Calculation of tumor burden          RipTag mice in each treatment were sacrificed at          the defined end points Solid tumors were isolated          photographed and measured The tumor volume was          calculated using the following formula volume             width  length Tumor burden per mouse was defined          as the sum of the volume of all macroscopic tumors          Intestinal carcinoid tumors appear occasionally in          RipTag mice Such tumors are associated with this          particular line of RipTag transgenic mice but not          others and were not the result of any of the treatments          in the study Thus these

designs for          the treatment of tumors RipTag mice intervention and          regression     In each trial we used three          experimental arms as well as an untreated control group          the treatment arms were adoptive transfer of tumor          antigen specific T cells a sublethal dose of radiation          R or radiation followed by adoptive transfer In          the intervention trial treatment occurred at a time when          small encapsulated adenomas are forming week  for          RipTag mice The data are summarized in Figure  The          mean tumor volume at the start of the trial was  mm           The average number of tumors was  At the end of the          study the mean tumor burden in the untreated control          group was about  mm in volume and  in tumor number          Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from TCR transgenic mice          into RipTag mice produced a modest but not          statistically significant reduction in tumor volume           and no change in tumor number Sublethal          radiation alone significantly reduced tumor volume           p   but the mice had a similar number of tumors           With the combination treatment a significant          reduction in both tumor volume  p   and          tumor number was observed It is notable that the mice          receiving the combination treatment had a mean tumor          volume of  mm p   and an average tumor          number of  comparable to the situation at the          beginning of the trial Thus a condition of stable          disease was achieved in the group that received the          combinatorial therapy          In the regression trial RIPTag mice with          substantial tumor burden and minimal life expectancy were          treated beginning at week      The average tumor          volume was around  mm at the start of the treatment          Figure  The tumor burden of the untreated control          group at the end of the study was  mm  No reduction          in tumor burden was observed following adoptive transfer          of nontransgenic splenocytes alone  of controls          In contrast sublethal radiation alone resulted in a          significant reduction of tumor burden  p            The combinatorial treatment produced an even greater          reduction in tumor burden  p   The average          tumor number in all groups was similar about  As          observed in the intervention trial tumor burden in the          group receiving the combinatorial treatment had remained          virtually unchanged Thus even with substantial tumor          burden the combination of sublethal radiation and          splenocyte transfer could stop tumor growth during the          course of the study                          Sublethal radiation increases lymphocyte          infiltration of tumors          Because the combination of sublethal radiation and          TCR splenocyte transfer lead to significant reduction in          tumor burden in both intervention and regression trials          we asked whether the radiation had increased the number          of tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes Tissue samples were          collected three weeks after treatment in the regression          trial Immunohistochemistry was used to detect CD  CD          and CDc cell infiltration into the tumors Because          RipTag mice are inherently tolerant to Tag little          infiltration by either T lymphocytes or dendritic cells          was observed in the untreated control group Figure           In agreement with previous observations little          infiltration was detected in RipTag mice receiving TCR          splenocyte transfer Figure  Nor did radiation alone          elicit T cell infiltration although a modest increase in          CDc dendritic cell infiltration was observed However          in both intervention and regression trials significant          CD T cell and CD T cell infiltration into          hyperplasticdysplastic islets and tumors was noted in          RipTag mice that had received the combination of          sublethal radiation and adoptive transfer of TCR          splenocytes A modest increase in CDc dendritic cell          infiltration was observed in the mice receiving the          combination therapy One should recall that the TCR mice          express a CDrestricted TCR and thus produce increased          numbers of antiTag CD T cells and thus we anticipated          a bias in numbers toward this T cell type Indeed one          week after treatment little CD T infiltration of          premalignant or malignant lesions was detected in          RipTag mice receiving the combinatorial treatment          data not shown However three weeks after          combinatorial treatment in the regression trial          significant CD T cell infiltration was observed in          solid tumors suggesting a broadening of the T cell          response from that contained in the adoptive          transfer                          Combining adoptive transfer and sublethal          radiation prolongs survival          The trials above used defined endpoints  week and           week to allow comparison of cumulative tumor volume          and number To evaluate the effects of the various          treatments on survival we performed intervention and          regression trials on cohorts of RipTag mice in which          groups received no treatment radiation alone or the          combinatorial treatment in which the endpoint was          survival Because splenocyte transfer alone had resulted          in no significant reduction in tumor burden this group          was not tested for survival benefit for logistical          reasons All RipTag mice in the study eventually          succumbed to their cancers Although radiation treatment          alone impaired tumor growth in both intervention and          regression trials it produced no significant extension          of survival time in either trial Figure  In contrast          there was a significant extension of survival of cohorts          receiving the combinatorial treatment in the intervention          and regression trials The effect was pronounced in the          intervention trial with an extension of survival of           weeks p   logrank In the regression trial          the extension of survival time was about  weeks p            logrank No extension of survival time was          observed in mice treated with R and syngeneic CH          splenocytes p   logrank Thus the observed          reduction of tumor burden produced by the combinatorial          treatment translated into significant survival advantage          and the effect was dependent on the increased frequency          of tumorantigen specific T cells from the TCR          transgenic          Because the single combination treatment lead to clear          therapeutic benefits and yet did not eradicate          established tumors we asked whether mice would benefit          from repeated treatments Both intervention and          regression trials were conducted RipTag mice were          given the combination treatment at weeks and again at          weeks of age for an intervention trial or at  and          weeks for a regression trial Survival was monitored          over time The results show no added survival benefit          when the treatment regimen was repeated Figure  The          mean survival time was statistically equivalent to that          observed in the groups given a single combinatorial          treatment in the intervention trial and in the          regression trial the cohort given a double combinatorial          treatment showed no significant extension of survival          time as compared to untreated controls p            logrank                            Discussion        Previous studies using lethal dose radiation and bone        marrow transplant prior to CD T cell transfer in another        RipTag line of mice indicated that such treatment could        produce a modest increase in the number of        tumorinfiltrating T cells     The current study        extends the thesis by focusing on the use of sublethal        radiation to enhance the antitumor immunity of adoptively        transferred tumorantigenspecific lymphocytes in RipTag        mice The splenocytes were derived from T cell receptor        transgenic mice that preferentially enhanced development of        CD T cells recognizing a peptide within the SV large T        oncoprotein     While the transfer of naive        splenocytes from the TCR transgenic mice had no effect on        tumor development sublethal radiation prior to lymphocyte        transfer resulted in significant reduction in tumor burden        in both intervention and regression trials In addition        RipTag mice receiving the combinatorial treatment had        significantly longer survival time than those receiving        single treatment        Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that the        combinatorial treatment dramatically increased the level of        infiltration by CD lymphocytes and CDc dendritic cells        into solid tumors Due to the nature of this line of TCR        transgenic mice only about  of splenic CD T cells are        Tagspecific Thus it is possible that some of the        tumorinfiltrating CD T cells may recognize targets        other than Tag This may be the result of the bystander        effects induced by the tumorinfiltrating Tagspecific        CD T cells The elucidation of this phenomenon with        idiotypespecific antibodies or tetramers in future        experiments would clarify the extent of bystander effects        in this model Although delayed when compared to CD T        cell infiltration CD T cell infiltration became more        extensive over time We speculate that the        tumorinfiltrating CD T cells would induce the        activation and tumorinfiltration of CD T cells present        in the transferred transgenic splenocytes This pattern as        well as the origin of the splenocytes suggests that CD T        cells can play a predominant and effective role in        controlling tumor growth        Previous studies have indicated that solid tumors can be        resistant to the infiltration of tumorspecific T cells        The data presented here suggest that such resistance can be        disrupted by sublethal radiation Several possible        mechanisms for the enhancing effects of sublethal        radiation on antitumor immunity can be envisioned as        discussed below First sublethal radiation may reduce        antigenspecific immune tolerance mediated by bone        marrowderived cells including regulatory T cells in the        tumordraining lymph nodes Previous studies have shown        that adoptively transferred tumor antigenspecific CD T        cells can be tolerized in the secondary lymphoid organs             including the RIPTag model     Radiation may        kill or disable regulatory T cells      or other        bone marrowderived tolerizing cells and prevent the        induction of tolerance in adoptively transferred        tumorspecific T cells     Additionally the high but        sublethal dose of radiation used leads to significant        lymphopenia     The sudden reduction in lymphocyte        number may create the spatial allowance in spleen and lymph        nodes necessary for the homing activation and expansion of        he adoptivelytransferred T cells The increase of        tumorspecific CD T cells in the tumordraining lymph        nodes could then enhance the infiltration of T cells inside        the solid tumors        Second radiationinduced damage or abnormality may        induce a tissue damage signal in the solid tumors through        radiationmediated apoptosis     There is mounting        evidence that apoptotic cell death is not immunologically        benign but can trigger immune responses      For        example cells treated with ultraviolet radiation can        provide potent adjuvant function in vivo            Sublethal radiation could result in altered expression of        pro or antiinflammatory chemokines      or        increased expression of T cell costimlulatory molecules        ie B on tumor cells     Radiation has been        shown to increase the expression of MHC class I and II        molecules in tumor cell lines      Thus the tissue        damage signals evoked by ionizing radiation may trigger the        activation and infiltration of antigenpresenting cells in        particular dendritic cells        Indeed in the        regression study we observe some increase of        tumorinfiltrating dendritic cells in the group receiving        the single radiation treatment It is possible that        radiationinduced tumorinfiltrating dendritic cells may        facilitate sustained activation and infiltration of the        adoptively transferred CD T cells in solid tumors in the        combination group        Third radiation may alter the biophysical structures of        tumors which in some tumors has the capability to impair        the infiltration or function of tumorspecific T cells For        example in the related RipTag model the vascular        addressins GlyCAM and MAdCAM are expressed in        premalignant islets but downregulated in solid tumors        their downregulation coincides with lack of infiltration in        this model of spontaneous antitumor immunity     It        is possible that sublethal radiation is altering the        expression of endothelial adhesion molecules allowing        binding and extravasation of activated tumorspecific        lymphocytes Another study suggested that liver endothelial        cells can induce antigenspecific tolerance of CD T cells            Perhaps RIPTag tumor endothelium develops a        similar capability to induce tolerance to extravasating CD        T cells a capability disrupted by radiation        Finally it is worth noting that the tumors in RipTag        mice are not only highly vascularized but also visibly and        histologically hemorraghic The hemorraghic phenotype        persisted in all single agent trials but the combination        trial was distinct The mice in the combination treatment        group typically had white tumors that lacked visible        microhemorrhaging A recent study has suggested that        tumorspecific CD T cells can exert antitumor effects        by inhibiting angiogenesis via release of IFN            Thus the white tumors noted in the current study may be        indicative of angiogenic inhibition by the infiltrating        tumorspecific CD T cells and such inhibition may be        relevant to the observed efficacy An analysis of the tumor        vasculature in the combination trial by immunohistochemical        staining for the endothelial cell marker CD revealed no        obvious structural or density changes in tumor blood        vessels data not shown Future analysis of molecular        markers of the tumor vasculature during and after the        combinatorial treatment will explore the possibility that        more subtle vascular changes are responsible for the        observed efficacy        While the underlying mechanisms remain unknown it is        evident that a combination of sublethal radiation and the        transfer of tumorspecific CD lymphocytes can have a        synergistic effect on tumor regression While the        antitumor effect of the combinatorial treatment does not        completely resolve tumor burden and the mice eventually        succumb it is important to recognize that the RipTag        mice are a very stringent system for assaying        immunotherapies because of the multifocal nature of tumor        progression in these mice Because the Tag oncogene is        expressed in all of the  pancreatic  cells each        of  islets can be considered an independent        premalignant focus Hence the immunotherapy tested herein        would have to destroy all neoplastic foci to affect a        complete cure which is perhaps too much to expect our        view is that the stringency of this system has advantages        as a readout for therapeutic strategies in the observed        efficacy may be more predictive of responses in the clinic        that those observed with subcutaneous tumors We expect        that clarification of the underlying mechanism may provide        avenues to improved therapeutic strategies based on the        concept of disrupting the evident barriers to effective        antitumor immunity erected by solid tumors We suggest        that the combinatorial approach presented here merits        consideration in the design of clinical trials aimed to        achieve T cellmediated antitumor immunity                    Competing interests        none declared                    Abbreviations        TCR T cell receptor MHC major histocompatibility        complex H
