                okay uh what what is it what does camping mean to you and and what camping have you done   oh weve done a lot of camping actually thats one of our favorite pastimes um  to us camping is is a combination of tent camping as well as environmental camping   hm   um and i think that really what it means to me is being outdoors in a sort of a wilderness environment and being able to enjoy nature what does it mean to you   well what uh uh what what do you mean by environmental camping   um there are a number of environmental cabins near where we live that uh offer some sort of dwelling some sort of um security from the elements but theres no electricity no heat no water   oh okay but yeah thats neat im not not not had that available uh anywhere that ive lived at well uh first   oh yeah State Park System i think is probably what supports a lot of those theyre theyre state as opposed to county facilities   what what state is that   California   California okay im in Texas and uh uh   oh   but most of the camping that weve done we we spent uh ten years in New England uh and my wife and i did a lot of tent camping before uh our first   oh uhhuh   uh boy was born uh there in in uh state parks in uh New England and uh   uhhuh uhhuh   here here in Texas there are are state parks where they have uh uh   what   shelters theyre called uh theyre wood frame on a concrete slab but screened in   uhhuh   kinds of of shelters and uh but they have uh electricity and uh water at those cabins and there theres  cabins   i see actually in the cabins so its like uh a a sink   well thats the no the uh theres uh one outlet and a light in the cabin uh an overhead one overhead bulb and then just outside the cabin theres a uh faucet uh coming up out of the pipe coming up out of the ground so that theres access to water like that uh   umhum umhum in in Texas what are the camp parks like if you go tent camping are you near a real wooded area or does it tend to be more um plains   well uh no its its the the ones that im familiar with are are basically uh basically wooded areas uh Texas has an awful lot of uh man made lakes   uhhuh   and uh uh tend to be uh wooded areas around those lakes im in im in Dallas northeast uh   umhum uhhuh what a difference from New England though i bet   yes yes oh yeah yes yes there there you could uh you know depending on what kind of camping you wanted why uh you go an hour in a different direction here you go three hours in any direction and its still about the same so uh thats a difference but we also   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh well whats it like camping with your son when he was young   well well we didnt we took a break from camping uh for with the the uh boys until they uh they got into uh scouts basically and uh and then our biggest one we we rented a uh pop up tent trailer   uhhuh   uh several years ago and went up to uh the Black Hills and back down through the uh uh Colorado uh Rocky Mountain National uh Park and uh   oh wow thats a pretty area uhhuh   Colorado Springs area and so forth Pikes Peak and that was a that was a lot of fun   uhhuh i bet it was for them too its been an experience uh with our daughter whos turning two in a couple of days because she was probably six months old the first time and we had kind of missed camping   yeah oh okay   well i the last time wed camped before she was born i think i was eight months pregnant because we like stretched to the very end  and that was a little rough in a tent but uh shes actually done very well and has enjoyed it a lot even even as a little   uhhuh yeah yeah   little kid so its been kind of fun uh trying to adjust our routine and and doing it with with her as she grows up   yeah yeah and   im sure itll be a lot different when she has a chance to really participate more   right right at at at at at two shes old enough to walk but not too far i would guess and and   which is what your kids have done right and shes fairly cautious so were not too concerned about her running into the poison ivy or whatever   yeah well  right right but you also dont do a lot of of hiking associated with the camping i i presume yeah yeah well that that sounds good sounds good   exactly uh staying close to the camp ground   and uh   well it sounds like youve um continued it no matter where youve been and how your familys grown so  thats my aspiration as well   yeah yeah and   uh uh and and uh although it it after a while it gets uh with teenage boys at this point well ones uh in college but uh uh   oh wow cool   uh it it turns different in that uh the problem becomes one of getting getting time when theyre available and dont have other activities uh   right right well i guess it
