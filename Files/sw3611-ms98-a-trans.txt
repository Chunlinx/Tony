              well how do we feel about the nursing home right  um i have a dad eighty eighty nine years old and uh he has Parkinsons   uhhuh uhhuh   and  there are three of us children my sister brother and i and we decided that we could not live with him going to a nursing home   uhhuh   and so for two years we took turns my brother and i live here my sister lives in Longview going back and forth up there helping her she has him in her home   uhhuh   and uh we just decided we couldnt put him in the nursing homes but i decided i couldnt keep on with that   right   and now she wont put him in the nursing home i think shes getting close   uhhuh   but the problem with these nursing homes is  the cost   right   and um he has a house and since he has a house it would cost oh i dont know something like two thousand dollars i think to keep him and um   uhhuh right uhhuh   uh i really need to know more about it   yeah i think were kind of my familys in the same situation my my grandmother is about ninety two right now and just really has lost her senses shes gone senile and we basically take care of her between my uncle and aunt and ourselves and my uncle lives in in Utah so   oh   its really its a challenge for our family because my parents still have a lot of young kids and its really tough for them to   oh yes   to handle my grandma as well as as well as um the rest of the family   yeah is she still mobile though   no not at all were we basically push her around and shes lost control of her bowel and its just its really sad and its kind of like you said that   oh really   weve weve looked at some nursing homes and and just the situations that ive seen is most of the time when there are when they they go into the nursing homes they just lose even more than what they had before   right they become a vegetable more or less  and uh they dont they sedate them and     uhhuh   forget them   yeah and really you know they say that theyre going to help them be productive but basically what they all do is they lay on their beds all day   uhhuh   and it just to me that seems really sad   well it really is um  my dad cant even feed himself  and um he still you know health is pretty his mind pretty much and thats why we cant put him there i guess if he didnt have his mind you know it would be easier to do that   uhhuh   but anyways   yeah its kind of a challenge i guess   yeah well hopefully  theyre going to clean these things up i dont that they will     yeah i think you know i think they big thing is just to find a nursing home that really cares for other people and its not just the money theyre bringing in but its its more of a humanitarian thing where they want to help these people have the best years of their lives that are left   right   and i think thats the real problem personally   yeah i guess one problem that theyre having in these homes is is help   yeah   they dont have enough help to go around   yeah and see thats i couldnt do it i think that thatd be super tough just because the people that you learn to love you see dying off one by one and i think that would just be really i admire those who can i couldnt handle that personally   yeah  i have a friend here  that i think her mothers like ninety seven or something and um shes been pleased well pleased with the care of course she goes every day   uhhuh yeah   and i think as long as you go every day to see about them they get better care   yeah i think youre right   uhhuh   and i think as you learn to know the volunteers and help them know a little bit about your family i guess that would make a difference too   yeah right  well  i do you know anything about the um qualifications uh i mean of knowing qualifications of the nursing homes   i i really dont to be honest with you im just seen ive done some work in nursings homes and ive kind of but in terms of specific qualifications i dont know other than three square meals a day   umhum   uh fruit and supposed sanitation type things but i just it seems like every time ive sung a lot and so every almost every Christmas and every holiday you can think of weve gone in and sang at nursing homes and its sad because really theyre not and to me at least it doesnt seem like theyre very well taken care of and any of them that   no no theyre really not   but   and i think as long as theyre is a family member to go in and see about them they get better care   yeah i tend to agree with that and i think more than anything for them thats important that if youre going to find a find some place where the people who are around them really and truly love them   umhum umhum   and they know that theyre still wanted and theyre still they can still be a productive part of society   right   and i think too often the nursing home for example my grandmas case she doesnt want to go to a nursing home because to her thats just a sign of losing everything and completely being completely unproductive forever   umhum  well thats kind of the way my dad was when he had to leave his home he  he left my home and went to my sisters and of course you know as far as   uhhuh
