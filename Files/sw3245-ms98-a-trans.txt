        okay so were going to talk about uh what kind of clothes we wear while we work   okay im ready uhhuh   do you work for TI   no i work at home   oh you do well youre like me then  i stay home also   do you have children   yes i have two a seven year old and three and a half year old   oh thats good   how about you   i have four girls theyre nine and five and three and a newborn   oh oh my you are busy   yes   and theyre all girls i have two girls  so all girls around here  yes uh really sweet   girls are nice arent they anyway as far as clothing goes um my wardrobe changes all the time depending on my size  we go from regular kind of spring clothes   thats how i am too umhum   regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes   uhhuh     clothes that are in between where youre not down to regular size yet   uhhuh   or youre on your way up from regular size  and theyre all in boxes or bags and they all rotate all the time   oh thats funny yeah   kind of the same stuff all the time though i dont uh get a whole lot new right now   yeah yeah  i know thats kind of how i am i said who ever i talk to is going to be bored because when its summer time im wearing shorts and when its cold im wearing sweat pants and   yeah   most of unless im going to something special that my daughters doing or something like that i   yeah i i like jeans a lot   well thats thats good i used to wear jeans all the time until after i had kids and now nothing seems to be comfortable because i bulge in all the wrong places so   oh and its its frustrating i just i find i have to get the right kinds though or its not comfortable   yeah   they it it works best if they have pleats in the front   right yeah   and uh they have to my waist is kind of small compared to the hips so it has to be not the straight up and down Levis kind   yeah yeah i know what you mean well   but um but i when i was i was pregnant through the summer this time and i wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist   oh uhhuh right uhhuh thats right   but um   one of my daughters was born in June and i remember i wore sundresses and you know just those real cool dresses almost the entire time   yeah yeah   and i had one that was born in December so um it was a little bit because however it was a real warm winter so even even into like November and December i was still wearing the short sleeve dresses course im always hot when im pregnant too so  i didnt really need warm clothes   uhhuh yeah yeah   but i really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new uh units outfits you know that are just knit   oh i havent tried those   oh theyre so comfortable its its just um you know a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff and   huh yeah yeah   its just great because you can put you know you can decorate them up or dress them up if you want or you can just wear them with you know tennis shoes if you want so theyre really nice  and ive enjoyed wearing those   uhhuh   but i   i dont know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here but i sure never wear them   yeah well i dont either if we if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference   yeah   i worked part time when my oldest was a baby   uhhuh   and um i had to wear a dress every day and   im watching Janice  uhhuh   and uh it was a little bit hard to uh wind down i would i would have to drive six thirty five home and i would be burning up like in the summer time by the time i got home i was like oh i got to get out of these clothes   oh i i remember that from when i was i worked way before i was married  even but uh offices they keep them so cold in the summer that you cant wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable   uhhuh uhhuh right right   youve got to have something to add to it or something i dont know if you can   yeah yeah yeah and then when you drive home like especially if youre in a lot of traffic which you are in Dallas uhhuh because i always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time i was afraid id make the car overheat   you burn up yeah yeah its hard on the car   yeah so i would roll my windows down it was still a hundred degrees  and i would just be sweltering hot by the time i picked my daughter up and   oh yeah   um i had a friend who used to take shorts to work and after work shed go in the bathroom  and change her clothes and i thought thats probably a good idea   oh thats funny yeah   because you really it   at least something cooler   yeah because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them if you   thats true   especially if its something that has to be dry cleaned which i dont have any of   yeah i dont have to worry a whole lot about that   no when you have children you dont um even when i go to church i have to have something i can just throw in the washer when im through   thats right something that it doesnt matter if it gets spit up on too   thats right or if you get it dirty or whatever i know it   ive always been a creature of comfort too if its not comfortable forget it   me too i know thats how i am too   wool was never comfortable to me   right me neither i have
