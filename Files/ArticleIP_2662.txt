                                 Rx Profit            When a motorcyclist was hitbroadside by a car on a local road ambulance workers stabilized his neck andback and whisked him over to the nearest facilitya suburban forprofithospital The yearold construction worker had multiple fractures includingto his vertebra Though the doctors did every Xray and blood test in the bookthey somehow overlooked the critical step of keeping him flat to protect hisfractured spine They did however figure out that his HMO preferred he betreated at another center So they transferred him to a local nonprofithospital where I sometimes work He arrived sitting up in his stretchercringing in pain and risking paralysis            It wasprobably an honest mistake But I was disturbed that the transferring hospitalwas so thorough with tests and so lax with basic care The nurses with meblamed the hospitals forprofit status Driven by the almighty dollar thecenter was slick at doing billable tests but had slashed staffing to the pointthat it couldnt provide good care I wouldnt take my cat to that hospitalone nurse said            Forprofit chains now own  percent of American hospitalsThey say they are transforming a bureaucratic industry into an efficientprovider of better quality care But the expanding federal investigation ofbillion hospital giant ColumbiaHCA raises concerns that the pursuit ofprofits is leading to fraud and poor care            Investigators believe thecompany overstated costs and deliberately ordered unnecessary tests to increaseMedicare payments Last month three midlevel executives were indicted forcriminal fraud and agents raided offices and hospitals in seven states RepPete Stark DCalif who sparked the probe points to previous scandals asevidence that forprofit hospitals will cheat insurers avoid the needy andsacrifice quality to produce profits A decade ago Paracelsus Health Corp wasforced to drop kickbacks for doctors who sent Medicare patients to itshospitals In the last few years several forprofit hospitals have paid steepfines for dumping uninsured patients on other hospitals This FebruaryMedicare forced Sutter Hospital Corp to return  million in fraudulentbillings            In themost outrageous case in  the government accused National MedicalEnterprises of paying bounty hunters to obtain patients for its psychiatrichospitals Its doctors then gave wrong diagnoses to increase billings and heldpatients as young as  against their will until their insurance ran out NMEpleaded guilty and paid  million in penalties Last month under its newname Tenet Healthcare Corp it paid over  million to settle patientclaims Yet Tenet is now the nations secondlargest chain            Forprofit hospitals defend themselvesfiercely They argue that  nonprofits face the same scandals too Indeedthey point out inspectors are investigating dozens of prestigious universityhospitals for fraud So far the University of Pennsylvania and Thomas JeffersonUniversity medical centers have paid over  million to settle charges ofdoublebilling Medicare And  the affluent suburban hospitals they havebought never had much charity care in the first place so whats with thedumping needy patients charge            Onquality of care they ask wheres the beef There are anecdotes like mine ofpoor treatment but critics admit theres no evidence that forprofit hospitalscompromise quality One study of  patient records found no differencesin death rates between forprofit and nonprofit hospitals            People in the forprofit hospital business are stupefiedwhen asked to defend profit in medicine It may come as a surprise to you butyour car is made by a forprofit company Every family is a forprofitoperation Every doctor is forprofit says Wall Street healthstock analystKen Abramowitz Health care is no different from buying a car Competitionwill produce increased efficiency and better quality in health care just as incars            But healthcare is not like buying a car You can shop around for a car but themotorcyclist I saw couldnt choose his hospital Also its much harder tojudge whether your care is good than whether your car is good Terrible thingshappen to people in hospitals all the time infections bleeding and othercomplications of care Studies show a quarter of these events are avoidablebut it is rarely obvious to patients which ones are If the motorcyclistdelirious with pain and a severe blow to the head had lost sensation in hisfeet he wouldnt have known if we could have prevented it He had to trustwith his life that making money was not our priority He did fine by the wayHell wear a fullbody brace for six weeks            Forprofit hospitals however face intensepressure to make money the top priority They must answer to stockholdersdemanding rising profits while nonprofit hospitals answer to a charitableboard Some boards do run hospitals like forprofits But a board is nothinglike Wall Street One sees you once a month and tells you to do better for yourown good The other holds a gun to your head every day            The waysto make profits are limited In theory forprofits are equipped to do itthrough greater efficiencyeconomies of scale easier closure of failingoperations and better access to capital But hospital consultant Larry Lewinfinds no evidence forprofits are more efficient Indeed  percent ofColumbiaHCAs beds lie empty compared with  percent of nonprofit bedsAnother way to generate profits is to buy up hospitals cheapthough regulationand competition have made it harder to lowball purchase prices            Forprofits also keep billings up by avoiding theuninsured sticking to affluent suburbs and avoiding obstetric pediatric andemergency services Charity care at forprofit hospitals is half that ofnonprofit hospitals But with forprofit chains buying Tulane and GeorgeWashington university medical centers and other big city hospitals thesetactics wont be available much longer            And of course hospitalshave squeezed as much profit as possible out of insurers billing foreverything they can ColumbiaHCA managers had targets of  percent to percent annual growth in charges They even tried to make profits on bloodprovided by Red Cross charities Increasingly however managedcare insurersand the government are refusing to go along            Ultimately that leaves onealternativecutting corners on care And NMETenets bounty hunters show howfar care providers may be willing to go            Medicine never used to belike this For a long time insurers gave doctors carte blanche to run upcharges Some did But the dominant professional ethic to do right by patientskept most from exploiting the system Forprofit hospitals have no ethic beyondmaking a buck Their doctors are imbibing that spirit Thats what worriesme
