                    Introduction        In population studies a doseresponse relationship between short sleep duration and        high body mass index BMI has been reported across all age groups  In the largest        studied sample elevated BMI occurred for habitual sleep amounts below  h  A        Ushaped curvilinear relationship between sleep duration and BMI was observed for women        but for men there was a monotonic trend towards higher BMI with shorter sleep duration        Importantly a recent prospective study identified a longitudinal association between sleep        curtailment and future weight gain  How sleep curtailment may interact with body weight        is unknown but hormones regulating appetite and energy expenditure may be involved        A number of hormones may mediate the interactions between short sleep duration        metabolism and high BMI We hypothesized that the two key opposing hormones in appetite        regulation leptin and ghrelin  play a significant role in the interaction between        short sleep duration and high BMI Leptin is an adipocytederived hormone that suppresses        appetite  Ghrelin is predominantly a stomachderived peptide that stimulates appetite         Other mediators of metabolism that may contribute include adiponectin and insulin        Adiponectin is a novel hormone secreted by adipocytes and is associated with insulin        sensitivity  We investigated the associations among sleep duration acute and        habitual metabolic hormones and BMI in the populationbased Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study                            Methods                  Overview          The institutional review board of the University of Wisconsin Medical School approved          all protocols for the study and informed consent was obtained from all participants The          Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study is an ongoing longitudinal study of sleep habits and          disorders in the general population  Briefly to construct a defined sampling frame          all employees aged  y of four state agencies in south central Wisconsin were mailed          a survey on sleep habits health and demographics in  Mailed surveys were repeated          at y intervals A stratified random sample of respondents was then recruited for an          extensive overnight protocol including polysomnography at baseline Stratification was          based on risk for sleepdisordered breathing SDB with an oversampling of habitual          snorers to ensure an adequate distribution of SDB Analyses were adjusted for the          weighted sampling when appropriate Recruitment for baseline studies was staggered to          conduct seven studies per week study entry and followup time thus varied within the          cohort Exclusion criteria included pregnancy unstable cardiopulmonary disease airway          cancers and recent upper respiratory tract surgery The baseline response rate was           with most refusals due to the inconvenience of sleeping away from home Followup studies          have been conducted at y intervals with up to three followup studies to date          Collection of morning fasted blood was added to the protocol in  Extensive survey          and other data available from the sampling frame have been used to evaluate the potential          for response and drop out biases          Figure  provides an overview of the study population and the data collected The          sample comprised  participants with an overnight study and blood sample A d diary          of sleep duration was added as part of a protocol to assess daytime sleepiness after the          initiation of the cohort study these data were available for  participants                          Data Collection          This investigation is based on Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study data collected from the          mailed sleep surveys overnight studies and d sleep diaries Overnight studies were          conducted in laboratory bedrooms with participants setting their own sleep and rise          times After informed consent was obtained questionnaires on lifestyle and health          history were administered and height and weight measured A blood sample was collected          shortly after awakening from overnight polysomnography                      Polysomnography            An channel polysomnographic system was used to assess sleep states and            respiratory and cardiac variables  Sleep was studied using electroencephalography            electrooculography and chin electromyography Grass Instruments Quincy            Massachusetts United States Continuous measurement of arterial oxyhemoglobin            saturation by pulse oximetry Ohmeda Englewood Colorado United States oral and            nasal airflow nasal air pressure and thoracic cage and abdominal respiratory motion            Respitrace Ambulatory Monitoring Ardsley New York United States were used to            assess SDB  Each s interval of the polysomnographic record was scored for sleep            stage and SDB using standard criteria  The average number of apneas and hypopneas            per hour of measured sleep the apneahypopnea index AHI was the measure for SDB            For analyses including AHI as a covariate participants were excluded if they had sleep            studies with less than  h of usable polysomnography or if they were receiving            treatment for SDB                                Polysomnographic measures of acute sleep            Polysomnographic measures of sleep duration just prior to blood sampling were used            to evaluate degree of acute sleep restriction Total sleep time was total hours of            polysomnographically defined sleep Wake after sleep onset WASO was hours of wake            time after three epochs of sleep had occurred Sleep efficiency was total sleep time            divided by time from lights out until arising in the morning                                Selfreported sleep measures of chronic sleep            Two variables were used to evaluate degree of chronic sleep restriction by            estimating average nightly sleep duration i usual sleep from questionnaires and            ii average nightly sleep from sleep diaries                                Questionnaire            Usual sleep was estimated from the following questions how many hours of sleep do            you usually get in a a workday night b a weekend or nonwork night These            questions were included in all mailed surveys and were added to questionnaires            completed at the overnight study in  For participants studied after  data            from questionnaires administered at the overnight study were used  for the            remainder of the sample data from the mailed survey closest in time to the overnight            study were used Usual sleep was calculated as   workday sleep    weekend            sleep                                Sleep diary            Average sleep duration was also estimated using a d sleep diary kept by             participants as part of an added protocol to measure daytime sleepiness The median            time between the blood collection and completion of the diary was  d Almost all            diaries  were completed within  mo of blood sampling In diaries participants            recorded the time they went to bed and arose each day and the duration of any naps            Average nightly sleep was calculated as the sum of the hours between bedtime and            arising divided by six Average nightly sleep plus naps added naps to the above            sum                                    The Relationship between BMI and Sleep Duration          For the analysis of the association of BMI and sleep duration the sample comprised           participants with at least one d sleep diary Of these   and y          followup studies had been completed by   and  participants respectively           visits providing repeated measures data for greater analytic efficiency and          precision                          Hormone Assays          Following overnight fasting serum was collected soon after awakening and stored at           C All samples were assayed in duplicate It was not possible to assay samples from          all participants in all assays because of the volume of serum available this          particularly affected the ghrelin assay which required the most volume Leptin and          insulin were determined using enzymelinked immunoassays ELISA Linco Research St          Charles Missouri United States Total ghrelin and adiponectin were measured by          radioimmunoassay Linco Research Sensitivity for the leptin and insulin enzymelinked          immunoassays was  ngml and  Uml respectively Sensitivity for the ghrelin and          adiponectin radioimmunoassays was  pgml and  ngml respectively Intra and          interassay variations were all less than  and less than  respectively The          quantitative insulin sensitivity check index QUICKI was log           I   log           G  where           I is fasting insulin and           G is fasting glucose                           Statistical Analysis          All analyses were crosssectional and performed using SASSTAT  Leptin ghrelin          and adiponectin were squareroot transformed and insulin log transformed based on the          distribution of residuals from the multivariate regression models We evaluated the          relationship of age sex BMI and time of storage of blood sample on hormones using          multiple regression Partial correlations adjusted for age sex and BMI were calculated          for hormones and QUICKI with and without control of other potential confounders The          relationships between hormones and sleep were evaluated using multiple linear regression          after control for potential confounders including age sex BMI SDB and morningness          tendencies as measured using the HorneOstberg questionnaire an indirect surrogate of          earlier rising time In all analyses involving insulin glucose and QUICKI but not          leptin ghrelin and adiponectin participants with diabetes selfreported diagnosis          or currently taking insulin or diabetic medications or with glucose  mgdl were          excluded Participants with SDB were not removed from the analyses shown When          controlling for AHI in models participants who used continuous positive airway pressure          or who had inadequate sleep were excluded Because controlling for AHI did not          significantly change the sleephormone regression coefficients these analyses are not          shown The relationship of BMI with average nightly sleep was evaluated using a quadratic          fit This was examined using multiple visits           n   from  participants with sleep diary data available          Mixed modeling techniques were used to account for withinsubject correlation for          participants with multiple visits SAS procedure mixed was used for modeling and          hypothesis testing using robust standard errors and a compound symmetric withinsubject          correlation structure All reported           p values are twosided For illustrative purposes changes in leptin          ghrelin and BMI for different sleep amounts were calculated at the average values and          sex distribution of the relevant sample                            Results        Table  shows the characteristics of the sample unadjusted for the weighted sampling        scheme Figure  shows the mean BMI for min intervals of average nightly sleep after        adjustment for age and sex We found a significant Ushaped curvilinear relationship        between average nightly sleep and BMI after adjustment for age and sex average nightly        sleep coefficient           p   average nightly sleep         coefficient           p   the two coefficients define a curve The minimum BMI was        predicted at  h of average nightly sleep The most striking portion of the curve was for        persons sleeping less than  h  of the sample where increased BMI was proportional        to decreased sleep An increase in BMI from  to   corresponded approximately        to an average nightly sleep duration decrease from  h to  h as estimated at the mean age         y and sex distribution  male of the sample with available sleep diary        data        Table  shows the association of each of the hormones glucose and QUICKI with age        sex and BMI Serum ghrelin leptin adiponectin insulin and glucose were significantly        correlated with BMI and sex Storage time had significant effects on some but not all        variables in all cases however effect size was small and the effect was corrected for        in all calculations Adiponectin and glucose were correlated with age Table  shows        partial correlations among the measured and calculated variables adjusted for age sex        and BMI All correlations agree with previous studies and validate our assays and        population sample We also examined several potential confounders to be later controlled        for if needed in our models Identified relationships included ghrelin with highdensity        lipoprotein HDL alcohol intake and creatinine leptin with diastolic blood pressure        smoking and blood urea nitrogen BUN adiponectin with HDL triglycerides uric acid and        BUN insulin with HDL triglycerides uric acid and smoking glucose with HDL        triglycerides uric acid alcohol intake BUN and creatinine QUICKI with HDL        triglycerides uric acid smoking and BUN When diabetics diagnosed and participants        with high glucose glucose  mgdl were removed from this analysis all        relationships remained significant except for the correlation between ghrelin and        adiponectin and ghrelin and insulin        Using polysomnography to measure objective sleep immediately prior to blood sampling        ghrelin correlated significantly with total sleep time sleep efficiency and WASO Table         Using questionnaire and diary data estimating chronic sleep significant correlations        were found between leptin and average nightly sleep with and without naps and usual sleep        amounts Table  A significant correlation was also observed between ghrelin and average        nightly sleep plus naps These relationships were consistently found when other possible        confounding factors such as medications hypertension AHI and factors listed above were        included in the statistical model analysis not shown In unadjusted models leptin was        significantly correlated with total sleep time and average weekly sleep with naps and        ghrelin was significantly correlated with sleep efficiency and WASO Figure A shows the        mean leptin levels for halfhour increments of average nightly sleep after adjustment for        age sex BMI and time of storage see Table  In the multiple regression model see        Table  there was a significant increasing trend in leptin for average nightly sleep        duration         p   When evaluated at the average values and sex distribution of        our sample a decrease from  to  h in average nightly sleep was associated with a        predicted  decrease in leptin Figure B shows the mean ghrelin levels for halfhour        increments of total sleep time after adjustment for age sex BMI and time of storage see        Table  In the multiple regression model see Table  there was a significant        decreasing trend in ghrelin with total sleep time         p   When evaluated at the average values and sex distribution of        our sample a decrease from  to  h of polysomnographically defined total sleep time was        associated with a predicted  increase in ghrelin There was no significant correlation        between sleep duration acute or chronic and serum adiponectin insulin glucose or        QUICKI Results of our analyses were unchanged after adjusting for the weighted sampling        scheme                    Discussion        We found that habitual sleep duration below  h was associated with increased BMI        similar to findings in other studies including children  adolescents  and adults         We also report a significant association of sleep duration with leptin and ghrelin        that is independent of BMI age sex SDB and other possible confounding factors analysis        not shown for SDB and other confounders Short sleep duration was associated with        decreased leptin and increased ghrelin changes that have also been observed in reaction to        food restriction and weight loss and are typically associated with increased appetite        These hormone alterations may contribute to the BMI increase that occurs with sleep        curtailment        Previous studies have shown that both acute sleep deprivation  and chronic partial        sleep deprivation sleep restriction  can cause a decrease in serum leptin        concentrations These studies however were performed under highly controlled laboratory        circumstances Our results validate the association of decreased leptin with decreased        sleep time in a large sample of adults under reallife conditions and now indicate a role        for ghrelin Leptin deficiency increases appetite and produces obesity  Leptin        administration suppresses food intake and reduces energy expenditure  Importantly        low leptin as observed with sleep loss has a greater impact on appetite than high leptin        levels which are associated with leptin resistance as occurs with obesity         Levels of ghrelin a potent stimulator of appetite  were higher in those with        shorter sleep Ghrelin levels are also positively associated with hunger ratings  but        decrease with increased BMI see Table  In one study after  mo of dietary supervision        a reduction in BMI of approximately  was associated with a  increase in ghrelin and a         decrease in leptin  These changes in participants of similar BMI to our sample        and presumably producing increased appetite are comparable to those observed with sleep        loss of  hnight With sleep loss however relatively high ghrelin and low leptin        levels are associated with increased BMI These changes can be hypothesized to play a        contributory rather than compensatory role in the development of overweight and obesity        with sleep restriction        Our findings are strengthened by the large and wellcharacterized populationbased        sample attention to bias and confounding factors and inlaboratory polysomnographic data        The changes in hormones with sleep duration were consistent and of significant magnitude        They also represent the first demonstration of a correlation between peripheral hormone        levels and both selfreported questionnaire and diary data and polysomnographically        determined sleep amounts in a general population sample While these data are more        comprehensive than previous studies on this topic some misclassification error may exist        because of intraperson variability or limitations of polysomnographic measurement Little        is known about the stability of selfreported sleep duration and polysomnographic measures        of sleep duration over time We examined the stability of the selfreported sleep duration        data and found these measures to be stable For  participants who completed three        surveys the mean standard deviation of intraperson differences in usual sleep for two        y periods was   h For  participants with at least three sleep diaries the        mean standard deviation of intraperson differences in average nightly sleep for two y        intervals was   h Furthermore the subjectively reported hours of usual sleep        and the diaryderived average nightly sleep values were highly correlated         r           p  Onenight polysomnographically defined total sleep time        had a similar intraperson mean difference  h with a somewhat larger standard        deviation  for  participants with at least three sleep studies        Elevated ghrelin mainly correlated with acute sleep loss as measured by polysomnography        immediately prior to blood sampling see Table  Figure B while reduced leptin        correlated with chronic sleep restriction indicated by selfreported sleep measures see        Table  Figure A Measures of usual and onenight polysomnographically defined sleep        time were only weakly but statistically significantly correlated         r           p  supporting the concept that these measures reflect        longterm and shortterm changes in sleep amounts respectively Our findings are in        agreement with the current view that leptin is important in signaling longterm nutritional        status while ghrelin has a more significant role in acute hunger The changes in leptin and        ghrelin with sleep restriction could therefore provide a powerful dual stimulus to food        intake that may culminate in obesity        Longitudinal and intervention studies will be necessary to define further the link        between sleep curtailment and increased BMI Only total ghrelin was measured since active        octanoylated ghrelin is unstable Although both total and active ghrelin appear to be        regulated in a similar and parallel manner future studies will need to focus on        measurement of the biologically active form Other potentially important appetite        regulatory hormones such as PYY   were not measured Measures of appetite were        not included in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study overnight protocol therefore a direct        examination of the relationship between the observed hormone changes with sleep duration        and alterations in appetite was not possible        Hormone measurements were all performed on a single fasted morning sample and may not        reflect the h profile It is possible that participants with shorter sleep woke up        earlier and that hormone differences may be partially related to circadian time Leptin and        ghrelin levels rise slightly during the night  and this could result in higher hormone        levels in short sleepers This may be an issue for ghrelin as levels increased with acute        sleep restriction It is however unlikely to play a role in the leptin finding since        lower levels were found with chronic but not acute sleep restriction Additionally studies        have shown a high correlation between morning fasting leptin and ghrelin levels and h        mean profile  We also found that the ghrelin and leptin changes were unaffected by        morningness tendencies The fact that studies investigating the diurnal profile of these        hormones found similar hormonal changes over the entire h period after experimental        sleep restriction also corroborates our results  The robustness of our findings and        similar observations from smaller controlled studies  also suggest that our        statistically significant results are unlikely to be a reflection of the number of analyses        carried out        Animal studies have suggested a link between sleep and metabolism  In rats        prolonged complete sleep deprivation increased both food intake and energy expenditure        The net effect was weight loss and ultimately death  Rats fed a high        proteintocalorie diet had accelerated weight loss compared to sleepdeprived rats fed        calorieaugmented fatty diets  Food consumption remained normal in sleepdeprived        rats fed proteinrich diets but increased  in rats fed calorierich diets Preference        for fatty foods has also been reported anecdotally in sleepdeprived humans  Sleep        deprivation may thus increase not only appetite but also preference for lipidrich        highcalorie foods Animal experiments that have found weight loss after prolonged sleep        deprivation have to be interpreted in the context of a stressful procedure producing        intense sleep debt  which may interfere with adequate food intake From our study        we hypothesize that the moderate chronic sleep debt associated with habitual short sleep is        associated with increased appetite and energy expenditure In societies where highcalorie        food is freely available and consumption uncontrolled after milder chronic sleep        restriction the equation may be tipped towards food intake for highcalorie food rather        than expenditure culminating in obesity Short sleepers may also have more time to        overeat        Sleep loss from a baseline of  h was associated with a dosedependent increase in        BMI This was the predominant effect in a population increasingly curtailing sleep         Sleep greater than  h however was also associated with increased BMI Patients with        SDB a pathology associated with increased BMI may spend a longer time in bed to        compensate for fragmented sleep however controlling for AHI did not change the        curvilinear BMIsleep association Another possibility is that in long sleepers reduced        energy expenditure due to increased time in bed has a greater impact than reduced food        intake In favor of this hypothesis long sleepers exercise less  In our data we        found that the odds ratio of high levels of selfreported exercise  hwk based on a        single survey question decreased with increased sleep time but controlling for this        variable also did not change our findings analyses not shown        Insulin resistance with sleep deprivation has been reported in a laboratory study of        young healthy volunteers  When controlling for BMI we found no significant        correlation between insulin glucose or adiponectin levels and various measures of sleep        duration Also there was no significant correlation between QUICKI or the homeostatic        model assessment HOMA  data not shown and sleep duration This may be due to        difficulties in detecting small effects on glucose tolerance under lesscontrolled        conditions of large population studies        Our results demonstrate an important relationship between sleep and metabolic hormones        The direct effect of chronic partial sleep loss on food intake energy expenditure and        obesity now needs to be explored Altering sleep duration may prove to be an important        adjunct to preventing and treating obesity
