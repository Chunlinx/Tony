                                 Apocalypse Then            How do you portray violencein movies nowadays so that it isnt a turnon Nearly  years ago SamPeckinpah devised a massacre at the climax of The Wild Bunch that hethought would take the casualness out of killing He lingered on it slowed itdown fastened on bloodspurting bodies as they hurtled through the airandended up making it lyrical aestheticizing it distancing it Lesswellintentioned filmmakers followed in the wake of Bloody Sam turningcarnage into spectacle even into rock n roll What Steven Spielberg hasaccomplished in Saving Private Ryan is to make violence terrible againNothing in the movies melodramatic narrative can diminish the shockingimmediacy of its combat scenes            Theopening battle might be the most visceral ever put on film After a solemn butpredictable modernday prologuean old man and his extended family trudge outto a cemetery to view row upon row of white crossestheres a shock cut to theboats of Allied soldiers surging toward Omaha Beach in Normandy France ItsDDay  Trembling hands open a canteen They belong to a familiarstarTom Hanksbut everything that follows is alien The camera is down inthe surf pitching as young men pray and vomit Theyve barely beached beforethe first bullets comebefore these smoothfaced overgrown kids begin to getblown through We dont see the enemy machine guns or rifles but we hear thepops and the ceaseless whine of bullets and we watch the men as their chestsand heads explode Some drop underwater but still the bullets come in nearsilence producing squalls of blood above the water the din resumes with avengeance            The images are supersharp as if viewed through toostrongglasses yet they streak and pixilatebreak into shardsas the camera jerkswildly left then right Color has been drained from the frame The greens ofuniforms and browns of earth are muted the sky rendered a neutral grayAgainst this monochromatic palette the brackish blood leaps out of the screenThat blood is everywhere A helmet full of seawater turns out to be full ofsloshing gore a soldier with a gushing arm socket picks up his severed limband staggers aimlessly a man with his intestines on the outside wails througha last protracted hemorrhage A soldiers helmet stops a bullet with a clankhe removes it in wonder his brains are then blown out            For nearlyhalf an hour the horrors come one upon another unaccompanied by music andunrelieved by any point of view except that of the soldiers in the middle ofthe slaughter There are no objective establishing shots and no possibilityfor emotional distance Nauseated I fixed on Hanks because I knew the starwould survive until at least the last reel But even that reassurance seemedprecarious In Saving Private Ryan  death can come at any instant fromany direction For the rest of the films running time nearly three hourstotal each actioneven a small one such as the eating of an appleis thickwith potential finality            This is not the work of the Spielberg wevecome to know After Jaws  and Close Encounters of the ThirdKind  he could afford to build any set throw money at any creativeproblem His mise en scne became increasingly synthetic He seemed tolose touch with the texture of life Even Schindlers List  edgedinto the movieish Deciding to shoot Saving Private Ryan as if it werea war documentary gives Spielbergs art a new orientation Or rather a newdisorientation He shoots battles so that we cant always see whats happeningour vantage is frighteningly restricted and the world of combat is reduced topure sensation This isnt about bravery or heroism but getting from PointA to Point B without being torn apart by bullets                           SavingPrivate Ryan  from a script by Robert Rodat doesnt remain as feverishlyabstract as its imagery but at its best early on it feelsundiagramedunmapped A squadron of Omaha survivors led by Capt MillerHanks is sent behind enemy lines to find one Pvt Ryan whose three brothershave been killed on the same day in separate battles The seven men underMillers command are furious with what they see as a PR mission and amisallocation of military resources they cant believe theyre risking theirlives to rescue one anonymous private But we in the audience know that themission is more than PRthat Gen Marshall Harve Presnell sounding like BobDole has ordered it out of a Lincolnesque compassion for all the familiesripped apart by war Freighted with such symbolism the odyssey cannot help butamount to something             Millers journey into the bowels of the warthroughrubbled villages and fields strewn with rotting corpsesattains the surrealintensity that Francis Ford Coppola strove for in Apocalypse Now except without the selfconscious Golden Bough stabs at mythmakingSpielberg stages an agonizingly prolonged encounter with a German sniper in amounting drizzle the life of a wounded exposed soldier streaming out of hisbody with the rainwater The next assault is different an attack on a concreteNazi pillbox thats barely glimpsed through the thick smoke the actionviewed through the eyes of the squadrons skinny bookish translator JeremyDavies After the shooting subsides the tenderfoot hurries ahead to discoverthe groups medic Giovanni Ribisi mortally wounded being ministered to bysquadron mates hysterically pressing the dying man for instructions on how tostop his bleeding Its no wonder that later the men go through piles of dogtags taken off dead Americans with little more than numb irritation and thatwhen they finally stumble on Pvt Ryan Matt Damon they can barely containtheir hostility            Soldiersin war movies are usually undercharacterizedit comes with the territory Butthese young actors register Vin Diesels loping charisma made me sad to seehim blown away so early and Barry Pepper gives a stock partthe sniper whoprays fervently before he killsa monomaniac concentration Mellish AdamGoldbergs nervy Jew who cant keep from taunting captured Germans with hisreligious identity is a study in aggression like Groucho without punch linesThere are stellar turns by Davies Ribisi Tom Sizemore as a plodding butgoodhearted sergeant and Edward Burns whose acting is less mannered whenremoved from his own movies Tom Hanks efforts to submerge his moodywiseguypersonality dovetails movingly with his characters struggle to keep hishumanity in check I find Damons proletarian integrity deeply suspect but mustadmit that he holds the camera like a star and that finding Pvt Ryan is not ananticlimax            The battles in Saving Private Ryan makemost World War II pictures seem like Hollywood kid stuffeven the bleakexistential ones like Sam Fullers Steel Helmet  and DonSiegels Hell Is for Heroes  These sequences carry a postVietnamaura of futility and the scenes between the skirmishes are similarly modernfull of rambling talk and post Godot waiting around But the moviesoverall vision is surprisingly oldfashioned In most Vietnam films authorityis insane Here orders from on high bring meaning a glimpse of a more divinepurpose The mission has the opposite end of the one in Apocalypse Now not the wars heart of darkness but its heart of light            Theresanother more virulent way in which the movie is oldfashioned In the courseof the endless massacre of Americans on Omaha Beach I wrote in my notebookNo one who experiences this scene will ever cheer for a war again But whenthe tide of the battle turned and the Germans started getting their heads blownoff I wrote YES And when a pair of Allied soldiers fresh fromwitnessing their buddies being blown to bits shot several pleading Germansrather than take them prisoner I didnt applaud the act but I didnt feelmuch like grieving either            The Germans are faceless with one exception a capturedpillbox Nazi who babbles and cajoles for his life sings American anthemsextols Betty Grables gams and screams Fuck Hitler Reiben Burns andMellish want to blow him away but the translatorwho has almost never fired agunprotests vigorously that such an act would be a war crime and that theGerman must be taken prisoner or freed It would be wrong to give away whathappens next but the consequence of the squadrons action is hamhandedlypredictable and morally speaking takes the picture down a peg Too bad            It goes without sayinghowever that Spielberg makes the case that soldiers morals explode like landmines amid the terrors of war This is not after all where they live Itshard to recall a more chilling stretch in modern movies than the one before thelast big battle when the American soldiers surrounded by the debris of adevastated town listen to the echoey pipedin strains of an Edith Piafrecordingand then hear the first low rumbles of approaching German tankseach man alone in the shared knowledge that this foreign music will likely bethe last theyll hear
