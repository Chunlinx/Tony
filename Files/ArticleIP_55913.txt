things happen wwwplanetpokercom                        Your best bet in any casino is at the pokertablesreal poker not video pokerbecause you play a game of skill againstshmoes like yourself not a game of mathematical chance against a machine or adeck of cards The more poker skill you acquire the better your odds At ameatspace casino or a virtual one the house makes its money by taking a smallpercentage rake from each poker pot or renting the seats by the hour Therearent a lot of live poker games on the Web but unhappily I found one            All the live poker sites I visitedpokercompurepokercom deltapokercomrequire a download of the same software Idecide on PlanetPokercom because Mike Caro a pro poker player whom Ive metand like endorses it I put  in my account with ease but when I try toplay I get an error message about being unable to link up with the Planet Pokerserver This error message appears on a few different computers hooked up to afew different corporate networks that I try making me think that the networkadministrators have configured their firewalls to disable these games Isucceed in connecting to PlanetPokercom when I borrow a friends laptop andconnect through his Internet service provider            Once in the poker room you scan the virtual tablesfor empty seats and click to sit down or to join the waiting list After aminute wait I still cant find a chair for the lowstakes Texas Hold Emgame  and  bets pots around  or so Impatient I jump into ahigherstakes game  and  bets pots more like  which turns out tobe a horrible idea These players are much better than the lowstakesplayers and take my money in a hurry The playing interface is smooth andsimple popping up your options to fold call or raise when its your turnBut not only does my Web connection fail in the middle of one hand if thishappens the game assumes you have called the bet then kicks you off the tablewhen the hand ends I flat get beat when I risk any chips Players withhandles like nineball and fatso just outplay me On one tough hand thatlost me  I was pretty confident with my three jacksonly to see sleepymake a gutshot straight on the last card to whup my trips and steal my chips Ilose  worth in under an hour but I love the challenge Of all the onlinegames this is the one I could get frighteningly into Though in the futureIll stick with the lowstakes games            The drawbacks of live online poker You cant readbluffs in your opponents trembling fingers and bobbing Adams apples The onlyguaranteed way to get a bead on players is to watch for betting patterns toemerge Another thing about these games that makes me nervous is that twoplayers in cahoots at adjacent computers could rig the table playing in tandemand driving up the bets when they know theyve got the hand won Finally itshard to gauge the competition With the online anonymity for all I know I wasplaying against PhilHellmuth Jr But the game seemed fair and I was simplyovermatched                           Final net though Im still waiting on the Showgirls check and as for the Slotland checkno yesterdays email confirmation of my withdrawal did not convince me thatits actually on the way                                       Conclusion                        Online gambling is here probably to stay and itsgoing to be unfathomably big If you think video poker at airports is  waittill you see coworkers feed their paychecks into online slots from theirdesks Depending on what kind of person you are this may mean you should establish an offshore casino in the Antilles before the Department of Justicecracks down or  wait for this stuff to shake itself out before you blow bucks playing Web roulette As long as Indian casinos are only a few hoursaway giving your credit card number to a distant and foreign Internetoperation might not be worth the risk If you do log on though perhaps Illsee you at the virtual Hold Em table My handle is seth
