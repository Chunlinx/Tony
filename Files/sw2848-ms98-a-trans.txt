September October   oh yeah uhhuh   and uh i think thatd be great plus like i say i like i like cruises im going with my sisterinlaw im going on a cruise next summer uh for about seven days and uh id i havent decided ive been to the Bahamas but i think id like to try the uh the Mexico one this year the Cozumel and   umhum   Puerto Vallarta and that that route around like that i believe this next time but the Bahama one was nice and if thats one of the cruise we can get on i ill take it again because it was really a lot of fun   and the waters real clear down there   oh just crystal absolutely crystal clear the fish are just beautiful and if you like snorkeling   umhum yeah   oh just you just cant beat it i i love to snorkel and the the beaches are just snow white absolutely snow white have you ever been to the west coast of Florida   um no just to Galveston   oh well the west coast of Florida all all those beaches are snow white like that   umhum umhum   and the east coast you have to get down to Miami before theyre any you know before theyre snow white but the west coast is just beautiful   umhum   and i i go i moved here from Florida a couple of years ago back from i was living in Texas i went to Florida and came back and uh oh im going to retire down there one of these years and its going to be in on the west coast of Florida because its so gorgeous   yeah   the sand sand is just out of this and its just like sugar powdered sugar around uh oh Venice Beach and Clearwater especially has beautiful beautiful snow white sand   umhum   its really nice but i grew up in Colorado so i dont care for the mountains too much   hum   uh and California im a native Californian and they have mountains there my mother lives up in northern California theyre nice to visit and i didnt enjoy growing up in the mountains and id rather go to the sun than i would to the to the mountains i mean theyre all right i dont like it because i have to go now see to see me mother i have to go to the the the mountains   yeah   but if i didnt have to if i didnt have to go i would never go   did you ever go to Yosemite   yes   thats pretty isnt it   yeah it is and ive been to uh of course i grew up in Colorado where it was really mountainous and beautiful   umhum hum yeah   but uh when i go back and visit it im really disappointed it it it doesnt uh i remember it as a child and its nothing like what i remembered as a child its so commercialized and i it really   umhum   made me got kind of turn my stomach when i went back and saw how commercialized it had gotten but   yeah   im not a camper outer so i you know i if you like to camp out so thats fine but i i dont want to camp out i like the luxuries too much  i guess im spoiled i am spoiled   yeah   and i spoil myself i guess so i   and then in in Colorado its mostly streams and theyve dammed up some of them now so yeah   yeah it just so you dont Colorado just doesnt really show me anything anymore so   umhum   now my where my mother lives in northern California is absolutely gorgeous i mean just   yeah   picture postcard gorgeous and it it you know it just out of sight but uh its too uh ive got to be by a big city i i cant stand living that far away i fly up into Oregon and drive down to her house   umhum   and uh so shes really way up there and it it i just its just too far away from a a big city for me i got to have a shopping malls and  what have you   and northern California really is out in the boondocks isnt it   oh boy she is in  its its a good twelve hour hour drive just from San Francisco on winding winding winding river roads   umhum   and its way on up past the wine country and everything is like i say its really gorgeous but   but you fly in through Portland then   no Medford Oregon   oh they have a airport there uhhuh   yeah and then drive down its about an oh an hour hour and a halfs drive from Medford Oregon but its all mountain driving   umhum   and fortunately my sister picks me up i dont have to drive it   yeah   tried driving it once from San Francisco and that was a that was very dumb ill never try that again   they have a they they have a coast highway there dont they or   well this uh where my mother lives is uh it kind of in the middle of the state up north so   umhum   theyre about uh an hour or two drive from the ocean for the coast so you could go up that way but it would be out it would be out of your way better from from to go to her house at like up through Redding and on up that way   umhum   and uh   how far is it from Tahoe   oh gosh i dont know four hours i think four no i cant remember i seem like its eight hours somebody somebody told me it may be it may be twelve so i cant remember mine i know my son went from Tahoe to over to their house so and he knows that i i never have gone there so   umhum   i dont know   master the mountains too   yeah it really like i say it really is gorgeous   umhum   uh i uh i like the sunshine better i mean id rather go out where theres beaches and i dont i like to sun bathe and uh you know its getting so dangerous now the sun bathe or the sun burns and cancer skin cancer and everything so i load up you know on the sunscreens and so i because the ocean to me is real soothing and comforting comforting   yeah   and so thats why i like to to go there but and of course i dont like uh i like uh i like to snorkel so i have to go where theres real clear water to do that   yeah and around here the uh the Possum Kingdom is about the the closest place   is it really uh   yeah they have real clear water and plants   oh ive never been now where is that near   its uh near um well its its kind of near Abilene but its its uh about halfway in between here and and Abilene   oh okay   its uh you if you know where Albany is then uh its about maybe an hour west of Weatherford   oh okay   out there west of Fort Worth   uhhuh uhhuh   its a big its on the Brazos River they dammed up the Brazos River   oh i see i see   and its beautiful   is it no i i guess ive never been up there my my when i moved up here uh uh uh from Florida i i misplaced my snorkeling i think they what they did they didnt unpack it it must have been in a box or something they didnt unpack because i ended up without my snorkeling equipment and and a few other things and they must have been in a box that i had in my garage and they just didnt get them to me so   umhum   im going to have to start from scratch i guess and buy all new snorkeling equipment but i had some really good snorkeling equipment i really hate to start over again but theres no other choice choice but   yeah   anyway have we talked our five minutes   yeah i think so   okay well its been nice talking to you   yeah nice talking to you byebye   uhhuh byebye
