                                 Everyones an Expert                         Dear Dennis            Forgive me if I dont have much spring in my step this morning I was justreading the new issue of Harpers  and started a piece by William Gassin appreciation of the printed book He makes the usual comments about howwonderful books are and how an ideal home would have walls full of books andthen I got to this Every real book as opposed to dictionaries almanacs andother compilations is a mind an imagination a consciousness            Sigh As a dictionary editor it is frustrating enough to be thought to beproducing interchangeable and useless material but for a respected writer toregard dictionaries as mere compilations with no mind or imagination behindthem is especially bad            Your uservsexpert situation is right on target here Its not just myexperience its pretty much universal that language is thought to be a subjectthat anyone can comment on because everyone uses it Unlike math medicine oreven some sports which require deep knowledge to approach language is wideopen Everyone has a pet peeve be it a misused word an unusual pronunciationor what have you            For lexicographers this manifests itself most annoyingly in the poor stateof dictionary reviewing Most new dictionaries are not reviewed in themainstream press and even when they are they are not reviewed by linguists orlexicographers They are reviewed by writers on the grounds that people whouse the language professionally must be qualified to critique books devoted toit            As Sidney Landau points out in his excellent book Dictionaries The Artand Craft of Lexicography  this is much like assuming that anyone who livesin a house is qualified to be an architecture critic The result is that whendictionaries are discussed in the press only the most superficial issues aregiven attentionthe novelty of the new words entered the number of usagenotes the number of illustrations Important considerations such as thequality of the definitions are ignored And those writing dictionaries areencouraged by their marketing departments to add ever more flashy features togive the press something to focus on            I find that much of the time users have a very strong sense of what theylike and dislike in language and are unwilling to let any socalled expertsinfluence them Nor would I necessarily want to a persons aesthetic sense isnot to be tossed away lightly But I do wish that they would at least considerwhat we have to say since they might learn something on occasion            Perhaps Mr Gass whose own vocabulary is so rich could also still learnthat dictionaries are more than dull compilations They are even sometimesreal books            BestJesse
