Second Opium War British and French troops invaded Beijing and ransacked and ruined many of the buildings Empress Dowager Cixi saw to a complete restoration in  but the Western armies returned in  in retaliation for the siege of the Foreign Legation during the Boxer Rebellion Undaunted the Empress Dowager completed a second restoration in  The Summer Palace became her countryside version of the

With some  animals the zoo is the largest in China but despite its notable collection of giant pandas Siberian tigers golden monkeys and redcrowned cranes the facility is in need of modernization Few foreign visitors are happy with the size and condition of the cages although the new Panda Garden featuring a halfdozen adult pandas and twin babies is a bit more spacious and a step in the right direction Most of the zoos recent major funding has gone to the creation of the adjacent Beijing Aquarium a stateoftheart marine park scheduled to have  aquatic species in residenceExcursionsThe Great Wall is Chinas most popular attraction From Beijing splendid sections of the wall can be enjoyed at several locations Less visited and less crowded are two of Chinas greatest imperial cemeteries the Ming Tombs and the Eastern Qing Tombs Two other major excursions from Beijing are the Peking Man Museum at Zhoudian and the vast imperial retreat and temples of ChengdeGreat WallConstruction on the Great Wall began as long ago as the fifth century bc it winds across northern China for over  km  miles However the Great Wall Wanli Chang Cheng that most visitors see consists of a few beautifully restored segments near Beijing that were built extended or refortified during the Ming Dynasty ad  The Ming builders were the first to finish these massive earthen fortifications with brick They built a new section of the wall running for  km  miles just north of Beijing as a massive buffer and early warning system against invaders from the north This stratagem was to fail as the Manchus eventually broke through overthrew the Ming seized Beijing and established the Qing Dynasty in Chinas last imperial lineHundreds of thousands of laborers were conscripted over the centuries to extend and repair the Great Wall and many of them lie buried in its ruins In the seventh century ad over a million workers were said to be involved in this project but in the centuries sinceuntil the Ming Dynastymuch of the wall fell into ruin Even today most of its length has not been kept up the earthen remnants barely visible While it is often reported that the Great Wall is the only manmade object visible from the moon the claim is dubious at best Still it is Chinas grandest achievement on par with Egypts pyramids and a handful of other ancient wonders of the worldThe Great Wall is best appreciated at four main sites north of Beijing Badaling Mutianyu Simatai and Juyongguan Three of these four segments have been carefully refurbished with the exception of Simatai which is largely untouched since the days of the early Ming Dynasty The earthen foundations of the wall and watchtowers as well as much of the brickwork are original most of it  to  years old although extensive remodeling and fresh materials have been addedThe look and the feel are authentic enough once one is on the wall itself out of sight of the shops vendors tour buses parking lots and cable cars below The hordes of tourists are another modern addition of course but it is possible at all these sites to walk beyond the crowds The steep mountain scenery is spectacular and the air is usually quite clear The sheer steepness of the walls stone stairs and the precarious footing provided by the irregular treads are what most surprise firsttime visitors As it snakes up and down the peaks and ridges the wall conforms to a challenging topography one that leaves many tourists gasping for breath But the views from Chinas ancient Dragon of Stone make the journey unforgettableCarefully restored in  the Great Wall at Badaling  km  miles northwest of Beijing is the mostvisited portion of the wall The mountain setting is spectacular and the wall rises and falls steeply as it winds up and down the ridges About  m  ft high and  m  ft wide this Ming Dynasty fortification is built of tamped earth stone and brick Beacon towers of stone and brick are mounted at regular intervals It is possible to walk the stairs of the restored section for about  km  miles before reaching the crumbling remains of the original wall on either end At the northern terminus there is a cable car connecting the wall to a parking lot below The parking lots at the base of the wall are filled with vendors stores restaurants and other modern attractions including a cinema and a KFC fastfood outletBadaling is crowded especially from June through September but it is quite beautiful Equally attractive is the secondmost visited section of the Great Wall at Mutianyu  km  miles northeast of Beijing Mutianyu was opened to tourists in  to relieve the crowding at Badaling There is also a cable car at Mutianyu eliminating the minute hike up to the wall and at the foot of the wall there is again a village of vendors shops and cafs Mutianyu is one of the oldest restored sections of the Great Wall in the Beijing area thought to have been built under the Ming rulers nearly  years ago Visitors can walk well over a kilometer nearly a mile atop these ramparts from watchtower to watchtower At either end you can view the crumbling wall running to the horizon broken but still visible In the early spring and late fall particularly on weekdays the Great Wall at Mutianya is not very crowded Surrounded by its renowned green forests it is a pleasant alternative to BadalingThe Great Wall at Juyongguan  km  miles northwest of Beijing on the way to the Badaling section is the newest portion of the wall open to tourism  and the nearest to the capital Juyongguan contains a massive guard tower marking one of the Great Walls most celebrated mountain passes This guard tower built in  is decorated in Buddhist carvings with inscriptions in Chinese Tibetan Sanskrit and languages of the northern tribes Some of the temples and parks clustered at the pass in the days of the Ming dynasty have also been restored here The wall can be walked for  km  miles as it winds over the peaks of the Taihang MountainsThe least restored least crowded major segment of the Great Wall near Beijing is at Simatai  km  miles northeast of the capital Not only is Simatai rather far from the capital it is also quite uncrowded and unreconstructed Its stairways and watchtowers resemble those crumbling edifices one can only glimpse from Badaling Mutianyu and Juyongguan The natural scenery is dramatic and the ruined state of the wall gives Simatai a romantic feel although there is a cable car to the top It is also dangerous with broken stairways leading up some of the degree inclines Other portions are in such ruins that one must walk along the outside of the wall on steep narrow paths where the footing is difficultFrom the village at the base of Simatai there is a halfmile gravel path to the first stairway which skirts the small Simatai Reservoir The reservoir divides the Simatai wall from another section known as Jinshanling which adventurous hikers can also tackle Simatai consists of  beacon towers each about  m a quarter mile apart which were once used to transmit fire and smoke signalstower by towerto the Chinese armies encamped below should an enemy be sighted The highest of the beacon towers known as Wangjinglou stands at an elevation of  m  ft affording a grand view southwest toward Beijing Locals say the lights of the capital are visible on clear evenings from hereMing TombsThe valley of the Ming Tombs  km  miles northwest of Beijing is the final resting place of  of the  Ming emperors Courtyards and elaborate pavilions similar to those in the Forbidden City cap underground burial chambers where the emperor with his empress and concubines is entombedHere a Spirit Way Shen Dao  km  miles longthe most renowned graveyard entrance in Chinaforms a grand introduction to the valley It is lined with arching entrance gates and an avenue of stone animals  pairs of creatures including lions and elephants and court officials  pairs the statuary dating from  Inside the Dragon Phoenix Gate are the tombs of which three have been restored and opened to visitorsThe tomb of Emperor Yongle Chang Ling is the largest although its underground palace where the emperor and his empress are buried has not been opened Nor have the  satellite vaults where Yongles concubines are entombed The massive courtyards and pavilions above Yongles burial chambers have been restored and they house some of the Ming Tombs excavated treasures including imperial armorThe burial palace of Emperor Wanli Ding Ling honors the th Ming emperor who ruled from  to  His burial vaults  m  ft below ground are made of marble and cover  sq m  sq ft His white marble throne golden crown and red coffin along with the coffins of his wife and first concubine remain in the tomb The Zhao Ling tomb is also open but is less impressiveThe Ming Tombs were once a staple of tours to the Great Wall at Badaling but foreign tourists have seldom been impressed by the site finding it dank and poorly restored A more interesting imperial cemetery is the Eastern Qing Tomb site although it is located at a much greater distance from BeijingEastern Qing TombsNearly as vast and monumental as the Forbidden City the Eastern Qing Tombs Dong Qing Ling  km  miles northeast of Beijing require a considerable daytrip to view The journey over country roads while scenic is slow Emperor Sun Zhi  the founder of the Qing Dynasty selected this remote spot in a large mountain valley while on a hunting expedition It is Chinas largest royal cemetery with the tombs of  emperors  empresses and over  members of the Qing court Three of Chinas most famous rulers are buried here including Emperor Qianlong  Emperor Kangxi  and the notorious Empress Dowager Cixi Like the Ming Tombs the Eastern Qing Tombs are entered via a long Sacred Way lined with  pairs of stone animals and court officials The oldest tomb Xiao Ling is that of the founder of the Qing Dynasty Sun Zhi His tomb is unopened but the  pavilions and halls on the site can be visited The tomb of Emperor Kangxi Jing Ling is also unopened but its magnificent aboveground halls contain many original imperial treasures including Kangxis Dragon Throne The tomb of Emperor Qianlong Yu Ling is open Located  m  ft underground it consists of nine immense vaults and the marble coffins of the Manchu emperor and his five favorite consortsThe most lavish tomb is that of Empress Dowager Cixi Above her underground palace inside a sacrificial hall is a wax museum showing Cixi in full regalia as Goddess of Mercy her favorite Buddhist deity The underground palace contains her double goldandlacquer coffin Unfortunately the coffin was desecrated in  by a warlord who also plundered the tombs treasures including  pearls and a burial quilt studded with rare pearls Many of Cixis imperial treasures did survive and are now on display in the galleries above her tombPeking Man MuseumThe Peking Man Museum is located  km  miles southwest of Beijing in the village of Zhoukoudian whose name has become synonymous with Chinese paleontology In the hills and caves of Zhoukoudian archaeologists found the skull of a new ancestral link to mankind Homo erectus pekinensisPeking Man This  discovery suggested that mans closest ancestor might have lived in Asia as well as Africa Excavations of the site continued until  when most of the fossils were carried out of wartorn China by foreigners never to returnThe cave on Dragon Bone Hill where Peking Man lived  years ago showed evidence of a community numbering up to  individuals Nearby caves contained fossils and artifacts from morerecent Stone Age settlements  to  years ago These caves may now be visited their treasures housed in the nearby Peking Man Museum Here there are molds of the missing skulls an array of stone tools the bones of prehistoric beasts some human fossils and a modern statue of Peking Man himselfChengdeThe small city of Chengde formerly known in the west as Jehol  km  miles northeast of Beijing requires an overnight stay for visitors based in the capital But its worthwhile for anyone interested in seeing the monumental remains of the Qing Dynasty as well as its most spectacular Buddhist temples Chengde became the imperial resort of the Qing rulers who built a royal city and park here rivaling that of the Forbidden City and Summer Palace in BeijingThe Qing rulers never forgot their nomadic Manchu roots and Emperor Kangxi developed this remote valley in the countryside as a summer court and hunting ground in  It was here that Kangxis grandson Emperor Qinalong received the first official delegation from the West ever to visit China a British team headed by Lord Macartney in  And it was here that Lord Macartney refused to kowtow bow before the emperor ending any hopes for a peaceful opening of the door to trade in the th centuryThe Chengde Summer Palace today is demarcated by a wall  km  miles around and its grounds comprise the largest surviving imperial garden in China Among the palaces and halls still in place are the Front Palace where the emperors conducted official court business and nine courtyard halls in plain rustic style Beyond this cluster of imperial halls and residences is a large park with lakes bridges pavilions rockeries and the grasslands and hills where the court enjoyed sports on horseback There are copies of famous Chinese gardens here as well as small temples and multilevel viewing pavilionsChengdes other main attractions are the temples in the hills outside the park Many of these Eight Outer Temples have a strong Tibetan flavor All were built under Emperor Qinalong between  and  The Mount Sumera Longevity and Happiness Temple Xumifushou Miao commemorates the Panchen Lamas visit to Chengde in  A copy of the lamas residence in Shigatse Tibet it is crowned by a pagoda decorated in green and yellow tiles The Small Potala Temple Putuozongsheng Miao built in  is even larger and more lavish covering  hectares  acres Its great red hall evokes the Potala Palace in Lhasa and the arcades within are filled with Buddhist treasures including sensual figures related to the esoteric Buddhism of the Red Hat sectBeyond these and the other temples is Hammer Rock Bangchui Shan a massive stone pinnacle that can be reached by ski lift or hiking trails The view from this m ft natural tower of the valley below the imperial park and the surrounding Buddhist temples reveals the wealth and scale of the Qing Dynasty at its height In  this imperial summer villa was all but abandoned after Emperor Jiaqing was killed here by a bolt of lightning Less than a century later the Qing Dynasty itself was destroyed by Republican forces ending Chinas last period of imperial rule
