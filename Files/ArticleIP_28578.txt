Scotts silly about Cody Shearer and Chris Matthews should stopright here and use your very thoughtful link to my current Saloncolumn Its a longish list Im afraid but most of Scotts mistakes should beobvious to anyone who can read Just to correct the record in                  Slate                here they are            Scott writes On Jan  last year shortly aftershe had testified in the Paula Jones trial Willey reportedly had a frighteningencounter with a jogger near her house in Richmond Va Fact As I mentionedthe alleged incident on Jan  was three days before Willey testifiedin the Jones case Otherwise what was the point of intimidating her            Scott writes Matthews seemed to have a prettygood idea who the mysterious jogger wasan idea that he got from theDrudge Report  Fact As I noted the Drudge Report picked up thejoggers supposed identity from the Matthews broadcast in an item postedthe following day  Thats why the column was primarily aboutMatthews            Scott writes The next night chatting withNewsweek s Michael Isikoff and NOW President Patricia Ireland Matthewswas less coy The Shearer in question he declared was Brookes twin brotherCody Fact As I wrote quoting the transcript of May  Matthewsidentified Cody Shearer by name the night Willey appeared  There aremany words to describe the way Matthews behaved Coy is not among them            Scott writes Shearer could not have been Willeysstalker Conason declared because he was on a transcontinental flight lastJan a flight on which Shearer happened to bump into his brotherinlawsold boss former Secretary of State Warren Christopher Fact Actually what Ideclared was that Shearer has documents proving he was in SanFrancisco Jan and that he sat next to Christopher on a flight back toWashington Jan  This mistake is a little worse than what Matthews did Hehad to make a phone call to get the facts All Scott had to do was readthem            Scott writes According to a recent Drudgeposting a man with a gun was arrested outside Shearers house a few days afterMatthews Willey segment aired Fact This is exhausting Many news sourcesincluding the AP reported the appearance of a gunwaving man at Shearershome not just Drudge Those same sources also made it clear that the gun nutwasnt arrested outside Shearers house but in fact arranged voluntarysurrender to the police a few days later            As for my failure toexplain why nutty people are nutsand why they weave Shearer familyconspiracies around an event that may or may not really have occurredthat isbeyond my competence Sort of like

out my errors and I apologize to the readers ofS                  late for my carelessness The article as now publishedreflects the corrections                                       Ticketmaster                        I found Paul Krugmans  somewhat puzzling Firstwhy would allowing the interplay of freemarket forces imply that stadiumsmovie houses and other mass entertainment centers would become dominated bywealthy people More specifically why would letting the price of tickets riseto the market clearinglevel necessarily lock out the average fan This is anassumption about demand What Krugman appears to be saying is that demand for agiven commodity will become more inelastic as ones income or wealth increasesThis is odd because it collapses the distinction between willingness to pay andability to pay Just because someone can afford to pay  for an advancedshowing of The Phantom Menace or  for a Knicks game doesnt meanhe will Why then conclude domination by elites            Second even if we allow for Krugmans assumptionsand his conclusions it would still imply that those who pay more must also berabid fans Is it true that wealthy people are bigger sports fans than thenonwealthy If not stadium seating will always be accessible to the averagefan            Third even if we accept the conclusions theydont apply to all mass entertainment venues A particular sporting event canbe unique Seeing Michael Jordan do a slamdunk right in front of your eyesbecause you have courtside seats can be a singular experience A movie on theother hand is the same everywhere Why then would George Lucas be concernedabout alienating tens of millions of fans by allowing some advanced showings atpremium prices The movie can air for as long as it keeps packing the theatersHow is accessibility reduced            Fourth money is a very flexible tool It ispossible to shift our disposable income to any number of items Why couldnt anaverage fan spend  or so to see an advanced showing of The PhantomMenace and simply forgo doing something else he obviously valued lessCharging below market prices to make tickets affordable does not appear tomake any sense            Gary Beckers argumentis the only one that appears to make any sense If the value of massentertainment is in the social experience then guaranteeing that the venue bepacked by charging below market prices is a rational policy Many bars andclubs live and die by this principle often giving the impression of beingpacked by letting a long line of people in at a slower rate than theyotherwise could The strongest example of this is probably Wrigley Field Itsbeen argued that the stadium contributes enormously to the baseball experiencewhich is why the place is packed even if the Cubs have a bad season

customary to keep a loaded unlocked gun in ahouse with children asks the May   citing an experiment suggesting thatmany children especially ones aged  to  will play with guns even when toldnot to Let me suggest a possible answer             It turns out that there are very few fatalfirearms accidents involving children This may be surprising given that percent to  percent of all US households own guns but its so Accordingto the National Safety Councils Accident Facts  there were about fatal gun deaths in  among kids age  to  There were  such deaths amongkids  to  and  among kids  to  This tells us about the age of thevictim  not of the shooter but its the best rough proxy Ive seen inmy professional readings I teach a seminar on firearms regulation at UCLA LawSchool            To put that risk in some perspective about kids age  to  drown each year in residential swimming pools which are legaland even customary to keep around ones house thats twice as many as thefatal gun accidents for all kids age  to  even though pools are much lesscommon than guns I know some people fence their swimming pools but somedontjust like some keep their guns locked and others dont More generallythe total number of fatal accidents involving kids  to  that year was so fatal firearms accidents accounted for about  percent of the total Therewere about  fatal firearms accidents involving people of all ages out ofa total of  fatal accidents from all causes             But doesnt it make sense to require parents tokeep guns locked or unloaded even if itll save just one childs lifeUnfortunately the analysis cant be that simple because such a restrictionwill not only save lives but also cost lives            Guns are used quite commonly in selfdefenseestimates range from  National Crime Victimization Study to million to  million yearly defensive gun uses studies by largely proguncriminologist Gary Kleck and by largely antigun criminologist Philip CookNobody knows what the exact count is and how many of these uses involve savedlives or saved lives of kids Nor does anyone know how many of these useswould have been frustrated by having to fumble with unlocking the gun often inthe dark when one has just been waked up by an intruder breaking into thehouse It is at least possible though that this number of lost lifesavingselfdefense uses would be greater than the number of fatal accidentscaused by having the guns loaded and unlocked Not certain but possibleCertainly the answer isnt certain in the other direction             So one answer to thequestion Why would a reasonable gun owner believe that it should be legal andcustomary to keep a loaded unlocked gun in a house with children not quitethe question Todays Papers asked but the only one Im remotely qualified totry to answer is Because loaded unlocked guns can save childrens lives aswell as take childrens lives and reasonable gun ownersespecially ones wholive in dangerous parts of townmay be acting very rationally in keeping theirguns maximally ready for selfdefense despite the modest risks this mayimpose             Eugene Volokh                        Acting Professor UCLA LawSchool
