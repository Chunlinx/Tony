                 well i need to find out from you how the last remodeling project you undertook and if it was successful and you you were pleased with what happened   well   youve been doing any remodeling lately   the only remodeling we do is we put uh new uh we put up molding and wallpaper and we put it up in Chads room and in the uh   uhhuh   front room   all right did you like the results   but i let the yeah i dont do the actual uh uh putting it i dont actually cut them the molding i mean we have a guy come in and do that and we do the painting and the sanding and then i built some shelves in the basement last week so i i guess that qualifies   uhhuh all right yes it does what kind of molding is this uh molding   crown molding and then some uh chair molding but uh   oh uhhuh well thats a lot of fun we   i guess maybe we will have to do some new projects when the baby comes   oh yeah decorate a nursery or something huh   yeah well you know we got the TV in this room thats probably have to be converted to a bedroom so   oh okay yes get some uh get an extra room there for the new baby   well you you havent had to do any of that have you   whats that   any remodeling really   no uh weve done uh some painting and put up some wallpaper in uh the boys room   uhhuh   we needed to to paint because the paint was uh getting molten dingy or or grain plus there was a lot of markings on the on the paint that       well on top of the bunk beds the boys got up there and uh started drawing on the ceiling and that was kind of hard to get off so we decided rather than uh uh wash it all off and clean it up we decided to paint over it and   uhhuh   the walls were were textured and there was a lot of holes from the previous owners and so we patched them all up and painted and and put border and wallpaper along the top and it looks really nice now and we were quite pleased with it and and uh   umhum   it uh looks pretty good theres a lot of other things that Cheryl would like me to do but   yeah   its just finding the time   yeah  i guess well eventually get around to finishing the basement someday i dont know when   well good good uh   i think i might uh paint the uh cement you can theres supposedly kind of a cement paint you can get that uh will make it just a little nicer even you know before we finish it   uhhuh well good you uh you put on a deck deck there recently too havent you or thats been a couple of years   well parts of the cement cement had a patio i painted the uh our porch   uhhuh   that was kind of a job  had eighty eight spindles to sand and take all the paint off borrowed an air gun from Lauras brother in law and it uh   yeah i imagine it would be wow painted it with   yeah and that worked nice its just one of those Wagner ones you know they   well good yeah we have one   they work pretty well really theyre noisy   yes i yeah they are they they make a lot of noise but theyre good   yeah   we havent used ours yet wed like to use ours   you havent used it at all   no i havent   oh so you dont you dont know how uh wait the only thing youve got to worry about is getting the paint the right viscosity   yeah so it doesnt jam up   youve used one before though it sounds like   yes i have   yeah   it was my dads and i i used it with him   umhum   was able to paint some things and uh and he said he didnt need it anymore and he he gave it to us and we havent had a chance to or need to paint anything down here yet i im kind of leery about using it inside     oh yeah   um because it does put a lot of particles and mist in the air that i didnt want to get all over the carpet or   yeah yeah it puts out a lot and i mean i even ordered us that one when we did that porch   yeah uhhuh   i mean there was  had the i had my watch and it was all over my shoes and uh the shrubs all turned white down there     it it snowed huh thats about the only snow we can get down here in Texas if it if it were a white paint you probably used a a uh redwood color or a stain didnt you   yeah it was just it was white   oh it was   yeah because the porch the porch spindles are white   yeah thats right thats right   and uh it was a latex we had a hard time getting it thin enough because latex is kind of rubbery to begin with a little thicker than most but it ended up working fine plus i was the weather you know i did it in uh   oh yes umhum oh good     well the winter started to to cool down i think it must have been October when i finished   umhum   yeah i remember it was a conference weekend i think when i finished   well the the weather i understand was pretty good at that time   yeah it was it was not bad but   yeah the weather weather is beautiful down here real nice real nice it got up to about seventy five degrees down here and thats kind of the right temperature to be painting things but   is it yeah   yeah its uh we would like to like to do a little bit more well probably do some we were working recently out on our spa   humum   and uh and hot tub trying to it was really overgrown with a lot of   yeah   i guess uh what is it honeysuckle uh
