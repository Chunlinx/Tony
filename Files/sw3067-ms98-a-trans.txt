            okay uh   do you have annual family reunions or   uh yeah uh our  the my my my mothers side of the family is quite large or well was quite large at one time and uh  they uh for as long as i can remember have had uh a yearly reunion um back uh early on they used to to rotate them from house from some to to different peoples houses in the family   umhum all local were they like all in Dallas   and uh no no not no this was well i am actually from Mississippi and so thats it was it was around there generally uh thats where the family   oh uhhuh uhhuh just from city to city then huh   grew yeah and it was not only in Mississippi in some other places as well so it was uh   umhum umhum   it it it was a big deal but uh they they tried to to centralize it in one spot so in the past couple of years they had it at um state park every year   umhum umhum   we rent a pavilion and and do that and thats usually works out to be pretty good uh they will rent a pervilion pavilion on a weekend and uh   do you go back   i havent gone back lately in fact uh this past Sunday was the uh was the reunion but i didnt get to go uh i have   is it choice or just business or   not getting to go uh just uh the distance involved and uh just not   umhum umhum umhum   i have a younger daughter now and uh i its kind of hard to get her  get her there and everything but i am going to to uh   umhum   hopefully next year get to go back because uh a lot of the family has not uh on her side my mothers side has not seen you know my daughter so   oh do you have brothers and sisters   i have one brother   uhhuh uhhuh and is your mother still living   so yes   oh so so you go back and visit with her anyway wouldnt you i mean either way there was family reunion time or   right yeah right i i usually see her a couple times a year so thats no no   or not   big thing but uh i uh i do i do enjoy the reunions the only problem is that now um originally originally when we had them uh they were mainly my mothers uh fathers my mothers fathers family had quite a few uh   relatives right umhum   brothers and sisters so it was a large reunion of of of of that group uh from that descendancy   umhum   and uh a lot of those people have and and at time you know they all knew one another   right right   and now its gotten uh that uh a lot of those people are died have uh have died off or you know what we are left with is the the relatives of of of that group   the next generation uhhuh   and so uh its not quite as close as it used to be so i think people feel less of a of a desire to really go i know that   why why why do you think that its less close than it used to be   well i i just think that uh you know at that time when when they were you know  those were all brothers and sisters a lot and or they were all in the same area geographical location you know back back around you know in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up   umhum umhum umhum   um you know they were all located together together in one small community   right right right   and as as time grew  i mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth and now when you when you they come together its its generally you know like say the kids kids of those people who are not you know anywhere near one another and i dont think they feel the the the closeness that they used to be there   umhum   which is a shame but thats just how it is my mother was complaining last year about the you know its dwindling down every year you know thats just i think thats just   is that just familys lack of priority anymore maybe yes that we get so involved in our work lives and just   well yeah   social lives and so forth that   yeah thats uh yeah i think thats some of it but you know I i i its just the way you know i think society society is now is that we are not we dont have the extensive family we used to its more of a you know a smaller   uhhuh   smaller unit and you know we we tend to try to do things i think with with our immediate family as opposed to the extended family of people that we may or may not remember or know you know very well uh   right right it really makes an effort on to to do this anymore right right   right it requires a lot of effort to to to to do that sort of thing i mean i i used to enjoy going i mean i still do kind of enjoy it but uh its it doesnt its not as many people there that i really really enjoy seeing   right right   you know i its going just for the sake of getting together i think for the family and   do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother thats in that group   uh   on a regular basis not just Christmas cards though   um um no not really that in that but then again uh well i you know i have some aunts that uh i i i i do thats about  my mothers sisters   umhum umhum   you know but i feel closer to them because i kind of grew up with them but but uh as for the you know for the rest of that group no not really   right   you know and and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion so uh you do not really feel that   right right   that really close to them   right in my my uh fathers family we get together  every year at a different location either Dallas or Oklahoma City they had chosen Santa Barbara California for this summer and and didnt get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or like in the Texas Oklahoma area   umhum   and uh so they canceled that one and uh are looking next year bringing it back closer but we have a letter a family letter   umhum   that circulates and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote thats on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top and then thats the way its kept in order and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion you dont feel like i dont know anything about this person youve youve read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth so you are kind of half way acquainted that way   thats a good idea right   and that thats been a thats been a nice way of   yeah   keeping us all aware of each other i think   right   we tried to start that in my husbands family his mothers side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago and i said well lets start this letter and it just never  my husbands sisters started it and sent it to us and thats as far as it got i sent it on to the next one and and but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in Scottsdale Arizona for that family   yeah umhum   and uh were real glad we got together because since that that time there were only like two of the one sister and one sisterinlaw of the original family left and the sisterinlaw died and the sister is in a nursing home so we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago
