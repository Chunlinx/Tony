              so do you exercise   yeah i just started about uh two months ago consistently doing it um     well thats good   yeah i uh i walk jog three times a week for about an hour   oh huh   yeah so ive just gotten up to um being able to jog one and a half to two miles and then       um about mile and a half of walking   yeah   so   well i do a lot of walking at work because im outside a lot so   oh oh okay what kind of work do you do   im in the Air Force   oh okay   so im outside a lot i work on airplanes so i do a lot of walking there   yeah okay so you consider that your exercise   uh yeah   yeah   uh but i need to work on getting into an exercise program really   hum what kind of exercise program would you think you might want to get into   uh just basically the the uh uh up my uh you know heart rate and respiration and stuff just to keep it   umhum   going because ive noticed ive been getting a little tired lately   maintain it oh well what kind of things do you like to do like um do you like to run or play a sport or   well i kind of   bicycle ride   i kind of like bicycle riding and and running a little bit i dont you know really particular like running but   umhum yeah  well its kind of hard on the joints   yeah   theres a lot of other things to do   umhum   bicycle riding is pretty good for you   yeah   you dont have to put any um shock no it doesnt shock your joints or theres no pounding or anything     yeah huh   yeah so you think you might get an exercise bicycle   oh i might i got a a regular bicycle out in the   oh   out in the garage but its its been kind of raining and stuff around here lately so there aint been much of a chance to go riding a bicycle   yeah yeah thats the problem with with that is like if you wanna be consistent and then the weathers bad you cant really or get out when its cold or whatever   yeah yeah   yeah so i have an exercise bike at home but i dont use it  it just kind of sits there in the corner       yeah but you got a good exercise program going on it looks like   but yeah and the reason that im doing it is because i have a friend doing it with me otherwise i wouldnt have the motivation   yeah so your motivation is having somebody do it with you   yeah well its you know im a student and im in school all day and im really tired the end of the day and a lot of times i just wanna go home   yeah   you know and and eat       but knowing that my friends waiting for me you know i meet her at the stadium where we work out um   yeah   it makes me go and then after i do it i im glad i went and i enjoy it and i have more energy yeah after you do it   yeah     so and we encourage each other so   yeah well i went on a trip once and me and the the guy i went with we went to the gym three times a week and worked out so   oh thats great   that i got into that and then when i got back home i just couldnt keep into it because   yeah   you know its   its hard you let other things get in the way and and the youre busy   yeah   yeah and if you have a family and   yeah i got one son and he kind of keeps me a little busy around the house and   yeah its kind of hard to its like you have to schedule a time and stick to it but its hard when   yeah   you dont have somebody to do it with you its easy to just say well im not gonna do it today but ill do it tomorrow and then you never do it   yeah thats and plus my work schedule because theres times i go in at all different hours and its kind of hard to keep a steady   umhum oh yeah that would be tough   so   yeah well   thats what hurts me a lot about getting into a exercise program   umhum yeah well maybe you can you can um i dont know do a lot of walking like you are and do calisthenics or something i dont know   yeah   or get an exercise bike and in the house   yeah well ive been looking at them uh Nordic Tracks   oh yeah   i hear theyre supposed to be pretty good huh   huh yeah i have a friend that has one and she said its really really good it works a lot a lot of your muscles   yeah umhum   and uh she just does it thirty thirty minutes three times a week   oh   and thats not too much time   no not really well thats part of what the brochure said too you know twenty thirty minutes a day and or three times a week or however   yeah yeah umhum you see if you just keep that up you know thats not too much time and then i bet itll really improve your you know your cardiovascular system and and all of that because they say even if you just do that it increases   yeah   your life span i dont know how much but
