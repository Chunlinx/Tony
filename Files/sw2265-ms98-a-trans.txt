        uh tell you what  um ill let you start or  if thats all right   okay um my major source of information i guess is TV news  excuse me i uh wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while im getting ready to go to work oh i quite frequently uh glance through headlines or in the newspaper but uh primarily mine is uh TV news how about yourself   pretty interesting yeah i have to have to agree with you um normally dont have time in the morning to to watch the any type of TV usually catch it going to work on the radio or when i drag the paper in from the front and it pops out of the bag i usually catch the headlines which is normally what you see the night before on the evening news  yeah so uh ive kind of um   um true   uh we have a one year old in the house so its kind of hard sometimes to watch TV during the during the during the night but i usually try to catch the ten oclock or um um those type of issues id to say during the war uh there were we were the American public was probably flooded with um   uhhuh   uh too much information and as far as the sub question about was i satisfied am i satisfied with the coverage id have to say yes but when it came to the war issues it was like whos telling the truth you could between the channels there was uh the casualties were differently the amount of missiles launched were different and it was almost too much information overcommunicated   well thats true but uh i uh my personal opinion is that the uh the various network news  medias were uh trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military   true i agree with you   now i can appreciate that especially after what happened in Vietnam   yeah which is a is a joke   uh but i mean lets face it todays todays uh means of communications we could uh very well a newscaster could very well give away away a piece of top secret information   umhum   and uh pat himself on the back for for uh making a big scoop   yeah thats a good point uh but i would have to say across the board im im satisfied with the way uh the news is is spread um of course here at Texas Instruments uh the rumor mill runs rampant the secretarys probably are the best resource of what the layoff status is   very true i find T News very enlightening and i check that everyday and of course with that goes along the the stock price of TI   yes yeah   yeah yeah yeah i agree with you i im glad you mentioned that because i think i have to since i dont have the opportunity in the morning ill probably catch the the head lines on T News thats a good point   of course T News is is more or less headlines uh i dont think much of of their sports coverage   umhum yeah true kind of short   all they give the scores   yeah least   but uh thats right im not yeah outside of of uh pro football im not too interested in other games uh other sports anyway   umhum   but uh the the T News is is a good way to keep up to date i think they do a pretty good job selecting the most important items   well thats great yeah i do i surely do they do they surely do uh anything anything else cross your mind uh i guess most of us go by the audio which is the the television television or the radio   uhhuh   um yeah but you need to continue to read so you you can people learn to read you know   well i spent twenty years in professional in uh commercial broadcasting ten in radio and then ten in uh TV and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits and of bits and pieces of news on the air   hm   uh i mean there there are times where uh video uh reporter actually will risk is life life and limb ive seen it happen time and time again and uh  well i remember one time up in Nashville Tennessee was one of the fellows fellows got mixed up in a with a riot going on down there but he was lucky he got out of it   hm   for some reason because he was carrying a camera uh they left him alone   ouch everybody got excited   umhum   thats tough thats tough  well ive enjoyed speaking with you   nice talking to you too Jim   did you get your catalog on your your your gifts   no   oh yeah i just got mine in the mail so it kind of inspires me to keep calling   oh well ill have to be looking for it then   yeah theyre not to shabby theyre pretty good   is that right well good   yes sir have a great day byebye   you too
