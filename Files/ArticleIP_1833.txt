weatherchaos El Nio is part of a larger cycle Periodically the conditions thatproduce El Nio act in reverse This produces La Nia which causes differentbut equally freaky global weather conditions            Congress and the Federal Emergency Management Agency areholding emergency hearings about the new El Nio and the media are covering itobsessively There is good reason to worry The eastern Pacific has heatedfaster this year than at any time in recorded history El Nio  promises tobe the most brutal climatic event of the century surpassing even El Nio which killed thousands and caused  billion in

everything Hollywoodsdisastermovie villainsDantes Peak the twisters the Titanic icebergarepikers next to El Nio Here is a partial list of events that El Nio can beblamed for at least partially the ongoing drought in Australia New ZealandThailand Malaysia and Papua New Guinea forest fires in Indonesia famine inNorth Korea the appearance of hurricanes along the Pacific coast of the UnitedStates the disappearance of hurricanes along the Atlantic Coast of the UnitedStates a mild winter in the Northeast a harsh winter in the Southeast thefailure of the fish harvest in South America El Nio seems

El Nios bring lots of rain to the region and if theysubside there may be too little water to sustain the Sun Belt            El Nio in fact is a conspiracy so immensethat it even explains the other weather conspiracynamely the jet stream Thewarm moist El Nio air causes the jet stream to split as it flows eastwardover North America One arm dips south giving the Gulf Coast a wet winter Theother stays in Canada The Northeast is thus spared the jet streams Arcticblasts and enjoys a lovely winter            Despite implicating El Nioin all these varied weather crimes scientists know surprisingly little aboutit This years El Nio is the first major one to have been  Before El Niowas identified weather consisted of a series of little mysteries Why is therea thunderstorm Why a drought Those mysteries have been solved sort of butthey have been supplanted by a much bigger one What is El Nio Weather mavensdont understand why El Nio begins They dont know why it is occurring morefrequently It used to arrive every five to eight years recently its beencoming every three to five years Scientists are befuddled about itsrelationship if any to global warming Some say global warming is making ElNio more severe others say El Nio is making global warming more severe ElNio is a darling of greenhouse skeptics because it shows how mighty MotherNature is compared with man If El Nio a natural phenomenon we dontunderstand and cant control can shift worldwide temperatures and rainfalldramatically we should hesitate before blaming our own carbon dioxideemissions for the worlds ills            There is one other reasonwhy El Nio is a fitting weather pattern for the age On balance it rewardsAmerica at the expense of the rest of the world In Africa Australia Indiaand Southeast
