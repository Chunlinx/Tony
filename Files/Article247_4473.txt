                                 Retooling the Sports Scene                        Hi Chris            Had to laugh at that image you conjured up of Michael Jordan sitting in theWashington Wizards locker room by himself dressed and ready for practice longbefore anyone else on his newly purchased team showed up Theres a bit of ageek factor there isnt there Something thats not usually associated withJordan even though he always tells those stories about not being able to get adate in high school            But I do hope that your characterization of Jordan as the wily veteran whotakes a wrecking ball to todays something multimillionaire What Mepractice sports world is what happens But I wonder Magic Johnson didnthave that impact when he briefly tried coaching the Lakers a few years ago Hefound many of the players incorrigibly apathetic or selfabsorbed He quit indisgust Now hes playing in Swedenhonest to Godagainst whom I dontknow The Flying IKEAs The Stockholm Saunas Who And what do they give awayat halftimesnowblowers And did you see yesterday that Dennis Rodman saidhes interested in joining the Dallas Mavericks but quote his calendar isbooked through this weekend Essentially Rodman would love to join theMavericks but playing those pesky games just gets in the way            Clearly the whole sports scene needs some retooling The tabloids here inNew York have dubbed this Sundays Super Bowl the Mayflower Bowl because bothteams St Louis and Tennessee deserted their original homes Word just gotout that Sebastian Janikowski the pudgy Polishborn kicker at Florida Statemay be deported if hes convicted of trying to bribe police to get a friendreleased from jail Even the Olympics which we both consider the mostwonderful stirring spectacular sports event there is was tainted by thatpayola scandal last year Remember Representatives from the host city wannabeswere funneling payoffs and jobs to International Olympic Committee voters            What astounded me most was the cheesy stuff the voters requested            Lawn equipment            A  violin            A pair of AKC registered bulldogs or  worth of door knobs            Im not making this up            Arrangements were made for the pianist daughter of IOC vice president Kim UnYong to rehearse with the Berlin Philharmonic when Berlin was seeking the Games Though described as only modestly talented Kims daughter alsoperformed with the Melbourne Symphony in  when that city was chasing theOlympics and with the Utah Symphony in             The Utahans even paid her             Presumably to go away            How many times can you hear Chopsticks            Still the undisputed king of graft seems to have been JeanClaude Ganga aninfluential IOC member from the Republic of Congo who asked for medicaltreatment for himself and a free knee replacement for his motherinlaw Hiswife Eugenie received free cosmetic surgery            Now seriously Chris if you had a bunch of wellheeled businessmen ready tofulfill your every whim wouldnt you ask for something better than a titaniumknee or a riding mower Whatever ever happened to craving a Porsche Aspeedboat A villa on the coast of Spain How about a Matisse            Im ranting I know Perhaps this is just bitterness on my part When I readabout Eugenies cosmetic surgery I was stricken by a thought You mean IOCmembers can demand just about anything in exchange for their votes on anOlympic host city and I chose to be a sportswriter  Ive settled forthe Rangers pregame buffet all these years when I couldve had a free nosejob instead What was I thinking            Johnette
