                all right are we paying too much in taxes and are we getting what we pay for       whats your opinion   well its kind of a broad subject uh i i think there are some areas where we where we uh pretty well       you know get our moneys worth but i i i also think there are a lot of areas especially in uh big government federal government uh where were were short changed uh lot of money spent for uh things that are not used and i dont know i was i was in the Air Force and out of it there were  there was equipment at every base i was ever on that was just going to waste it was just sitting and rusting and you know it   okay i i tend to agree with you when it comes to government spending there are so many studies done that dont mean anything   yeah   but well spend hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars on   yeah   and its nice to know something doesnt work or something doesnt exist but it could be put to more practical use   yeah and i i think that uh  its a a tone of our times that politicians uh are into themselves more than they are into you know doing something worthwhile for the people they represent which which is really unfortunate   that is true i agree with you in that area um i have a tendency to im in from Texas and i read you know how our politicians voted each week in the paper   yeah   and its you know its interesting how the votes vary and what they ran on in platform   umhum   dont necessarily come true in their voting in the Senate or Congress whatever   and dont really respond to uh people who write them and call them and uh you know unless theyre in the limelight and under pressure so yeah i think we get short changed on that   right thats very true what state what state do you live in   Texas   okay what do you think about Robin Hood   now that well i work for school district and uh its it has hurt us a lot um there has to be some way i think to equalize education opportunities but um at you know our uh we we tend to think i think this especially big government tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it and i dont you know thats just not true i dont think the you know i dont think money is gonna take the place of intelligence or uh problem solving skills uh i think there there are too many things that money cant  uh that cant that money cant buy that that are important as far as education is concerned   thats true what school district do you work for   Richardson   okay i work for Plano  so were comparable as a matter of fact i just paid my Richardson taxes because i live in Richardson and   oh great okay yeah   supplemented the Robin Hoods very thoroughly i think   yeah i think weve uh   our taxes went up tremendously   we yeah weve got it on the line dont we   yes   and its not gonna get any better dont i mean you know it just keeps going up and up and up uh i used to live in the Plano school district and uh there was a an organization a taxpayers organization that uh finally communicated the message to i think to the people in Plano that you know we didnt want our taxes raised   yes i remember that was about four five years ago   yeah   yes   but this you know this uh i think living in Richardson were kind of spoiled because i think we get  we come closer to getting our moneys worth as far as the city is concerned i think then probably any city any city in the country   yes well did you read in the Dallas paper where they increased the teachers the administrators pay by thirty three percent   is that incredible   after they laid off all those teachers   thats a thats the biggest mess ive ever heard of you know how can you how can you justify raising anybodys salary if you you know if you have to lay people off   right but you know im not gonna complain because Plano got we all got a pay raise this year   yeah   you all got a pay raise this year am i correct   yeah well yeah the i think teachers did uh did and i dont know about administrators i im semiretired and i was i was an administrator so i i you know i dont get a raise anymore i just   okay   uh i work part time and just get uh  you know my pay doesnt change   are you on the early retirement   yes   oh are you enjoying it   yes very much uh course i still i still work two part time jobs so its not really total retirement   hm   well its interesting you know because when you look at what Richardson has done with the early retirement you
