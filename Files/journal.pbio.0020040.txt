                            For people who received their introduction to cancer genetics in college in the first        half of the s everything looked simple and straightforward It was the stuff you could        explain to sincerely interested relatives who wanted to know what you were spending your        time on There were oncogenes and there were tumour suppressor genes Oncogenes were        overactive genes and proteins that somehow caused cancer because they were overactive        therefore they were dominant Tumour suppressor genes were genes that would normally        prevent a tumour from happening and that needed to be inactivated for a tumour to start to        form both copies of a tumour suppressor gene had to be inactivated and the mutation was        recessive If inactivation of these genes is a random process it was understandable that        people who inherit an inactivated copy of a tumour suppressor gene had a higher risk of        developing the associated forms of cancer than people born with two normal copies as        postulated in Alfred Knudsons  twohit model And indeed it was shown that in the        tumours in these predisposed patients the remaining wildtype copy of the tumour        suppressor gene was lost a process referred to as loss of heterozygosity        For me in  things started to change Venkatachalam et al  published a paper        in the         EMBO Journal describing a detailed study of tumours in mice lacking one        copy of the p tumour suppressor gene         Trp  This gene is known to be the most mutated gene in human cancer        and its function to be central to many processes that are involved in the cellular        prevention of cancer Mice lacking both copies of this gene are for the most part viable        but succumb to cancer mainly thymic lymphomas at three to five months of age Donehower        et al  Mice born with one copy of the         Trp gene start to develop cancer at around nine months and incidence        increases with age        In their study Venkatachalam and colleagues analysed an impressive group of          Trp         mice of controlled genetic background and followed the fate of the         Trp wildtype allele in the tumours According to the twohit model it        was expected that in these tumours this copy would have been lost or inactivated However        this turned out not to be the case Half of the tumours from mice younger than  months        were found to have retained the wildtype copy of         Trp  a number that increased to  in mice older than  months In        two tumours the researchers sequenced the complete coding region of the remaining        wildtype allele and showed it was structurally intact To exclude the possibility of        downregulation or inactivation at the level of protein expression they irradiated        tumourbearing mice prior to sacrifice a treatment known to increase p protein levels        via posttranslational mechanisms Their data showed the retained wildtype allele in these        tumours was expressed normally and suggested it had a normal wildtype conformation        Next the authors did a rigorous test of different functions of the p protein They        first tested whether the tumours showed amplification of Mdm This protein whose        expression is regulated by p stimulates breakdown of p thereby forming a negative        feedback mechanism that keeps p levels low Some tumours therefore amplify the         Mdm gene as a means of inactivating p However this was not found in        the tumours from the         Trp         mice Subsequently the researchers tested to what extent the        retained         Trp copy behaved normally Irradiation of many tissues leads to        pdependent apoptosis and indeed in tumours that had retained the wildtype allele        irradiation did lead to an increase in apoptosis whereas in tumours that had lost the        wildtype allele it did not        The p protein is known to function as a transcriptional regulator by either up or        down regulating target genes in response to different forms of cellular stress including        irradiationinduced DNA damage The authors studied the expression of two pupregulated        genes         Cdkna  which encodes p and         Mdm  and one downregulated gene         Pcna  in ppositive tumours after irradiation and showed responses        indicative of normal p function Furthermore it was shown that the p protein from the        tumours was able to bind to a pbinding DNA sequence in an in vitro setting Finally        since it is known that p absence in tumours is correlated with chromosomal instability        Venkatachalam et al  used comparative genome hybridisation to compare this feature        between pnegative and ppositive tumours and found a fold greater stability in the        latter        In short this paper clearly showed that at least in mice in many         Trp         tumours the wildtype allele of         Trp is not only retained but also appears to function normally This        strongly suggested that a decrease of dosage in p is already sufficient for        tumourigenesis a phenomenon referred to as haploinsufficiency Shortly before the group        of Moshe Oren Gottlieb et al  had shown that a         Trp         background leads to a greater than  reduction in p activity        using a presponsive         lacZ reporter gene in transgenic mice Venkatachalam and colleagues        suggested the strong concentration dependence of p function could be explained by the        fact that p functions as a tetramer A  decrease in p monomers can easily be        imagined to result in a greater than  decrease in functional tetramers which in turn        increases the chances of these cells becoming cancerous        This paper by Venkatachalam et al  made me realise how important it is to remain        critical even of longestablished theories and models Since then haploinsufficient        mechanisms have been described in more tumour suppressor genes in humans and mice reviewed        in Fodde and Smits  For instance in a recent paper in         PLoS Biology  Trotman et al  used mouse models to describe how        the dosage of the         Pten tumour suppressor gene influences the occurrence of prostate cancer        Further genes have been described with other unexpected roles in the tumourigenic process        There is a longstanding debate in the literature about the number and role of mutations in        a tumour and without going into the details it is clear that haploinsufficient mechanisms        for tumour suppressor genes will greatly influence the statistics on which these        discussions are based At a time when microarray analysis has become a standard experiment        and the many thousands of changes in tumour cells are analysed across the whole genome it        is important to keep in mind that the correct interpretation of this wealth of information        might be more complicated than the widely accepted models would have us believe
