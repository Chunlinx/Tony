                                 Objects of Beauty             Still life that most humbleof the classical genres traces its origins to a legendary painting contestAround  BC the Greek painter Zeuxis was said to have painted grapes solifelike that birds came to peck at them His rival Parrhasios secretlypainted a curtain over the panel of grapes Zeuxis tried to lift the curtainand lost the contest Teasingly realistic grapes and drapes have figured instill lifes ever since Some of the most spectacular examples of the genrewhich got its name in  th century Holland depict great mounds offruit and fabric that fool the eye  trompe loeil  so completely that wecan practically smell them and feel them            Stilllifethe portrayal of familiar inanimate objectsis as the name suggests aparadoxical genre Its French name nature morte dead nature pointsup the paradox even more acutely If the Dutch banquet pieces suggest endlessbeautyHolland in the  th century was so rich it didnt know whatto do with its moneytheres a darker side to still life that warns of thebrevity of earthly pleasures The ancient Egyptians painted images of food andpersonal effects in their tombs images that were to accompany the dead ontheir last journey and a rich tradition of European stilllife painting slipslittle reminders of mortalityskulls and flickering candlesamong the applesand pears and peeled lemons            Still life then is caught between the timeless vision andthe ticking clock When you enter the current show at the Museum of Modern Arttitled Objects of Desire The Modern Still Life you find yourself in a smallwhite room with only one painting on the wall Czannes Still Life With aGinger Jar and Eggplants  This is the timeless vision The effectis that of a hushed chapel and on the altar is this gorgeous riddle of apainting with its tilted plate of ripe pears its pendulous eggplants itsgreat blueblack bedspread draped across the lower half of the painting andits round wickerwound ginger jar carefully placed in the middle Every formfinds an echo elsewhere in the painting and none of the depicted objects callsattention to the historical moment            Its adazzling opening this great Czanne and much of the explosion of Cubist workin the next room builds on Czannes achievement The gravitydefying sepiaswirls of Picasso and Braque with their fragments of guitars and violinsafiddlehead here an Scurve there a couple of quarter notes waltzing off atable edge somewhere elsehave a kindred formal harmony            Then you turn a corner and enter a different world wherethe immediacy of modern life of the ticking clock is everywhere palpableHere in a glass case is Man Rays Gift a clothes iron painted black with a row of  tacks glued headfirst into theface Next to it is Marcel Duchamps bizarre Why Not Sneeze Rose Slavy a metal bird cage painted white containing  marble cubes athermometer and a piece of cuttlebonethe internal shell of a squidlikecreature used according to the dictionary as a dietary supplement for cagedbirds Such objects with their elliptical wit return us to the dark side ofstill life these bones and cages and tacks and thermometers offer a deadpananswer to what life is Cest la vie                        These readymades asDuchamp called them pose in a new way the oldest stilllife question Is itreal or is it art Instead of birds pecking at painted grapes we have objectsthat are real and art Andy Warhols carefully constructed and paintedBrillo                Boxes  stacked on the floor look an awful lot likeBrillo boxes stacked on the floor Backtracking I found myself wondering whatthese things had to do with Czanne and the answer is not much            Foralongside Czannes timeless forms in subtle harmony another modern stilllifetradition has flourished more in tune with pop culture advertising and thedisposable culture of the  th century MoMA which does so well bythe scions of Czanne is less instructive about this hybrid line ofdescent            There was space in that little white chapel at the start ofthe show to include an example of the trompe loeil American mastersWilliamHarnett and John Peto contemporaries of Czannes who are just as muchfounders of modern still life as Czanne and whose more playful spirit is justas tangible in the works at MoMA After all the title of the show perfectlyfits the objects Harnett and Peto assembled dollar bills snapshots of lovedones jewelstudded pistols            As oneventures deeper into the  th century from Dadaism to Surrealism toAbstract Expressionism and Pop Art it is Harnett one thinks of more often thanCzanne Harnetts practice of inserting newspaper headlines among histackedup objects turns up in Braque and Juan Gris their way of asserting boththe uptodateness of their art and the background noise of World War I            One aim of Objects of Desire is to show how the sameobjects in the limited repertory of still lifewine bottles and fruits pipesand shaving kitstake on very different meanings public and private overtime The show succeeds spectacularly in this regard Gerald MurphysRazor  is alert to consumerist art during the s the socalledgolden age of advertising The razor crossed with the fountain pensurmounted by a box of matches reminds those in the know that Murphy themodel for the hero of F Scott Fitzgeralds Tender Is the Night  gave uppainting to run the family business Mark Cross pens When a trompeloeil shaving brush and a match turn up later in the show in MagrittesPersonal Values  they have an oneiric suggestivenessquite in contrast to Murphys flat factuality Superimposed against a blue skyMagrittes comb seems to be lying on clouds of shaving creama paintersdreamwhile the match lies asleep on the floor Stilllife objects that havefigured for centuries as reminders of mortality can take on new urgency underthe pressure of history In Max Beckmanns Still Life With Three Skulls the greenish skulls on the table look freshas indeed they were inthat harrowing yearlike notquiteripe fruit Warhols Skull now reads unavoidably as a premonition of AIDS            Passingthrough the final rooms of the show one feels the pressure of an argumentbeginning to emerge Painting gives way increasingly to D sculpted stilllifes such as Jasper Johns brace of cast bronze Ballantine Ale cans Painted Bronze  and found objects Those dueling Greekpainters return in a new guise as Mario Merz in the Zeuxis role covers aglass table with an array of fresh vegetables and fruit changed daily by a NewYork caterer  Spiral Table   while Christo playing Parrhasiosconceals the familiar Czannesque shapeswine bottle vase etcunder adrapery of canvas  Package on a Table              Were meant to feel that were coming to the end of theline an impression confirmed in Domenico Gnolis painting of an empty tablecovered with a lace tablecloth Without a Still Life  placedtoward the end of the show and chosen for the cover of the catalog Thestilllife objects have escaped leaving the bare table the bare canvas            MoMAs story of modern artbeginning with Czanne and ending with abstraction has been confirmed but ata cost The final rooms feel like classrooms with lessons hammered home Theshow ends as it began in a small white room holding one object This time thealtarpiece is a plain white block of marble centered on the floor WolfgangLaibs Milkstone  A wall panel explains that a film of milkcovers the top of the marble so that a living substance milk has beenstilled thus embodying the quintessential definition of the still lifeSuch heavyhanded conceptual humor is a far cry from Duchamps mercurial witor from the visceral delight of Meret Oppenheims Object  thefamous furlined teacup Now thats a living object stilled
