                                 Take This Simple Test            Heres a threequestion quizto determine how rational you are This will work best if you stop and answereach question before going on to the next            Imaginethat each of your three fabulously wealthy cousins offers you a choice of twoChristmas gifts In each case choose the one youd prefer                           Cousin Snip offers you a choice of                        A million in cash            B A lottery ticket Theticket gives you a percent chance of winning  million an percentchance of winning  million and a percent chance of winning nothing atall                           Cousin Snap offers you a choice of                        A Alottery ticket that gives you an percent chance of winning  million            B A lottery ticket thatgives you a percent chance of winning  million                           Cousin Snurr offers you a choice of                        A million in cash            B Alottery ticket that gives you a  chance of winning  million            Now that youve made your choices you can read on todiscover whether youre a rational creature Rational does not meanriskneutral A riskneutral person is one who is indifferent when given achoice between  cents and a  chance of  A riskneutral person wouldchoose B in all three cases In Snips offer  percent of  million plus  percent of  million  equals  million whichtrumps  million In Snaps offer  percent of  million  trumps percent of  million  In Snurrs offer  of  million is million which trumps  million            But itsequally rational to avoid risk or to seek it out The insurance and gamblingindustries are based on these proclivities Even so rationality does implysome logical consistency in your choices about risk It would be embarrassingif a lot of                   Slate                readers failed this test so Im going to makeit easy by adopting a very broad definition of rationality As long as yousatisfy two simple criteria Im willing to call you rational            Heres my first criterion If you prefer A toB then you should prefer a chance of winning A to an equally largechance of winning B And heres the test to see whether youve met thatcriterion Your answers to Questions  and  should be the same Thats becauseSnaps choice A is an percent shot at a million bucks and Snurrs choice Ais a million bucks Therefore Snaps A is an percent shot at Snurrs AMeanwhile Snaps choice B amounts to an percent shot at Snurrs choice BDo the math A percent chance of winning  million is the same as anpercent chance of winning a  chance of winning  million  x   So if you prefer Snurrs A to Snurrs B you should prefer Snaps A toSnaps B            Heres mysecond criterion of rationality If youre choosing between two lotteries withidentical chances to win then your preference should be unaffected if I throwin a consolation prize that you get if you lose in either case You pass thattest if your answers to Questions  and  are the same This is why            Snips choice A is million Another way to say  millionweird but bear with meis anpercent chance to win  million with a consolation prize of  million forlosing Snurrs choice A is also  million So Snips A is an percent shotat Snurrs A with a million consolation prize            Snipschoice B is a percent chance of winning  million plus a percent chanceof winning nothing plus an percent chance of winning  million The firsttwo items taken together amount to an percent chance of a  chance ofwinning  million The third item means you get  million if that percentchance doesnt come through Snurrs choice B is a  chance to win million Snips choice B is therefore an percent shot at Snurrs choice Bwith a million consolation prize            So if youprefer Snips A to Snips B you should prefer Snurrs A to SnurrsB if youre rational            To sum up if you are even minimally rational your answersto Questions   and  should all be the same But they probably arentAccording to survey data collected by Nobel laureate Maurice Allaisandduplicated by several subsequent researchersmost people answer A to Question and B to Question  There is no way to reconcile that combination of answerswith the most rudimentary theory of rationality no matter how you answerQuestion  In other words people prefer the cash over the lottery tickettoan extent that rational risk aversion cant explain            Economistshave variously viewed the Allais Paradox as a warning a trifle anopportunity and a challenge If youre looking to explain all human behavioron the basis of a few simple axioms its a warning If you dont believe thatcasual answers to abstract survey questions constitute an important part ofhuman behavior its a trifle If the survey responses mean that people areless rational than they ought to be its an opportunity for economists toteach better decisionmaking skills If you conclude that theres a criticalelement missing from our theory of rationality its a challenge to identifythat element            One missing element is regret  When youchoose a lottery instead of a sure thing as in Question  you risk not justlosing the lottery but also feeling regretful about your recklessness But whenyou choose between two lotteries as in Question  you can always reconcileyourself to a loss by thinking Well Id probably have lost no matterwhat I chose Maybe thats why most people go for the sure thing inQuestion  but are willing to go for the slightly riskier of the two bets inQuestion  Click for an experiment that could test this hypothesis            Heres anotherthoughtexperiment that indicates the importance of avoiding regret Supposeyou belong to a company of  soldiers of whom one must be chosen for thedistasteful task of executing a prisoner Which of the following do you preferA One soldier is selected at random to shoot the prisoner Or B all soldiers fire at once without knowing which one of the  has been issued liveammunition Either way youd have a percent chance of being theexecutioner so simple theories of rationality suggest that you should beindifferent when asked to choose between the two options Yet most peopleprefer B because in case B you never know whether youve beenunlucky            Theanalogy between the soldiers and the Allais survey respondents is imperfectthe soldiers who choose method B are trying to avoid regret over bad luckwhile the survey respondents are perhaps trying to avoid regret over baddecisions But in either case ignoring the human impulse towardregretavoidance might give a social scientist cause for regret                           Note toreaders A week after this article was posted Landsburg clarified the simpletest Read his addendum in EMail to the Editors
