                okay   okay well Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is uh in the situation of choosing college shes actually at Bible College for this current year   umhum   umhum   and uh i guess uh first and foremost it really its a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then uh uh which colleges or universities can best offer that program and then it comes down to the dollar you have to uh its whether or not youre a resident for that jurisdiction or you know it does it comes down to uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs   umhum umhum umhum   uh what do you feel about come of the things that need to     damn it i agree with pretty much with everything youve said um the one the one thing that i you know id advise any parent um you know or any or any person looking for a college um is that   i think i think you know its really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there because you know theyre just um in my experience ive talked to people at other colleges um that you know the the the way the you know the the the lifestyle pictured in the catalogs catalogs isnt always  the whole story   no you the the college the the catalogs are sales material it doesnt matter whether  you know theyre theyre selling school and uh and true it uh really is helpful if a   umhum umhum umhum   parent and the student can get there and see   umhum   the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school uh i guess theres a difference in here the the at least the university here in Saskatoon is primarily uh off campus resident students like they just live in the community   umhum   uh you know i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well and that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit   umhum umhum yeah i i go to Georgia Tech which is you know primarily an engineering school and uh you know i think i really do miss the fact you know that its not a university that theres theres not   umhum   the the you know it tends to be a very conservative school and there and there doesnt tend to be the diversity of views that a lot of you know universities will will have   yeah uh i guess were here this is the university that has for years had the the car that uh will travel the farthest on uh on a small quantity of gas our engineering students   umhum   uh in competitions and thats the kind of thing that also you see uh if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school uh whether you you know in one sense whether youve got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether youve got a   umhum   uh you know its sort of somewhat unkind but producing graduates um you know as sort of   umhum yeah   some development and some training uh like its easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them   umhum   and uh and that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to how you know what the attitude towards achievement is   umhum   uh do you uh have anyone that youre seriously needing to uh feed information to i suppose if youre actually at at Georgia Tech as a student youre a ways away from that   yeah uh i dont really know of anyone thats like looking thats looking for colleges now you know because with the exception of uh peoples younger brothers and sisters  then the only advise passed down is dont go to Georgia Tech  uh       but uh no actually actually im im im more interested in in in choosing the right job job when you graduate  type information   right well thats thats one of the really a valid point that people need to consider as well   umhum umhum   uh you know to going to college university is going to take four to eight years depending on the programs programs programs persons involved in and after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself   program umhum umhum   and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market  jeez the best   umhum like a fine arts education i   right best training in the world is not going to feed put food on your table   umhum   and uh
