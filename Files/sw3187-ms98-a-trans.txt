        how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home   so it well i dont feel very good about it but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore he actually died a few months after that and so   uhhuh   as at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do because he it was either you know a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days   right and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him   um well the see uh well we he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list   oh my   right we wound up just choosing a another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into or we no actually no it was even Mennonite related im sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in   yeah so the convenience right   uh what do you think   my grandmother lived with us um until August um and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home she has leukemia   umhum   and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton and were several thousand miles away     yeah   so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility she had her own little room and didnt have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and TV set so   yeah yeah thats important id say   yes and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room   okay   so she didnt have to be transported back and forth so shes been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well its not her favorite place to be in shed much rather be here with me but   yeah   when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her and ive got little children here who needed me here   right so that   um she needed somebody to watch her twenty four hours a day   right and that becomes difficult then   so she was falling down and hemorrhaging and you know all kinds of physical problems so it just became too much for me to handle even though i would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldnt anymore   umhum yep we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several  points during the last few years of his life but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was   yeah   getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he   uhhuh   lived in his own house as long as he could though he was living alone   yeah   had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the uh top without a great deal of pain   oh   and this eventually things just went too far and he   yeah   he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home   yes well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions it sure wouldnt have been Grannys decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but shes accepted it real well now   right well thats   so   yeah thats right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide whats the right thing   well we enjoyed having her here but we feel shes much safer where she is now she still continues to fall but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her   and umhum   and i know shes eating the right things and her doctors right there where he can come in and check on her so it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair   yep   so i think shell adjust
