                    Background        Prostate cancer is one of the major diseases that pose        serious health problems for aging men     It is        generally believed that androgen has a significant role in        the development and progress of this disease            Changes in the growth response of cancer cells to androgen        ablation and antiandrogen during the progress of the        disease       suggest that multiple androgenrelated        signaling events are involved in neoplasia and disease        progression It has also been documented that prostate        epithelial cells exhibited squamous metaplastic phenotype        during vitamin A deficiency     and prostate cell        carcinogenesis could be prevented by retinoic acid RA and        its analogs in vitro       These findings suggest        that retinoiddependent cellular events were involved in        tumorigenic transformation of prostate epithelial        cells        Retinoic acid receptors RARs and retinoid X receptors        RXRs are nuclear transcription factors that mediate the        action of retinoids      We have demonstrated that        in the rat castration resulted in an increase in mRNAs for        RAR  and  in the prostate such effects were prevented by        T replacement     We also demonstrated that the levels        of mRNAs for RAR  and  in nontumorigenic rat epithelial        cells NRP were downregulated whereas those in        tumorigenic cells NRP were unaffected or upregulated        following T treatment     In addition RAR  was        overexpressed in tumorigenic NRP cells These findings        suggest that tumorigenic transformation and perhaps        neoplasia of prostate epithelial cells are associated with        abnormal expression and androgen regulation of RARs        Androgen exerts its biologic effects by binding to and        activation of androgen receptor AR that transactivates        target genes through androgen responsive element ARE in        the promoter of target genes     In human breast        cancer cells the effectiveness of retinoids in cell growth        suppression was dictated by the presence of RAR            Estrogen regulation of the expression of RAR  was mediated        by interactions between estrogen receptor ER and estrogen        responsive element ERE in the promoter of RAR  gene            Because the DNA binding domains of steroid receptors        including AR and ER are highly homologous we postulated        that similar mechanisms might also mediate the effect of        androgen on RAR genes in prostate cells        The current experiments investigate the effects of T and        its interaction with RA on cell growth and the expression        of RARs in human prostate cancer cells LNCaP Furthermore        we present evidence to suggest that T may affect the        expression of RAR  gene through direct interaction between        AR and putative ARE in the promoter of RAR  gene Because        EGF and its receptor EGFR are involved in prostate cell        growth and their expression can be modulated by androgen        and RA       we also examined the interaction of T        and RA on the expression of EGFR                    Materials and methods                  Cell culture          Human prostate carcinoma cells LNCaP ATCC          Rockville MD

LNCaP cells propagated in T          flasks were washed with  ml of plain RPMI  medium          and trypsinized with  ml trypsinEDTA solution          GIBCOBRL Gaithersburg MD The cells were then seeded          onto the well plates    cellswell in  ml          complete media Two days later the cells were well          attached and covered  of the surface area At this          time the FCS in

later          the medium was removed and the cells were incubated in           ml plain medium containing Hthymidine  Ciml for          an additional  h After washing twice with  ml of plain

LNCaP cells were propagated in  ml complete medium in          T flasks with medium change every th day until the          monolayers reached  confluence usually  days          after seeding The FCS in the medium was then replaced          by cFCS h later various concentrations of testerone          were added in the absence or presence of  nM RA The          cells were harvested  h later This

several changes in          strength SSC and  SDS at C for  h The          radioautographs were developed after they were exposes to          Kodak Eastman Kodak Rochster NY XAR film for

dosedependent biphasic stimulation          of Hthymidine incorporation p   Figure A          While effects of  nM T was abolished by  and  nM          RA p   the effect of higher doses of T were          suppressed by all doses of RA used p   The          extent of suppression depended on the doses of both T and          RA Specifically Hthymidine uptake in cells treated          with  nM T was suppressed by the presence of  nM          RA to an extent that was significantly lower than          untreated controls p   Similarly treatment of          LNCaP cells with  nM RA alone resulted in           stimulation of Hthymidine uptake p   Figure          B these effects were suppressed by concomitant          presence of  nM T p   Such effects          became less pronounced when higher doses of RA were used          Combination of  and  nM RA with  nM T resulted          in lower Hthymidine uptake than those cells treated          with RA alone p                            RAR  and  mRNA          Treatment of LNCaP cells with T alone for  h resulted          in dosedependent biphasic increases in levels of RAR           and  mRNA transcripts with the maximal effect of           nM P   Figure  When the cells were treated          with T in the presence of  nM RA the RAR  and           mRNAs in LNCaP cells were suppressed in a dose dependent          manner P   Figure  The  kb RAR  mRNA was          not affected by these treatments                          Electrophoretic mobility shift assay EMSA          Incubation of AR protein with the Plabeled oligo          probe of RAR  promoter resulted in a proteinDNA complex          after EMSA Figure A radioactivity of the complex was          displaced by unlabeled oligo probe but not by oligo          probe of unrelated sequences This complex was not          present when the probe was incubated with BSA Incubation          of nuclear extracts of LNCaP cells with the Poligo          probe also resulted in a complex that migrated to the          same distance as that achieved by AR Poligo probe          complex Figure B The specificity of such complex was          demonstrated by displacement of radioactivity with          unlabeled specific oligo probe Incubation of AR protein          with antiAR polyclonal antibody CW prior to the          addition of Plabeled oligo probe resulted in          supershifting of the proteinDNA complex Figure          C                          Interaction of RA and T on EGFR          Figure shows that treatment of LNCaP cells with RA           nM alone for  h resulted in   decrease in          the binding of IEGF and membrane proteins P            On the other hand binding of IEGF was          stimulated by  in cells treated with  nM T P            but this effect was attenuated by the presence of          RA Western blot analysis revealed a similar pattern of          change in the  kd EGFR protein                            Discussion        Androgen is essential for normal prostate function but        has also been implicated in the pathogenesis and neoplasia        of prostate cancer       On the other hand retinoid        is essential for normal prostate function      and        exhibits antiproliferative and chemopreventive efficacy in        experimental prostate carcinoma       The        dosedependent stimulation of Hthymidine incorporation in        LNCaP cells by T and RA when administered alone and        reciprocal suppression of such effects by each other are        consistent with previous findings        These        results illustrate interactions between androgen and        retinoid in the control of LNCaP cell growth A correlation        between dose effect of T on Hthymidine incorporation and        that on RAR  and  mRNA levels further suggests that RAR        signaling events might be involved in such interaction        Stimulation of LNCaP cell growth by RAR analog    and        overexpression of RAR  in tumorigenic rat prostate        epithelial cells    support the above notion        Modulation of the expression of EGF and its receptor        EGFR in prostate cells by androgen       and        overexpression of EGFR during the advanced stages of        prostate cancer     imply that EGFEGFR signaling        events might be involved in neoplasia and perhaps        progression of prostate cancer An increase in EGFR in        LNCaP cells after treatment with growthstimulating dose of        T is consistent with this postulate Suppression of EGFR        in LNCaP cells after treatment with a dose of RA that also        attenuated the stimulating effect of T on EGFR further        suggest that EGFR signaling might have a role in the        interaction between T and RA on LNCaP cell growth In this        regard RA was reported to blunt the growth response of        LNCaP cells to EGF     These investigators also        reported increases and decreases in LNCaP cells in Sphase        after exposure to growth stimulating and antiproliferative        doses of RA respectively Treatment of LNCaP cells with an        RXR agonist also caused an increase in G cells and a        decrease in S phase cells     suggesting that cell        cycle kinetics are involved in the effects of RARAR        signaling        Binding between AR and nucleotide sequences of the        promoter of the RAR  gene and that such proteinDNA        complex was supershifted in the presence of antiAR serum        suggest the presence of ARE in RAR  gene This notion is        supported by the presence within the oligo probe of        nucleotides sequences AGATCC          n to  and ACTGGT          n to  which are identical or        complementary to half of the palindromic ARE motif of        prostatien C subunit gene AGTACG     and that of        PSA promoter  AGTGCT      respectively Binding        between LNCaP cell nuclear extract and oligo probe of RAR         promoter thus suggests that ARARE interaction might        mediate the effects of T on the expression of RAR  in        LNCaP cells A similar mechanism may also pertain for the        effects of T on RAR  since the DNA binding domains are        highly homologous among RARs In addition sequences in        other segments of the RAR  promoter including  GGGACA                 n  to  and  TCTGCT          n  to  were similar or        complementary to that of half site of the upstream ARE        GGAACAtatTGTATC and promoter ARE AGAACAgcaAGTGCT of PSA        gene     respectively Oligo probes containing these        sequences also interacted with AR protein data not shown        These results further suggest possible presence of multiple        AREs in the RAR  gene Functional importance of multiple        AREs in androgen effects has been demonstrated in PSA gene                   Stimulation of RAR  and  mRNA in LNCaP cells by T        differed from that in normal rat prostate and        nontumorigenic rat prostate epithelial cells NRP        but was comparable to that in tumorigenic rat prostate        epithelial cells NRP      In cervical        carcinoma cells the RAR  gene was abnormally        downregulated by RA     In ER positive human breast        cancer cells RAR  mRNA was also upregulated by estrogen            Thus T stimulation of RAR mRNAs in LNCaP cells        could be related to the pathologic state of the cells        LNCaP cells contain high levels of functional AR with        mutated ligand binding domain and exhibit aberrant cellular        responses to androgen       The mutated AR when        interact with the ARE of the RAR gene may transactivate        the gene in an abnormal fashion resulting in increases in        its mRNA        In summary current results demonstrate interactions        between T and RA in the expression of RAR  and  and        EGFR as well as cell growth in LNCaP cells These results        suggest that RAR and EGFR signaling events might be        involved in the effects of RA and T on LNCaP cell growth        Moreover EMSA demonstrated the presence of putative ARE on        RAR  promoter suggesting that AR proteinDNA        interaction might be involved in the effects of T on RAR        genes While the importance of these in vitro findings for        prostate cell pathophysiology in vivo must be interpreted        with caution current results nevertheless provide a        molecular basis for the interaction between androgen and        retinoid in LNCaP cells Further understanding the        downstream signaling events in such interaction will        provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying normal        and pathologic growth of prostate cells and will        facilitate the use of retinoid analogs in the prevention or        treatment of such diseases as prostate cancer                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        Author  has been
