Where to GoPuerto Rico is an island of contrasts perhaps the only destination in the Caribbean where the city streets hold as much allure as the beaches One third of the islands population of just over three million live in San Juan which is undoubtedly the draw for many One of the leading commercial and industrial centers of the Caribbean it is characterized by highrise office blocks and sprawling suburbs Its the delights and historical treasures of the old town however that capture the eyes and imaginations of most visitors And beyond the limits of the capital are mountains rivers and lakes forests and plantations waiting to be exploredOld San JuanOld San Juan is without doubt one of the most spectacular sights of the Caribbean Founded in  it is partially surrounded by walls and fortifications that have protected it from modernization and indiscriminate development The carefully preserved historic houses and public buildings retain many of the most charming features of the original Spanish colonial architecture Cobblestone streets the stones were brought as ballast on the Spanish ships which went home filled with treasure and gold tiny squares and grand plazas surprise visitors at every turn as they wander the neat grid of streets planned four centuries agoOnly eight blocks wide San Juan can easily be covered on foot though there are some steep ascents that may be challenging in the Caribbean heat Even if you only have one day youll be able to enjoy its delights If possible however take at least a couple of days Enjoying a rest in a shady plaza or taking a long lunch at an outdoor caf are just as much a part of your trip as a tour around the museums San Juan is a living city and its especially bustling after dark when crowds throng to the bars and restaurants or simply stroll the narrow streets and airy plazasBegin your exploration at Plaza de Coln Columbus Square If you take a taxi from the outlying resort areas this is a good place to alightbefore traffic in the narrow streets forces your vehicle to a halt The square was named after Columbus on the th anniversary of Puerto Ricos discovery in  After admiring the unusually tall statue of the discoverer leave the square from the northeastern corner and walk along Boulevard del Valle this is a pretty street with a series of brightly painted buildings but the traffic can be busyAt the top of the hill on the right youll find the towering walls of Fuerte San Cristbal the largest fort in Puerto Rico Its also the youngest fort on the island built in the th century to plug a hole in the easterly defenses of the city From atop the brick walls which withstood fierce attacks by cannonballs and other projectiles you can enjoy panoramic views out to the east and over San Juan Bay to the modern city The forts vast interior courtyard now echoes with the sound of running children rather the marching of soldiers boots but one dormitory of the old barracks has been recreated with bunks lining the walls and uniforms hung neatly on pegs Take the long dark walk to the dungeons to find a faded drawing of a Spanish galleon sketched on the wall by a captain accused of treasonAfter visiting the fort continue west along Boulevard del Valle which becomes Calle Norzagaray Here youll be tempted by fine views of the sea you may even catch sight of a cruise ship sailing gracefully into port This route sits against the old city walls which were completed in  and from here it is easy to see why the city was thought to be impregnable Thanks to the high thick walls and the watchtowers with their distinctive rounded roofs the residents could be sure that no one would approach unseenAfter a walk of about half a mile youll find the plain faade of the Museo de Arte e Historia San Juan Museum of Art and History on your left Once a major market place for the city built in  the building now houses a major collection of Puerto Rican artJust past the museum a large open grassy area comes into view If you happen to be here on a weekend youll find thousands of Puerto Rican families out flying kites This area is the best place to take advantage of the sea breezes and many kites soar hundreds of feet up in the air When collisions occur or lines get crossed jovial banter breaks out between the partiesits a very social activity The grassy area cut by one gravel path leads to the end of the promontoryand the mighty Fuerte San Felipe del Morro usually simply referred to as El Morro meaning the headland On your right as you walk toward the entrance youll pass the old city cemetery resting between the walls and the sea The ornate tombs are still carefully attended and hold the remains of some of Puerto Ricos most illustrious families The entrance to El Morro is reached across a wide dry moat a last defense against attack Walk through the huge curved doorway to the heart of the fortEl Morro was one of the most formidable citadels in the world During the th and th centuries it was one of a ring of forts that held the key to Spanish power in the Caribbean The watchtowers of El Morro look out to sea and inland across San Juan Bay to the coastal plains beyond The multilevel defenses made it possible to fire weapons from sea level up to hundreds of feet above ground Despite some serious attempts by English and Dutch forces the fort was never forcibly takenSince  the lighthouse here has provided protection for ships off the coast the present light dates from  The old barracks and ammunition arsenal now house a museum which offers an audiovisual presentation about the history of the fort in English and Spanish on alternate half hoursAfter exploring the fort walk back across the grassy lawns At the small traffic circle at the end of the driveway youll find refreshment stalls where you can get a cool drink or snack before moving on Young Puertorriqueos have taken to skateboarding and rollerblading on nearby Plaza del Quartel Ballaj They gather every day at this square to compete with their peers and show off their skills to passersbyTo the left is Cuartel de Ballaj Ballaj Barracks once the major army barracks under Spanish rule and now a significant cultural attraction The second floor of the building houses the Museum of the Americas The museums mission is to gather collections of artifacts of Amerindian culture including folk art basketware from Colombia and ceremonial masks and costumes from around Central America The barracks themselves are also interestinglarge open rooms that used to house soldiers and their families face in toward a large court where drills were carried out The square now remains eerily quiet unless a school group is touring the museumOpposite the entrance to the Barracks is the long white building that houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture A new museum is planned for this space but in the meantime temporary art exhibitions display the best of Puerto Rican painting and sculptureFollow Calle Beneficencia the street leading off the right side of the barracks back towards town Youll soon come to a small square on your left with a huge totemic sculpture This is Plaza del Quinto Centenario Quincentenary Square The sculpture symbolizes the  years of Puerto Ricos existence On close inspection Amerindian and Spanish themes can be seen but some elements are a little obscureWalk on to reach another small square Plaza San Jos San Jos Square one of the gems of the city Situated close to El Morro it was once one of the most important squares in San Juan In the center is a statue of Juan Ponce de Len in full regalia that was cast in  from the iron of a British cannon confiscated after their unsuccessful attack on the city Edged by historic buildings the square has changed little since the th century except that many of the houses have been converted to restaurants and bars This is a good place to come after dark and watch the world go byOn the north flank of the square is the Spanish Gothic Iglesia San Jos San Jos Church the secondoldest church in the New World The plain white faade reflects the sunlight helping cool the interior The body of Ponce de Len was interred here for over  years before being moved to the San Juan Cathedral in  Attached to the church is a large building that was originally a Dominican Convent It was an army barracks until  when it was taken under the auspices of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture You can enter the main square and see the three cloistered floors that flank it Art exhibitions are held here regularlyOn the east side of Plaza San Jos are two important buildings In the corner is the Pablo Casals Museum dedicated to the life of the cello virtuoso and composer who lived the last years of his life in Puerto Rico Casals was responsible for injecting life back into the classical genre here he sponsored a classical music festival which still takes place every June Next to the Casals Museum is the Casa de los Contrafuertes House of the Buttresses named after the sturdy stone supports that reach out at angles from the walls It is thought to be the oldest privately owned residence in Old San Juan dating from the early th century There are two museums on the upper floors the Pharmacy Museuma complete apothecarys shop with bottles and scalesand above it the Museum of Latin American PrintLeave Plaza San Jos via Calle Cristo Halfway down this street on your left youll find the Catedral de San Juan San Juan Cathedral The church dates from  though a comprehensive restoration was carried out in the early th century The interior features pretty trompe loeil details that add depth to the plain columns and domes On the northern wall is the tomb of Ponce de Len he shares this place of honor with San Po a Catholic martyr whose remains were brought from Rome in Facing the cathedral is Plazuela de las Monjas a tiny square filled with trees where courting couples and old folks take advantage of the shade You may also catch the sound of jingling bells signaling that the local icecream seller is around On the north side of the square is the El Convento Hotel a great place to take a break The hotel has an interesting history because as the name suggests it started life as a convent in  Unfortunately as the number of nuns declined the convent was forced to close and the building decaying year by year played host to the best and busiest brothel in the city It was also one of the cheapest hotels in town before being rescued and transformed in the early sOn the western flank of the square youll find the Museo del Nio Childrens Museum No sterile display cases full of artifacts here This is an entertaining handson activity center where kids can be kids and yet still have a learning experience There are four floors of interactive exhibits including a real dentists chair where mom or dad can be examined by their offspring and a giant bubble machine on the upper floorBehind the museum are a number of other important attractions Take Calle las Monjas toward San Juan Bay After a short distance youll arrive at the western wall and a small square Plazuela de la Rogativa with a bronze statue commemorating the torchlight religious procession or rogativa that saved the city in  Its believed that the lights held by the bishop and the women of the city fooled the British forces in the bay into assuming that Spanish reinforcements had arrived The British fled emptyhandedJust a short walk north of the square is the Casa Blanca White House which for  years was the home of the descendants of Ponce de Len Something of a minifortress safe behind its own high wall the house itself is fascinatingthe interior is a museum to life in th and thcentury San Juan with many rooms full of period furnitureWalk back toward the Plazuela de la Rogativa and peer over the city wall which rises over  ft  m at this point The plain faade is broken by the San Juan Gate which was once the only entrance to the city from the old port The gate was constructed in  and the walls were completed in  Every person who traveled across the Atlantic from Spain would enter through this narrow passagemany would make their way directly to the Cathedral to give thanks for a safe arrivaland all goods were transported through here The thick wooden doors are an impressive sight they were locked and guarded each night but now remain open to allow people to stroll along the seafrontMake your way back to the cathedral along Calle San Juan and turn right once again at Calle Cristo Youll pass some interesting shops that might tempt you to browse for a while the designer outlet stores are particularly popular Turn right at Calle Fortaleza to reach one of the jewels of San Juan La Fortaleza Now the home of the Governor of Puerto Rico this fort is in fact a historic monument dating back to  It was the first fortification built by the founders of San Juan and has been in constant use since that time Of course it has grown over the centuriesyoull find extensions and renovations in the Baroque Gothic and NeoClassic styles Now a National Historic Site this fascinating home is full of period furniture You can tour the house and its extensive gardens but you must book in advanceAt the southern end of Calle Cristo at the edge of the city wall is tiny Capilla del Cristo This chapel was said to have been built in the memory of a young man who in  raced his horse down Calle Cristo was unable to stop the animal in time and fell over the wall to his death Others say that in fact the chapel was built to commemorate the fact that the boy was saved by divine intervention at this very spot Whichever is true the chapel now stands as a barrier to any other such mishapTo the left of the chapel is thcentury Casa del Libro House of Books a small museum devoted to rare books and the printing and binding arts Next door is the Centro Nacional de Artes y Artesanas Popular Arts and Crafts Center a showcase of modern art and crafts managed by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture Temporary exhibitions are mounted here and some items are occasionally made available for purchaseTo the right of the chapel is the entrance to Parque de las Palomas Pigeon Park clinging to the side of the city wall and a favorite with children The park can be a little oppressiveits always a flurry of people and pigeonsbut at least pause long enough to admire the panoramic views across San Juan harborBack at Calle Fortaleza take a right and continue to the intersection of Calle San Jos Here youll pass fascinating small shops selling art and crafts from around the world Wooden carvings from Asia sit side by side with Haitian native paintingsTake a left and a block farther down youll enter Plaza de Armas This was the first central square of Old San Juan and the City Hall or Alcalda still sits on its northern side The army used to drill here hence the name armas means weapons or arms but today it is simply a place for people to meet and have a coffee or sit and chat Workers enjoy picnic lunches here at midday old people while away the afternoon The

interior remodeled in  The theater hosts regular performances of ballet dance and drama often showcasing works by modern Puerto Rican writers and choreographersYou cant miss the harbor Just look for the huge cruise ships which dwarf the surrounding buildings The cruise port comprises several large jetties from whence hundreds of passengers disembark on a regular basis Walk west along the seafront in the direction of the town Next to the ultramodern cruiseship wharfs youll will find the rather downattheheel commercial ferry jetty which caters to the small boats that ply across the harbor to the modern city Taking one of these little boats is one of the best ways to take in the size of the harbor and the old town Youll also get to see Puerto Ricans at work and and playsnacking on empanadillas pastry turnovers filled with meat or cheese and enjoying salsa musicNear the ferry dock across Calle Marina youll see the rising edifice of the San Juan Post Office a magnificent building with ArtDeco

full of souvenir stalls and faux designer watches galore To the left is the Arsenal de la Marina a fine building with strange Moorish details Built in  it houses the Fine Arts and Folk Arts departments of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture In front of you is the Paseo de la Princessa a smart promenade that has emerged from years of neglect to become the place in town to stroll in the evening or to sit and watch the world go by A number of new statues and fountains now grace the Paseo One named Raices Roots depicts members of each of the races that have contributed to the modern Puerto Rican mix surrounded by playful dolphins La Princessa home of the offices of the Puerto Rico Tourist Company sits along the Paseo Originally a prisonthis is why it is outside the city wallsit is now a showcase of modern Puerto Rican artMetropolitan San JuanToward the end of the th century the city fathers realized that San Juan was becoming overcrowded so they decided to break through a section of the vast wall and expand the citys borders Gangs of laborers were hired to carry out the job you can see photographs of them in Fuerte San Cristbal This action altered the perception that San Juan was a citadel cityalready an anachronism at the timeand plans were drawn up to develop the area immediately east of the city an area that became known as Puerta de Tierra or gateway to the land Today San Juan stretches all the way around the bay A number of the modern suburbs though primarily residential have some interesting attractions for visitorsJust outside the old town facing out toward the sea is the impressive El Capitolio home of the Puerto Rico Legislature Constructed in  it has already been recognized as a historic monument Continuing beyond this sight youll pass some rather careworn buildings before reaching Parque Muoz Rivera one of the places where local families like to relax on the weekends There are areas of formal gardens a small fort and childrens play area A seafront promenade to the north sees hundreds of families strolling on warm weekend evenings the beach though very narrow is the nearest one to the old city and its always crowded in the afternoon and on weekendsA series of bridges lead across a small strait to modern San Juan or to the right to Condado and the resort areaMiramar a pleasant residential quarter with fine family homes benefits from its position alongside the Isla Grande commuter airport Santurce a business and residential area has few attractions except for a concentration of movie palaces and the Centro de Bellas Artes the largest performing arts center in the Caribbean Housing three theaters and five rehearsal halls this complex has spearheaded a resurgence in the popularity of traditional Puerto Rican music and dance It also has a regular program of performers from around the worldHato Reys unexpected futuristic skyline marks it as the financial center of the Caribbean Those skyscrapers are banks and the street on which they stand has been nicknamed the Milla de Oro or Golden Mile Ro Piedras is the home of the University of Puerto Rico Its considerable campus serves  students and the university museum in a modern onestory structure nearby exhibits contemporary Puerto Rican paintings and sculptures along with archaeological evidence of the talents of the islands original Indian inhabitantsMore Indian relics plus old Spanish coins and tiles can be viewed in the Ponce de Len Museum at Caparra miles  km west of San Juan on Route  Alongside this small white museum are the ruins of the house Ponce de Len built and from which he directed the colonization of the island In  after a number of outbreaks of disease the capital was moved to San Juan and Caparra was abandoned Whats left of Ponce de Lens house looks like ancient Roman ruins earnestly preservedCatao is an industrial area visible directly across the bay from the old city Most of its buildings though important to the economy of the island spoil the view but one is of rather more interest to visitors The Bacardi rum plant offers an interesting and wellorganized free guided tour Small motorized trains carry visitors to the distilling and bottling plants Free samples are dispensed and in the gift shop you can buy bottles to take back home For those more interested in history than in the production of rum there is a fascinating museum that relates the story of the Bacardi family who still own the business from their arrival in Cuba from Spain to their flight to Puerto Rico after the Cuban revolution in  to their influence on the global drinks marketSan Juans ResortsPuerto Ricos popularity as a holiday island has risen enormously since the early s Most of the development and tourist infrastructure lies in a narrow strip along the coast east of San Juan Condado was the first it had already been on the map with the jet set and saw further expansion when a string of highrise hotels were built along the long stretches of sandy beach Its main street Ashford Avenue has something of the ArtDeco feel of Miamis South Beach As you stroll past the shops selling expensive topdrawer merchandise youre likely to pass a number of impeccably dressed older women carrying impeccably coiffed toy poodles As time has passed the young energy has moved east taking advantage of available land and now Isla Verde farther along the coast has been developedsome say overdeveloped This is where all the real action is A number of large hotels with theaters casinos and restaurants attract highrollers Fastfood restaurants bars and gift shops fill the streets The two main beaches of Isla Verde are impressive and they get very busy but the resort is very close to the airport and can get a little noisyThe NortheastHeading east out of Isla Verde it takes only a couple of minutes to leave the city behind The coast road Route  leads past the end of the runway at Muoz Marn Airport on the left and Isla Verdes balneario public beach on the right Travel over the little bridge that spans the entrance to Laguna la Torrecilla and suddenly you are in the countrysideThe road runs along the coastline and through the Bosque Estatal de Piones an area of beautiful sandy beaches and coconut palms that until recently was a pristine environment where sleepy cattle sat under the trees It is now a popular weekend picnic spot for city families many of whom leave their litter behind when they depart This sort of carelessness spoils Piones and many other beauty spots on the eastern coastline within easy reach of San Juan an assemblage of broken bottles leftover food litter and worse is something you cant fail to noticeHead through Loza and on towards Ro Grande Here Route  meets Route  one of the major arterial roads around Puerto Rico its a very busy highway so be aware and drive carefully Take a left and proceed to Route  then turn right and head up toward El Yunque the Anvil the most famous mountain in Puerto Rico Normally capped with clouds it catches from the passing sea breezes and sometimes entirely lost in a blanket of gray stormclouds the ft m peak stands at the center of the Caribbean National Forest an area of virgin rain forest preserved since  when the island was still a Spanish colony Originally a park of  acres  hectares it now covers  acres  hectares and is managed by the US Forestry DepartmentThe whole area is a place of staggering proportions there are over  species of native trees One specimen is said to be over  years old some trees are so wide it takes several people to reach around them others soar hundreds of feet into the air The forest gets over  inches  m of rain each yearthats some  billion gallons  billion liters of water The animals that live here are also amazing This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot The infamous coqu see page is of course heard everywhere All in all the park in an impressive sight with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distanceArriving via Route  youll come right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park This facility presents important information about the history of the park its plant and animal species and its role in the local ecology You can then travel on higher into the park toward the summit You cant drive the whole  miles  km between the visitors center and the end of the road but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way so theres ample access Two popular stops are La Coca Falls on the right after the mile km point and the Yokah Observation Tower at the mile km point Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes The most spectacular cascade in the park La Mina Falls is just a minute walk from the roadside via Big Tree TrailTake a walk on any of the wellmarked trails the atmosphere is humid and the vegetation constantly damp your best friends will be your insect repellent and your stout shoes but the landscape is beautiful and fascinatingEl Yunque is included in many tours from San Juan these usually include a trip to Luquillo Beach which lies in the shadow of the peak to the north There is a popular balneario at Luquillo which has restrooms snack bars and a childrens play area The beach is kept tidy and there is ample parkingAfter Luquillo Route  curves around toward the east coast of the island and to the town of Fajardo which is a steppingstone to the offshore islands of Vieques and Culebra There is little to hold you in the town except for a finger of land reaching north out into the ocean Take Route  to explore this area On the way youll pass a large marina with fleets of charter boats and the El Conquistador Resort and Country Club with its golf course marina and private offshore island At the very tip of the peninsula is Bahia la Cabezas and Las Cabezas de San Juan Nature Reserve one of the newest reserves on the island Acres of mangrove swamp cover the rocky outcrops sheltering sandy beaches and providing a haven for herons and pelicans Youll see hermit crabs scurrying across the ground hiding in their shells as you approach Faro de Fajardo Fajardo lighthouse stands amid all the greenery protecting ships from the shallows to the north and eastIsla de Vieques and CulebraThe islands of Vieques and Culebra off of Puerto Ricos east coast are a part of yet in many ways totally separate from the main island The small populations here live a slower more traditional life and the headlong rush to get there yesterday which youll experience in some of the cities and towns of Puerto Rico doesnt seem to exist here at allVieques pronounced beaykase is the largest of the two though its name from the Amerindian means small island Its about  hours by ferry from the coast or a minute flight from Isla Grande Airport in San Juan An island of wonderful sandy beaches and farmland it is also home to a large US military reserve Regular military flights may mar the tranquillity somewhat but they cant spoil the natural beauty Much of the land has been leased back to farmers and visitors can enjoy the wonderful beaches although youll need some form of photo ID to gain access to them On the south coast youll find Sun Bay and  miles  km of fine governmentrun public beach which was used as the location for the film Lord of the Flies Nearby is Mosquito Bay an appropriate name since most of the island seems to have squadrons of the tiny winged beasts This is a phosphorescent bay and you can take a boat trip out into the water to agitate the microscopic organisms that give off the strange glow Its a fascinating experience The show is always better on a moonless nightThe capital of the island is Isabel Segunda named in honor of the thcentury Spanish Queen who was on the throne when work began on the fort in the s Its shady plaza sees a constant stream of visitors but no one rushes Theres little else to do but relax and this is the real appeal of ViequesCulebra much smaller at  sq miles  sq km is north of Vieques It is the largest rock in a collection of over twenty that attract sailors and divers from the main island Culebra was known as the Spanish Virgin Island until the American takeoverit lies halfway between Puerto Rico and St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands Its only town is named Dewey after Admiral George Dewey a hero of the AmericanSpanish War of  The local people are more apt to call it PuebloCulebra is full of natural beauty beaches Flamenco is the most celebrated clear waters full of marine life and land awash with flowers Most people come just to sit on the beach or walk in the fresh air Much of the island is now managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to preserve the environment It makes an interesting day trip from Puerto Rico and a total contrast to hot days in the streets of Old San JuanThe SoutheastTraveling south from Fajardo you have the option of using Route  a new toll road or continuing on Route  Both roads lead past to the town of Humacao and on toward the south coast Just south of the Humacao is a left turn for Palmas del Mar

area around the Cendro la Pandura peak The road climbs via a series of switchback turns and once at the top youll have a clear view of the town lying in the flat plain below The lifestyle of the people who live high on the hillside is fascinating Jbaros country farmers carry machetes to the fields accompanied by their faithful hounds Chickens scoot under cars as you approach Around every turn youll marvel at how the houses can be built on such precipitous slopes The road then leads along the southern coastal plain through several small towns to Playa de PoncePoncePuerto Ricos second city Ponce is as much steeped in history as Old San Juan Founded in  it was named after a relative of Juan Ponce de Len not the famous explorer himself Ponce is a thriving port city very modern in many ways but it lives up to its name of Pearl of the South At the very heart of the city is a jewel of an old town wellpreserved thanks to a massive and expensive restoration program begun in the s Hundreds of careworn buildings were brought back to life and power cables were buried underground and out of sight Along with this physical transformation came a cultural change Ponce has become a focus for social events that celebrate Puerto Rican history and tradition several major festivals are held here throughout the yearThe focus of the city is Parque Degetau in Plaza Las Delicias Delight

together Named a World Biosphere Reserve the area includes several sandy beaches To see the park at its best though take the inland route Route  rather than the coast road There is too much evidence of human activity on the beaches the litter and burnedout cars spoil some of the beautiful viewsFurther east along Route  youll reach La Parguera a small town on the south coast surrounded by thousands of acres of mangroves A pretty town with a seaside atmosphere it is a popular vacation spot for citydwelling Puerto Ricans One of the most enticing activities in La Parguera is exploring the mangroves some of the tunnels are hundreds of yards deep and the small offshore islands where you can picnic swim and snorkel all day The waters offshore are full of sealife and wonderfully clear Rental boats are availableJust east of La Parguera is Phosphorescent Bay known for its glowing water filled with microorganisms Over the years many residents have built houseboats on the margins of the mangrove and this has caused problems for the sensitive environment of the bay The situation is said to be improving now as new environmental controls are being put into placeHeading west beyond La Parguera youll need to use secondary roads but these are in surprisingly good condition and relatively quiet Its almost a pampas landscape here with grassy slopes and horses galore Boquern a small village on the west coast has arguably the most beautiful balneario public beach on Puerto Rico a long arc of fine sand backed by sea grapes and palm trees The settlement is growing due to its popularity and a new marina is taking shape but it still retains the feel of its origins as a fishing village When the catches arrive small temporary stalls are set up around the tiny town square You can buy fresh clams and oysters which can be shucked for you to eat as you go There are a few small hotels here which soon fill up on weekends and holidays but if you arrive midweek or out of season you may find that you are the only visitorsSouth of Boquern you leave the world behind Make your way along Route  towards Cabo Rojo and the lighthouse at the southwest tip of the island to really enjoy natural Puerto Rico Fishing is the main way people make a living herebetween mangrove outcrops are many small shacks with boats tied up to rickety wooden jetties The salt flats that you see are still harvested commercially Eventually the tarmac stops and the road changes to a simple dirt track The surface is reasonable so dont worry about continuing on Youll travel over a narrow bridge and enter a section of the Bosque Estatal de Boquern Leave you car below the lighthouse and walk up the hill to reach it a fiveminute walk for the reasonably fit Turn around as you climb the hill and a wonderful sandy bay will open out in front of you Pelicans play and feed and frigate birds wheel in the sky aboveThe Faro de Cabo Rojo Cabo Rojo Lighthouse has been sadly neglected but the light still plays an important part in protecting shipping off the island It sits atop some of the highest cliffs on Puerto Rico a truly spectacular sight But beware of going too close to the edge as there are no fences hereInland from La Parguera and Boquern is pretty San Germn once also set on the coast but moved inland after the original site was sacked several times Built on an undulating hillside the town is the epitome of the Spanish colonial style Its two town squares have not yet been spoiled by neon fastfood signs Theres much of architectural interest around the pretty promenades and grand houses Over  named buildings are under protection but unfortunately as yet there is no tourist information office in the town and many of the buildings are neither identified nor open to the public Just enjoy the beautiful views and stroll along the streets to take in all the detailThe major building of importance here is the Iglesia Porta Coeli Church of the Gate of Heaven a tiny terracotta chapel and convent founded in  It sits in the lower of two squares in the town The heart of one of the most important religious communities on the island in its early years it was later used as a schoolhouse and poorhouse before being handed over to the government in  After renovations in  it was opened to the public The new complex includes the Museo de Arte Religioso Museum of Religious Art which features a collection of Puerto Rican santos carved religious figures and iconsNorth of Boquern is the city of Mayagez the major urban center of the west coast and the end of the Ruta Panoramica The old city was destroyed in an earthquake in  as a result Mayagez is less interesting in terms of architecture than other settlements It is however a popular base from which to explore the west coast there are frequent direct flights between Mayagez and San Juan A number of large international hotels offer a good standard of accommodation and facilities such as golf and casinosThe University of Puerto Ricos campus at Mayagez has an internationally recognized Tropical Agriculture Research Center which among other activities cultivates several hundred tropical species The center is open to the public but since it has no refreshment facilities or play areas for children its for dedicated gardeners onlyFifty miles  km off the coast is Mona Island called the Galapagos of Puerto Rico This isolated place characterized by a coastline of high cliffs is home to turtles iguanas and endangered pelicans There is no human settlement today but there is evidence that Tano Indians once lived here Columbus is also said to have landed as did Ponce de Len Camping trips of the communewith nature variety can be arranged from MayagezThe NorthwestThe northwest of Puerto Rico is the surfing capital of the Antilles with great waves rising offshore Inland is some of the most beautiful and undeveloped karst landscape anywhere The region produces most of the Puerto Rican coffee crop once the only coffee drunk in the VaticanOnce north of Mayagez head west on Route  to Rincn This small town and lowkey resort is the surfing center for all the beaches along the coast North from town is Punta Higuaro one of the most popular beaches and the Faro de Rincn Rincn Lighthouse This warning tower which is surrounded by a neat park area with a caf and gift shop makes an ideal platform for whalewatching Groups of the leviathans pass here on their migrations Telescopes allow you to scan the horizon for their watery exhalationsFarther north along the coast just south of the small town of Aguada is a monument commemorating the landing of Cristbal Coln on the island in  Though no one is really sure of the precise landing site Columbus is renowned for having been less than accurate in documenting his landing sites the small park with its column and nave paintings depicting Spanish colonization serves its purpose wellNorth of the town of Aguadilla traveling out toward the airport and Rafael Hernandez air force base are a series of fine bathing and surfing beaches The most famous is Crash Boat Beach named after a shipwreck that happened just offshore The beach is always busy but the most exciting stretch is the northern section where the fishing boats rest Most hours of the morning there are ships coming ashore with their meager but extremely fresh catch The boats are brightly colored and carefully tended to ensure that they are always in peak conditionnot one is splintered or sunbleachedTraveling back along the northern coast there is little to draw the eye Inland however its a different story South of the busy town of Arecibo are a number of attractions that would make a fine daytrip from San Juan none is more than a minute drive from the capitalRoute  from Arecibo leads to one of the most important and mysterious scientific instruments in the world Arecibo Observatory has the largest singledish radio telescope in the world  ft  m in diameter it has been silently scanning the universe making maps of distant solar systems and listening for messages from other planets since  The Observatory is part of Cornell Universitys National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center it operates  hours a day The center likes to emphasize the serious scientific work it undertakessuch as detecting extremely weak radio pulses from the very corners of the known universe which take  million years to reach the earth Some visitors are more impressed by the fact that the observatory was used for location shots in the James Bond film Goldeneye and more recently in Contact starring Jodie Foster A viewing platform allows you to look down on the massive dish and in the education center opened in  visitors can undertake simple and safe experiments to learn more about physics and the solar systemThe Observatory sits in the heart of karst country a region of archetypal limestone erosion Wave upon wave of small smooth hillocks known as haystacks cover the land and the roads bend and weave around these forested mounds and through small villages nestled in the valleys The name karst is taken from a region of Yugoslavia that has these same geographical characteristics One striking feature of all karst landscapes is that the erosion of the limestone layers by rainwater creates cave systems where weaker rock is worn away from under stronger rock that remains intact Puerto Rico has one of the most dramatic cave systems yet discovered in an area known as Parque de las Cavernas del Ro Camuy Ro Camuy Cave Park a little way south of the Observatory just off Route  Tourist trains carry passengers between the caves and sinkholes deep vertical shafts created when cave roofs collapse that make up the park A long video Spanish only shows what to expect before you set out The giant Cueva Clara Clara Cave is reached by descending into a sinkhole once in its depths a narrow entrance leads to a cavern of cathedrallike dimensionsit is said the largest section of the cave could hold the El Morro fort The caves and sinkholes have taken millions of years to erode many of the stalagmites and stalactites have been hundreds of thousands of years in formation An underground river the Ro Camuy is responsible for much of the work It still flows today enlarging its path through the rockThe whole cave park is a truly awesome sight with holes  ft  m deep and  ft  m across and caves thousands of feet deep all surrounded by pristine forest Some say that the fountain of youth is here in the clean water filtering through the limestone from the surface You dont have to believe the legends but taste the water anywayits very sweet and it cant hurt to wish just a littleFrom the caves its a short drive to Lares the islands center of coffee production The sweet brew made from Puerto Rican beans is considered one of the finest in the world though production is small Coffee plants usually interspersed with other crops such as bananas or plantains can be seen growing on the high hillsides it is a crop that enjoys good drainage and lots of humidity which the large banana leaves help to conserveFrom Lares take Route  to reach the most important Amerindian site on Puerto Rico the Parque Ceremonial Indgena Caguana Caguana Indian Ceremonial Park The park is set in a wide valley surrounded by limestone peaks one of which is said to represent the supreme god of the Tanos The several ceremonial ball courts discovered and excavated here suggest the site was one of the Indians major centers of worship The Tanos were still living happily on the island when Columbus arrived in  archaeological finds here date back to  bc The ball courts edged with stonessome with symbols carved on themare set in fine gardens planted with many native tree species A small museum displays pottery and other artifacts found at the siteFrom Arecibo on the coast its an hour along the fast Route  toll road to San Juan Many of the villages and towns along the way are small industrial outposts for the suburbs of Catao Just before reaching the city however is a resort that is developing into an important provider of visitor accommodations Dorado has several large resort hotels all of which occupy private grounds near the pretty sandy beaches These are selfcontained hotels with facilities such as golf courses and nighttime entertainment There is however little tourist infrastructure in the immediate vicinity The town of Dorado with restaurants and shops is  miles  km from the nearest hotel along the strip The Dorado resort area began life as a large plantation owned by the Livingston family the first hotel built herethe Hyatt Dorado Beach Hotelincorporated the old plantation house into its original designExcursion to St ThomasThe shopping mecca of the Caribbean St Thomas is the most densely populated of the three US Virgin Islands the others are St John and St Croix Easily reached from San Juanjust a minute flight from Muoz Marn International AirportSt Thomas has become a mustvisit island for many people Its a dutyfree haven where luxury goods can be  cheaper than at home This is particularly advantageous to US citizens

birdseye view of most of the neighboring US and British Virgin IslandsCharlotte AmalieThe capital of St Thomas Charlotte Amalie pronounced amahlia sits on one of the finest natural harbors in the world Named by Danish settlers after the wife of King Christian V the settlement started out as a trading port a tradition that continues with great success today The downtown area resting between the surrounding hills and the harbor is a warren of old streets and red roofs best seen from above One lasting legacy of the Danish colonization is the street namesWarehouses built along the harbor by th and thcentury Danish merchants still play host to hundreds of traders But now instead of stocking such staples as cotton flour or salt the stores are filled with the modern version of pirate bootygold gems watches and designer goods The main shopping streets lie close to the waterfront A series of narrow alleys are filled with craft clothing and jewelry shops along with cafs and restaurants that provide welcome relief once youve become shopped outBut Charlotte Amalie is not just a shoppers paradise There are historic gems to be discovered here as well Perhaps the most prominent is Fort Christian which sits to the east of downtown Work on the fort began in  to protect the harbor The terracotta walls pretty painted shutters and crenellated clock tower give the building a cozy rather than a fearsome look The interior has been transformed into a museum of life in the US Virgin Islands colonial furniture archive documents and old photographs of the islands people and towns Take a walk onto the walls of the fort for a wonderful view over the seafront and the colorful Vendors Plaza a craft market under bright parasols that has a permanent home in the forts shadowNext to the fort

commemorate the freeing of the slaves in  Across Tolbod Gade is the Tourist Information Office where you can pick up maps and other information On the northern corner of Tolbod Gade is the main post office Make your way in that direction but dont be tempted to turn right and head for the stores just yet Take the steps to Kongens Gade which is the street behind the Lutheran Church The steps climb onto the steep hill that has many of the oldest and most important buildings of Danish Charlotte Amalie The family houses of the merchants and civil servants where built high on this risenamed Government Hillto take advantage of the cooling breeze Kongens Gade itself has several buildings dating back to the late th and early th centuries Hotel  named for the year in which it was built sits amid other fine homes Walk past Hotel  and pause at the steps beside it which climb higher onto Government Hill These are the  Steps one of a series built by the Danes in the mid s to allow pedestrian access to the town below The  Steps are the longest in town but whoever named the flight must have become tired toward the end and miscountedthere are in fact Before climbing the steps make a small detour farther along Kongens Gade past the Lutheran Parsonage  to reach Government House an archetypal colonial mansion Now the office for the Governor of the USVIs this  structure was originally used for meetings of the Danish Colonial Council it was totally renovated in  Nearby is Seven Arches House Museum once the home of a Danish master craftsman The house has a welcoming arms staircasefashionable in the th centuryleading to the entrance Renovated and filled with period furniture walking through it is a step back in timeRetrace your route to the  Steps and climb to the

real name was Edward Teachcan also be seen herePerhaps one of the most beautiful and unusual buildings in Charlotte Amalie is the St Thomas Synagogue on Crystal Gade This is the oldest synagogue building in continual use under the American flag The Jewish congregation has always been strong here from the very earliest days of Danish settlement in  When the allconsuming fire of  broke out  families were worshipping in the small synagogue Only one scroll could be saved before the flames destroyed the building The present structure was built on the same spot and opened in  The synagogue has sand on the floor symbolic of the Jewish flight from EgyptThe cruise port is situated at the West Indian Company Dock a mile or so east of town The thirtyminute walk around the harbor is pleasant if the traffic is not too busy Those who want to ride will find numerous taxis waiting to take them to and from Charlotte Amalie The dock is one of the largest and busiest in the Caribbean Old Danish

Thomas its best to head directly north up into the hills youll be able to enjoy the beautiful views back towards Charlotte Amalie along the way Drakes Seat thought to mark the spot where Francis Drake sat and watched ships moving to and from San Juan offers breathtaking views of the northern coastline and Magens Bay the site of what is probably the best beach on St Thomas and one of the most famous in the Caribbean Estate St Peter Greathouse and Botanical Gardens takes up  acres  hectares along the ridge top near the summit of St Peter peak The estate was established in the s and was owned in the s by Virgin Islands Governor Lawrence Cramer Both the house and the gardens were totally destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in  Today they are back to their beautiful best and the house has been restored to combine history with modern amenities The observation deck around the house is the perfect perch from which to admire the view If youre feeling more energetic follow the nature trail through the gardenAt nearby Mountain Top ft  m above the bay and higher than Drakes Seatyoull find a sophisticated shopping mall and large bar area with almost nonstop daiquiris they claim to have invented the banana daiquiri here Everyone comes with a camera so you may have to wait a while to get a shot of the viewMagens Bay is a beautiful stretch of sand with a slight kink in the center which gives it the epithet heartshaped Because it is so sheltered its a safe place for children to swim and for everyone to snorkel though it can get very busy In the rolling hillside behind the beach is Mahogany Run Golf Course so you could have a round in the morning and swim and snorkel in the afternoonOn the eastern end of the island amid a number of large hotel complexes is Coki Point a pleasant beach At the end of the point is Coral World which offers a fascinating look at life under the water The attraction centers around a number of different controlled marine environments each with its own animals or fish Watch out for the stingray shark and turtle pools where regular feeding times are posted youll even get a chance to pet some of the exhibits Pride of place at Coral World must go to the genuine coral reef which has been implanted in the open water offshore An underground viewing area reached via a walkway allows you to observe the daily activity of the reef fish and some of the larger wild creatures who swim in for the free food provided by Coral World staffCoki Beach is popular spot for snorkelers simply because there is so much sealife here thanks to the regular feedings provided by Coral World around their reef Many of the cruise ships bus their passengers in here for snorkeling so it can get busy but you are almost always guaranteed a good show of marine life
