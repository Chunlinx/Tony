        have any great vacation spots to share with me     uh  well most       im fifty three most of my big vacations i think are probably in the past ive been you know to Europe a couple of times and   oh boy   and to   where in Europe   Rio huh   where in Europe did you go   oh okay uh England uh Holland France uh one of the interesting most interesting ones was Berlin we were there for five years and this was back in eighty five before you know the wall came down   wow   so that was very interesting to go into you know a Communist country and all that course its kind of laughable now but you know thats the way it was then   thats not you say you were there for five years   five days im   oh five days uhhuh   five days my husbands brother was the commander of the Air Force base in Berlin   uhhuh uhhuh   and so we were visiting them   im sorry i interrupted you you was always saying also saying that youd gone to Rio   yeah uh another brother  all my  my brothers and sisters used to live in all these interesting places uh theyre all retired and back in the states now but one lived in Rio and that was   thats wonderful   we went there for about ten days and that was quite a beautiful place   umhum   and uh so   so a lot lot of your big vacations have been international   to yeah and to visit relatives my brother worked lived in Jamaica for a number of years so we went there you know for a week so uh   thats wonderful   and   do you like to travel domestically as well do you do you take vacations around the country now   uh yes uhhuh in fact thats probably where well go in the remaining years well probably just stay right here in this country for some we i think we could afford more back then than we can now   uhhuh     were caught in this economic crunch   yes i can relate to that   we also had a time share condo if youre familiar with those so we used and it was our home unit was in Vail Colorado   oh yes   and then if you didnt want to go there you could switch and go actually anywhere anywhere in the world and   did you ski when you were there in Vail   uh yeah a little but we waited we were too old when we started going to really learn the you know like our children learned well and skied well but you know   uhhuh uhhuh   you thats something you really i think should learn when youre younger       you know you wait until youre forty five and start learning to ski well then youre afraid youre going to break something   its true its true   now ive done all the talking you tell me what youve done   yours are much more exciting than mine um i think probably finances have limited us um primarily my family um because im the oldest when i left um my family went on some really fun vacations so its more the things that ive done with my husband and and more recently our child that uh that we that i could probably talk about   well youre much younger what age are you   well im not actually i just started my family younger  i mean started my family later um   oh   im thirty six and my daughters only   well that is young go ahead   my well but my daughters only two so  at my age i think that my my mother i mean when my mother was my age i think that i was probably twelve or something like that   yeah but but that was the trend back then you know       you had your children in the early twenties   it right at any rate weve really enjoyed camping vacations i think that thats probably the thing that weve uh done most each year probably four to seven times a year well take short short little vacations maybe three days maybe four days   oh   and theres so many places in the San Francisco Bay area that you can camp that you dont really have to go very far you can drive as little as an hour and get into a redwood forest and feel like youre just   oh and such beautiful country up around you   it is really nice to have that very close um there are some places up the coast near Mendocino and in Marin that have what they call environmental cabins so you can rent them fairly inexpensively and stay a couple nights and feel like you have a little beach house getaway   oh   so weve done that a few times too you know its very rustic you dont you bring all your own things and you bring your your your cooler almost as if you were camping but theres a stove and theres a   right   a table and and uh platforms for your bed mattress and that sort of thing so its somewhat set up those weve really enjoyed i think what id like to do when our daughters a little older   oh   and if we have other kids its uh the kind of club made med vacations that my husband and i enjoyed several years ago because theres so many different activities   umhum and and they you can take children now cant you   yes they call them club kids   yeah okay i knew i knew something about that uhhuh     yes they have all kinds of art activities and sports that are tailored for kids and babysitters if you have children that are you know infants
