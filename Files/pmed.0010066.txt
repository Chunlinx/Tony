                    Introduction        Most primary malignancies spread systemically via lymphatic dissemination  For        example the finding of axillary nodal metastases predicts a much shorter diseasefree        survival in breast cancer  The total nodal tumor burden number of affected nodes and        metastatic tumor volume affects prognosis even more severely  Accurate lymph node        staging also remains a cornerstone in choosing the most appropriate therapy for a given        stage Therapeutic intervention of metastatic lymph nodes  prophylactic radiation of        frequently affected drainage routes  and systemic therapies  all have been shown to        improve survival Genetic profiles identifying metastatic tumors  serum biomarkers and        proteomic profiles are currently being developed to identify patients at risk  No        direct genetic profile however has been demonstrated to date to accurately predict the        presence of human nodal metastases in a given patient Rather surgical approaches such as        sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection are still commonly used Careful        histological analysis includes mapping bisectioning and rapid staining in the frozen        tissue laboratory Higher diagnostic accuracies can be achieved by serial sectioning         m and by immunohistochemical staining         Noninvasive imaging studies are commonly used during the workup of primary malignancies        Typically lymph nodes are diagnosed by tomographic techniques computed tomography CT        magnetic resonance imaging MRI as malignant when their short axis is  mm in size         Such size criteria however have been shown to be unreliable  Similarly the        detection of cancer in nonenlarged occult nodes is often quite low by positronemission        tomography PET and single photon emission computed tomography imaging For example small        nodal metastases   mm are often missed by PET imaging in patients with breast cancer         More recently it has become possible to image anatomic regions at submillimeter        resolutions by MRI with excellent spatial coverage and reduced motion artifacts The        development  and clinical introduction of lymphotropic magnetic nanoparticles has        been shown to significantly improve diagnostic accuracies of MRI for nodal staging LMRI        in prostate cancer  These nanoparticles serve as probes for lymphatic anatomy and        function and enhance tumor detection through abnormal distribution patterns in malignant        nodes         Despite the advances of LMRI for cancer staging image analysis has been challenging and        occasionally controversial Traditional analysis has been based on a readers        identification of certain structural abnormalities that can be variable given differences        in acquisition parameters and interpretation criteria  Furthermore it has been        challenging to quickly and accurately analyze large datasets generated by LMRI        The goal of the current study was to develop and test technologies that would vastly        improve the accuracy of current LMRI nodal staging Specifically we set out to a        determine whether unique magnetic parameters existed and could be used for semiautomated        image analysis and b whether the technique could be applied to different primary cancers        Here we provide the first comprehensive analysis of tissue parameters validated against        histopathology as an end point                    Methods                  Study Design          The Institutional Review Board approved the current study and all patients signed          informed consent The study was divided into a learning           n   lymph nodes with known histopathology and a test dataset           n   lymph nodes with known histopathology Table  Assignment          into datasets was done in temporal fashion The learning dataset represented          retrospective cases at outset of the study and the test dataset represented prospective          cases collected during a y interval In the learning set  of the nodes were benign          and  of the nodes were malignant The learning dataset was obtained from  patients           male  female age  y mean  y with histologically proven primary          genitourinary malignancies prostate  bladder  testes  ureter  All patients          completed the MRI study and then underwent surgical resection           n   andor nodal biopsy           n   The investigated nodes had a mean short axis diameter of           mm range  mm          The test dataset was obtained from  patients  male nine female age  y          mean  y with histologically proven malignancies from different primaries Table           including prostate           n   breast           n   penile           n   bladder           n   testes           n   and colon           n   Seventynine percent of the nodes were benign and  of the          nodes were malignant The nodes in the test dataset had a mean short axis diameter of           mm range  mm Both datasets included the full spectrum of normal nodes to          completely replaced nodes                          MRI          MRI was performed at  T System X General Electric Medical Systems Milwaukee          Wisconsin United States using phasedarray coils All images were archived on DICOM          PACS servers MIPortal CMIR and Siemens Medical Systems Erlangen Germany and Impax RS           AGFA Technical Imaging Systems Richfield Park New Jersey United States for          subsequent analysis Images of the pelvis           n   extended from the pubic symphysis to just above the level of          aortic bifurcation In patients with primary testicular cancers           n   imaging was extended superiorly to include the renal hilum and          retroperitoneum In patients with breast cancer           n   we obtained MR images of the bilateral axillae including the          internal mammary and supraclavicular regions All patients were imaged with identical          pulse sequences and timing parameters Imaging was performed

imaging sequences and parameters had previously been optimized to          reduce motion artifacts maximize signaltonoise ratio SNR and provide diagnostically          useful images of the pelvis abdomen and chest within clinically acceptable time limits          The Tweighted fast spinecho sequence in a above was primarily used for qualitative          nodal detection and hence a square pixel with more than one acquisition was obtained          The twodimensional axial Tweighted gradientecho sequence in b above was chosen to          achieve adequate anatomical coverage within a short imaging time The axial dualecho          gradientecho sequence in c above was developed specifically for this project to          provide artifactfree datasets for quantitative image analysis A matrix size of             was chosen for this sequence to achieve a balance between the upper limits for          imaging time while reducing image noise Finally a D Tweighted sequence was obtained          in d above to provide a dataset for vascular maximum intensity projection MIP          reconstructions                          Quantitative Image Analysis          All image analysis was performed on archived DICOM images using different software          packages eg custombuilt software such as CMIRImage MGH Boston Massachusetts          United States Syngo Siemens Medical Systems Advantage Windows General Electric          Medical Systems Lymph nodes were identified by readers who manually placed kernels onto          each node for automated boundary detection and calculation of nodal dimensions and          volumes The thus identified regions of interest ROIs encompassed the entire lymph node          not only portions of it and were used for quantitative signalintensity SI          measurements see Table  Serial measurements of nodal dimensions on different pulse          sequences or time points varied less than           A number of quantitative tissue parameters were calculated either as differences          between pre and postcontrast scans  or as singlevalue analysis on postcontrast scans          see Table  The lymph nodemuscle LNM ratio was calculated by dividing signal          intensities of an entire lymph node by that of adjacent muscle using a similarsized ROI          drawn manually The nodal SI change was calculated by obtaining SI before and after          contrast administration The nodal SNR was calculated by obtaining SDSD          noise  The T was calculated in nodal ROIs on dual TE images using          CMIRImage T maps were constructed by performing fits of a standard exponential          relaxation model S  Ke          TET  to the data on a pixelbypixel basis Only pixels with          intensity greater than a threshold level X of noise were considered during the fitting          process Pixel variance was obtained from postMR images Comparative visual analysis          included short axis measurements and identification of heterogeneity large focal          defects and central hyperintensity according to criteria previously established                    To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the different tissue parameters in the          learning dataset we determined sensitivity specificity and predictive values for each          parameter alone and in combination Table  The most discriminatory parameters were          then applied to the test dataset Table           In the final set of semiautomated image analysis D reconstructions were obtained for          nodal mapping onto vascular anatomy using MIP projections While the MIP projections do          not aid in the differentiation between malignant and benign lymph nodes they are          invaluable in providing anatomic content to the dozens of lymph nodes identified In          particular MIP images were generated interactively from postcontrast fatsaturated          volumetric interpolated breathhold images to outline vascular anatomy The evaluated          lymph nodes characterized as benign or malignant by Tvariance analysis were then          superimposed on the volumetric D images using customized software Advantage Windows          General Electric Medical Systems                          Statistical Analysis          Data were expressed as mean  standard deviations SD and medians All statistical          testing was performed using GraphPad Prism GraphPad Software San Diego California          United States The significance between two individual groups was determined using the          nonpaired Students           t test eg benign and malignant datasets in Figure  For the more          discriminatory datasets alternativefreeresponse receiver operating characteristic          curves were plotted Ratios for cutoff singlevalue parameters were defined to yield          highest sensitivity and specificity Accuracy for a given parameter was expressed as the          area under the curve A          z  and values are summarized in Table                           Histology          All lymph nodes were sampled histologically within  wk of the MRI mean  d range           d The analysis was done in surgically resected lymph nodes           n   both benign and malignant nodes or in fine needle aspirates          and core biopsies           n   malignant nodes only implementing careful mapping procedures          to correlate nodes Surgically excised nodes were sectioned at  m intervals after          bihalving and were stained with hematoxylineosin                            Results                  Learning Dataset          The learning dataset consisted of  histologically validated lymph nodes from           patients with different primary malignancies see Table  The mean short axis diameter          was  mm range  mm with  of the  nodes  measuring less than  mm          that is below the traditional imaging cutoff for malignancy occult nodes Table           summarizes the incidence of different visual comparative before and after contrast          administration and semiautomated postcontrast administration only parameters in the          two different groups Figure  is a graphical representation of overlaps between          malignant and benign groups for different parameters listed in Table  Table           summarizes sensitivities specificities and predictive values for the different          quantitative imaging parameters Sensitivities of metastasis detection by visual image          analysis ranged from  however often with lower specificities Volumetric          measurements in particular were insensitive markers of malignancy in nonenlarged nodes          see Table           In contradistinction image analysis of pre and postcontrast image sequences resulted          in higher specificities and sensitivities see Table  Comparative differences between          benign and malignant nodal groups were highest for T and pixel variance measurements          see Table  Of all the semiautomated parameters tested alone T measurements showed          the highest sensitivity   confidence interval  and specificity            confidence interval  in the learning dataset see Figure  and Table           Of all the semiautomated parameters tested in combination T measurements combined          with pixel variance analyses postcontrast showed the highest sensitivity            confidence interval  and specificity   confidence interval  in          the learning dataset Figure E Using the dualvalue analysis there was one malignant          outlier in the benign dataset the lymph node was  mm in overall size with few          malignant cells seen on histology and probably too small for analysis and two benign          outliers in the malignant dataset both these nodes showed hyalinosis replacing more than           of the nodal architecture                          Test Dataset          To determine whether feature extraction would be accurate for prospective nodal          staging we utilized the above criteria against a larger test dataset encompassing           validated lymph nodes from  patients including different primaries see Table  The          sensitivity specificity and predictive values of the most discriminatory parameters of          this prospective analysis are summarized in Table  We primarily focused on          semiautomated image analysis of postcontrast scans because of the high sensitivity and          specificity determined in the learning dataset T measurements showed a sensitivity of            confidence interval  and a specificity of   confidence          interval  Combined T and pixel variance analysis achieved a sensitivity of            confidence interval  and a specificity of   confidence interval           comparable to that of the learning set and much superior to currently used size          criteria          Using the dualvalue analysis there were two malignant outliers in the benign dataset          both of these nodes were less than  mm in overall size and probably too small for          analysissimilar to the learning dataset and three benign outliers in the malignant          dataset two of these nodes had hyalinosis replacing more than  of the nodal          architecture and one had macrocalcifications More important all the misclassified          nodes occurred in individual patients rather than in the same patient and hence did not          affect the overall nodal staging on a patientbypatient basis in this dataset                          Image Reconstruction          Utilizing semiautomated feature extraction to identify lymph nodes and image analysis          based on T and pixel variance we subsequently proceeded to map individual lymph          nodes onto vascular anatomy in the different anatomic drainage patterns Figure           summarizes the different steps in image analysis Figure  and Video  shows an example          of a yold patient with colorectal cancer undergoing semiautomated nodal staging In          this particular patient MRI identified six positive lymph nodes   mm each          reconstructed as a D dataset whereas all positive lymph nodes were missed by PET scans          Figure  and Video  show reconstructions and analyses from a patient with a breast          cancer primary with bilateral nodal metastases Note the high spatial resolution allowing          the detection of a mm nodal metastasis                            Discussion        We show that it is feasible to extract various quantitative tissue parameters to predict        the likelihood of nodal metastases in vivo These results are highly relevant in cancer        staging because they provide evidence that a quantitative tissue parameters enable        diagnosis of lymph node metastases while reducing interobserver variability and b that        semiautomated reconstructions allow spatially more extensive mapping than is currently        possible        Metastases to lymph nodes occur during growth of most primary malignancies and their        presence mandates the need for more extensive and systemic therapy Nodal cancer staging        currently relies on invasive procedures surgical lymph node dissection sentinel lymph        node resection biopsy with significant morbidity and cost  or insensitive        tomographic imaging methods  For example detection sensitivities using size criteria        with stateoftheart multislice CT are as low as  whereas PET imaging of nonenlarged        nodes has equally low sensitivities  Based on the observation that nanoparticulate        solutions accumulate in nodal macrophages upon systemic injections  lymphotropic        superparamagnetic preparations have been developed  In earlier clinical trials using        lower spatial resolution sequences metastases of  mm have been detected  whereas        as few as  tumor cells have been detected in nodes in experimental mouse models         Despite these advances it has been difficult to acquire images of sufficiently high        resolution and to derive parameters to automate diagnosis The data presented here indicate        that unique magnetic parameters allow identification of nodal metastases and accurate D        reconstructions including surgically inaccessible lymph nodes        The significance of the above findings is fold First the ability to directly and        noninvasively monitor nodal tumor involvement represents a powerful diagnostic tool for        cancer Accurate staging represents the cornerstone for triaging patients to either        localized or to more aggressive and systemic therapies Second the method described here        was sensitive for the limited subsets of primary cancers tested It is reasonable to        hypothesize that such analysis could be applied to staging of other common primaries In        particular lung colorectal genitourinary and head and neck cancers could benefit from        this staging procedure In addition to nodal staging the nanoparticleenhanced MRI can        also be used to measure microvascularity in primary tumors  and to improve the        detection of liver metastases  Third our results are significant because the        semiautomated staging method is highly accurate and reduces variability in visual image        analyses between different observers        The LMRI staging technique is believed to be clinically relevant in several key areas        First LMRI may play a significant role in avoiding unnecessary surgeries that is those        in nodepositive patients Second since LMRI can detect lymph nodes outside traditional        surgical fields this information may influence surgical approaches In colorectal cancer        LMRI may provide a sentinelnodelike guide to staging Third it is likely that LMRI        would be useful to identify appropriate patients to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior        to surgery Currently neoadjuvant therapy is often reserved for postoperative patients        once the nodal status has been determined Fourth LMRI may be particularly useful to guide        radiation therapy by mapping the complete nodal status onto bony and vascular landmarks        Finally LMRI could be used to avoid invasive diagnostic procedures which are not part of        therapy For example LMRI could replace lymphangiography mediastinoscopy or endoscopic        ultrasound for nodal staging        Our findings have a number of direct implications for technology development and in        clinical care Accurate measurements of T relies on motion artifactfree multiecho pulse        sequences that are not routinely available on clinical scanners at spatial resolutions        required for nodal staging Such sequences will have to be implemented and combined with        postprocessing tools to simplify and semiautomate analysis Similar software approaches are        already used routinely in lung nodule characterization  or screening for breast cancers         We predict that in the case of LMRI such automation routines will be highly        specific given the unique mechanism of image contrast As a proofofprinciple we        implemented approaches to identify segment analyze and display nodal information While        the current technology is already highly accurate we anticipate further improvements with        hardware and software advances We hope that this will ultimately translate into clinical        practice and replace unnecessary intervention
