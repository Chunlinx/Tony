                                 Flying Out of Control                        Some people rage against government taxes others resent the old people whoare sucking dry our Social Security safety net even as they crankily vote downlocal school budgets Not me I lie awake and worry about the national tragedythat is the airline industry I hate them all the lackadaisical baggagehandlers who accidentally sent our luggage to a remote cargo area at JFK lastweek the surly stewardesses the brazen caterers whose spongy chicken inbrown goo so shamelessly denigrates the memory of food But most of all Iobsess over the people whose duty it is to deice wings coax the cargo holdnot to explode and fix any smoking engines before takeoff So of course youare right simple mechanical failure is scarier than terrorism because itconnotes a level of indifference that is no less evil than overt terrorism butfar more insidious And even worse it epitomizes the attitude of most airlineemployees toward their customers The passengers Those people who are payinghundreds of dollars or moremy ticket to Asia last month topped forthe privilege of being herded like cattle onto a death trap over which no oneseems to have much control Stop citing those statistics that show air travelis safer than automobiles The big difference is that auto accidents aresurvivable Thats because auto accidents are to some extent controllable bythe travelers The driver who hears a car engine making a bad whompety noisehas a choice Pull off the highway or gut it out The airplane passenger wholike me hears a nasty whirrrrrsh on takeoff and feels the seat shimmy as ifpowered by Magic Fingers has no such choice I must sit And hope that thepilot is better at his job than the baggage handlers are at theirs            Despite the cultural leap that being an airplane passenger requiresas anAmerican I have after all spent nearly four decades constructing anelaborate illusion of how I control my lifeI continue to fly So far thegamble has paid off Im alive Youre alive Our children still have parentspartly because we chose Asia not Egypt as a destination We even have ourluggage This time
