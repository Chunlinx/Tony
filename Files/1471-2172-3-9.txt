                    Background        The         in vitro culture of human peripheral        blood lymphocytes in IL results in the generation of        cytotoxic cells that lyse tumor targets Natural Killer        NK cells are the main lymphocytic population        constitutively expressing p chain of the IL receptor        and exhibiting upregulation of LFA Lymphocyte Function        associated Antigen molecule upon IL stimulation        Consequently incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes        with IL induces selective activation of NK cells rapid        increase of NK activity followed by generation of LAK        activity and proliferation This has been referred to as        the LAK phenomenon     Similarly IL treatment of        peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC or pure NK cells        within a few hours induces an enhancement of cytotoxic        ability It was observed that the maximum enhancement        obtained with IL is less than that obtained with IL        and comparable to that observed with IFN However IL        was found to be effective at concentrations  order of        magnitude lower than ILIFN Maximum enhancement of NK        mediated cytotoxicity was observed with a combination of        IL and IL the effect of the two cytokines together        being additive     Another study revealed that cytokine        stimulated NK cells use both granzymeFas ligand pathways        of apoptotic induction to mediate cytotoxicity    and it        was found that IL and IL both increase induction in        mRNA coding for perforin granzymes A and B     Hence        the importance of both these cytokines in enhancing        cytotoxicity cannot be overlooked        However before this picture about the involvement of NK        cells in LAK activity emerged there existed considerable        controversy regarding the type of effector cells mediating        this activity particularly concerning the relative        contributions by the two lymphocyte populations NK Vs        cytotoxic T cells         Experiments in which        depletion of AsialoGM a glycolipid present on the surface        of NK cells was carried out demonstrated that the        generation of LAK cells followed by IL stimulation was        considerably reduced thereby confirming that the NK cells        are the major contributors of LAK activity            Further studies with sorted pure populations of CDNK        cells also showed that the LAK phenomenon is predominantly        mediated by IL activated NK cells Both precursor and        effector cells of this activity were typically NK cells            Direct evidence that NK cells are the mediators of        LAK activity came from Immunotransmission Electron        microscopic studies using colloidal gold labeled antibodies        in which CD positive cells were shown to extend their        protrusions deep into the target cells and it was found        that the cytoplasmic granules and vacuoles of CD positive        LAK cells were concentrated in the area of the binding site            With the advent of flowcytometry and        immunophenotyping we thought we could approach this dilemma        in a different but simple and straightforward manner        Therefore we generated LAK cells by the method of Anita and        Hersh    and carried out cytotoxicity experiments with        the stimulated cells For our cytotoxicity experiments we        used the U cell line which are derived from human        histiocytic lymphoma as tumor targets U cells share        many surface markers and receptors with normal human        monocytes and therefore express many monocyte like        characteristics        Concurrently we also        assessed the changes in the phenotypic characteristics by        flowcytometry Flowcytometry is a powerful tool that allows        one to study not only freshly isolated lymphocytes but also        cells that have been cultured         in Vitro and allowed to proliferate        in the presence of stimulating factors This helps to        qualitatively as well as quantitatively assess the        phenotypic nature of the proliferating cells         in Vitro In the present study our        aim was to find out the relative contributions of cells of        different phenotypes to spontaneous cytotoxicity and study        the effect of long term         in vitro stimulation of cytokines on        mixed lymphocyte cultures                    Results        A study was undertaken to see the effect of IL andor        IL stimulation on a long term basis and correlate the        phenotypic changes of the proliferating population        corresponding to their cytotoxic abilities after         in vitro culture of the peripheral        blood lymphocytes LAK cells were generated as described        At regular time points the cells were harvested The        chromium release cytotoxic assay was performed by the        standard procedure and compared with the corresponding        phenotypic characteristics of the cells by flowcytometry        A dot plot was generated to gate for the cells after        stimulation A representative dot plot of unstimulated and        stimulated cells is shown in Figure         In the Figures to  the line graph represents        percentage Cr release values indicating the percentage NK        cytotoxicity at different time points in response to        different stimuli The bar diagrams indicate the        corresponding phenotypic characteristics of the cells as        assessed by flowcytometry The total cells were analysed        after appropriately applying the gate on the corresponding        dot plots        It can be seen that IL at  U cells is very        effective in inducing proliferation of NK cells         simultaneously augmenting cytotoxicity Figure  The        percentage of NK cells blue bar rises from a basal value        of     of the total lymphocytes on day zero to            of the total lymphocytes on day  Simultaneously        percentage cytotoxicity line graph also rises from a        basal value of     on day zero to     on        day  concurring with the increase in NK cells When IL        at a concentration of  U cells was added along with        IL at a concentration of  U cells there was an        increase of NK phenotype up to     on day  and a        corresponding maximum NK activity of     Figure         Equally impressive augmentation of NK activity was seen        even at lower concentrations of IL and IL in        combination At IL concentration of  U cells along        with IL concentration of  U cells there was an        increase of NK phenotype up to     on day  and a        corresponding maximum NK activity of     Figure         But when IL alone was added at the same low        concentration percentage of NK cells is only            on day  corresponding to maximum NK activity of only            Figure  However IL by itself at concentrations        of  U or  U cells is unable to cause neither an        increase in the NK phenotype nor in their cytotoxic ability        Figure          From Figures      it is evident that        initially on day  even though there is a transient        increase in the CDve T cells green bars up to         the corresponding increase in the chromium release values        against U target cells is negligible even at a high dose        of IL In contrast at later time points when the        cytotoxicity goes up to  there are very few CD T        cells as compared to the NK cell phenotype The proportion        of T cells red bars also has no bearing on the NK        activity                    Discussion        Following low dose IL treatment in leprosy patients        NK cell numbers were found to increase fold and IL        therapy of HIV patients resulted in enhanced NK and LAK        cell activity         in vitro    IL subcutaneously        given resulted in         in vivo expansion of CD positive NK        cells to very large numbers which showed LAK activity and        ADCC Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity         in vitro     In view of the        above mentioned and other reports available in literature        a pilot study was undertaken to see the effect of IL        andor IL stimulation on a long term basis and study the        phenotypic changes corresponding to the cytotoxic changes        after         in vitro culture of the peripheral        blood lymphocytes        The results obtained from these long term stimulation        studies have thrown up interesting points for debate The        phenotypic analysis of the PBMC cultured in the presence of        IL andor IL from  to  days has brought to light        that there is a gradual increase in the percentage of NK        cells suggesting that these cells constitute the        predominant cell population in these cultures This        observation is consistent with the results of others where        they have shown an increase up to  of NK cells on day         in response to IL and IL     Even at low        concentrations when IL is added along with IL it is        able to cause substantial increase in NK cell proliferation        and activity Figure  comparable to the effect seen when        IL is added alone at higher concentrations Figure         Hence the two cytokines together appear to have an additive        effect as reported by other workers            The most striking observation from our experiments is        that it provides clear evidence that the CD T cells        contribute little to cytotoxic activity against the U        target cell line It is seen from the figures              that when NK cell number increases the NK activity        also increases Initially on day  even though there is a        transient increase in the CD T cell population a        corresponding increase in the chromium release values is        not observed at a low dose of IL figure  and only a        very marginal increase is seen at a higher dose of IL        figure  although the CD positive T cells are more than        double the basal level In contrast at later time points        when the cytotoxicity goes up to  there are very few        CD positive T cells as compared to the NK cell phenotype        reaffirming that it is the NK phenotype that is mostly        responsible for the spontaneous killing of U tumor        targets Similar studies have been carried out using other        tumor targets such as K COLO WILMS MELANOMA and P        Some researchers have reported the ability of CD positive        T cells to exhibit spontaneous killing against some of the        targets such as K or P upon stimulation with IL               However Lanier and Philips who carried out        extensive studies on the LAK phenomenon have emphasised        that although CD T cells exhibit nonMHCrestricted        cytotoxicity to some targets upon IL stimulation their        contribution was quantitatively and qualitatively very        minimal as compared to the NK subset      The        differences in the ability of lymphocytes of different        phenotypes to respond to IL stimulation and carry out        spontaneous lysis of different targets could probably be        attributed to the differential expression of inhibitory        receptors present on the targets such as KIR and CDNKG                   Another important observation is that IL by itself at        concentrations of  U or  U cells is unable to        cause neither an increase in the Natural Killer phenotype        nor in their cytotoxic ability Figure   This is        in agreement with the reported literature where it has been        reported that IL can act only on prestimulated cells        and has little or no effect on resting lymphocytes            IL is a cytokine produced to some degree by B        lymphocytes but mostly by phagocytic cells including        monocytes macrophages neutrophils epidermal cells        keratinocytes and dendritic cells which are among the first        cells to encounter a foreign antigen during infection in        response to bacteria bacterial products intracellular        parasites etc     It was found that IL induced        directional migration of highly enriched preparations of NK        cells and CD activated cells but not resting T cells and        monocytes When NK cells were treated overnight with IL        they showed augmented binding to epithelial cells EC by        the LFA ICAM pathways Thus by inducing migration and        interaction with EC IL regulates crucial determinants        of NK cell recruitment in tissues     It is believed        that IL plays an instrumental role in tilting the immune        response in favor of T helper type  by generation of Th        cells and consequently initiates CMI     Since IL        enhances cytotoxicity and augments proliferation by antigen        specific T cells and NK cells IL may facilitate antigen        specific and nonspecific cytotoxic immune defense against        intracellular pathogens such as         M tuberculosis  An intriguing        property of IL is its capacity to induce proliferation        by cytolytic T cell only upon costimulation with antigen        IL may thus be a candidate to control the cytolytic arm        of initial immune response to pathogens by inducing        expansion of cytotoxic T cell only when antigen is        encountered     The biologic significance of the        multiplicity of cytokines which can stimulate the        proliferation of T and NK cells is unclear It may be that        the various lymphokine growth factors are differentially        produced at different time points during the ontogeny of        the immune system at different stages in the development of        an immune response or at different sites within the body or        lymphoid tissues     Our studies have confirmed the        importance of multiple cytokine stimulation of lymphocytes        and how NK cells are crucial to the development of        spontaneous cytotoxicity and are the major contributors to        LAK activity         in vitro when U cells were used        as targets The use of flowcytometry to understand the in        vitro effects of cytokine stimulation makes ones task        easier as studies can be carried out on mixed lymphocyte        populations                    Conclusions        The use of flowcytometry as a tool in correlating the        functional capacity of various subpopulations of mixed        lymphocyte cultures to their phenotype has been        demonstrated A study was undertaken to correlate the        phenotypic changes corresponding to the cytotoxic potential        of human peripheral blood lymphocytes after long term         in vitro stimulation with IL and        IL cytokines As reported in literature flowcytometric        evidence also pointed to the fact that double positive        cells constituting the cytotoxic T cells contribute little        to Lymphokine Activated Killer activity reaffirming that        in a mixed lymphocyte culture it is the NK phenotype that        is responsible for the spontaneous killing of tumor        targets Thus flowcytometry can be easily applied to        situations where one needs to quickly understand the        phenotypic changes with respect to their corresponding        functional capacity in response to various stimulants or        inhibitory agents even on mixed
