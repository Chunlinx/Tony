        right okay     yes   how many kids do you have   i think we i think were going to talk about parents spending time with their children we have three children who are eleven nine and eight   right   so this is a big issue with us although i dont recall marking it on my little things to talk about but  perhaps they are looking for uh words to be said like day care and quality time and     uhhuh   anyway  you dont have children   no   but youre married   yeah we we been married for two and a half years weve been trying for about two years but no luck yet  hopefully   oh you know i know were not supposed to do this long distance but actually im getting a call i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting could i ask you to hold one minute ill be right back excuse me just a moment theyre gonna get mad   uhhuh had   she has three kids eleven nine and eight   hello im so sorry that was my daughters Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting   uhhuh its all right okay so it keeps you busy do you have a lot of activities with your kids     well i dont wanna i dont want this to be a unilateral conversation but  yes we do both my husband and i work and our children are sixth fourth and third grade and the school years are wonderful theyre just wonderful the kids theyre real people and theyre interesting and  they they have all their own activities and um   uhhuh     i think as parents we really enjoy them and in our own personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel  im sure im sure thats coming though but theyre wonderful kids   uhhuh so theyre pretty good kids huh yeah well we had nine well growing up i guess i can talk about us uh we had nine kids in our family we had eight boys and one girl but my dad um  yeah and the time that my we spent with our dad was he owned his own business so we worked with him most of the time   you had eight boys and one girl   so thats how we spent most of the time with him yeah   are you Mormons because with Utah and the large family   that was the dead giveaway huh   well were Catholics i came from a family of five i had four brothers the only girl   uhhuh oh   and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled i never felt spoiled in fact i always felt my toys were destroyed   which that i was gonna say my sister wasnt spoiled very much   no usually busy fighting for survival   yeah thats exactly what it was   well i do think with working parents it is i mean there are some real issues here um   but uhhuh   that i think um i dont know its an interesting phenomena i happen to um  im a pediatrician my husband is a physician so um   oh   i i teasingly i talk to parents about this a lot uh children i i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home um need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide whats best for them and their family   yeah uhhuh   and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing and i long ago decided im a better mother because i work outside the home i really believe that   umhum   and it has um helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldnt otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age and i think our kids are real secure   umhum   and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so i know it sounds like a rationalization but its i really think its true for our family and i think it has worked very well   well yeah its like you said its you know to each his own i mean were planning on having my wife stay home and but   theres no question i think thats really the best if if a woman is happy doing that i hate to put it quite that way   umhum yeah   i was twenty nine when i had my first child and um i would not have been real fulfilled i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child its a wonderful its wonderful to be a mother but   umhum   um i liked i like the way i did it i sort of worked half time i had very flexible hours   right   i nursed all three of our children till they were at least a year and i you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers   oh uhhuh   um and i think we choose very very carefully the um alternative situations that we had them in   umhum   some babysitting groups again i know it sounds like a rationalization but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they  they learn to share and they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure theyre secure  i think that helps   umhum well thats good sounds like youre have a handle on it   oh yeah hope so so your wife does she work right now     um no not right now right  right well we just moved down here we used to live up in Seattle   shes out   for for a couple years   so youre still trying to dry out   its  its no problem here  yeah we really liked it up there but then when
