        okay Jim um can you tell me a little bit about your opinions on capital punishment   uh the bottom line that i after four years of working with the state prison system ive come to the conclusion if youre going to give the man the death sentence go ahead and fulfill the sentence understandably the Supreme Court says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody they get a one appeal once that appeal fails within thirty days execute sentence if youre going to give the man the death sentence dont keep the guy on death row for eight nine ten years and make him worry about it   yeah   plus costing the taxpayers twenty five thousand dollars a year just to keep the guy locked up   well youve youve got a point there but um do you think one appeal is is too stringent   no i do not think one appeal is everybodys entitled to one appeal   okay now um what do you think about about the death penalty itself do you think that we should have a death penalty   absolutely and i wish they would exercise it more thoroughly let the punishment fit the crime in this state weve got a very weird situation going on were under federal supervision and i agree to a point i agree with how the system works in some respects in other ways i dont for first time offenders everybodys entitled to screw up once well give them the early release credits well give them the good time credits well give them the early parole second trip down whether its for the same crime or totally separate one you serve your sentence day for day third trip down this is where my views on it goes way far beyond what the law states third trip down if its for the same offense or for a totally different one this individual has proven that he does not want to conform to the rules of society so you kill him period end of story   yeah well i kind of think were too lenient number one now i work in Massachusetts but i live in Rhode Island so the the legislature just come out and said that because of what with treating the prisoners socalled brutally because uh the state prisons overcrowded we have to release them so they took the offenders with the the minor crimes and they let them go they didnt have to serve the rest of their term and which is absolutely incredible um i think number one my opinion is that the judges are too lenient but yet you get some of the jury trials and and it comes down to the nitty gritty when people are ready to condemn a person they always kind of forgive him a little bit nobody wants to put the finger on somebody and say well thats it you know were going to kill you so its got to be up to the judges i think we need we have to put into place judges that are stricter than the ones that are in there now and the other thing is im not sure about Texas but like in Rhode Island if someone breaks into your home you have to do your utmost to leave so you cant cause a confrontation with that person you cant shoot him you cant do anything with him im not sure what Texas is   uh Texas has got it rigged to where i cant shoot the guy can enter my property and i cant shoot him but once hes physically inside my house uh the law reads to where you can defend yourself if you feel your life is being threatened yeah at two oclock in the morning if somebodys in my living room i feel real threatened so im going to come out with guns blazing   yeah its yeah and ours yeah and see in our case its you have to you have to exit you have to leave and if you have to leave your home to get away from this individual thats what you should do so what choice have you got you know as far as as far as our laws go up here   well the the legal system in this country has gone to such extreme measures theyve swung so far away from   yeah youre fading   there there is no such thing as justice in this   youre fading away Jim   country anymore we only have situation ethics i said yeah the guy robs the liquor store and yeah he shot the owner but he was under the influence of narcotics   huh   that that should make absolute zero difference you shot the guy you get the death penalty period   that doesnt make any right right and so he was under the influence of narcotics at that time when when the act was was performed but he knows hes going to go back and do the same thing over again you know when hes straight so socalled so people like that any one i believe you if you murder someone i believe in an eye for an eye and i think probably uh uh maybe the majority of the people do at least the people that uh that i talk to you go out there and you kill somebody you rob a gas station or a drug store and you shoot somebody you deserve to be killed also   that should be automatic death penalty no if ands or buts   right right um youre subject to one appeal i i kind of dont agree with you on that i think probably you should have at least two appeals   but thats whats got our system bogged down so bad now theyve appealed everything to where if theyve got one typographical error where in their in one line instead of spelling theyve got one word misspelled i mean its a very minor clerical error they couldnt tell they theyll appeal the hell out of that and that just throws another wrench and it takes two years to work an appeal   yeah thats yeah right common sense has to has to set in some place its just like uh  uh organized crime now they know all these people they know that the the leaders of organized crime and all that sort of stuff why cant they do something about it because they cant if they if they tape something they cant they cant bring it into the court as as evidence and they know they just had this uh i dont know if its been in your newspapers but um the guy that got out of prison here to go to a mafia um swearing in ceremony and they got uh uh somebody and im not sure who who it was what organization what law enforcement agency they got a movable bug a a a court order for a movable bug which means that you can take it any place and put it any where   uhhuh   and now theyre contesting that movable bug because they didnt state that they were going to put it in this particular home where this meeting took place so theres a technicality there but they know outright that these people are murderers and whatever else you got and yet theyre not going to let that evidence in you know as admissible evidence in court so that has to be looked at too um i dont know who theyre protecting theyre not protecting the innocent thats for sure   since so people that came up with the laws that made all these loopholes and technicalities take a look at your congressmen and senators youll find that the vast majority of them are practicing lawyers   thats true thats true um selfpreservation of the species i guess right   thats it what they dont realize the time is coming and i see it coming over the horizon that the majority of American people people are getting fed up with their BS and are demanding are going to demand real justice instead of this   well the   in Texas in Texas were getting to a point where a guy gets a fifteen year sentence hes going to serve fifteen months and hes out   youre kidding   one month for one year actually assigned   because of because of what because of overcrowding or   overcrowding overcrowding   huh now the pendulums going to swing more and more people   weve gone too far to the left its fixing to come back hard right   yeah because you look at the statistics now and im sure its in your your newspapers just like it is in ours that every major city now the increase of crime is is escalating i mean there are more look at the look at the people there are being shot now i mean every day theres theres dozens of dozens of people across the nation they just get blown away for no reason you know stray bullets or California they were going out there and they were shooting and they get these guys and they dont do anything with them so i kind of i kind of agree with you im kind of you still in the in the uh prison system   yeah ive been with them for about four years now   how do you like it well   all things considered id rather be a cop on the street because once i walk inside the gates the inmates have more rights than i do say an inmate swings at me or hes raised his fist threateningly toward me ive got to let him hit me before i can hit him bac k to be justified have it called what they call a justified use of force   thats incredible   thank uh federal judge named William Wayne Justice   do you uh you carry a firearm in when youre in there   no in inside the gate i do not carry any weapon at all   nothing   nothing   not even a uh uh billy club or huh whats the purpose of that so they cant take it   so they cant take it away from you   yeah well i dont know so you going to make a career out of it   i seriously doubt it       oh it it it all boiled down to when the opening for this came up it was the best deal going it was paying so much more money than what i was making before i couldnt turn it down   oh okay is it uh was it uh civil service   uh actually really really
