                                 The Wild West            American history is widelyinterpreted as the preeminent refutation of Karl Marxs social and politicaltheories Ironically though it was in the United States between  and that something very close to Marxs vision of class warfareunfoldednot as Marx might have predicted in the nations industrial centersor financial capitals but in the mining

deportations and crush strikeswith National Guardsmenusing what Commons and his associates called all theparaphernalia of dictatorship            While writing Big Trouble  the late PulitzerPrizewinner J Anthony Lukas who took his own life in June this year mayhave sensed that readers in the conservative s would resist being remindedabout these ferocious longago American upheavals Lukas penchant for epichad served him well in Common Ground  his account of racial turmoil inBoston during the s and s But by all reports he was depressed aboutthe prospects for a large tome about American class conflict            The UnitedStates after all has been blessed we are constantly told with a dynamicegalitarian sort of capitalism one that has always rewarded individualinitiative and confounded class distinctions Lukas book runs afoul of thisconventional wisdom in two ways first by describing a world as Woody Westcomplains in a dismissive review of Big Trouble for the WeeklyStandard  in which there was no middle term between plutocrats and wageslaves and second by appearing to ignore what West contends is the mostremarkable fact of the capital consolidation of those years especially in theWest the permeable nature of class in America Lukas knew better about suchpreWorld War I hellholes as the Coeur dAlenes district of Idaho or CrippleCreek and Leadville in Colorado or the Comstock mines of Nevada as describedby one Eliot Lord            View their workDescending from the surface in shaftcages they enter narrow galleries wherethe air is scarce respirable By the dim light of their lanterns a dingy rocksurface braced by rotting props is visible The stenches of decayingvegetable matter hot foul water and human excretions intensify the effects ofthe heat The men throw off their clothes  Only a light breechcloth coverstheir hips and thicksoled shoes protect their feet from the scorching rocksand steaming rills of water            In tellingof these American places Lukas had to challenge some powerful reassuring mythsabout our past            He decided to focus on a particular story themurder in  of Idahos former Democratic governor yearold FrankSteunenberg Considered a moderate on labor issues Steunenberg had beenelected governor by a wide margin in  with the support of the Populistsand organized labor Three years later however Steunenberg approved thedeployment of black troops and the use of preventive detention bull pens tosquelch labor unrest in the Coeur dAlenes mining camps Denied reelection in he retired to his hometown of Caldwell about  miles west of Boiseforgotten by most of his fellow Idahoansbut not by the aggrieved miners Onthe evening of Dec   as he walked through his front gate a bomb blastblew him to pieces Idaho officials immediately suspected that militant minerswere responsible            The jobof investigating the murder fell to the celebrated Pinkerton detective JamesMcParland who had broken up the notorious Molly Maguire labor terrorist groupsin the anthracite fields of Pennsylvania  years earlier In CaldwellMcParland quickly apprehended a drifter and sometime associate of various unionminers who called himself Harry Orchard In Orchards hotel room policediscovered materials for rigging up a bomb After prolonged coaxing byMcParland Orchard confessed to Steunenbergs murderand with the clearimpression that he could save his own neck by naming others he went on toimplicate three executives of the Denverbased Western Federation of Minersone of whom William D Big Bill Haywood had cofounded an even morenotorious organization the Industrial Workers of the World            The arrest of Haywood and the others in Colorado and theirremoval on a secret train to Idaho in what amounted to a legal kidnappingbrought an outraged response from such relatively conservative labor leaders asSamuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor as well as from suchradicals as the socialist leader Eugene Debs The defense in turn acquiredthe services of the nations most famous lawyer Clarence Darrow And after ayear and a half of legal wrangling and nationwide protest demonstrationsfollowed by a threemonth trial Darrow won an acquittal for Haywood mainly onthe grounds that Orchards testimony was unreliable A few months lateranother jury acquitted one of the other WFM men and charges against the thirdwere then dropped Only the wretched Orchard wound up getting convicted andfollowing the commutation of his death sentence he spent the rest of his lifein an Idaho penitentiary            Its easyto see what drew Lukas to the Steunenberg episode a tale of murder that isstill shrouded in mystery along with a longforgotten cause               clbre populated by such largerthanlife characters as HaywoodDarrow and McParland all wrapped around a history lesson about the classbitterness of a century ago Indeed Lukas was so drawn to the story and itsdetails that he sometimes seems to have lost his bearings trying to readsignificance into every little shard of information that his research haduncovered            As a result of these huge authorial effortsBig Trouble is bigger than it had to be It includes long digressions onsubjects ranging from the European origins of private detective work to thegradings along the circuitous railroad route from Denver to Boise The majorcharacters receive ample biographical treatments but so do dozens of otherfigures famous and obscure who had only fleeting links to Lukas story Thebook certainly rewards readers whenever it returns to the main story Lukasmastery of historical events and contexts and his ability to dramatize themwas acute But it is a shame in an age of blockbuster publishing that Lukaseditors either did not or could not prevail upon him to lighten up on himselfand on his audience            Historians may also questionwhether the Steunenberg affair on its own touched off in Lukas words astruggle for the soul of America To be sure the larger industrial conflictsof the period amounted to such a struggle And to his credit Lukas for allhis obvious sympathies with the workers was scrupulous in assessing the eventssurrounding the murder In his epilogue he offered compelling albeitcircumstantial bits of evidence that strongly suggest that Haywood and theothers actually were involved in an assassination plot But Lukas never fullyclarified why Steunenbergs murder and its aftermath were as pivotal as hissubtitle implies they were In fact the immediate result of the trials was towiden the breach between Haywood who became increasingly radical and his morecautious WFM associates who wound up pulling back from the revolutionary IWWIn this sense Lukas story may have been important as part of the struggleover the future of organized labor but less so as a struggle over Americassoul at least when compared with the truly momentous Homestead and Pullmanstrikes of the s the Triangle Shirt Waist Co fire of  or any of theother more familiar set pieces of turnofthecentury labor history            Still it is the rare authorwho can recreate with so much passion and exactness aspects of our historythat most Americans would just as soon forget Anyone who knew Tony Lukas evenslightly was deeply impressed by his boundless openminded curiosity about theinjustices of modern life along with his stubborn reportorial integrity aboutgetting to the very bottom of any story as best he could Its flaws asideBig Trouble is a brave book that exhibits those qualities bounteouslyAnd so its tale is truly tragic
