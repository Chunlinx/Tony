                                 Sambo Returns            It only took a few days ofnational publicity to force a North Carolina college to cancel a course on thetheme that American slaves were happy on the plantation But this idea ispopping up elsewhere not just among the conservative defenders of the OldSouth but even on the left            EdwardBall a scion of slave owners won a National Book Award last week forSlaves in the Family  a sentimental genealogy of his clan The bookexudes what Arthur Schlesinger Jr once called doughface liberalism Ballmarvels that he may possess thousands of

journey of selfdiscovery            Meanwhile new DNA evidence strongly indicates that ThomasJefferson did indeed father children by his slave Sally Hemings BecauseHemings was the halfsister of Jeffersons deceased wife and because theirrelationship may have lasted decades the story has taken on a romanticcoloration Historian Eric Foner mocks that it is as if he and Sally were akind of Romeo and Juliet starcrossed lovers doomed by an inflexiblesociety            Thecollege course was titled North Carolina in the War for SouthernIndependence Thats the Civil War to yall At Randolph Community Collegein Archdale NC members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans have beenteaching as the Associated Press reported that most slaves were happy incaptivity and that many served as loyal Southern soldiers According to oneinstructor These people ie the slaves loved the South They werentlooking for some Yankees to come down here and save them            Any historian can tell you that much of theSunny Slavery Scenario is nonsense Few slaves fought for the Confederacythough  former slaves fought for the North  And slaves did wantthe Union army to free them As Leon Litwack recounts in his copiouslyresearched Been in the Storm So Long  they rejoiced to the skies whentroops arrived to liberate them They considered it a deliverance of biblicalproportions            Still leave aside thecourse which was canceled last Thursday after protests from the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People We would neverintentionally set up any class that is offensive to anyone in our community and obviously this class has done that the colleges president said Whatwas the true character of bondage in the American South On thatquestion historians have never agreed Opinions have shifted with theprevailing political and cultural winds and the issue remains alive            For thisthe left is as responsible as the right Confederate enthusiasts have made freeuse of liberal arguments for academic freedom tolerance and multiculturalismThey say they are just exercising their right to teach their version of eventsEverybody can celebrate their culture but we cant groused another courseinstructor Leftwing scholars have also done the most work to refute the viewof slavery as a crippling experience            Alittle historiography is in order Not so long ago theRandolph Community College view of slaves as happy in their bondagesmilingsinging Samboswas the dominant view even among experts The experts ofcourse were whites who in general believed themselves innately superior toblacks Led by the Southernborn Ulrich Phillips whose American NegroSlavery  was the standard work in the field for decades leadingacademic historians portrayed slavery as a benevolent paternalisticinstitution that benefited blacks by civilizing them In this view it waswhites who suffered under the slave system since before the Civil War slaveryhad become far less profitable than the Norths capitalist labor arrangementsYet slave owners selflessly bore this burden so their slaves could enjoycontinued care and goodwill            It wasntuntil  when Kenneth Stampp published The Peculiar Institution  thatthe historical professionand the textbooks that take their cues fromitseriously revised the picture of bondage Besides cataloging thebrutalities of slave owners Stampp showed that slaves actually did notappreciate the experience He noted their rebelliousness their efforts to riseup and throw off their shackles the ways they cagily resisted their workrequirements the lengths they went to in feigning contentment to eludeharsh treatment from their masters The happy Sambo Stampp claimed was just aruse            Three years later Stanley Elkins published theequally monumental Slavery  Though a liberal like Stampp Elkinsaccepted the notion of the docile contented Sambothough hardly as evidenceof slaverys mildness Influenced by the psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheimsresearch showing that the Nazi concentration camps infantilized theirinmates Elkins argued that the closed system of slavery was so cruel andallencompassing that none but the most stouthearted could survive withouttheir wills being broken or their psyches damaged Liberal social scientistslatched onto Elkins theory as a rationale for creating policies to tear downthe barriers that were impeding black advancement in the s            Thesociologist Nathan Glazer reviewed Slavery for Commentary andgave a copy to his friend Daniel Patrick Moynihan then an aide to PresidentLyndon Johnson In  came the famous Moynihan report on the condition ofblack families Influenced by Elkins Moynihan suggested that slaveryand thebarriers to male employment imposed by Jim Crowhad instilled inAfricanAmerican culture such recurring features as broken families andillegitimacy He called for governmental action to undo the damage            Next leftwing historians rose up to defend black cultureagainst Moynihans characterizations In doing so they partly absolvedslavery Herbert Gutmans The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom  showed that slave families while often broken up whenmembers were sold or assigned to different plantations were remarkablymonogamous and stable In  the radical historian Eugene Genovese who hassince become a Catholic conservative published Roll Jordan Roll TheWorld the Slaves Made  Now a staple in college history courses RollJordan Roll painted a picture of slaves not as mere victims of oppressionbut as creators of a vibrant life While obviously constrained by theirbondage blacks nonetheless forged a culture rich with religious observancesfolk tales family traditions song and so on Genovese transformed the debateby making slaves at long last central and even powerful players in shapingtheir own lives            Many on the left thrilled tothis portrait Neither Genovese nor Gutman would ever argue like the Sons ofConfederate Veterans that slaves were happy in their condition as slaves Butthey might agree that slaves were sometimes happy despite theircondition as slaves And its here that the New Lefts scrupulous scholarshipinadvertently dovetails with the rights racist interpretations Thanks toGutman Genovese and their leftwing peers we now know that the notion thatSlaves Were Happy as the New York Times headline put it is notnecessarily false            In the early decades of thiscentury when racist views were the norm Phillips picture of slavery asbenevolent institution held sway In  Stampps view of slaves as beingjust like whites except for their subjugation reflected the tenets of postwarliberalism In the era of black power New Left assertions that slaves madetheir own lives resonated loudly Today we have a therapeutic culture Thepresident champions a touchyfeely national conversation on race defendersof the Confederacy just want to tell their side of the story school officialsworry about offending the community and Ed Ball inspired by the confirmationof shared blood wants to use his book profits to fund interracial dialogueSlavery has returned as little more than a failure to communicate
