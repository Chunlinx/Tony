        okay well what do you think do you   well im kind of leaning towards i dont know im thinking about what from one to ten what my number would be itd probably be somewhere closer to uh less control because i dont see im not a member of the NRA although my father is but   uhhuh   i i guess i believe i i think the NRA has gone overboard the wrong way you know theyre sitting there on number ten saying theyre saying absolutely no gun control we dont even want to think about it and   yeah   and i think thats a dumb situation because there has got to be some kind of background check to see that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose you know if if if youre going to hunt with it if youre going to do sport shooting you can wait a week   yeah umhum right thats true   its not a big deal for them to go if they can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket you know i mean they should be able to go back and find out if youve had any kind of psychiatric record armed you know felony record you know   right thats true   any of that kind of stuff and it seems to me right now that theres not theres not that much of a check i im not really sure what Texas law i think theres a check for felonies for felonies on your record if the gun shop owner does it you know but   right but umhum yeah but he has to go out and do it thats true i think that   yeah if you and if its a private sale of course then theres nothing   right and see thats my only problem with uh making you um you know get the check and everything is is i guess bad guys if you want to call them bad guys they are going to get a gun no matter what   umhum   theyre not i dont think theyre going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when theres a check i think theyre going to go out and find it someway individual sale or something like that   yes but but maybe well prevent a few John Hinkleys   yeah i hope thats true   you know i i thats thats the kind of people i like i say i dont think the guy whos going to rob a Eleven is going to rob a Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife baseball bat or you know whatever   yeah right knives exactly hes going to do what he wants to do thats true i i just think it makes the honest people more honest and   but you know yeah and and the people who want it its not that big a deal like i said to wait   right right and if you have to have it in a hurry somethings wrong   yeah yeah it makes you wonder what they need it for all of a sudden here hum   thats right thats right well im married to a policeman so we we talk about this a lot   yeah i imagine i imagine his his opinion is a little bit towards the one there on the scale of one to ten he needs some more gosh if i was a cop id be   yeah yeah yeah i was watching a worried about that   too many people have too many too much access   yeah they do they do   and i i guess i think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of gun i mean       some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put out that are a piece of i mean theyre theyre basically it says here buy me and go rob a Eleven thats   right right or even even the um the little um toy guns look real i mean ive heard so much about that on TV and thats kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one   yes they thats really gotten bad or your child accidently if your child is old enough to i mean therere a lot of kids who when theyre ten look like theyre twelve or fourteen or   yeah yeah right   and and especially some of the minority children whether you know a racist or not thats the truth and and if some of them are doing something that they shouldnt be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands and a cop comes up   umhum right i mean you cant blame them it looks like theyve got a weapon   you cant jeez  jeez and you cant take the chances the   thats right   because theres been kids that age who have killed people and you know you know there was a law in   exactly   i think its in Oregon where theyve now made all toy guns theyre theyre making them like neon colors you know yeah and the kids dont care my kid doesnt care he picks up a stick and goes bang so it doesnt make any difference to him   right and i think thats a good idea thats right i know right right a guns a gun to them they can play with anything make it a gun thats exactly right   yeah yeah so you ought to do i think they ought to do that with toy guns they ought to make them very reasonably do something outrageous to them you know so that theyre not so that theyre very distinguishable from a real gun   right right exactly thats right thats a good idea well i was uh watching TV yesterday and theres a town in Georgia   yes   and its the law that you have a gun every adult you know uh is able to carry a gun and and they encourage it yeah and the police love it which really surprised me and i and i think and thats what they were going after um   thats kind of they encourage it hum   they went to interview this town i mean its a little dinky town they went to interview them about the gun control laws and uh the police said you all the people said thats fine we care less you know were all honest and everything like that we we all carry them but we we dont mind being checked and uh and i think it kind of took that um   hum   neatness away from it you know like well heck everybodys got one you know and   i dont know i   so it was it was it was quite unusual to see the people in that town   thats kind of an odd thing i dont know i have a gun and i mean my folks have always had i learned to shoot when i was real little i think thats a lot of it too is that people   umhum   need to teach their kids what not to what to do and what not to do because i started shooting my dad   right exactly   started letting me shoot like a little air BB gun when i was probably five or six years old but   umhum yeah   you know it was this is how you hold it this is the only place that you do it which was you know out far and away and you dont ever touch it unless im here and you dont point it at at people and then they had then i went to the Texas   right thats what were doing exactly   Parks and Recreation i guess but anyway the safety hunter safety program that you have to do now i think it started in about nineteen seventy if you want if you want to go deer hunting and your birthdays after   oh yeah oh   nineteen something fifty five or something then you have to go attend one of these hunter safety courses or you cant get a deer license   umhum well thats neat well thats real neat   and it and its basic stuff its like its dont you know when youre climbi ng over a barbed wire fence dont point you dont lean your gun against it you know and you and then you crawl over it and have it shoot yourself and uh it   yeah right well thats real good   those things happen it it it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people   right right and its and they usually are real basic   yeah put the safety on the gun dont assume always assume its loaded thats thats got to be the most common thing that people yeah its oh its empty its empty boom you know   common sense things i know and people dont want to believe that yeah it was fair i took the clip out or whatever and   yeah and i forgot about the one in the chamber  oh   in the chamber  thats exactly right yeah well we were trying to teach our daughter she knows real well about um about her daddys guns what not to do and what to do around them   oh yeah does he got them locked up all the time too when hes home   yeah um and and and she and shes real um and shell know shell even tell her little friends dont ever you know touch my daddys guns or something like that so shes real shes real good about it and shes never been curious   dont even think about it yeah yeah hum   i mean because hes always you know if hes has them out cleaning them you know she can be there and hell tell her how hes doing it or you know show her the insides and stuff like that   umhum yeah if you make it where its not something   to be feared and   curious yeah not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared of if it if its just one more piece of something but but theyve got to understand like you said never touch it but yeah   right exactly right they have to have that respect for what it does and what it can do   ours is a we have a shotgun and its up in the closet   umhum   and then the shells are in another part and its sometimes i think about it and and i got it because my husband used to travel and be out of he was out of country one time for three months   oh yeah   and i was like uh you know were in a nice neighborhood but still and you and then ive got it so far sometimes i think i i wonder if i   still   im not about to load it because i you know i assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there and its in a case and its you know its put up and its away and all that but i dont want to take the chance and i think if somebody ever does break in its going to take me a year to find the shells and then get it  dont come in the   umhum right hes got to go to a lot of trouble yeah hold on hold on  its in here somewhere i know it is yeah well i know i know how to use them we go we go hunting every once in a while and he showed me how to use his guns and i really enjoy it but   hum   boy if someone did break in i dont i dont know that i could or would even grab it   i know i i used to think about that it was a lot easier when i was when i was when i was single it was one thing and when i was married just married with no kids when it was just me   umhum thats true   it was an easy decision   yeah yeah   it was like you you come after me youre going to get it  you know and now theres so many other things where are the kids what are they doing you know where is this person coming in from uh youve got and and if if you if you manage to get it out   yeah right yes right   and then you know what how how can you even afford to to think about what what youre going to do with it because you dont know where your kids are at the same time ugh   true true well we have dogs that are pretty very protective so if theyre if theyre stupid yeah if theyre stupid enough to come through then   yeah we do too yeah i figure theyll make enough noise but yeah its its i kind of think we we have two big dogs in the backyard i always kind of thought that too kind of an extra buffer   yeah yeah theyve got to be pretty stupid and and most people uh uh that uh break in or whatever go to houses without the dogs luckily   yeah anything that the well any any advantage they can take   right and thats one of them so well   unfortunately yeah guess it makes them worth the dog food over the years   yeah yeah really does well do you think weve   yeah i i think thats about all i can   me too on gun control   were were in pretty good agreement actually on it it would be an interesting it would be even more interesting you you to to meet some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum thats opposite   yeah i think we are right right but im glad youre not so   me too its nice to find theres another reasonable person in Garland well its been nice talking to you byebye   right  well good you too thanks byebye
