                                 Wretched Excess                        Guess what Light Years is the one I meant            Heres what I wonder about the Peter Unger thing you do mean Peter Ungerdont you Is it true I mean is it true that if I buy a blouse Im notsaving a child Isnt it possible that if we all stop buying things all sortsof people who currently arent starving to death will suddenly be out of workand will soon be starving to death Just asking Its questions like that thathelp me deal with the guilt            The Tierney piece this morning was a disappointment to me because althoughI can never read enough about the DuffPerelman divorce I didnt find PeterUnger particularly interesting on the subject Its a fascinating case thoughShes Undine Spragg all over again a true Wharton creation Ive beenfascinated by her for yearswhen she was married to Mike Medavoy inHollywood she suffered greatly and neurasthenically having to make do on hispathetic  million a year salary no welfare mother had as hard a time I canassure you They built a grand house with a budget that mushroomed beyond theirmeans and when it was finally finished alas there was no money to furnishit The stress from it all caused her to contract EpsteinBarr a disease I hadbelieved in up until that point This experiencelife in a furnitureless homewhich reminds me somehow of the famous Julie Christiealoneonthebalconyscene in Darling explains to me at least why Duff is asking for somuch money to decorate the apartment she wants Perelman to buy heralthough Iwas interested to read an interview in the New York Post with severaldecorators who said her budget was if anything low            Anyway I dont think theres the remotest chance that liberalism theliberalism I grew up with welfarestate stuff etc is on the verge of acomeback and theres even less chance that anyone will stop spending money inthe flamboyant and careless manner thats become commonplace One of the thingsthat has always fascinated me is the example of Saul and Gayfryd Steinberg whospent their money so extravagantly and publicly in New York in the s andwere practically stoned for it Theyd broken a kind of tacit agreement aboutbehavior among rich people the people who would never drive anything but astation wagon and they had to be made to pay Now of course everyone breaksthe agreementnot just in Hollywood but even in Seattle viz Bill GatesWhen someone like Pat Duff comes along she provides everyone with a fabulousexcuse to feel morally superior And everyone is right to feel that waybecause her arguments are genuinely disgusting but its all part of an era ofwretched excess that were all part of and that I cant imagine is going tocome to an end any time soon            Your question about screenwriters reminds me of the first or second time Idid a screenplay for a studio and had to sign the thing they send you called aCertificate of Authorship I took it to the bank to have it notarized and gailysigned it The notary at the bank looked at it Did you read this he said Notreally I said This says he said that the studio is the author of yourscript I was astonished In any case these days if you write an originalscreenplay for a studio and they dont make a movie from it you get it backfree after I think five years The Writers Guild won that one about  yearsago But of course you dont get it back if it was someone elses idea or iftheyve kept it active by ploughing more money into it etc            Tomorrow can we talk about Hillary
