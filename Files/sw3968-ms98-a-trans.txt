                okay   all right thats a real different topic im not sure im familiar with with what they mean of invasion of privacy   i know i guess that i guess you consider just things that every day that would youd think of about see im a college student so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me   yeah   you know that i thinks like is an invasion of my privacy stuff like that but i think itd be it is kind of a tough topic   yeah i think personally you know im im i used to be a college student ten years ago but  uh now i think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and says Mrs Miller have we got a deal for you   oh gosh youre like no you dont no   its like how do you know my name where did you get my phone number and why do you think its a deal for me   uhhuh   i mean those people theyll call you any time of the day or night with try to solicit and thats an invasion of my privacy i think   yeah they call late now i mean now theres i heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or something   oh they do already   see thats ridiculous i would be so mad   well and ive even had the computer generated calls on Sundays too   really   umhum   huh   but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls     huh   dont answer your phone hello the computers geared to to start talking to you on the on the word hello     really huh i dont know id think like things that that i thinks like privacy is like just like not going through my stuff but like going through just like my clothes or my drawer just going through my stuff basically   uhhuh   oh yeah oh yeah   that drives me up a wall   are you and your roommate a similar size   no see were not and uh   and she still goes through your clothes   yeah shell take all my shirts and stuff because she cant wear like my pants but shell take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff   uhhuh ooh   man im just glad she cant wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses you know   oh yeah   but still shell just take them and she wont even think about it and then ill like see her that day and shell be wearing my clothes and ill be like you know i dont like to borrow my clothes out you know i really dont   uhhuh   so i prefer that you just not go in and get them because she doesnt even ask me   uhhuh   stuff like that really  like thats an invasion of my privacy i feel like   oh yeah i agree   stuff like that when you have your door closed people just walking in and stuff like that   umhum   i was thinking like my mom i know this she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy is like going through her purse like if you ever needed money and stuff we always just give her her purse you know and shell get it out or whatever   oh yeah yeah uhhuh   i was trying to think i was thinking thats the only thing i could really think of that would really be   my mom doesnt even like for us to go through her cabinets   really   i mean were all grown all her kids are grown and we have our own families and now if we go through her cabinets shes like well what are you digging for   uhhuh yeah get out of my cabinets   yeah like what are you doing dont you have your own house to dig through   thats great   yeah so i guess that privacy is really and at the work place i suppose oh well actually yes i can say definitely privacy at the work place i hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk     uhhuh see yeah   because that was that was where i kept all my stuff and i could tell i mean even if a pen was turned the wrong way oh yeah   you could tell you know you put your stuff where its yeah that would drive that would that   it would drive it drove me batty for a while yeah well i worked a second shift   really uhhuh   and everybody else in my area worked first shift and our shifts overlapped   uhhuh uhhuh   so i would come in and there would be people sitting at my desk working and im wondering you know um what is this  its my vitamins i wonder what is you know yeah what is why are they working at my desk and can i have it back   yeah   can i have it back soon maybe   then you start missing stuff and   oh yeah  no mommy is going to take the vitamins im sorry i have a small person   thats okay     yeah   see that would that would make me really mad because you can always tell when someones touched your stuff just because i mean i know i have everything like a certain way     switchboard call   and you know how it looks and everything     oh yeah well you know how you left it the day before   uhhuh that would bother me definitely   oh yeah so thats   yeah i agree its its pretty tough that way and i know even like with your school books and paper   uhhuh   do you miss your papers sometimes   see yeah   uhhuh  huh   you just know thats the only thing i can really think about being an invasion of privacy like something every day though   yeah well actually i do know and i have used it once and it it really is an invasion of privacy but   uhhuh   in the library theres a book that you can find out what peoples phone numbers are by where they live by their street address yeah   oh really uhhuh   and that i mean ive ive used it once
