tosquelch despair that his lovers fling themselves into each others arms Greinis the central consciousness of the book a man who once a brilliant Talmudscholar in Poland and then a student of secular

which is expressed internally in a jumbleof Yiddish and Polish and English and Hebrew Singer is very good at evokingthe palimpsest imprints of his characters layered lives in a way that givesthem more modernist complexity than his rather conventional conception ofcharacter and plot might otherwise have allowed for            He isalso good at making their highly personal adventures seem the outgrowth ofhistorical and metaphysical circumstances Singers decision to set his novelin  allows the book to spin on a historical axisthe aftermath of theHolocaust the creation of the state of Israel the birth of the Cold War TheHolocaust for instance does not simply inspire the characters largedespairing gestures it filters into their casual foreplay Do you rememberhow we once turned on the gas

wealthy mancame on the scene and I ruined her In those days I wanted to ruin everythingIt was a sort of an ambition with me This is a man who seeing a full moonrise beautifully in the sky feels moved to announce Oh if only I could pissall over it That God himself might be a Nazi is a thought that severalcharacters comfortably entertain            It would be wrong to see inall this merely the warping effects of the Holocaust Singer is chroniclingsomething larger and more complicated than that Most of his charactersdespite Orthodox childhoods began their rebellion against God before World WarII in the s and s when Jews were stepping out of shtetl culturefor the first time in a thousand years This was true of Singer himself whohas a good deal in common with his hero Grein The Holocaust merely added ahorrible twist to their rebellion Ernest Jones Freuds English biographerfamously observed that Hamlet wishing his father dead was unable to survivehis fathers actual murder because he was so crippled by guilt In other wordsthe princes real tragedy was that somebody fulfilled his fantasy for him Onemight say something similar about Singers characters Having rebelled in theiryouth against Judaisms commandments having come to revile itsrestrictionshaving in some sense wished it deadthey were forced to watchthe Nazis fulfill their fantasy by actually murdering the thing whosedestruction they inwardly willed No wonder so many of them feel implicated inevil            This peculiar double deathadds anguish and guilty energy to the book Grein has the fundamentalism of thefallen Orthodox He sees only the faith of his father or a full embrace of sinHe cannot believe in a middle way Ultimately he becomes a penitent fleeinghis sexual entanglements his family his responsibilities and taking uprefuge in Palestine This stab at return is both unconvincing and at the sametime what makes Singer and this novel so interesting For what Grein comes toresemble in his selfish flight from the past from responsibility from moralchoices is nothing so much as a Yiddish Huckleberry Finn He isnt going backto Palestine hes lighting out for new territory He has become an American atlast
