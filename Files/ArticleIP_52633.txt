                              DearPrudie                                                      My friends and I regularly read your column andjust love it Shameless flattery aside we do have an issue and hope you canhelp us My brotherinlaw is in a serious relationship with a friend of mineI actually introduced them at my wedding The problem is that my friend treatsmy brotherinlaw and everyone else for that matter like dirt She yells athim tells him what to do what to wear where to go and how to spend his freetime She is moody and extremely unpleasant to everyone Needless to say Idont see much of her anymore Anyway we are afraid that my poorbrotherinlaw who does not have the benefit of very much experience inrelationships will ask her to marry him                                       My family myhusbands family and our friends cannot stand her and dread having her atfamily gatheringsto the point where we are all trying to figure out how notto invite her to Thanksgiving or Christmas In short we want to say somethingto him because we know that there are women out there who will treat him withrespect courtesy and affection How can we tell him how we feel withoutmaking him feel totally alienated                                       Hopeful in Va                        Dear Hope            Perhaps your brotherinlaw views being emotionallyslapped around as foreplay The woman you describe sounds like a cross betweena harridan and a dominatrix However even an inexperienced man knows when heis being treated like a dog in obedience school Prudie wonders why he thinksthis is all right The loose thread here is that you say you dont see much ofher anymore but she was a friend Did her behavior change            In any case since yourbrotherinlaws nearest and dearest want to keep Miss Congeniality away fromholiday gatherings Prudie suggests you and your coterie of concerned friendsdecide on a designated yenta which is how it may be perceived and that personmust tell him flat out that people who care about him do not like the way he isbeing treated and they see dark days ahead He will either respond with adefense of his PMS poster girl or confess that he is trying to end therelationship Either way he will be made aware of the concern which is reallyall that outsiders can do If he chooses to stay in the relationship and thenext gathering is a nightmare simply tell him the woman makes for too muchdiscomfort and although you will miss his presence the greater good of thegroup takes precedence and not to plan on further gettogethers Worst casescenario is that he will feel alienated and his relationship with allof you will be strained  but just as friends dont let friends drive drunkneither do friends watch in silence as friends hook up with bitches            Prudie directly                                             DearPrudence                                                      My mother who is a charming woman in almostall other respects appears to have a grave problem staying employed There isa definite pattern afoot here At first the new job is wonderful the peoplescintillating and fabulous the work enticing and exciting After a few monthstrouble begins to brewinvariably with her supervisor What follows is less aslide down a slippery slope than a professional avalanche that results ineither a dismissal or a narrow escape to the next dream job where ofcourse the cycle repeats yet again                                       It is screamingly obvious to everyone who knowsand loves her that the trouble lies with my mother and not as she would haveit with the parade of horrible bosses fate has saddled her with Needles tosay as I write this letter she is about to lose another job She is  Ihave tried gently to suggest therapy Ive sympathized and logged hours andhours on the telephone listening to every sordid detail of every office slightall to no avail I have even considered appealing to her current employer withwhom I have a warm acquaintance to overlook her nuttiness and keep her onbecause despite her Sturm und Drang office manner she really is verygood at what she does                                       I admit a good dealof my concern is selfmotivated With a modest income of my own and twochildren to provide for I fear if she loses this job it will be her lastleaving me to support herand I know in advance that I cant let her end up ina welfare hotel But her chances for finding a replacement gig dwindle withevery lost job and every looming birthday I would prefer to be my mothersdaughter than my mothers mother but my resentment is building every dayPrudie what to do                                       Distraught Daughter                        Dear Dis            What a thoughtful insightful letter While at somepoint all grownup children become to a greater or lesser degree parents totheir parents your situation is complicated by at best a personalitydisorder and at worst mental illness Your mothers repeated manic initialresponse to a job then making a mess of it is legitimate cause for concernWhat you must do now is confront your mother with the truth as tactfully andforcefully as possible Make clear that you are willing to be emotionallysupportive if she makes efforts to help herself but that financially you areunable to have her as a dependent            For your own emotionalwellbeing know that the worst case scenario may involve distancing yourselfif she will not acknowledge her problem If she winds up in the systemgetting city or state supervised housing and therapy that may not be a badthing This is sometimes the mentalhealth equivalent of an alcoholic hittingbottom You should also know that your evaluation of the situation is humaneand loving and that however things play out you will have been a good andcaring daughter            Prudie supportively                                             Prudence                                                      Although one maydisagree with the hamfisted way in which smokers were evicted fromrestaurants people like me with sensitive noses appreciate the result It tookyears for me to work up the courage to ask someone not to smoke near me andnow I dont have to do that anymore But a new terror has arisen Recently ina crowded but fancy restaurant in the middle of the delicious main course theempty table next to ours was occupied by a group of people including a womanwearing far too much perfume It was overwhelming and made it literallyimpossible to taste the food Everything tasted like perfume And then my nosestarted to run The expensive meal was ruined but I didnt say a word ShouldI have And to whom                                       Allergic and Sniffly                        Dear All            In the particular situation you write about youcould have asked the maitre d to give you another table assuming one wasavailable In the big picture however overpowering scents are a burgeoningproblem and Prudie shares your discomfort Since there is no way to instruct astrange woman to please hightail it to the ladies room and wash off all thatChanel No  or to inform people that the scent they have chosen to pour allover themselves is retchinducing those of us who are knocked out by perfumeare basically stuck Moving ones location or leaving an establishment is aboutas far as an offended party can go Some places however have designatedthemselves scentfree zones but certainly a small number This may be thewave of the future however because who would have thought  years ago thatyou couldnt light up in a restaurant            One problem withperfumes and colognes is that the wearer for some strange reason is not ableto smell when she or he has overdone it And surprise men can be as guilty aswomen Also some ethnic groups tend to go in for excessive eau de whateversometimes instead of bathing And of course there are the tchotchke shops inwhich one is overcome by potpourri incense scented candles and sachet Beingassaulted by smells unfortunately is an issue we can often do little aboutMaybe nose plugs            Prudie sympathetically                                             Prudie                                                      Regarding the letterfrom  I can tell you from experience that sisters do not take kindly to ANYadvice given them about raising their children Sitting down and having a frankdiscussion is asking to start World War III in the family Better yourcorrespondent should be the aunt these girls can go to for advice supportkind words etc Better she should do everything in her power to be a rolemodel of acceptance and love and build up these girls selfesteem at everyopportunity If they spend time alone with her so much the better As for hersister mm could express her understanding of how difficult it must be to raisethese children give her sister a chance to vent mention classes or books thatmight be helpful but never never make it personal No fingerpointing orsuperior attitudes please It never has a happy ending                                       Four Sisters of My Own                        Dear Four            Thank you for addingimmeasurably to the discussion You have firsthand knowledge of a situationwhich Prudie as an only child could not have  proving again thatexperience has great value            Prudie gratefully
