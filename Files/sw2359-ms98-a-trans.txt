                hi Mary have you gone visiting uh any new restaurants lately   hi well i havent been to any new ones but i have uh several that i frequent uh mainly because of specialties in foods and i have so many  so many foods that i prefer uh that i enjoy such as oriental foods i dont like Japanese food but i like all Chinese food   uhhuh i i tend to get stuck in in and i find a place that i like and i stay there um i  some of the things i like are atmosphere um   ah sounds familiar   food price um but mostly i think you know service and atmosphere are the two things that you know i dont minds paying little bit if if i dont have to wait too long to eat and if the service is good the food is good   yes yes   and i find like the the places that im going to now um because whenever you find a place thats good other people have already already found the same kind of a place and so sometimes i have to go to this place in uh where i know i have to wait at least fifteen minutes sometimes a half hour       and um they have little bar there so we sit there and um sipping on some mixed drinks before we get to eat   oh that sounds uh very much like one of our very very best places to get steaks   uhhuh   uh and they open at five and if your not there at five thirty youll probably have about an hour wait   wow okay So this   and they have a bar also which is always crowded as can be  but its its an specially fine restaurant and when you consider they take no plastic or checks       strictly cash and theyve been in business oh for at least forty years uh thats they   uhhuh oh they must have some good food there   yes yes it its their their steaks are exquisite they also have uh excellent uh liver which i happen to like   uhhuh   and um those are the two specialties which they have that and their stewed tomatoes which are well known all over the Dayton area   uh i had uh an opportunity to visit visit the Dallas area and uh i went to some steak houses while i was out there and there was this one place that i visited that was really unique The waitresses were dressed like little cowgirls   oh   and the i dont remember the name of the place but for a menu all they had was a it was like a wooden block   uhhuh uhhuh   and and um i think for food they had steak and beans  and they had three different sizes of steak The cowboy the cowgirl and the   right     i forget the the other one the heman or something like this and um and i i i found it uh to be very good The atmosphere was good it was a lot of fun     yes right well one of the nicer restaurants supposedly that opened up here not uh too very long ago called Harbor Lights specializes in fish   uhhuh huh   and uh the atmosphere is fantastic and i was there with its a group um that uh we were having a going away dinner for a friend and there were twelve of us and i the the food that uh we ordered each of us was quite good but the service was horrendous   oh no kidding   and the the waitress never once came behind me um um on our side of the table she reached across the table she never once asked if we wanted coffee we had to grab onto someone else they didnt     uhhuh   refill our water glasses um someone had only eaten a portion of their food and wanted to take it home and asked to have it boxed and she just pitched it out       and then when she finally did bring something um to replace that she practically threw it at the person   oh thats too bad see how one one place one person can make a big difference on whether you go back to the place again   yes and oh absolutely what made me angry was that when there are groups such as ours there were twelve of us they automatically put the tip on the bill   uhhuh wow okay   and ill tell you we had some very unhappy people who were so unhappy with the service and resented paying fifteen percent tip when they had such poor service   yeah oh thats really thats really too bad i had um one place that i enjoyed going to but my my girlfriend didnt like it and then i had asked her about it and she said um   but     that the reason why she didnt like it was that she felt that the place wasnt cleaned well um they had um younger kids you know wiping the tables down and they werent very   oh yes right right   well trained i guess and they didnt do a very neat job in cleaning the tables off and when the waitresses came they she just put all of the clean utensils and everything right on top of these dirty tables   oh  well it one thing that gets me is when you see them do putting out the um the um knives forks and what have you and when they put them down they hold them by the edge that you are going to put in your mouth     yeah right   and that really up sets me when i see that   i i can certainly understand that in fact in this same restaurant that my girlfriend doesnt like to go to she um she frequently finds food   oh   struck onto the utensils as where shes got to go through uh three or four uh different um utensils and the the the waitresses are very nice theyll theyll keep exchanging it   ah uhhuh yes but yeah   but they dont look you know like she had complained about it one time and the girl said she was sorry she picked up these utensils and and when back and grabbed some new ones and then put the new ones back down and the new ones looked worse than the ones that she took away so she is not even looking you know and   oh no no and actually you know those are the kind of things that should get taken back to the management   yeah   um because the the the waitresses have no control over the the way the dishes are and cleaned in the kitchen and if theyre not cleaned off well when they go threw the dishwasher food just doesnt always get washed off and it sticks on there and then when they dry them   thats true     um if they air dry them or heat dry them it dries it right on it and thats terrible   uhhuh yeah yeah yeah i agree the management should know about it but the waitress should especially if you ask them to take something back to look at the ones that shes uh bringing over to you instead of just grabbing a handful and bring them over again   yes i agree with that but just dont ever get a glass that has lipstick on it oh that is terrible i had that happen only once i dont remember where but its always   oh boy     one time enough for me to be aware of the situation and i look at every glass that i get   how about fast food do you enjoy um fast food restaurants   yeah i dont mind that um my husband never cared for fast food so we didnt go that often but you know i have no problem with uh going to a McDonalds or a Wendys or uh   uhhuh   a or a Long John Silvers or any of those once in a while not often but once in a while   uhhuh yeah yeah i enjoy it once in a while but i enjoy relaxing while i eat you cant really do that in these fast food places   yeah oh yeah thats thats very true now once in a while if theres a good ballgame like theres going to be tonight  with Duke and uh um Kansas City   uhhuh   uh Kansas uh cause see now i would enjoy having a pizza   uhhuh   and just sit and watch the game and a have a pizza and a beer that i would enjoy   uhhuh at a at a restaurant or at home   no no at ho me just have it delivered yeah we we have number of our pizza places deliver and i assume that you have that there also   at home oh yeah were just beginning with that it um it took one of the pizza companies and i think it was um gee Dominos   Dominos was the first one to start yes   yeah right after they started i guess the other uh businesses lost money and they all began doing the same thing   yes yes uh we have Dominos we have Pizza Hut and then we have a couple of other smallers Little Ceasars and Juans Pizza theyre all in the general facility where i live and so i can and then yet my most favorite one doesnt deliver   uhhuh we have no which one is that   uh its called Marians Pizza but i think it is local   huh   and the   yeah we have Popaginos did you ever here of Popaginos   no   okay we have a thats a fairly large chain in New England we have a a Popaginos um and they had not been delivering up until the time where uh Dominos began delivering and within a matter of six months they started up there own delivery service   umhum right yeah that makes a big difference well we have a lot of businesses going out of business uh in this area and i dont know whether its necessarily uh nationwide but many of the smaller stores grocery stores card shops uh restaurants smaller restaurants i cant compete with some of the larger ones and they are all going under   uhhuh it would seem to me that if that if i owned a business the thing that i would want to do is a is a get little survey uh like were doing with each other and and encourage people to to give that information back to the management   yes yes absolutely   and then maybe somehow turn what ever negatives around into a positive   well i um uh ive been retired from education for uh oh what eight years and i do i have a bunch of had i should say a bunch of little jobs such as a sales associate um  of womens   uhhuh   specialty dress shop and um i was a manager parttime at a card and gift shop as well as teaching in a modeling agency and modeling so   uhhuh   the card shop just went out of business weve been there almost a year almost two years but uh and the store was precious everyone liked the store they liked the kinds of cards and what have you but the location was so poor   uhhuh huh   and it was in a shopping strip that had a grocery store on one end that took them almost four years to really get that going and that strip filled up but Kathy selected the middle store in the middle strip and theres still no stores on either side and its been over a year and a half yes and and its sad because it was it was a nice store and she was such a lovely young gal to work for i just feel very bad   oh thats too bad it   um
