has been pretty muchdiscounted But its plausible to think that cooking a meal together and thendining on it just the two of you could be erotic Especially if like meyour schedule frequently forces you to eat alone and you often find yourselfstanding in front of the microwave screaming Come on goddammitIntercourses  by Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge  TerracePublishing  preaches that for every

book rosemary is sexy because of its fragrance used in many perfumesand because of its texture which so the text assured tickles nerve endingsThe dessert was mostly coffee rum and Kahlua which has worked before            We shopped for the food together and cookedtogether drinking wine and beer along the way At one point while I wasworking on the dessert I asked my wife how long to beat the heavy creammixture Till its stiffits an aphrodisiac she said Preparation tookless than an hour and everything came out perfectly Eating at our dining roomtable for the first time ever without guests we were having fun bycandlelight But the mood was romantic not erotic                           Overall rating toes curled                        Thats when we went for the Viagra  for  doseswhich includes a consultation fee The drug was prescribed by a doctor whomIve never met and ordered from a pharmacy in Miami Beach Fla where Ivenever been I completed the transaction via the Internet after filling out acovertheirass questionnaire in three minutes            We each decided to take one pill clinked ourglasses and gulped And then what It felt awkward sitting in our bedroomknowing that it could take up to an hour for Viagra to work I suggested thatwe play strip poker something Id never done Deb had never even played pokerso I had to explain the rules I won in about six hands auspiciously Ithought with three aces But we still werent really in the mood yet            So then I got out the other purchase Id made at ATouch of RomanceDirty Dice  One of the two pink cubes is markedwith these words instead of dots lips above waist ear breastbelow waist and  The other cube is labeled kiss squeeze lickblow suck and eat We took turns throwing the dice but the activitiesgenerated seemed forced and arbitrary Finally as they say at NASA there wasword from the pad that the launch sequence was initiating It was pretty muchlike all other sex except for a slight lightheadedness Deb said she noticed aremote tingling sensation On the plus side there was no priapism and neitherof us experienced disruption of our color vision nor a fatal heart attackwhich was nice                           Overall rating toes curled                        St Augustine held lust to be a fitting punishment formans disobedience to God the bodys disobeying of the mind the will thespirit and even of itself The paradigm of this for him is the unbiddenhardon JeanPaul Sartre discovered something similar although celebratingit rather than deploring it Essential to the erotic is the bodys defianceof design and control The paradigm of this for him is the jiggleSartres view yields a sort of sexual Heisenberg principle There is aninherent tension between physically abandoning yourself to another on the onehand and sexual planning on the other The more of the one the less of theother And this I discovered is the chief obstacle to sexual selfhelpGetting an erection is sexy Making one is not As my wife said about ViagraYou start to have a new feeling and then you realize where it came from andthen you dont have it so much  Anything that makes you think about it likethat is just creepy            This is not to say there isnt a way out of thisconflict between desire and design With homage to our potent POTUS there isI think a Third Way thats neither sexual complacency nor standard selfhelpIf the intrusion of consciousness is the problem then maybe the answer is toblock it out Sure you could do this the oldfashioned way with alcohol anddrugs But then you have all the traditional drawbacks including diminishedphysical attractiveness and degraded sexual performance            So how about this instead Go for all the sexualselfhelp you can but do it covertly  Watch a sex video or porn flickif you wantbut by yourself and then try to share what you learned withoutsharing how you learned it Dont tell your partner you took Viagra Or giveeach other standing permission to slip it into the odd afterdinner drinksaying nothing Of course when you do it youll still know but having anunselfconsciously turnedon partner is a real compensation for that and nexttime your partner can surprise you And yes this requires trust But whywould you be having sex with someone you dont trust My main conclusion isthat contrary to our blabby culture the key to a better sex life is lesscommunication
