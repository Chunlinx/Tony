yesterdayEarly Monday Moscow time Boris Yeltsin dismissed his prime minister creatingyet another political leadership crisis for the country which faces aparliamentary election at the end of the year and a presidential one in themiddle of the next Because of the developments late break of the earlyeditions only the LAT front has it in the form of a reefer box TheNew York Timesfronts Dagestan but leads with further evidence of exponential politicalinflationthe Republican Partys quiet creation of an elite club of  milliondonors The Washington Post stuffs Dagestan and goes instead with theINSs apparent loosening of its previous policy of automatically detainingevery immigrant eligible for deportation because of a criminal convictionUSAToday leads with a story that gets front space at theNYT President Clintons carrying of the fight over Republican proposedtax cuts to the national governors meeting Clinton told the state executivesthe cuts could force deep cuts in domestic programs and raise interest ratesYet the paper reports Clinton also said that he thought a smaller tax cutcould and should be passed this year Some of the coverage marks the continuingmedia gravitization of Jesse Ventura Frontpage pictures from the meeting atthe LAT and NYT show a twoshot of Clinton and Ventura talkingvery much equals pictorially at least This represents a very consciouschoice by editorsafter all during Clintons appearance he no doubt appearedat least briefly with nearly every governor            The NYT lead notes that the Democratic Party has its own top fatcategory requiring an individual contribution of  and goes on toobserve that if both parties meet their highdonor goals the Republicans willhave raised twice as much money via this route as the Democrats This is allsoft money not governed by the rules for individual union or corporatecampaign contributions because its collected for partybuilding activitiesand issue ads rather than for individual candidacies and the paper explainsthat the new high levels of giving mean that the total amount of soft money collected for  could double the  amount            The Posts first illustration of the INS shift is the release Fridayof an Ethiopian woman who had been jailed by the INS because she was onprobation following a conviction for shoplifting clothes for her children Andthe story provides no examples of obviously dangerous criminals snagged by theINS under the old policy But the paper goes on to admit that its unclear howmany of the criminals affected are like the Ethiopian woman and how many aremore serious felons            Both the NYT and WP front reports that Jordans new leaderKing Abdullah has in recent days twice gone out among his subjects on undercover factfinding missions once pretending to be atelevision producer complete with crew and once an ordinary passenger in ataxicab Both stories and isnt it curious that both papers wouldindependently front such a soft feature note that there is a rich Arabtradition of leaders going out in mufti with the overall feeling being thatthis is a quaint feature of a veil and robeenmeshed culture Neither storynotes that the practice would also be a good way for an American president tofind out what real people put up with and what they actually think If apresident has a certain knack for ahem sneaking around he might as well doit for the public good            The LAT fronts a million lawsuit being brought this week in a Los Angeles court by a formerAmerican Airlines mechanic against the company for its failure to takeseriously racial

ahangmans noosenot a drawing an actual rope noosehanging over apassageway In a pretrial deposition the mans supervisor testified that hethought displaying nooses could be offensive but he did not think it was aform of harassment The man tried to retreat from this view after a minutebreak called by Americans lawyer The LAT is to be saluted for runningthis story prominently and if American is smart itll settle this case beforelarge numbers of the papers  million daily readers decide there are plenty ofother morally sound ways to fly out of town            The papers nod toward the th anniversary of Richard Nixons resignation ANYT frontpager notes that half of Americans alive today hadnt turned yet on that day if they were alive at all And that a recent poll found percent of respondents thinking that there have been other political scandalsthat were just as bad as Watergate A Wall Street Journal Rule of Law column wonders how it canbe that Bill Clinton got invited to give the keynote address to the AmericanBar Association today when Richard Nixon was never so invited and indeed wasultimately disbarred On the LAT oped page columnist Richard Reevesdigs up a Ben

Howard Kurtz reports theres grumbling in thenewsroom of the Nashville Tennessean over the appearance in a Gorecampaign video by the papers editor a close friend of Gores And indeed theeditor has now said the appearance was a mistake This is dumb Isnt theeditor allowed to also have a private role as a voter And even in his publicrole theres an excellent chance his newspaper under his direction willendorse Gores candidacy So obviously its okay for people to know what hethinks of Gore
