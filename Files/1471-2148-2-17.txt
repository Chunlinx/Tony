                    Background                Artemisia L Asteraceae as broadly        conceived by Linnaeus is the largest genus in Tribe        Anthemideae      and one of the largest in the family            It is widespread in mid to highlatitudes and        shrubby species dominate most cold and many warm deserts in        the Northern Hemisphere             Because        of the abundance of winddispersed         Artemisia pollen in the geological        column it is used as an indicator of steppe climates            Some members are foraged by ungulates rodents birds        and insects          despite the production        of sesquiterpenes that afford a bitter taste to the        herbage The woody species increase dramatically under        grazing pressure thereby excluding desirable forage              Many         Artemisia species are a major cause        of allergies in humans     All         Artemisia species produce aromatic        oils and several are culinary herbs or used as flavorings        hallucinogens vermifuges and pharmaceuticals               and some are toxic             Artemisia annua annual wormwood and                A mexicana produce antimalarial        drugs       and artemisinin from         A annua  appears to selectively        kill human breast cancer cells            Despite the wellknown importance of         Artemisia  there is no consensus on        taxonomic relationships which have traditionally been        inferred on the basis of floral and capitular morphology        In         Artemisia sl  the typical limb of        the Anthemideaetype ray florets are reduced to a        membranous vestige giving the impression that the small        capitula are composed only of disk florets referred to as        disciform capitula inflorescence by Bremer and Humphries            In other members of the genus the ray flowers are        absent thus the capitulum is composed only of disk        florets         ie  discoid In addition plants        with discoid capitula are considered homogamous since all        florets are of one sexual form perfectbisexual disk        florets and plants with disciform capitula are considered        heterogamous with two or more sexual forms          ie pistillate rays and perfect        disks or pistillate rays and staminate disks        Taxonomic treatments for         Artemisia over the past  years        range from maintaining a single large genus of over         species         to the recognition of six to        eight genera from within its taxonomic boundaries                      Artemisia of antiquity was divided        into three genera          Artemisia Absinthium and         Abrotanum  by Tournefort            However the concept of a more inclusive genus was        resurrected by Linnaeus     hereinafter referred to        as         Artemisia sl  Besser    and de        Candolle    recognized four sections within         Artemisia sl

pistillate and fertile disk florets functionally        staminate receptacle glabrous        The first phylogenetic treatment    recognized four        sections within a broadly defined         Artemisia sl  with sect         Artemisia proposed as the progenitor        to sect         Absinthium          Dracunculus  and         Seriphidium  This phylogeny was        based on two hypothesized evolutionary trends loss of        fertility in the disk florets and loss of ray florets        Sect         Artemisia and         Absinthium were later united           and all sections were raised to the level of subgenus                     ie  subg         Artemisia Dracunculus  and         Seriphidium  In addition a number        of authors         considered the American        woody sagebrushes to have an independent origin from the        woody Asian species subg         Seriphidium  and recognized sect         Tridentatae         Poljakov    and others    segregated subg         Seriphidium as a distinct genus along        with several small genera from within the boundaries of         Artemisia sl  The more recent        major classifications       have agreed with the        segregation of         Seriphidium on the basis of        discoidhomogamous capitula and recognized the smaller        segregate genera as well Ling       for instance        considered         Artemisia ss and         Seriphidium to be distinct and sister        to each other and with the small segregate and allied        genera in turn sister to them     In their landmark        monograph of Tribe Anthemideae Bremer and Humphries           placed         Artemisia and its allied genera in        Subtribe Artemisiinae In contrast to Lings hypothesis           regarding sister group relationships between         Artemisia ss and         Seriphidium  the Bremer and        Humphries    morphologically based cladogram placed four        small genera          Neopallasia Turaniphytum Mausolea        Picrothamnus  with a total of seven species as        closest sisters          ie  segregates of         Artemisia ss  the         Artemisia clade         sensu Bremer and Humphries whereas         Seriphidium and two small genera          Kaschgaria Crossostephium          species total were placed outside the         Artemisia clade as allies to         Artemisia ss  In addition         Sphaeromeria Filifolium        Ajaniopsis  and         Stilnolepis  species total were        sister to this clade of eight genera that included         Artemisia ss and its segregates and        allies Further Ling and Ling    recognized         Elachanthemum as distinct from         Stilnolepis          ie  as two monotypic genera        Altogether these  genera comprise the         Artemisia group         sensu Bremer and Humphries        According to Bremer and Humphries     the         Artemisia group is monophyletic and        defined by heterogamousdisciform capitula disk florets        usually bisexual and fertile ray florets pistillate or        homogamousdiscoid capitula disk florets usually bisexual        and fertile ray florets absent pollen with short or no        spines associated with anemophily and thickwalled        cypselas devoid of ribs sometimes faint ribs are present        in         Sphaeromeria and         Crossostephium  All of the         Artemisia group genera contain        species that have been variously placed within the        taxonomic boundaries of         Artemisia sl with the exceptions of                Sphaeromeria Neopallasia        Turaniphytum  and         Mausolea Nonetheless these four        genera are always considered closely related to it                        Artemisia ss  and         Seriphidium are composed of        approximately  and  species respectively and are        geographically widespread Their species occur        predominantly throughout Europe and temperate Asia as well        as in western North America         Sphaeromeria and         Picrothamnus are endemic to western        North America whereas all remaining Artemisiinae genera        occur in eastern southwestern or central Asia        Several biological factors may account for the        disagreement and wide range of interpretation in relation        to generic circumscription and subgeneric boundaries in         Artemisia and its allies including        rapid and recent diversification reduction in floral        features associated with anemophily with the concomitant        loss of potentially useful taxonomic characters multiple        origins of woodiness       and chromosomal        evolution and hybridization        In addition        most studies have focused on a limited geographic region        rather than studying the taxon worldwide        The primary objective of this study is to construct a        molecular phylogeny of Subtribe Artemisiinae including         Artemisia and its allies employing        the internal transcribed spacers ITS of nuclear ribosomal        nr DNA The goals are  to test the monophyly of        Subtribe Artemisiinae and the         Artemisia group  determine the        phylogenetic placements of the segregate and allied genera        in relation to         Artemisia ss  and  evaluate the        patterns of diversification and test biogeographic        hypotheses and evolutionary trends in capitular and floral        morphology in the         Artemisia group      The ITS        have been demonstrated to be appropriate for examining        generic relationships in many plant families including the        Asteraceae     for Tribe Anthemideae specifically            and within         Artemisia                         Results        The PCR products of the ITS were resolved as single        bands on  agarose gels Of the  aligned nucleotide        positions for both spacers combined excluding gaps        required for alignment  were phylogenetically        informative Sequence divergence uncorrected p is         among members of the         Artemisia clade  among members        of Subtribe Artemisiinae and  between Subtribe        Artemisiinae and the outgroup species from other        Anthemideae subtribes        Resulting phylogenetic trees obtained by maximum        parsimony MP maximum likelihood ML and Bayesian        analyses were congruent in topology All three analyses        resolved three major clades for Subtribe Artemisiinae with        MP the least resolved and ML the most highly resolved The        topologies differed in the placement of         Stilnolepis  which was placed        outside of Subtribe Artemisiinae by MP and at the base of        the subtribe by both ML and Bayes Otherwise the tree        topologies differed only in their ability to resolve        relationships within the three major clades numbered           in Fig         Using MP two analyses  replicates with TBR branch        swapping on  trees per replicate and  replicates        with TBR branch swapping on  trees per replicate        resulted in  equally parsimonious trees of  steps        CI   RI   RC   The resulting        consensus trees from each MP analysis are identical in        topology with little resolution achieved trees not        shown Three major clades of Subtribe Artemisiinae were        resolved and include  species of all         Artemisia subgenera except subg         Drancuculus  as well as         Seriphidium Crossostephium        Neopallasia  and         Sphaeromeria           Filifolium and species of         Artemisia subg         Dracunculus  and          Ajania Arctanthemum Dendranthema         and         Elachanthemum          Kaschgaria is placed within the        Subtribe Artemisiinae clade but its position is        unresolved while         Stilpnolepis is placed outside the        subtribe The closest sister genera to Subtribe        Artemisiinae are         Nipponanthemum and         Leucanthemella Subtribe        Leucantheminae Three genera          Oncosiphon Eriocephalus  and         Microcephala  from Subtribe        Matricariinae are sister to this larger clade Bootstrap        analysis supported  ingroup nodes for the MP tree at        values  and are indicated on the ML tree Fig                The ML analysis converged upon a single tree with a log        likelihood value of  Likelihood parameters for        the dataset were determined by Modeltest  for the TrNG        model and included the following base frequencies of A          C   G   T   rmatrix values        of AC   AG   AT   CG          CT   GT   and a gamma distribution of         The ML tree resolved Subtribe Artemisiinae as        monophyletic with         Leucanthemella and         Nipponanthemum as its closest        sisters Within Subtribe Artemisiinae         Stilnolepis and         Kaschgaria form independent clades at        the base of the subtribe Similar to the MP tree the same        three major clades are resolved Fig         Bootstrap analysis of the data using ML criteria was not        computationally feasible given the size of the data set        Therefore as an alternative we conducted a Bayesian        analysis utilizing a GTR model with  rate classes AC          AG   AT   CG   CT   GT   for           generations sampled every  generations that        resulted in a posterior probability distribution containing           samples The analysis converged on similar log        likelihood scores mean   and reached stationarity        no later than  generations The initial burnin         samples from the analysis were discarded and a        majority rule consensus tree of the remaining         samples was constructed to obtain posterior probabilities        and resulted in a tree with  ingroup nodes with a        significance level  Posterior probabilities are        indicated on the ML tree Fig  The Bayesian tree was        identical in topology to the ML tree with the exception        that the New World         Seriphidium subclade was        unresolved                    Discussion                  Monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae and the          Artemisiagroup          The ITS data provide weak support for the monophyly of          Subtribe Artemisiinae Fig  ie  posterior          probability as estimated by MrBayes and unsupported as          measured by parsimony bootstrap analysis            ndh F sequence data also failed to          resolve or support the monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae              In the ITS phylogeny only one genus appears to          disrupt its monophyly           Stilnolepis  which occupies the          basalmost position of the ingroup However the next          node up is supported at a  posterior probability          indicating that Subtribe Artemisiinae is likely          monophyletic with the possible exception of           Stilnolepis           The ITS phylogeny Fig  resolved three major clades          within Subtribe Artemisiinae that correspond to the          following  all subgenera of           Artemisia minus           Dracunculus            Artemisia subg           Dracunculus  and  the largely          radiate members of the subtribe            Ajania Arctanthemum  and           Dendranthema  All three clades          have segregate genera embedded within each indicated in          bold and these clades are supported at   and           posterior probabilities respectively with the third          clade also supported by a bootstrap value of  The           Artemisia group           sensu Bremer and Humphries    is          not monophyletic because three segregate genera           Elachanthemum Stilnolepis  and           Kaschgaria are excluded from this          clade Additionally           Artemisia sl  is monophyletic          only with the inclusion of five segregate genera           Seriphidium Sphaeromeria Neopallasia          Crossostephium  and           Filifolium  Additionally this          clade is only weakly supported with a  posterior          probability and bootstrap support                           Placement of segregate and allied genera          Three of the eight segregate and allied genera that we          examined were placed outside of the           Artemisia group including           Stilnolepis Elachanthemum and           Kaschgaria  whereas the remaining          five were placed within it including           Seriphidium Sphaeromeria Neopallasia          Crossostephium  and           Filifolium  However many of these          placements are among the most weakly supported branches          of the resulting phylogenetic trees Fig                     Stilnolepis Elachanthemum and           Kaschgaria are excluded from the          clade of the           Artemisia group and are in part          sister to all remaining Artemisiinae genera in the ITS          phylogeny           Stilnolepis and           Elachanthemum are monotypic genera          that occur in Central Asia that are often treated as a          single genus           Stilnolepis     However our          ITS phylogeny supports Lings treatment of them as two          distinct genera     Neither genus appears to be a          member of           Artemisia sl  or the           Artemisia group Both genera are          discoid with corymbose capitula but whether either genus          possesses spineless pollen a synapomorphy for the           Artemisia group or is          windpollinated has not yet been determined                Kaschgaria a genus of two species          from China and central Asia is also placed outside of          the           Artemisia group but clearly          within Subtribe Artemisiinae  probability in the ITS          phylogeny           Kaschgaria was removed by Poljakov          from           Artemisia sl  on the basis of          stellate corolla hairs and was considered more closely          related to           Seriphidium than           Artemisia ss  even though it is          disciform rather than discoid               Kaschgaria possesses spineless          pollen      Therefore placement of           Kaschgaria and           Elachanthemum outside of the           Artemisia group is intriguing          because if these placements remain robust          windpollination may have arisen more than once in the          tribe or insectpollination may be secondarily derived          within Subtribe Artemisiinae in the radiate genera clade           of Fig           Four of the small alliedsegregate genera are embedded          within the clade of the           Artemisia group in addition to          the large segregate genus           Seriphidium Fig            Filifolium is sister to species of          subg           Dracunculus  and together comprise          a sister clade to all remaining           Artemisia species and four          segregate genera moderately supported at           probability Monotypic           Filifolium occurs in China and          Korea and was previously considered a species of subg           Dracunculus on the basis of sterile          disk florets Cassini    segregated subg           Dracunculus as           Oligosporus with the sterility of          the central florets as the defining synapomorphy that          unites these species Fig b Bremer and Humphries             noted that           Mausolea and           Picrothamnus share this trait and          suggested that           Oligosporus should be resurrected          and defined to include these three segregate genera           Mausolea was segregated by Poljakov             from           Artemisia sl by marginal flowers          that lack corollas           Picrothamnus was established by          Nuttall but reduced as           A spinescens Hall and Clements          and according to Bremer and Humphries    is          essentially           Dracunculus with two          autapomorphies spiny habit and cobwebbypilose cypselas          Thus two taxonomic treatments are viable  the          recognition of two subgenera within           Artemisia sl  subg           Dracunculus and an expanded subg           Artemisia or  the resurrection          of           Oligosporus following Cassini to          include species of           subg Dracunculus Filifolium and          perhaps           Mausolea and           Picrothamnus Unfortunately we were          unable to obtain ITS sequences for           Mausolea or           Picrothamnus           Monotypic           Crossostephium was treated as a          segregate genus of           Artemisia by Bremer and Humphries              It is distinct from           Artemisia by the presence of a          coroniform pappus however it was once placed near           A californica by Gray    and          Rydberg    on the basis of deeplyribbed cypselas           Crossostephium occurs in the          Phillipines Taiwan southern Japan and China whereas           A californica occurs in western          North America Based on the ITS results we conclude that                    Crossostephium is allied with Old          World           Seriphidium and several           Artemisia subg           Artemisia species and           A californica is sister to most of          the New World species of           Seriphidium Fig  Although          placements of both are weakly supported  and           probabilities for           Crossostephium and           A californica  respectively Fig                              Neopallasia is a genus of three          species that occur in central Asia including southern          Siberia Mongolia and China     It was segregated          from           Artemisia by Poljakov    on the          basis of several autapomorphies including pectinate          leaves centralsterile florets at the apex of the          capitulum ovoidlanceolate anther appendages and a          rosetteshaped arrangement of cypselas on the receptacle          Poljakov    and Bremer and Humphries    contended          that           Neopallasia is closely related to           Artemisia subg           Drancunculus  However the ITS          data place           Neopallasia sister to Asian species          of           Seriphidium and some members of           Artemisia subg           Artemisia  close to           Crossostephium  This placement is          moderately supported at  probability                    Sphaeromeria is considered closely          related to           Artemisia sl  although it was          once treated as a section of           Tanacetum     It is a small          genus of nine western North American species and has no          autapomorphies that distinguish it from           Artemisia sl Bremer and Humphries             suggested that it might be more closely related to           Kaschgaria  a genus composed of          two species that occur in central Asia and China They          are similar in habit and have similar inflorescences that          are slightly elongated However in the ITS phylogeny          Fig            Sphaeromeria is distant to           Kaschgaria Rather its placement is          unsupported within a           Seriphidium subclade that contains          several anomalous North American species some of which          have been placed in sect           Tridentatae  However because of          the lack of support for placement of           Sphaeromeria  we are hesitant to          suggest that it be submerged in           Artemisia sl  without further          study However it does not appear closely related to           Kaschgaria                     Seriphidium palmeri is an anomalous          species that was once treated as segregate genus           Artemisiastrum  The ITS phylogeny          places it among New World subg           Artemisia species in agreement          with previous studies     and not in agreement with          Bremer and Humphries    who place it near           Seriphidium sect           Tridentatae  This is a strongly          supported relationship at  bootstrap and           probability Thus           Artemisiatrum  should not be          resurrected with           S palmeri more closely related to          the New World species of           Artemisia subg           Artemisia rather than with the New          World           Seriphidium species that comprise          sect           Tridentatae                           Infrageneric classification of Artemisia sl          While this study is incomplete with regards to          subgeneric boundaries because only a limited number of           Artemisia species was sampled from          this large genus some preliminary conclusions can still          be made on emerging patterns of the derived phylogeny           Artemisia subg           Artemisia is not supported as          monophyletic with its species placed in six different          clades in the ITS tree Fig  It is apparently defined          taxonomically on the basis of plesiomorphies          heterogamous disciform capitula with perfectfertile          disk florets and pistillate ray florets and needs to be          recircumscribed           Artemisia subg           Absinthium is monophyletic           probability  bootstrap in the ITS phylogeny and          differs from all other subgenera by a hairy receptacle          However it is embedded within a clade of species of Old          World subg           Artemisia  Thus we agree with          Gray    that the species of subg           Absinthium should be merged into          subg           Artemisia Similarly Old World           Seriphidium species are          monophyletic  probability but should also be          subsumed within           Artemisia subg           Artemisia           Previously the origin of the           Tridentatae was unresolved with          competing hypotheses from the New World           Artemisia species vs Old World           Seriphidium species being equivocal               The current ITS phylogeny suggests that the          closest relatives of           Tridentatae lie among the New World          species of           Artemisia  in agreement with          McArthur and Plummer     perhaps sharing a common          ancestry with           A filifolia and           A californica  in addition to           Sphaeromeria  although monophyly          for this subclade is unsupported by the ITS data           Seriphidium sect           Tridentatae does not share a most          recent common ancestor with Old World           Seriphidium species and it should          not be treated with the Old World woody artemisias as we          and others have previously suggested                Seriphidium sect           Tridentatae is characterized by          discoidhomogamous capitula with the exception of           S bigelowii  which has occasional          heterogamousdisciform capitula of one pistillate ray          floret and two perfect disk florets  a character that          was previously considered a plesiomorphy or secondary          reversal in           S bigelowii     Based on ITS          and chloroplast phylogenies of sect           Tridentatae  we previously          concluded     that           S bigelowii was perhaps misplaced          and should be excluded from the           Tridentatae  In addition we          explained     an unexpected relationship between it          and           A filfifolia as possible          hybridization and introgression involving bidirectional          gene flow rather than recent common ancestry because          heterogamousdisciform           A bigelowii differs from          heterogamousdisciform           A filifolia by perfect disk          florets instead of femalesterile disk florets           Sphaeromeria also has          heterogamousdisciform capitula with pistillate ray and          perfect disk florets as does heterogamousdisciform           S bigelowii  suggesting that it          is indeed a plesiomorphy The occasional appearance of          disciform capitula in           S bigelowii might be explained by          introgression of genes or alleles from           A filfolia that control ray          expression a phenomenon observed in discoid           Senecio squallidus and radiate           S vulgaris in Europe              While this is speculative it is consistent with          hypotheses that hybridization and introgression are          widespread in sect           Tridentatae     and may          explain occasional heterogamous disciform capitula in           S bigelowii      However          there may be many genetic and developmental mechanisms          that affect ray formation and control floret fertility                        Artemisia subg           Drancunculus is monophyletic and is          sister to all remaining           Artemisia species It perhaps          combined with           Filifolium Mausolea and          Picrothamnus could be treated as a separate genus           Oligosporus following Cassini or          as one of two subgenera of           Artemisia  In the latter case all          remaining species of           Artemisia including subg           Absinthium and           Artemisia  and           Seriphidium including sect           Tridentatae would collectively          form a much expanded subg           Artemisia Thus           Artemisia sl  should either be          treated as two subgenera ie a largely expanded subg           Artemisia Clade  of Fig  and           Dracunculus Clade  of Fig  or          as two distinct genera           Artemisia and           Oligosporus  Both clades are          moderately supported at  and  probabilities and          include several segregate genera as well Therefore we          favor retaining the Linnean concept of the genus with          subg           Dracunculus conserved and the          numerous segregate genera eventually being subsumed          within           Artemisia sl                           Sister group relationships of Subtribe          Artemisiinae          Sister group relationships of Subtribe Artemisiinae          were unresolved on the basis of morphology              However an ITS phylogeny of FranciscoOrtega et al             that primarily focused on the origin of Macaronesian          endemic genera of Anthemideae revealed a possible sister          group relationship of           Leucanthemella and           Nipponanthemum Subtribe          Leucantheminae to Subtribe Artemisiinae Monotypic           Nipponanthemum occurs in Japan and          the two species of           Leucanthemella occur in Eastern          Europe and the Far East in Manchuria Korea and Japan          An ITS phylogeny of Subtribe Leucantheminae    also          excluded these two genera from that subtribe which is          otherwise Mediterranean in distribution congruent with a          chloroplast phylogeny based on           ndh F for the entire tribe              The           ndh F phylogeny failed to support          the subtribal classification of Tribe Anthemideae           sensu Bremer and Humphries and          failed to resolve the intergeneric relationships or          support the monophyly of Subtribe Artemisiinae However          this study resulted in the recognition of the importance          of biogeography in the evolution of the tribe as a whole          with a major divergence between relictual South African          genera and Northern Hemisphere Eurasian genera where          members of Subtribe Artemisiinae were placed Our ITS          phylogeny of Subtribe Artemisiinae that included           outgroup genera from seven Anthemideae subtribes also          supports a sister group relationship of           Nipponanthemum and           Leucanthemella to Subtribe          Artemisiinae Fig           A close resemblance of           Nipponanthemum and           Leucanthemella to the Asian genus           Dendranthema of Subtribe          Artemisiinae was previously noted by Bremer and Humphries              when they provisionally placed these genera in          Subtribe Leucantheminae The ITS data clearly support a          sister group relationship between these two genera and          subtribe Artemisiinae and their exclusion from Subtribe          Leucantheminae Both           Leucanthemella and           Nipponanthemum are radiate          supporting a radiate ancestry for Subtribe          Artemisiinae                          Evolution of floral traits          The genera that comprise the           Artemisia group are closely          related and were considered monophyletic on the basis of          ancestrally disciformheterogamous capitula and          spineless pollen with discoid capitula secondarily          derived by the loss of ray or marginal florets Fig            Phaeostigma and           Ajania  which are sister to the           Artemisia group in the Bremer and          Humphries    cladogram contain some species that were          once classified as           Artemisia sl since they are also          disciform However these two genera were removed from           Artemisia sl  and on the basis          of spiny pollen have been considered transitional between          the           Artemisia group and four radiate          genera           Tridactylina Arctanthemum          Brachanthemum and           Dendranthema  Our ITS phylogeny          places disciform           Ajania sister to radiate           Arctanthemum derived from within          the           ArctanthemumDendranthema clade          rather than sister to the           Artemisia group Thus disciform           Ajania does not appear to be          intermediate between radiate Artemisiinae and disciform           Artemisia and allies Furthermore          the tentative placement of disciform           Kaschgaria and discoid           Stilnolepis sister to the entire          subtribe suggests that there may have been multiple          origins for disciform as well as discoid capitula                          Biogeography          A complex scenario for the origin and diversification          of           Artemisia and           Seriphidium  and subsequent          parallel evolution of the two genera in the Old and New          Worlds was proposed by Ling      The putative          common ancestor to both sister genera was hypothesized          to have existed in northern Asia based on reported          fossil pollen records that date the taxa to the early          Oligocene or lower Eocene of the lower Tertiary with          speciation accompanied by migrations during the Tertiary          and Quaternary periods  forced southward by the          advancing polar ice sheets Hypothesized migrations out          of northern Asia purportedly occurred along three lines           westward into Europe with gradual migration into          North America western Asia Asia Minor the          Mediterranean and Africa  eastward into Siberia into          western North America and into eastern Europe and           further south into Asia primarily during the Quaternary           Seriphidium is clearly embedded as          two distinct clades within           Artemisia in the molecular          phylogenies making a sister group relationship          unlikely          According to Ling      a pro           Absinthium  ancestor in northern          Asia gave rise to members of           Absinthium  which directly gave          rise to           Abrotanum which subsequently gave          rise to           Seriphidium  An           Absinthium origin for           Seriphidium has also been proposed          on the basis of flavonoid data     The ITS data do          not support a sister group relationship of members of          subg           Absinthium to the remainder of           Artemisia sl  In contrast           Absinthium is embedded within a          derived clade composed of both Old and New World members          of subg           Artemisia  A proposed secondary          diversification occurred during the Himalayan uplift in          the late Tertiary and resulted in a center of diversity          that today harbors  species of regional endemics of           Artemisia ss  A more detailed          examination of           Artemisia sl is necessary to more          fully evaluate this hypothesis          Hall and Clements    proposed a sister group          relationship of subg           Artemisia to remaining subgenera          This hypothesis is also not supported because subg           Artemisia is not monophyletic In          contrast the ITS phylogeny supports an early divergence          of subg           Dracunculus from the remaining           Artemisia subgenera          It appears that the New World species of           Artemisia sl  are paraphyletic          and that the North American lineages arose once with at          least one back migration to the Old World by some members          of subg           Artemisia and           Absinthium Fig  Alternatively          the North American lineages may have arisen twice          independently Graham    suggested that the most          convincing earliest fossil pollen records for           Artemisia are late Oligocene from          Central Europe In all likelihood Subtribe Artemisiinae          and           Artemisia s l  originated in          Eurasia sharing a relatively ancient common ancestry with          Asian members of Leucantheminae and South African members          of Subtribe Matricariinae                                Conclusion        The ITS data do not support the segregation of numerous        small genera or         Seriphidium from within the        boundaries of         Artemisia  Two major clades for         Artemisia sl are supported and        include subg         Dracunculus and subg         Artemisia  with the segregate genera        and subgenera of         Artemisia embedded within subg         Artemisia  Additionally three        segregate genera are placed outside of the         Artemisia clade For Subtribe        Artemisiinae the         Artemisia group of species are        sister to the radiate genera Additional molecular markers        are necessary to further resolve relationships within the        Artemisiinae before making taxonomic decisions to subsume        all segregate genera within         Artemisia sl                     Methods        ITS sequences were obtained for  species representing         genera of Subtribe Artemisiinae and  outgroup species        from seven additional Anthemideae subtribes Voucher        specimens were deposited in herbaria see additional file         Total genomic DNA was isolated from fresh or

MicrosoftWord file of aligned data matrix used for        phylogenetic analyses in PAUP        Click here for file        MP analyses were performed using the software PAUP             assuming unordered character states and equal        character state weighting Gaps were treated as missing        data The HEURISTICS search option was used ignoring        invariant and uninformative characters Random addition of        sequences for  replicates with TREE        BISECTIONRECONNECTION TBR branch swapping on  trees        per replicate and  replicates with TBR swapping on         trees per replicate were performed using the following        settings MULTREES STEEPEST DESCENT MAXTREES          and accelerated transformation ACCTRAN Strict consensus        trees were constructed and bootstrap values were        calculated as measures of branch support    using the        following bootstrap parameters  bootstrap replicates         MAXTREES per replicate random addition sequence TBR        STEEPEST DESCENT and MULTREES In addition the        Consistency Index CI Retention Index RI and the        Rescaled Consistency Index RC were calculated as measures        of homoplasy in the data        An ML analysis was also conducted as a preferred        alternative to MP since comparative studies have shown that        in most situations MP can fail to resolve an accurate        phylogeny and generally underestimates bootstrap support            Model based analyses such as ML estimate actual        site changes from observed by taking into account various        aspects of molecular evolution such as multiple hits and        among site rate heterogeneity Simulation studies have        shown that ML is typically more accurate and robust than MP             Thus an ML analysis of the data was conducted        by employing an heuristic search in PAUP using TBR branch        swapping on a starting tree based on neighbor joining        ACCTRAN and STEEPEST DESCENT under the TrNG DNA        substitution model     This model was selected using a        Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test HLRT in Modeltest        version             Because bootstrap analysis using ML is not        computationally feasible for large data sets     we        conducted a Bayesian analysis as an alternative employing        optimization parameters similar to the nucleotide        substitution model that we used for ML      The        distinction between ML and Bayesian inference is that        Bayesian provides probabilities for hypotheses not        probabilities of data given a hypothesis              Bayesian analysis uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMC        methods to approximate posterior probability distributions        that are a direct estimation of branch support because they        are the true probabilities of the resulting clades under        the assumed models unlike bootstrap values             Additionally bootstrap values and posterior probabilities        derived from Bayesian analyses for multiple data sets        appear to be correlated     The Bayesian analysis was        conducted with the software MrBayes      A GTR        substitution model with  rate frequencies was selected as        the most similar model to the TrnG substitution model the        latter model is not available in MrBayes Four MCMC chains        were used with initial random starting trees The analysis        was run for    generations with trees sampled every         generations resulting in    samples The analysis        reached stationarity at  generations and these burnin        samples were excluded from the majority rule consensus tree        of  samples which was generated with PAUP to obtain        the Bayesian posterior probabilities                    Authors contributions        LEW conceived of the project and coordinated it as well        as collected plant material deposited new sequences in
