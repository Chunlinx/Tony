                                 The Suburbs Have Won            The great movement ofAmericans during the  th century has been from the countryside andsmall cities into big metropolitan areas But within metropolitan areas themovement has been outward from the cities to the suburbs The next census in will show that the United States has become majoritysuburban MostAmericans that is now live in metropolitan areas but outside the citylimits            New Yorkis the biggest city in the country by a wide margin and it is the most urbanin characterbut dont let that deceive you Seventy percent of New Yorkerslive in the suburbs New York has been majoritysuburban for decades sincebefore there was Levittown or Newsday or Please Dont Eat theDaisies  About one in  Americans is a New York suburbanite            The suburbs dominate popular culture The default settingfor movies television shows and even rock music is the suburbs Anything withan urban or a rural setting is selfconsciously played as different Thesuburbs dominate politics especially national politics Newt Gingrich is thefirst suburban speaker of the House Every presidential campaign is nowconceived of by strategists as a battle for the soul of the suburbs Thepresidential electorate became majoritysuburban years before the country as awhole did The dominant political machine in New York is a suburban

hood Those are statistical blips or anecdotes or fantasies UrbanAmerica is still losing population Rural America is still losing populationBlack people are suburbanizing faster than white people The suburbs areunstoppable inescapable            It isstill possible to hear the suburbs described especially by professional cityplanners and other urbanologists as a kind of temporary and revocableaberration You know the argument They were subsidized by the federalgovernment through the interstatehighway program and cheap VeteransAdministration mortgages They were forced upon New Yorkers by a roadcrazymasstransithating Robert Moses Their growth was a pure product of raceprejudice Millions of people especially New Yorkers are poised readywaiting eager to move back into the city if only  Im sorry Forget aboutit The main reason for the growth of the suburbs is that Americans likesuburbs They like houses They like lawns They like cars Most lowincomecity people would move to the suburbs if they could Mass commitment tourbanism has never existed in the United Stateseven in New York which seemsmore urban than it really is because it annexed most of its suburbs that isthe Bronx Brooklyn Queens and Staten Island long ago Whats remarkableabout New Yorks suburbs is not their demographic successthats acharacteristic of all suburbsbut their cultural failure New York has themost outofit least happening suburbs of any big American city            Only New York has no suburb with an essentiallyyuppie characterby which I mean dotted with little strip centers containingperhaps one or two casually chic restaurants a Starbucks a Borders anupscale food market an art gallery a MerchantIvorytype movie theater and amildly stylish homefurnishings store Palo Alto Shaker Heights andUniversity City Mo have far more of a patina of sophistication than any NewYork suburb            New York also doesnt have afullblown suburbannirvana edge city suburb such as Plano Texas orBloomington Minn or Tysons Corner Vathe kind of suburb that has shinyenormous malls and totally planned communities with spindly little trees andcurving streets and thatchy English names            Meanwhile a truly hip suburb no thats not oxymoronicgo visit West LakeHills Texas or Berkeley or Topanga Calif where there would be leafletsstapled to the telephone poles and vegetarian restaurants and rave clubs iscompletely out of the question in New York the only American city where thereis still a total overlap between downtown and bohemian Its the only citywhere the actual city is still the center not just of the metropoliss officialhigh culture but of its everyday culture too            Westchester County where I live is suburbia set in amberIts population has barely fluctuated for threequarters of a century You likeprewar buildings Virtually the whole county of Westchester below Interstate is prewar buildingsit could be a movie set There are very few mallsSuperstores are just starting There is ethnicity There are country clubstheold undemocratic kind not the new kind that are essentially outdoor healthclubs The expensive restaurants still serve continental cuisine Thecommunities are all villages with sidewalked main streets containing rows ofbrick buildings just what brave suburban reformers in the Sun Belt arestruggling desperately to coax into existence

never been to a single social event here where a hothouseconversation about the Industry could be sustained for more than about half anhour before it slowly flutters back to home ground the town and the kidsYes this was the case even the week that Pelhamite Joe Klein was unmasked asthe author of Primary                Colors             Virtually all the cultural imagery pertainingto Westchester

saying helpfully that my life would be completely ruined if I choseto live in the suburbs or the city All my friends who had grown up in theorganic New York suburbs had at some point around age  taken a blood oathnever ever to live in the suburbs as adults People who did move to the suburbshad to obey an unwritten conversational rule that you had to justify it instagy and fake terms either by exaggerating the hellishness of the city forchildren or by pretending that the suburbs were really not that far away andhad lots of great Korean groceries I felt as if I had wandered in in themiddle of the second actwhy did it make such a big difference What hadhappened to all those people when they were  that was so horrifying            I nowrealize that what all this was really about was first the extreme differencein New York between suburban and urban culture which doesnt exist in mostother cities because they dont really have an urban culture for middleclassparents any more and second status The status point is a tricky one Inthe minor leagues of status where most people play the city is for the poorand the suburbs are for the rich so to move out to the suburbs is to move upas well But in the major leagues of status the city outranks the suburbs Thecity is where the real players live The city is for the aristocracy and thesuburbs are for the bourgeoisie            In the major leagues when you live in thesuburbs it means that you havent made it enough to afford the basic setup ofcoop apartmentprivate schoolweekend house Or it means that youre not NewYorksavvy enough to be able to arrange for yourself one of those speciallittle deals the city is full of such as mainly a rentcontrolled apartmentOr it means that youre not artful enough to be able to live charmingly as abohemian If you have majorleague aspirations and cant manage to live in thecity youre better off moving out past the suburban Zone of Shame and livingfull time in the kind of lovely small town where major leaguers spend weekendsand summers At least then youre plausibly rustic and creative            When Im off the EasternSeaboard and people ask me where Im from I say New York When closer tohome
