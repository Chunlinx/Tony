                                 Suffer the Children            Having considered childabuse and its attendant ills from all sorts of anglesalleged Satanistscelebrity molesters recovered memories daycare witch trialsJames Kincaida professor of English at the University of Southern California has concludedthat at its root the problem is a matter of genre The thing is child abuse ascurrently conceived is hopelessly Gothic Stories about child molesting arepopulated by evil monsters and helpless innocents rather than flawed orunfortunate humans and they languish in a miasma of sinister eroticism Childmolesting is thought to be so evil so far outside the bounds of civilizationthat no means of exorcism can be considered too harsh or prone to error            At thesame time though the evil is elusive and invincible How can we preventmolesters from molesting We cantmolesters are monsters and theyllcontinue to molest no matter what the penalty Never mind that the recidivismrate for child molesting is less than half the reported burglary rate and lowerthan that of many major felonies How can we catch them before they start Wecantanyone could be a molester How can we be sure children are telling thetruth about abuse We cantchildren are imaginative and easily influenced bysuggestion How can we tell whether recovered memories are accurate Wecant How can we make sure trials convict molesters and acquit the falselyaccused We cant Child abuse is horrible child abuse is inevitableMolesters are monsters monsters are everywhere            The consequence of this conceptual impasse according toKincaid is endless repetitive talking Both sides of the recovered memorydebatethose who believe the children and those who are skepticalrehearsethe same script over and over again claiming all the while to be breaking thesilence Their monsters differ Satanic pornographers and incestuous rapistson the one hand megalomaniac therapists on the other as do their helplessinnocents wounded children vs daycare Dreyfuses Both make demons out ofFreud and the media but neither steps outside the demonology to question whywere so obsessed with child abuse in the first place The story linethethreat the urgency the need to expose the extremist languageis thesame            Strangelythoughand this is the second half of Kincaids thesisthis repetitiveness isin some nasty little way exactly what we want Its pleasurable The more weexclaim how horrified we are by child molestation the more we can permitourselves to linger in a way thats not far from lascivious over images ofchildish bodies Little tummies Little bottoms Little feet The more wecondemn the perversity of child beauty pageants the more we get to watchluscious little JonBenet Ramsey bat her baby eyelashes and to imagine her gorydeath But theres more Talking about abuse not only permits guiltlessvoyeurismit also gives shape to inchoate feelings of childhood hurt it tellsus why we are the way we are and gives us someone to blame and it deflects asense of cultural or moral decline onto a group of particular individuals Inshort Kincaid concludes not without a certain glee Eroticizing exists insymbiotic relation with sanitizing and the veiling and the exposing exist inan encircling doublespeak            This particular brand of sexual doublespeak hasbeen remarked upon before most famously by the late French historian MichelFoucault who in his History of Sexuality published in English in put forth his unexpected repressive hypothesis Those supposedlytightlipped Victorians in the course of devising rules to regulate sex andthe sciences that investigate its perversions in fact talked and wrote moreabout sex than anyone before them            Thepeople enmeshed in this culture of sex could no more escape or stand outsideit Foucault held than they could stand outside their own language Kincaid isnothing if not an optimist though and he believes that if whats wrong withthe way we talk about child molesting is genrewere telling the wrong kindsof storieswell then we should just start telling different ones How Firstof all by acknowledging rather than suppressing in a panic the eroticfeelings we have about children We should realize that finding childrenseductive does not compel us to fondle them in a yucky way as the daycareprosecutors so nicely put it And then we should follow the series of stepsthat Kincaid lays outsteps such as  Stop looking for monsters and theirvictims  Stop listening to simpleminded stories and  Stop tracingeverything backward looking always to the past for sources explanations andexcuses Those who have trouble with the first stage of the process Kincaidadvises thus If you find yourself getting too excited going too far wantingto incite or not to stopthen stop            Its possible to dismiss such prescriptions as naive butin the context of the quasideterministic Foucauldianism from which Kincaidsbrand of cultural criticism emerges theyre refreshingeven startling Whenwas the last time a Foucauldian offered a stepbystep cure for culturalmalaise Kincaids eccentric combination of suspicious narrative analysis andselfhelp cando enthusiasm may be just the Dale Carnegie twist these oldideas need No the problem with his analysis is not the prescriptions nor isit his occasional failure to restrain himself in the silly jokes departmentInnocence is a lot like the air in your tires Theres not a lot you can dowith it but lose it Its that Kincaid cant help himself Hes starryeyedabout children too            According to Kincaid thereal problem with our obsession with child sexual abuse is that it distracts usfrom other kinds of abuse that affect far more children than molesting doesboring unsensational kinds of abuse such as poverty neglect and bad schoolsThe question though is why these things should be considered childabusewhy they should be considered more evil when visited upon children thanupon adults Kincaid believes we should hold on to the sweet noneroticdimensions of the Romantic child cult We should still adore the child as theangelic innocent Blake and Wordsworth wrote about But its precisely thissacred little creature that generates the Manichaean stories hes complainingabout            After all as long as abusingchildren is considered somehow much worse than abusing adults childabuserssexual or otherwisewill be thought of as monsters Idealizedchildren shortcircuit politics because where they are concerned people tendto say things like even one child abused or hurt or hungry or killed isunacceptable whereas politics needs to be able to weigh risks to some peopleagainst risks to others Ian Hacking a philosopher who has written acutelyabout child abuse has observed that America seems to be the only country withabuse legislation specific to children Our zeal in defending children is notuniversal and not to be taken for granted Why do we have special charitiesdevoted to children Why do we consider the Oklahoma bombing especially vilebecause it killed children Why do we decide custody cases according to thebest interests of the child as opposed to the parents interests Thisis the stuff Gothic narratives are made of
