                                 Ethnicity Slickers                           But TheyreHarmless Stereotypes                        In The Merchant of Menace  BruceGottlieb for using racial stereotyping in the new Star Wars movie Whileits undeniably true that Jar Jar Binks is reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit andthose two noseless Federation guys are sinister Asians of the type not seensince World War II movies I take issue with the implication that this isharmful            Lets face itthese stereotypes have been out ofcirculation for  or  years kept alive almost exclusively by crackpotracists and horrified antistereotype brigades mostly the latter Your typicalyearold does not associate those traits with those ethnic groups Lucasstigmatizes no one but computergenerated alien creatures with theseportrayalsin fact a black man is prominent on the Jedi counsel There is adistinct Asian influence in the court of the queen of Naboo As Gottlieb pointsout the ultimate villain of the story is an influential rich white guy            Lucas has beenappropriating elements from other movies his entire career It only makes sensethat he would revive these longunused stereotypes and squeeze them for theirentertainment value I salute him for finding ways to do it without hurtingreal people                           Daniel Krause Canoga Park Calif                                             Bruce Gottliebreplies                               The response to my recent article The Merchantof Menace  has been overwhelming emails and counting In thatarticle I argued that The Phantom Menace revives longstanding racialstereotypes about Asians Jews and blacks Many of the  emails told methat I was wrong to make this claim A smaller number told me that I was rightOther than what I wrote in the initial article I have nothing to add to thisdebate                                       But a number of respondents such as DanielKrause concede that Lucas did indeed revive racial stereotypes but think thisrevival is no big deal Krause says that in this modern age stereotypes nolonger have the power to do harm A surprisingly large number of respondentsadd that only intentional racial stereotypes are harmful and as I say in theoriginal article I dont think Lucas intended to offend anyone                                       Frankly I had not anticipated this type ofargument Id always assumed that the revival of certain racial stereotypes ina childrens movie would be universally deplored But apparently not everyonefeels this way                                       So why is it wrong to milk ancient stereotypesfor modernday laughs Mostly it is tasteless since the racial stereotypes atissue have been used to justify all sorts of historical barbaritiesAdmittedly there is no bright line dividing an ethnic joke that seems funnyfrom one that is vicious The ingredients of humor are hard to pin down Butreviving Shylockwithout a trace of historical awarenessto amuseuncomprehending children seems obviously vicious rather than funny At least tome One thing is sureit certainly is not imaginative                                       And there is yetanother valid concern that the widespread transmission of racial stereotypesmight indeed be helpful to hate groups The influence is sure to be diffuseMany claims about the influence of popular culture are exaggerated But itshard to believe that people are not affected by the images and stereotypes theyencounter as children I am not completely confident that racial stereotypingin movies has a significant effect on racial politics But neither am Iconfident that it doesnt                                       Naboo TeaParty                        I liked James Surowieckis in the imaginaryuniverse of The Phantom Menace Moneybox But his attempt tocharacterize the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal asridiculously hostile to taxation forgets that the Journal people are ingood company Have you forgotten US history By making a tax dispute theputative reason for invading a planet Lucas merely transposed historicalevents that Americans ought to be familiar with Beyond substituting spacecraftfor sailing ships it wasnt much of a reach Does Boston Tea Party ring anybells How about Lexington and Concord or no taxation withoutrepresentation            Moviegoers are told verylittle about why Naboo was invaded but the few facts we get are crediblealbeit too sparse to test with the criteria for just wars                           Patrick OHannigan San Luis Obispo

value of writing for television and movies  Whateither of them has to say is irrelevant Halfhour comedy writers write jokesnot shows One exception which they both ridiculed is in my opinionSports Night             As far as screenwriters go it is hard to remembera movie in the last few years that is as well written as the primetime dramaswe have seen in the past  years I am referring to Hill Street Blues LA Law  Murder One  Picket Fences  Chicago Hopethe Kelly years Law  Order  Homicide Life on the Street Brooklyn South  The Practice  and yes even Ally McBeal Show me any halfhour show that approaches the wit intelligence characterrelevance and drama of the shows I mentioned            We are experiencing right now a golden age of dramaon television not in the theater not in movies but mainly in the oclockto oclock hour almost every night Look at these scripts then goback and look at what was called the golden age of television in the sSadly most of it doesnt hold up compared to what we see now            There are some finewriters out here and they are writing drama not jokes                           RobertDuncan Sherman Oaks Calif
