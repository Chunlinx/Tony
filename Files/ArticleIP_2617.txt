                                 No  for No             This October Avis Rent ACar will be spun off by its parent company personal services franchise giantHFS Inc in a million initial public offering I have a modest proposalfor the people who try harder To let shareholders know what theyre in forAvis should change its name From now on well call the company Fad I thinkits got quite a ring to it            Now itstrue that not long ago this very space was filled with invective againstcorporatename changes which may give you some sense of how far Ill go in pursuitof a catchy lead But in this case its impossible to resist for in the wordfad we have the entire history of Avisand the recent history of USbusinesssummed up in just three letters            Fittingly enough Avis roots lie in what turned out to beone of the great fads of the century namely air travel In  when WarrenAvis scraped together  and started his eponymous company rentalcaragencies were all in downtown urban areas making taxis the only way forbusiness travelers and tourists to get from airports to their destinationsAvis decided there was a huge market for rental cars at airports            At firstthere wasnt As Warren Avis described it a few years ago People just didntknow how to do it How could they It was only  There were no creditcards Nor were there courtesy vansoh the Dark Agesso the cars wereparked right outside the door and the rental agent would actually escort youto yours Eventually people caught on By  Avis was the secondlargestcompany in the industry behind only Hertz So Warren Avis sold it            That first sale the product of Warren Avisfear that he couldnt expand the company fast enough to keep up with thepostwar reinvestment boom was to a private financier named Richard Robie Overthe next  years the company would change hands  more times When the IPOis completed Avis will have its  th owner a collective ofshareholders in this case What makes this history of frontoffice turmoilreally notable is that it has been shaped in truly uncanny fashion by theprevailing currents of US business ideology            Avisfirst move into corporate faddom came in the early s when it waspurchased by ITT Now three different companies ITT was once one realcompany the kind that could topple a democratically elected government inChile without blinking an eye It was also the prototypical conglomerateassembling in the s a stunning array of companies from seemingly everyindustry on the globe When ITT owned Avis conglomeration was supposed to bethe recipe for success because diversification would allow companies to offsetlosses in one sector with gains from others Investors diversify theirportfolios the thinking went so why shouldnt large companies diversify theirownership            One reason they shouldnt it now seems is that unlesssomeone like Jack Welchof General Electricis in charge management tends toconcentrate on the industries they know something about and neglect those theydont Still conglomeration as a theory lasted well into the early s andAvis was there for all of it ITT sold the company to Norton Simon which wasthen bought whole by Esmark whose name was itself a product of corporatefaddism And then Esmark was purchased by Beatrice the ultimate consumercompany for the s selling Butterball turkeys Samsonite luggage andTropicana orange juice while paying millions of dollars for an ad campaigndesigned to create brand loyalty around a name Beatrice that did not appearon even one of its products            But thetransformation of Avis into a plaything for theoryspouting speculators didntreally happen until the s First Kohlberg Kravis Roberts the investmentfirm that made the leveraged buyout an art form bought Beatrice by assuminglarge levels of its debt The argument was that debt forced managements tobecome more efficient The important thing wasnt the size of the bottomlineprofit but rather increasing company cash flow Large interest payments wereapparently not the problem everyone had thought they were            As part of its effort to reduce Beatricesdebt KKR sold Avis to Wesray Capital a firm led by William Simon and Avismanagers Simon had brought LBOs to public notice when he and Wesray had firstbought Gibson Greetings a card company for  million and then  monthslater taken it public for  million That deal earned Simon himself million on an investment of  and not surprisingly made the LBO morepopular on Wall Street than bad contemporary art            Wesrayspurchase of Avis was trendy in three ways It was an LBO The company was runby management now which people argued would make Avis moreentrepreneurial And the company was no longer part of a conglomerate whichwas good because everyone was talking those days about focusing on your corebusiness But if the entrepreneurial spirit was willing the flesh wasapparently weak because less than two years later Wesray sold Avis to itsemployees who bought the company through whats called an Employee StockOwnership Plan            ESOPs were invented in the late s but did not becomepopular until the s Traditional thinking on employee ownership held thatemployees would sacrifice longterm gains for shortterm rewards which is whyeconomists consulting in postCommunist Eastern Europe disparaged workerownership Critics also suggested that with their salaries and stock wrappedup in the same company employees were putting too many eggs in one basketStrangely no one ever said the same about Michael Eisner But by the timeAvis employees bought the company the new thinking was that there was nobetter way of encouraging their creativity and dedication Avis employees saidone fan will be motivated they will be happy they will be competitive Ihave seen the future and it works            Actually it did work for awhile Avis profits jumped  percent in the first six months of employeeownership and the company remained profitable for the next decade But morerecently the bloom has gone from the ESOP rose and last year Avis was sold toHFS which also owns Howard Johnson Days Inn and Century  Conglomerationmay not be back in but franchising is and thats HFSs whole business Youmight say the acquisition of Avis was therefore inevitable And given therecent resurrection of the IPO market you might say the upcoming publicoffering was as well            Whats really interestingabout Avis is that each change in management has been accompanied by claims ofsuperiority and inevitability These claims cant after all all be rightThough in the s Congress did jiggle the tax rules in ways that encouragedboth LBOs and ESOPs If employees are the best owners then Simon was wrong toorchestrate the management buyout If franchising is more efficient the ESOPwas a mistake as were both conglomeration and the corebusiness focusBut nothing like this ever gets said The new moves in with scant reference tothe old The avatars of the new make huge sums of money all the whilepontificating about the efficiency and rationality of the market But themarket can be productive without being rational and you can have changewithout progress Right now Im waiting for Avis to announce that huge newinvestment that Bill Gates has made in its future
