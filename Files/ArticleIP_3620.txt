                                 Paying for Opera            If there is any art formthat cannot pay its own way it is opera Since the early  thcentury when George Friedrich Handel struggled to keep a company going inLondon opera has been sustainable only with the help of subsidieswhetherfrom aristocrats governments or corporate benefactors Even with ticketspriced up to  and higher at the best houses in the United States boxoffice revenues make up only half the cost of the show In cities such asVienna Paris and Berlin tickets can cost twice as much and contribute aneven smaller share of operating budgets Ill get to the question of why operacosts so much in a minute But for the moment assume that the problem isincorrigible If you want to live in a society in which opera continues toexist you have to decide who should pay for it            InEuropean countries the instinctive reply is the government But even inItaly Germany and Britain countries with long histories of public subsidyfor culture government support has recently drawn public fire While opera isthe most needy of the fine arts it is also the most elitist In the UnitedStates according to a justpublished survey of participation in the artsfewer than  percent of the public claims to have attended an opera in the lastyear and people probably exaggerate about this just as they do when asked howoften they have sex Around the world opera is synonymous with snobbery Itsreputation in England was not helped a couple of years ago when a Tory ministerdescribed the homeless in London as the sort of people you step on when youcome out of the opera Since the audience is rich snobs people say let richsnobs pay for it            Thats essentially the system we have here Wealthyindividuals and corporations make up the gap between box office revenues andoperating expensesamounting to  million in  according to OperaAmerica the Washingtonbased trade association But the idea that Americans donot publicly subsidize opera or the other arts is in fact erroneous We dosupport them quite generously not through the National Endowment for the Artsbut with a law that says contributions to charitable organizations aretaxdeductible Studies say that a dollar contributed to opera costs thegovernment between  and  cents in foregone revenue In other words operabenefits from the public purse to the tune of about  million a yearmorethan the entire proposed  budget of the NEA Why dont conservatives whowant to eliminate the NEA ever make the point that there is a multibilliondollar arts subsidy embedded in the tax code Click for the answer The million privately donated to the Metropolitan Opera in New York last year costthe government something like  million This is less than the direct subsidyof  billion lire  million the Italian government gives La Scala in Milanor the  million deutsche mark  million that Germany gives the BerlinStaatsoper but is slightly more than the Royal Opera in London gets            Operaenthusiasts in this country constantly lament the lack of direct governmentsupport for the arts Europeans on the other hand faced with a new climate ofbudgetary austerity countries are having to trim their deficits to join theEuropean Monetary System wonder how their cultural institutions can attractthe private money that seems to flow so freely in the United States With operafans on each side of the ocean admiring the others support system we mustask Which method of subsidizing opera is preferable            But first back to the cost question Why doesopera endemically require subsidies The short answer is that while theresonly one audience there are multiple performances all taking place at the sametime An opera is a symphony concert a choral recital a play a ballet amural and a fashion show all at once The number of people who work to put onone of these spectaclesbuilding the set brushing down the wigs turning thecrank that lowers Don Giovanni down into hellis incredible It can take people all of whom eat two or three times what normal people eat Then thereare the supernumerariesthe spear carriers peasants etc What would opera dowithout supernumeraries What would all those supernumeraries do withoutopera            Peoplewho work in the best American opera houses tend to be well paid but notridiculously so In her wonderfully gossipy new book about Cecilia BartoliCinderella  Company  Manuela Hoelterhoff digs out somehardtocomeby figures Top stars at the Met get  a performance forbetween nine and  performances If you factor in three weeks of unpaidrehearsal Placido Domingo gets less for singing at the Met than Cokie Robertsgets for speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers At  ayear Met General Manager Joseph Volpe is well paid but not absurdly so forsomeone who runs a  millionayear business and has to deal withmalingering divas instead of deferential corporate vice presidents            Those hoping to reduce costs run smack up against BaumolsLaw named for the economist William Baumol who first elaborated it in a book titled Performing Arts The Economic Dilemma  Baumols Law saysthat in certain sectors productivity cannot increase It takes the same numberof musicians the same amount of time to perform The Barber of Sevilletoday as it did in  In fact thanks to union contracts it actually takesmore musiciansyou pay an orchestra big enough for Wagner even when youprogram Rossini In order for the wages of the skilled professionals whoperform an opera to keep pace with those in other sectors of the economy whereproductivity does improve the cost must inflate In short theres noalternative to subsidy            Given thisstate of affairs whose system of subsidy is better The European model has theadvantage of being forthright The government declares that it wants morePuccini than the market provides on its own and it writes a check to pay forit Though this means that there is political oversight of artistic decisionsin theory this structure yields considerable creative freedom in practice Butbecause a third party is paying most of the bill theres less pressure toplease the audience This can encourage complacency artistic mediocritywelfare dependency and the restwhich may be why fans say the best Americanoperas companies are now of higher quality and consistency than the bestcontinental ones Marc Scorca the president of Opera America says that themore he learns about the European system the less envious of it he isAmerican opera companies cant sustain the mostly empty houses Scorca says hewitnessed on a recent trip to Germany And the kind of catastrophic financialmismanagement that has resulted in the British Royal Opera closing down for thecoming season is less likely when managers have to raise the moneythemselves            In the United States pleasing the audience isdoubly importantnot just because the box office take contributes a higherpercentage of overall revenues but also because the subscribers arecontributors too This incentive system keeps opera companies lean andhungryand American opera houses filled near capacity The need to win privatesupport may encourage a higher degree of artistic conservatismtoo manyperformances of crowd pleasers like Tosca instead of works by th century composersand an overreliance on bigname superstarsBut it has the advantage of seeming fairer to culturephobes The samegovernment benefita tax deduction for all charitable contributionsflows tosupporters of the Houston Opera and supporters of the Christian Coalition inproportion to their generosity and enthusiasm Society gets more music than thefree market would provide and more churches            Onbalance I think our system of paying for opera is more rational But then asreading Hoelterhoffs book will remind you the words opera and rationalseldom belong in the same sentence                           If you missed the linkon why
