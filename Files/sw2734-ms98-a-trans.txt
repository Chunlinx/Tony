          whats the uh in Texas law has a uh what does it have it has a death penalty doesnt it   oh yes yeah they just uh started it again too just late or within the past few years you know for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty   but now its coming back into favor   uh yes well they find it is more deterrent   well my sociology class at SMUs taught us that it was not a deterrent uh but now thats just what they said uh i dont know maybe maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now theyd say it is a deterrent   well uh if you   maybe theyve changed their minds   you know compare the figures i think thats where theyre uh theyre coming from the uh   maybe thats it maybe thats it because that was back in the seventies   oh there yes they are that was before the uh uh they adopted the death law again but uh i i myself am in favor of it uh particularly for uh well i think Texas has a good good law uh crimes murders related with uh drugs or killing a policemen   i think i agree but i think it ought to be expanded to include children i i think theyre they have theyre working on uh something in Austin now   uhhuh   and im not sure what it is i just remember seeing a uh kind of a synopsis of it   uhhuh well why stop at children why not go to adults too   well uh im im personally very in favor of it   uhhuh   uh why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after theyve mowed down a class yard full of kids or tried or tried to or done their very you know given their best effort at doing that   uhhuh yep   i i dont care to support them   well i dont either but uh uh but there is something to be said about or uh uh just just for the sake of argument im taking the a con im im against   sure   uh you know yourself how many times have you heard where uh uh a citizen was wrongfully arrested   uhhuh uhhuh   and served time at a penitentiary uh just recently this uh black man served nine years was it   and then there was the black woman that uh robbed and shot the furrier   for robbery   and she was set free too just in two examples in Texas recently   uhhuh   but she actually killed the furrier or someone she was charged with murder and then then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something i didnt i dont  i didnt retain all those facts very well but i know what youre what if we make a mistake   thats it   and thats not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything   uhhuh well right now our laws are so liberal that uh even with the death penalty in effect i dont think that uh   theyre going to use it uh too frequently uh unfortunately i like you say yes lets have it uh unfortunately i like you say yes lets have it put them all give them all a shot get rid of them   well   why should they be sitting sitting in uh prison getting their college degree   well i guess though where i would have a problem with it if i were on the jury that that put that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the persons guilty   uhhuh   now thats tougher its easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that yeah the death penaltys the way to go its a deterrent to crime they shouldnt catch themselves in that circumstance anyway but to be the actual one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me   yes very true i uh i agree with you there uh   i think id probably do it but we could never say what we would do if were not in the circumstance it thats thats thats a real easy  thing to say that oh sure i would but i dont know   uhhuh well i myself wouldnt want to be on the jury like that uh i it its uh thats an awful lot to uh to expect of a person to uh to kill somebody is what it amounts to   well yes but you know thats what they did   it true very true but they they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason   or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted   yeah well uh   and they they wanted something worse than they more than they respect the human life   uhhuh yeah exactly well anyhow i guess we both agree that that it is it should be in effect     hang them yeah yeah i agree it should be in effect also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement uh so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect but i want maybe well id i now i have a problem with this too i think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance   oh thats true well now any uh just believe in just about any state in the union uh uh a death uh or uh yeah death verdict is an automatic uh appeal   thats correct it is  it is   and uh uh yes im inclined to agree with you i think so there should be a limit as to the number of appeals   now theres some and maybe now i dont remember if this is Texas or not that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence   um um well no   convicted drug dealers   not just for dealing in drugs it uh   is it what is whats the rule   there are certain circumstances and i dont remember what they are   its something of the distribution theyre on the distribution end   uh yes   theyre not selling them theyre distributing them its for the large dealers is what its reserved for   uhhuh   and they they are in effect killing people   oh oh yes yes i i believe its any capital crime related to drugs   oh okay   i think thats the way its worded   is that how its worded i knew it was there but i i or proposed or is it proposed or is it passed   i do believe thats in uh i wouldnt swear to it myself but i thought it i thought it was in effect   i believe it is i believe youre right though i think it is and i have to agree with that   uhhuh   i i think it certainly should be one of the options uh ive been fortunate with my children and grandchildren so far that i know i qualify that heavily because you never know       but to the best of my knowledge we havent had a major problem yet   uhhuh   but it just touches so many young people   oh it does uh i have four sons myself and the youngest is twenty eight so they are all pretty well grown up and they all went through it you know going through high school and everything   um   and knock wood that uh they have not well i wont say they didnt try it uh i wouldnt know but uh they i doubt very much that theyre theyre using it now in fact im sure they dont   well my children are about in the same age bracket i thi nk lets see the oldest is thirty two and the youngest is probably twenty seven twenty eight   huh   so its the same age bracket   yes   and theres four two girls and two boys and i think one of each experimented very slightly with pot and i think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge   uhhuh yeah thats usually the way it is it its just uh try it out with their peers and none of them even smoke they dont uh they never been strangely enough uh their mother and i both smoked when they were growing up now my my my wife my exwife she quit uh well when she was pregnant with the last one and she never started up again and i just quit oh about fourteen months and two weeks ago   boy thats tough   yes it is i and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by   my husband hasnt quit yet and he knows he should and he knows and he knows but he hasnt   um   i do respect the fact though that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me he hes very conscious of of passive smoking and hes concerned about it but   well   hasnt quite made it yet   well when i was still smoking i i felt that way if i was in a public restaurant seated at table with uh non smokers i would try to pick a seat a a my seat where the smoke would blow away from them or id hold the cigarette under the table   yeah ive seen all of this yeah   and uh but uh now im on the shoes on the other foot uh im aware of other people smoking now   well Charles will actually Charles will not smoke in anyone elses house except our own   um   he will get up and hell go outside you know and he hes so when were invited to peoples house he will not smoke in their house which i think is good because theres a lot of people that are very particularly if they have children   yes uhhuh   but uh and hes you know he tries his best but the actual quitting he hasnt done he changed brands to a brand he doesnt like he put up all of his ash trays he will not smoke in a comfortable position you know but still  hes done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking  its a   uh uhhuh   it is long process   well the theres a trick i use they used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment   oh how neat   and every time i wanted one i have to go outside and just take one one at a time and uh that thats gets to be uh a deterrent   he has his in the kitchen
