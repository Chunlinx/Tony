                                 The Sturgeon King            The s American ban onCuban cigars so devastated Fidel Castro that American policymakers didnthesitate a decade later to punish the flagburning ayatollahs with a similarban on Iranian caviar By now an entire generation of American cigar smokershas paid the price of freedom by buying overpriced ersatz Havanas made in theDominican Republic or Honduras from imitation Cuban tobacco Since the collapseof the Soviet Union and the descent into anarchy of much of the former Sovietsturgeon fishery the leaders of the free world have also become the primarymarket for inedible caviar processed from sturgeon caught by Russian and Kazakhpoachers and clumsily salted in clandestine plants by shady postSovietcapitalists            Americanswho want a decent smoke can smuggle Cohibas but caviar enthusiasts can survivethe Iranian embargo legally by calling the Browne Trading Co in PortlandMaine at   Rod Mitchell Browne Tradings president importsimpeccable Russian caviar selected from the few former Soviet processors thatstill observe the old rules originally imposed by the czars faithfully honoredby the Bolsheviks but ignored since  by Russian free marketers            Mitchell who has built his business on the delicacy of hispalate he was profiled last week in the New York Times as the primesupplier of the citys highend fish speaks with the understated authority ofa master craftsman He claims he can taste the difference between caviar fromone sturgeon and another One reason to give him the benefit of the doubt isthat on his mothers side hes a Browne descended from a family that begantrading caviar nearly four centuries ago from Atlantic sturgeon caught at themouth of the Kennebec River north of Portland Another reason is that thegleaming caviar Mitchell imports from the former Soviet Union is pure magicSpoonful after spoonful plays across the palate like an ocean breeze If moneywere not an issue an average American in good health could dispose of a poundof Mitchells golden osetra in a single afternoon A third reason is that hiscaviar is favored by many of the chefs who occupy Americas culinarystratosphere Daniel Boulud of Daniels calls it the pearl of our businessEric Ripert of Le Bernardin has been serving it for the past five years GrayKunz of Lespinasse calls it a benchmark I have known wine tasters who say theycan distinguish in a sip of Burgundy the intensity of autumn sunshine thatwarmed a particular slope of the Cte dOr a decade ago And there arecabinetmakers I have heard of who can diagnose the health of the tree when itwas alive by the feel of its grain in a length of seasoned lumber But RodMitchell is the only craftsman I know who can credibly claim such intimacy withsturgeon            The brochure that Mitchell and his wife Cyndehave designed for their Browne Trading Co features a photograph taken in of Rods maternal relatives standing over a young Atlantic sturgeon weighingperhaps  pounds Full grown these fish weigh two to three times as much andare now a protected species but they were once so abundant in American watersthat Aaron Burr claimed he could cross the Hudson from Manhattan to New Jerseyon their backs In those innocent years of the young republic Americans didnteat much caviar What they didnt carelessly discard they packed in salt andshipped to the tables of Europes great nobles By the time American appetitesoutgrew their democratic origins local sturgeon had become scarce Now theworlds best caviar comes from the Caspian Seamost of it from the Iranianside which means it cant be sold in the United States            The timeto harvest sturgeon is at the appropriate moment during their seasonal journeyupstream to spawn Mitchell selects his caviar from the longestablishedprocessing plants at the mouth of the Volga at Astrakhan and at Atyraformerly Guriev where the Ural empties into the Caspian in Kazakhstan Theseplants still strictly control the catch along the spawning grounds butpoachers now take sturgeon with impunity from the depths of the Caspian beforetheir eggs are firm It is caviar from these fish that is clumsily processedand enters the American market for sale often at bargain prices to unwarybuyers Wary buyers however can spot such caviar instantly The aroma islikely to be fishy or stale The eggs will seem shapeless and gummy or oily andfilmed with a whitish glaze The flavor will be strong or dull or salty Theeggs may be of various colors and sizes or have turned to jelly            If Rod Mitchell were placed in a lineup of suspected caviarexperts he would be the least likely choice When we met for lunch the otherday at Daniels restaurant in Manhattan Mitchell looked much younger than his years and though he was well turned out in suit and tie I felt he would bemuch happier on the deck of the Pequod  Twentyfive years ago Mitchellhad a summer job running the launch at Maines Camden Yacht Club when ayachtsman offered him a job selling wine in a shop he had just opened in arestored  th century mill The shop stocked Montrachets andHautBrions for Camdens summer aristocracy and soon Mitchell was sellingFrench cheese foie                gras  and so on One day JeanLouis Palladinwhose Watergate restaurant in Washington DC would soon elevate him toculinary stardom walked into the shop and asked for caviar When Mitchellconfessed he didnt stock it Palladin offered to introduce him to an Iranianimporter That winter Mitchell began selling his Caspian caviar to chefs inBoston The following summer another of his customers who owns one of Francesgreat firstgrowth vineyards invited him to Bordeaux and it was there thatMitchell decided on the career in fine food that would eventually lead him toreestablish Browne Trading the family business that for generations hadbeen selling caviar fish and other seafood from the mouth of theKennebec            You donthave to own a restaurant to order Mitchells caviar If youve just won thelottery or taken your Internet company public you can probably afford to treatyourself to  ounces of his beluga at  The same quantity of osetra whichcomes from a much smaller species of sturgeon whose eggs are about a third thesize of beluga but whose flavor many people prefer costs  Two ounces ofsevruga from the smallest of the three Caspian species can be had for a mere Since silver spoons sometimes lend a metallic taste to caviar Mitchellsells spoons made of motherofpearl for as little as  a pair or you cansave your money and use plastic            Whatever you do never serve caviar withchopped egg or onion or capers and use lemon sparingly if at all These arerelics of a time when fresh caviar of the best quality was hard to find in theUnited States The best way to enjoy Mitchells caviar is just as it comes fromthe tin If you have some left over it will keep in the refrigerator for aweek or so as long as you stir it from time to time so that the surfacedoesnt dry out Caviar in tins that have never been opened can be kept forlonger periods at  degrees Fahrenheit At that temperature the oil will keepthe caviar from freezing Home freezers which are much colder are notrecommended            Though it is always best toeat caviar by itself you might try a spoonful atop some of Mitchells belonoysters the intensely flavored French variety that has been transplanted toMaine waters and now grows wild there Or to enliven an otherwise slowafternoon you might remove the upper third of an eggshell deposit the raw eggin a small pitcher or juice glass and scramble it under the steam nozzle of anespresso machine Then return the cooked egg to the lower portion of theeggshell mix with a spoonful of osetra and have a second and third egg onhand with which to repeat the process until satiated If you accompany each eggwith a shot of triple distilled ice cold vodka your afternoon will soonacquire a dreamlike consistency
