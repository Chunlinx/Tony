                                 The Impossible Dream of Equality                        Dear Nat            You strike a balanced note at the end of your message that I think isabsolutely appropriate On the subject of heredity you note that some portionof intelligence does seem to be hereditary or at least so many serious peoplesay So while we should try to reduce inequality of opportunity there willalways be some since some people are born smarter and that intelligence mayreproduce itself down the generations            That doesnt mean we need dwell on the negative As Lemanns narrative makesclear the current meritocratic sorting system has done a good deal to reduceinequality of opportunity The s elite was based on blood and to a muchlarger extent looksthings that are totally and overwhelmingly hereditary FScott Fitzgerald once remarked that the elite of his day consisted of animalmagnetism married to money One of the virtues of the educationbased elite ofours is that it has reduced the influence of looks magnetism and socialpolish though it will never get rid of them            Lemann also makes it clear that the current meritocratic system is far moreegalitarian than its intellectual founders Chauncey and Conant intended Theywanted to create a small elite class of guardians who would serve the publicselflessly That was elitist and America tends to wash away elitist plans Itwas also naive and reality tends to smash those notions There is never goingto be a selfless class of guardians no matter what Plato may have imaginedOne of the nice things about Lemanns story is the way it moves from Conantslofty writings down to the gritty struggles of politics and campaigns showinghow the original ideasorting people by scientific testswas twisted byevents            I finish this exchange more aware of the limitations of our currentmeritocracy but not moved to support radical changes to it The SAT has openedup opportunity for millions of people Lemann would not disagree But I thinkit would be pushing things too far to make the sorts of changes Lemann hints atin his conclusion That would be to try to impose an overly egalitarian planonto a society that is interested in opportunity and striving If theres onething we have learned this century it is that you cant forcefeedegalitarianism on human beingsAnyway its been an honor chatting with you about this but now Ive got totoddle off and work on a review Im writing on Frederick Law Olmsted for ajournal called The Public Interest  The editors there will skin me aliveif I miss my deadline            All the bestDavid
