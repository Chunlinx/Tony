                okay  you want to get a start   certainly um the weather here is warm and its been sort of raining on and off   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh im an avid gardener so i measure measure measure the rain in our rain gauge on a on a regular basis so i can can avoid wasting money on watering   oh great great uhhuh   and uh but its been threatening to rain for the last couple of days and it has not really which is a bit of a disappointment but it is very warm here which is typical for this part of the time of the year how about Pennsylvania     umhum yeah i think youre i think youre earlier than we are as a rule arent you your your your summer growing summer starts a lot earlier than ours   it starts in uh March as a rule   uhhuh see that is quite a bit we are just beginning people are have got their gardens in a lot of them now we could still have a frost   really this late could you have snow   umhum uh probably not but we have had we have had a frost as late as as in June   oh well we dont have that problem   early june  so but we we have also had nice weather an unusually uh nice spring it is almost like an early summer for us   oh well that is nice   uhhuh we could use a little more rain i believe   uh well we will be glad i will be glad to give you some of ours  usually we get it in in great quantities in April and May   uh umhum umhum   and then it stops for three months   yeah if it could just be spread out a little bit uhhuh uhhuh yeah its really been nice here uh   right   were supposed to have some rain this weekend but i dont know if well get it or not a lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us the the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us just by  well not too many miles   um are you in an agricultural area   yes umhum we have   well i know the weather i know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of off of the land   umhum umhum yeah we have quite a few farmers we we live out in the country were on a farm but were not a farming person  uh we have a garden but uh but were not farmers   uhhuh uhhuh hum well you know there are some disadvantages to being down south and that is it gets so hot that you know a lot of things die during the summer from the heat   um oh yeah they get burnt off   they they really do and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered   uhhuh uhhuh yeah well and that makes it bad too because uh when more with water being at a premium i know our aunt in California they theyve really been rationed on their water and it makes it real hard to have a yard or  uh or anything like that a garden their garden their farms their farmers i guess are hurting because of that also   yeah well my parents are now in San Diego and and theyve got pebbles in their yard because they cant almost nobody there has has lawns   yeah yeah well they are not allowed to water so what do you do yeah   yeah uh it is very it is very rough on them so actually i think i think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas because the the summers are extremely hot   uhhuh umhum but your humidity is different though than ours i think and it makes a a bit of a difference too   um what is your humidity humidity like   oh i dont know i think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas i could be wrong   uh i dont know what what it is percentage wise but i   i dont know for sure either but it always seems  well it just felt different like when we were in Texas it had a different feel to it   yeah its its drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin which is further south but it is not dry and and i have lived here for many years and i think it has gotten more humid over the years where the water is coming from i dont know   um um umhum uhhuh well it could be  i know my brothers home has been flooded a couple of times uh   oh does he live near the lake   well there is a lake not far but it is more run off from surrounding you know areas and that   uhhuh um   and uh hes just in an area where it is just low enough that its you know it it collects there and uh he has had a couple of inches in his house several times   umhum thats thats a problem uh they tell you when you are looking for a house or or or buying land to build on to be very careful and check the drainage because uh it is it is deceptive   umhum umhum umhum because of that umhum   and uh i know exactly what you mean   we are fortunate or uh we are on a where we are we get flooded it floods below us  behind us but were uh we are high enough that our house itself we never you know have had any problem like that   uhhuh oh well that is fortunate   yeah it is an old farm house and uh we really like it here   umhum well i i like it i like it here uh i i grew up here i have lived other places and and but i i did grow up here and this is very much home for me and   uhhuh uhhuh it is nice down there i i i liked it when we visited there   i hope you visited during the winter one of my one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter and you go to cold cool places that well i go to cool places during the summer if i can anyway   right right that is the best time to go yeah and and usually it has been when we have gone it has been nice it has been hot but it is it is hot to me in the wintertime down there   oh sure i mean   you know  but it is nice its uh its really a nice area   i i had a friend from England visit once at Christmas and we couldnt get her out of the what she called the back garden because she wanted to go back with a sunburn and she went back to the north of England with a sunburn   oh really oh oh good heavens  not me  i avoid the sun   well yeah basically i do too   yeah it takes me about four and a half hours to do to mow our grass and i try to cover up when i do the lawn   well i that that is really healthier frankly   yeah well i have had a little a couple of problems and uh i decided it is not worth it i i like to get tan in the summer time because i think you look healthier and uh we are just crazy   umhum that but you you know it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot now my sister is a a sun fiend and uh she is five years younger than me she is more wrinkled   uhhuh is that right it it just makes your skin more leathery it uh it yeah so   yeah and i think thats why exactly i think it burns off the i dont know the the the theory th e scientific principle but it burns something off the natural oils or something like that   umhum well the elasticity of your skin the collagen or whatever they call it they say it destroys a lot of that and you lose a lot of that so uh   yes yes uh that sounds like a good that sounds like the right theory   yeah but uh but we have really had nice the weather i cant complain we have really had really good weather of late and when it has rained it had its been a good soaking rain and uh   good   its just been a really nice Spring   well thats great its been its been very nice here too and i hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening and i want them to have nice weather   oh   for their visit instead of driving around in the rain   oh thats great how long will they be there   uh probably four or five days   uhhuh well that is great well i hope the weather stays real good for them and and uh that you have a good visit and everything and i hope your garden does good   well thank you thanks yeah and the same to you   and so okay well it was really nice talking to you and uh   a pleasure   good luck in your this venture it is uh like i said it has been real interesting so i hope you enjoy it as much as i have been enjoying it   im sure i will in in fact if i hadnt been preparing for this the out of town visitors i probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days   yeah i forget to the day goes by and i forget to make a call  usually   well i am glad you have broken the ice with me because now ill ill start doing it  okay well thanks Jean byebye   great great okay uh byebye
