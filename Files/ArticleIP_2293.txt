                                 Payback Time            Back when Republicans ownedthe White House and Democrats ran the Senate Orrin Hatch of Utah was theFlorence Nightingale of wounded nominees He called it a tragedy thatpolitics had entered the judicialnomination system Defending Robert BorkHatch commented When you have a man of this caliber I think its justterrible to try and make an ideological battle out of it When it came toexecutivebranch appointments Hatch was adamant that the Senate defer to thepresidents choices On this basis he stood up for William Bradford Reynoldsrejected for the No  job at the Justice Department in  and WilliamLucas shot down as head of the civilrights division in             Now Hatchis chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and hes the one blocking thepresidents choicesmost recently the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to beassistant attorney general for civil rights Aware that he is vulnerable to acharge of double standards Hatch has his defense ready He says hes not ahypocrite because the Democrats changed the rules In a hearing before therecess Sen Patrick Leahy DVt proposed that the committee pass the Leenomination on to the full Senate without a recommendation something Hatch hadwanted to do for Lucas eight years ago Hatch responded that sauce for thegoose is sauce for the gander I argued for reporting the nominations of BradReynolds and Bill Lucas without recommendations he said But Sens BidenKennedy Leahy and Kohl all voted no            Theres no denying that Democrats changed the rules AsStephen Carter explains in his book The Confirmation Mess  contestedappointments were relatively rare from the s through the s But aroundthe time Ronald Reagan became president Democrats rediscovered the moreliteral preReconstruction understanding of advice and consent This initself is ironic Usually it is Republicans who insist on taking the words ofthe Constitution literally and Democrats who argue for a broaderinterpretation In  the Democrats forced Ernest Lefever to withdraw as anominee for assistant secretary of state for human rights because he gave noindication of caring about human rights It didnt help matters when familymembers said Lefever thought blacks were genetically inferior or when Lefeverhimself told Sen Charles Percy that his opponents were part of a Communistconspiracy In  the judiciary committee prevented Reynolds from moving upat Justice because of the Reagan administrations positionwhich Reynoldsendorsedthat Bob Jones University which forbade and continues to forbidinterracial dating should be allowed to keep its taxexempt status This wasfollowed by the rejection of Bork for the Supreme Court of John Tower forsecretary of defense and of Lucas The new Democratic standard was thatdeference could no longer be expected at least for jobs involving civil andhuman rights            Conservatives contend theyre just playing bythese rules A deeply satisfying and entirely valid reason for rejecting thenomination is payback George Will wrote in a recent column on Lee Othersmade the same argument about Lani Guinier who never even got a hearing for thecivilrights job in  and about Walter Dellinger who served for severalyears as acting solicitor general because Republicans wouldnt confirmhim            But infact the GOP has gone beyond tit for tat Democrats always conjured up somekind of pretext Reynolds hadnt enforced the law Lucas had no background incivilrights enforcement and hadnt declared some stuff at customs In Leescase however Hatch says hes opposing a qualified nominee simply to draw theline on an administration position he disagrees with I think its time for usto that are dividing America and ripping us apart he declared incommittee            Furthermore Republicans have done away with deference fora whole range of posts that touch upon contentious social issues not justthose involving civil rights Before the  election Republicans killed thenomination of Henry Foster to be surgeon general because of his support forlegalized abortion Now they are sitting on the nomination of David Satcher forthe same reason Hatch has also been holding up dozens of nominations forfederal judgeships In these cases as in Lees conservatives have taken theimplicit position that if the presidents nominee shares the presidents viewsthat is reason enough for rejection            Nothingcan stop the Republicans from changing the rules of the nomination processunilaterally as the Democrats did in the s And theres no way to enforceconsistency Conservatives are free to defer to the president on ambassadorsand secretaries of Commerce but not on chairpersons of the NEA and surgeonsgeneral if they so desire It is also egregiously unfair to charge as SenBarbara Mikulski DMd and others have that Hatch and his colleagues areguilty of antiAsian racism because they have chosen to make a fuss in Leescase and not in others But ability and good sense are two different thingsHatchs zerodeference stance is a foolish one even for those who share hispolitics            The first problem with the Hatch standard isthat it wont work If senators take the position that they will not acceptpresidential nominees who share the presidents views on important issues manyjobs will remain perpetually unfilled In the case of civilrights enforcementthis might not bother Republicans many of whom dont believe in the wholeconcept But keeping an important post vacant may actually undermine theattempt to change the policy it represents Civilrights enforcement can bedirected more quietly from another desk As long as it is there wont be anypoint person to answer for administration policies or to the public In thecase of judicial nominees theres a more serious problem of justice delayedwhich as we know is justice denied due to a shortage of judges            Thesecond problem is less tangible The more policy disputes are personified themore the confirmation process becomes a war of martyrs and dragon slayers theuglier and more unproductive politics becomes On top of the many sacrificespublic servants already must makedisclosure lower pay restrictions on whatthey can do after they leavethey must increasingly bank on being gratuitouslyripped apart by a totally politicized confirmation process This seems too muchto ask Already those who aspire to confirmation must express themselves ineuphemisms and pretend to have no views            Theres no reason why affirmative action in particularneeds to be fought out at this sublimated level In recent decisions theSupreme Court has both circumscribed preferential policies and made clear thatthey can be limited or abolished by legislation If Hatch and his party want totry to proscribe raceconscious policies by democratic means nobodys stoppingthem from trying that is            The last issue is practicalSome day divided government will again be divided the other way When thathappens Democrats will be bound to escalate the confirmation battle once moreto settle their score with Hatch And so on and so on The game of paybacknever ends
