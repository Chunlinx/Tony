        i think im probably somewhere around a five on the scale they gave uh       um i dont like the idea of you know anyone being able to just sort of go up to a store and buy a hand gun for about uh you know forty dollars or whatever and go out and shoot someone but i also think that uh hunting is a legitimate use for weapons and uh i also sort of believe that although you know certainly our government is is very nice now it it probably doesnt hurt this sort of ultimate back up to have some some citizens to have guns if for some reason something ever happened and our government was run by someone who decided to make it non democratic well thats a very farfetched and you know sort of       you know paranoid if you will possibility but you know it i guess its its i think its its always sort of a bad idea when the only people that have guns are the military and the police since   well youre right there and uh i just think they should have a little more restriction on who buys guns   yeah i mean i i   instead of just being able to walk into a store and buy a gun they should have a waiting period   yeah i agree completely there should be a waiting period and they should be able to do a background check on you   exactly and i and as far as hunting im sure you know this is the same thing and if if you are a a you know a legitimate hunter or you just need a handgun or something like that a two week or three week wait period is not going to make any difference   yeah i mean most yeah i agree completely   if your criminal and you need a gun for that night its going you know its going to make you a little bit mad   yeah yeah yeah   but they should you know they should have some kind of restrictions and i think everybody should have to have a permit they dont require everybody to have a permit   yeah yeah   and i think they should if youre going to have a gun you need to to you know register it and and have a legitimate reason as to why you have it   yeah thats a reasonable   and it i i dont even think they do that in Texas do they   yeah uh i dont think so   i dont think so either   you need a permit to carry a concealed handgun i think in some states i think Texas might be one of those but to just carry you know one in the open or whatever is no problem   uhhuh umhum   um yeah although i one thing is i think no matter what rules you set unless you sort of had uh good enforcement of it it wouldnt matter i mean the types of people that cause trouble with handguns arent the sort to care what the law is anyway     thats true   um and im sure they would certainly attempt to buy them on the black market so youd need uh you know a good method of ensuring that they werent available there which given the success or rather lack there of of the police in controlling the market in drugs i sort of wonder uh you know really how effective it would be but i dont i dont mean that   i know itd just make it it would make it harder for them to get them but they still could but   yeah yeah i mean i dont mean it as an argument to not have waiting periods and that sort of thing but i just you know i just i think its something to be aware of that it probably would not be the the ultimate solution that would solve all crime problems   but youre right theyre always gonna yeah humum because theyre always going to be able to get them   um yeah uh do you do you have any sort of you know real real life experience with uh you know either people owning guns or people being uh you know assaulted with uh guns or anything like that   no not not really my my daddy was always a hunter so we always had rifles or shotguns or things around the house but you know he was responsible with those and   yeah yeah   um there was never an accident or anything like that and weve never been robbed or mugged or anything like that   yeah my dad hunted when he was young although he didnt um by the time i came along so we didnt we didnt have guns in in our house he left them at uh his parents house so you know i got to see them or whatever   umhum   but uh i do uh uh another student who i didnt know personally at Rice uh but uh its not that small that uh large a community about a week ago uh was shot in the head with a gun  yeah um he was you know going home sort of late at night after studying and uh   oh my goodness   you know robbers said you know i guess he was on a motorcycle and he had a his motorcycle helmet on which saved his life um because   my oh my goodness   they said you know we want your money you know we have gun or whatever so he was like okay here have my money you know ill lie on the ground ill do whatever you say ill im not going to put up any fight whatsoever and uh apparently there were two guys and one of them was really kind of jumpy and the other seemed kind of uh relaxed so he said to the relaxed guy hey you know please tell your friend not to shoot me you know but uh apparently the other guy for whatever reason uh shot him anyway   oh my goodness   and uh thanks to the fact his his motorcycle helmet was made out of Kevlar which is the same thing that bullet proof vest are made out of and so uh you know he was shot in the head but he was unharmed you know i mean i think i think he mightve gone to the hospital anyway just to you know be looked at but   oh oh my goodness   um he didnt even have a concussion or or anything like that   oh how frightening   but uh so its kind of scary   it really is   living at um Houstons got a lot of crime   but they you know and they have when my sister when she was going to the University of Texas she had
