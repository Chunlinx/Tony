                                 Gulf War Syndrome            Since shortly after the endof the  Persian Gulf War veterans have complained of medical symptomsthey say were caused by exposure to toxic chemicals during that conflict Andthey charge that the government has not taken their complaints seriously or iseven covering up evidence of a Gulf War Syndrome This past week the Pentagonadmitted that as many as  US troops were exposed to nerve gas duringthe Gulf War and the New York Times reported that Czech soldiers in theGulf detected toxins wafting over unprotected American troops Where does theGulf War Syndrome controversy stand            Therevelation that some troops were in fact exposed to toxic gases does notsettle the case The controversy rests on two remaining issues finding aplausible description of the illness and finding evidence that the lowleveltoxic exposures could cause it            After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August  the US leddeployment of the coalition forces in the Persian Gulf including Americans  British and  Canadians During this time not only wereAllied casualties far lower than feared but overall rates of illness were lowas well Despite fears that Iraq would use chemical or biologicalweapons  no such attack came and no soldier became ill or died in the Gulfbecause of toxicweapon exposure After entering an Iraqi bunker one soldierexperienced unexplained blistering which could have been caused by mustardgas            After returning homehowever American Canadian and British veterans began reporting a varietyof chronic symptoms that came to be called the Persian Gulf War syndromeCommon complaints are fatigue joint pain headache difficulty sleepingdiarrhea or nausea The Department of Veterans Affairs registered andexamined  American Gulf veterans who were concerned that they might havethe syndrome More than  filed disability claims for environmentalsickness unexplained illness and other ailments            No one hasclearly defined what the syndrome really is No characteristic symptoms orlaboratory abnormalities have been found Veterans quoted in New YorkTimes articles for example each cited different complaintsfrom loss ofteeth to tumors to memory loss to joint painand yet all were said to have thesyndrome The most frequent chief complaint joint pain was cited by only percent of veterans in the VA registry A majority of those registered did notshare any of the top dozen symptoms Other studies of Gulf War vets show nohigher rates of hospitalization birth defects or death than among controlgroups that did not serve Thus far five different independent panels haveevaluated the known evidence None could find any new disease or define aunique syndrome            Gulf veterans and their supporters point toevidence that troops encountered many different chemical agents whichthey believe made thousands ill after coming home Troops received multipleimmunizations  including uncommon vaccines against anthrax and botulinumtoxin They took pyridostigmine pills as an antidote against nerve gasThe military used over a dozen pesticides in the Gulf includingorganophosphates which can cause nerve damage above certain levels Oilfires in Kuwait billowed smoke over troops throughout the area A Scudmissile exploded over the th Naval Battalion exposing its soldiers torocket propellant and some claim mustard gas a weapon used to rapidlyinduce blindness and severe skin burns            Lastspring the Pentagon reversed its longstanding denial that troops had beenexposed to toxins while destroying Iraqi chemical weapons Officials now admitthat in March  troops were exposed to low levels of the nerve gassarin when an Army battalion destroyed an Iraqi ammunitions depot Initialestimates of  soldiers exposed were increased to  based on a CIAcomputer model of the gas clouds drift The number could be increased yet moreas further data are generated Czech soldiers confirmed detection of sarin evenearlier in January  when Americans bombed Iraqi chemical plants Sarinquickly triggers paralysis death by asphyxiation or cardiac rhythmdisturbances soon follows It was used for example in last years Tokyosubway attacks But exposure levels in the Gulf were not high enough to causesuch reactions            Congress has already authorized disability paymentsof up to  per year for veterans with chronic maladies that appearedwithin two years after the war The newest revelations about soldiers exposurewill add to pressure for more generous compensation                           Inconsistencies remainunresolved however First expert panelistsincluding a Nobel laureate amedical school dean and epidemiology and environmental health expertsdid notfind it plausible that the chemicals could have failed to produce major illeffects at the time of exposure yet could still cause chronic illness laterNo known toxic illness has ever followed such a pattern In medical circlesthe argument over Gulf War Syndrome is actually part of a larger debate overthe existence of other nebulous syndromes including chronic fatigue andvarious environmental illnesses            A second problem is that aGulf War Syndrome with consistent symptoms has yet to be defined Gulfveterans suggest that the syndrome is a constellation of symptoms which ones aparticular vet gets will vary with the individual The syndrome may even beseveral illnesses they say but the common thread is exposure to toxins in theGulf            The independent panelshowever say none of the proposed chemical agents are known to cause disease atthe low levels which troops faced Moreover they have not found any increasein illness among Gulf veterans as a whole or among those exposed to theproposed agents For example the engineers of the battalion exposed to sarinshowed no higher illness rates than others Some vets believe however thatthere is countervailing evidence which the government is coveringup
