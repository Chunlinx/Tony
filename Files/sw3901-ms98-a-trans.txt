        and       have you lived in Garland long   um yeah were going about six years yeah   about six years tell me your name again im sorry Carol okay um are you in a new area or old   Carol umhum um  well its about six years old weve lived here as long as the house has been built so i guess it is new in some way although were learning its falling apart   yeah yeah oh really   no thats exaggeration but we had some problems yesterday so   oh no leakage or     um some plumbing problems   oh not   so and it damaged the carpet and were going to have to do something were not sure call insurance or something so   im not sure what to do       well our house is about um twelve years old i guess weve been in it for about two years and   uhhuh   i guess theres advantages advantages and disadvantages to moving into a new or old house um one thing it had all of the window treatments you know so we didnt have to redo that and it had been updated but   right   uhhuh   their roof is old was old so uh last year we covered the wood shingles with uh that composition   uhhuh   and that was cost a fortune  and uh   oh yeah   now were were in the process of uh repainting the interior because we didnt paint when we first moved in and uh you know when you shop for houses you dont notice all the little things you think oh this is beautiful and everything and then you find  out that its   yeah uh i wouldnt think about the painting   you know that its not as great well theres just a lot of uh i mean it has that well the family before us raised three kids and a dog and cats and and so theres just wear wear and tear on the house but you dont notice   uhhuh yeah yeah   until you live in it and have to clean it  and you know you you find scratch marks on the wood or   yeah yeah   you know places were the dog chewed or i dont know things like that   yeah yeah because were kind of thinking of uh trying to find a used home and uh the ones weve looked at have been really nice um but you know theres some things you dont really think about looking at in a pre owned home that that you do in a new home so   i would say uh you know that uh who is it the inspector you know that you use just um they have a list of things they go over but   uhhuh   you know i think we had maybe a list on top of that that some friends had of ours had told us to go through and just things that they might not normally look for and and go around with them and even if youre kind of on their you know looking over their shoulder or whatever um   umhum umhum   because theres lots of things that furniture hides and you know we have a place we have picture frame paneling in our living room and it is in beautiful condition its uh its a custom home but theres just areas that they skimped on and uh but the   umhum   the uh picture frame paneling for the most part is beautiful and and they had this big arrangement on the mantel and it and i think one thing about the house that made us fall in love with it was their decorating you know their furniture  once you move in your furniture into the house its kind of it doesnt have quite the same look but um   oh really   yeah yeah   because were um you know we havent been married weve been married for almost four years and   uhhuh   uh  anyway but theres a piece of paneling behind thats above the mantel that has   yeah   um its right above the fireplace and i think they there must have been some water running down the chimney behind there because there is some water damage and its warped and with it being picture frame i dont know how to   yeah uhhuh   how to replace that one piece without having to tear it all down because its one of the inset pieces so theres a lot of things to you know to look for and um   uhhuh uh yeah yeah yeah   but i guess new homes are like that to they probably have things that are constantly   yeah   needing fixed or at least you probably have to i dont know did did you all did the builder provide the mini blinds and stuff like that or did you all yeah you had to go purchase all that   oh no no huhuh yeah yeah from scratch everything but were trying to look for a bigger home right now and and   what size what size home are you in now   right now were in um seventeen hundred square feet so its were looking for something a lot bigger because we have two kids   uhhuh   and uh but i like Garland i love Garland i really really want to stay in Garland if i can but uh you know theres theres other places too like Sachse and that and that area place area out there  which is really nice ive been to some friends house out there and theres just  uh there theres some really nice homes out there   im not really familiar with the homes in Garland i guess i know um i tried
