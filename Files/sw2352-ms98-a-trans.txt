                the topic is how we can how how what is our   community doing on recycling   and how and do we have any ideas to encourage more recycling   yeah  sounds like an exciting one   well it is to me uh because were our particular little household is hot and heavy we have our glass bin our tin bin and uh our uh papers that we accumulate and recycle and   where where do you live   Plano Texas   do they have the uh collection points where you can oh okay   yes they certainly do they certainly do   yes were were really behind the times here about all weve got is paper recycling and aluminum from cans uh North Carolina   where are you oh i see   um i buy i keep my newspapers and take those down and aluminum cans i keep those if i ever get them i dont drink Cokes or anything like that so i dont dont usually get any aluminum cans but thats thats all theyve got set up theyve got a uh central collection point at the JC Park and uh thats it   well our libraries and then the uh WalMart stores have the bins in back of them and when you recycle glass   umhum   that seems to make a lot of difference and you have the colored glass and the clear glass and the paper and the tin cans   umhum umhum   so when you get all of that going it is it it occupies a space in your garage but you very quickly get use to it and we do not   yeah and you and you and you also get rid of it so   sure well you know we haul it off it once in a while and we also do not bag our clippings on our lawns we let the wind blow it off we do not fill   oh yeah yeah thats why i just let it sit there and let it uh let it uh rot away and its a good fertilizer   well this is Texas it doesnt set it blows   oh  thats right   give   surprised you even have grass there   lots of grass give it twenty four hours and the whole things gone theres no problem someone else is worrying about       and we have somebody elses but uh the problem that bothers me more uh you know i think the communities will do as good as they are supported by their local government you know   umhum   if theres if theres enough need and they have a responsive local city management   umhum   it will happen what upsets me uh there was an article and im sorry i was reading a book at the same time it was on our Texas beaches   umhum   and they are saying our Texas beaches are suppose to be the dirtiest beaches in the United States   uh   and its not because of litter its because of boats   umhum   the if you could think of the basin the Texas gulf coast as a large swirling   umhum umhum   vacuum things that are thrown from ships swirl in and swirl in to our beaches   umhum yeah exactly   and it kills some of our animals theres theres a professor down there that has Texas A and M has a nice size facility   hum   at Port Aransas   umhum   and hes got all these collection of animals that hes frozen that were killed you know by plastic   hum   its horrible its a gross collection   yeah ive seen ive seen pictures of uh seals that have gotten uh gotten their necks stuck in those uh plastic uh   umhum   oh what do you call them they hold six packs together those plastic   yes whatever those things nasty things are   yeah because they theyre theyre playful and they think this is fun well stick our head through here and they get their head stuck in there and they cant get out and they strangle   thats right or they starve to death because they cant swallow   and i or they starve because they cant eat   or drowned   yeah i mean its thats yeah thats thats terrible i mean i like seals   yeah terrific well they showed one baby turtle that had been caught up in some uh plastic   umhum   and it starved to death it couldnt it couldnt swallow it was pitiful   yeah yeah thats what it bothers me the same thing about uh netting tuna they they get so many dolphins and   well theyre suppose to have be working towards around that   and i well they keep saying that but ill tell you i i saw a program not too many months ago i think it was on Arts and Entertainment or Discovery one of the two and theyre talking about all these people who are making uh all these boast that you know were dolphin free and all that kind of stuff and they just they showed them to be absolute liars   uhhuh oh really   yeah because you know people like Starkist they dont go out there and catch the fish they buy the fish from other people   sure so   and and and all these people do is tell them oh no no no no we have we have these safety nets now   trust us its our nets everythings great go back sleep and dont worry   sure thats right trust us yeah they had some they had some uh uh undercover film of these people and they they netted oh i mean dozens of dolphins   oh   and they killed probably half of them   oh thats just sickening   yeah it is i like dolphins too     well and the other thing uh we have an endangered species turtle a Ridleys turtle   umhum   thats on the Texas Gulf Coast   umhum   and theres our shrimp nets are suppose to be turtle proof so the turtles can swim through   um right right   huge fight going on uh the shrimpers just say great you want us to put a big hole in our nets is that what you want us to do  this makes sense to us were starving to death anyway and you want us to put a hole in our nets i can see their point i i guess if my family were terribly hungry i wouldnt be as humanistic as i am because i dont have that problem   umhum   so its its really a hard hard issue to say whats right and whats not   well i think what they need to do is to come up with a better way of shrimp farming   oh this is   i m ean theres theres i i dont see any reason why they cant uh i mean theres a lot of places Japan for instance have shrimp farms i mean they they they raise shrimp   like they raise catfish now   just just like they raise anything else and and you can do it and the uh the the collection is very easy and you dont go around killing everything else that happens to be in the area   well part of the problem there is so many of the fishermen work for so little money   umhum   we have a lot of Vietnamese   yeah   fisher people   right right   and yet they support their whole family on less than than id had for lunch   on fishing yeah umhum   anyway   umhum   and of course they dont have the money to make an investment like that   yeah well its   and it it all goes back to the government spending enough money high enough priorities on things like that   umhum   that they it would have to be government owned or supported financed if not controlled   yeah   there because the financing simply isnt there because its one of those cottage industries that uh   yeah and   the very poor keep going but cant do anything to change   yeah is right yeah theyre theyre theyre in it for a matter of survival not   sure   not environmentalist   well and you know they could they could be terribly sorry theyre killing the turtles you know   oh yeah they they probably are i   probably are probably are   of course i dont understand why they dont if theyre going to kill them they might as well eat the turtles too and   well they may do it   they probably do i mean     whether they like it or not they may do it you know   oh turtle is good   yeah thats correct turtle is very good thats the other thing wrong with the poor turtles   yeah yeah yeah i had turtle when i was in Vietnam didnt know it was turtle at the time because i wouldnt have eaten it but   well in my unreformed days i have had turtle soup in New Orleans and i can tell you its fabulous   yeah i   but of course a boot would taste fabulous when they finish with it   yeah  thats true     so its no telling what the turtle really taste like     well hopefully its real turtle too   well it maybe it wasnt you know who who knows what i had but it was fabulous   yeah you well thats thats the other thing i mean you never know what theyre putting in there you know  oh this is turtle soup you know okay   great sure it is   sure right   charge fifteen keep moving   yeah why not give it a fancy name and put a high price tag on it   as long as its French   its probably its probably Campbells or something     oh dear well i dont have any my big solutions all go back to elect politicians that are more sensitive because i think we cant do it ourselves   no i i no no i dont think we will because you need you need some kind of organization for it and   you need clout   yeah and the problem the problem i mean weve got all these environmental organizations but theyre all pulling in different directions and its the the end results is is just a nullity nobodys getting anything done and and i think there needs to be a concerted effort you know say okay heres a problem were going to do this and you put all your resources here and were going to do this and you put your resources here something like that i mean just   itd be great but the problem with that is you have all of these little branches off the main problem and everyone is very concerned about one thing you know like the woman down the tip of Texas that that calls her turtles and kisses everyone of them everyday shes terribly interested in her turtles she could care less about shrimp   umhum   and on she goes you just kind of think everybodys got such a splintered interest   yeah well thats what thats what i mean about all these groups theyre so   yeah thats exactly it   yeah theyre so uh   and theres no way to to to make one group more interested or sensitive to the other group but they can be but theyre not sensitive on the bottom line which means money   they yeah i mean would i mean youd ideally they would all combine together and pool there resources and and and then they could have their agenda for all these different problems and come up with solutions but i mean you know work at it as an organization not as a little group just they just dont get anywhere   thats why i keep going back to the politicians that it has to have some focal spot   thats right thats right   we we need uh we need an environmental Ralph Nader type   umhum   which   exactly       yeah somebody to pull the whole thing together to make it work   gee right   i mean we weve been at this for for so many years now and just and just and nothings happening
