                                 Blacklist and Backstory            A couple of weeks ago theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that it would award anhonorary Oscar to the director Elia Kazan What was surprising about this newswas the amount of controversy it generated virtually none For decades Kazanhas been reviled as the most notorious of those who named namesidentifiedCommunists working in Hollywoodbefore the House Committee on UnAmericanActivities In recent years both the American Film Institute and the LosAngeles Film Critics Association have turned Kazan down for honors that no onedisputes are merited by his films which include East of Eden and AStreetcar Named Desire  But this time the vote in Kazans favor wasunanimous Reporters looking to reprise the old conflict had a hard timefinding anyone who still bears him a grudge            Why have Kazans enemiessuddenly dropped their complaint Several articles on the subject have rituallyinvoked the end of the Cold War as an explanation But its not clear why thecollapse of Communism should smooth matters over Many wars end in a reckoningrather than in forgiveness and forgetting A more plausible explanation isprobably that Kazan now  has outlived most of his antagonists and that thefury of the rest has lost its edge It may indeed be time to excuse Kazan forwhat he did in  But if so it shouldnt happen because no one can betroubled to remember or sort out the morality of his actions            A synopsis In the s Kazan got his start in the GroupTheater a leftwing theater troupe that was home to the legendary directorsLee Strasberg and Harold Clurman as well as the radical playwright CliffordOdets For a year and a half Kazan was a member of a Communist cell insidethe Group He quit after members of the cell received orders to take over thetheater and turn it into an actors collective Despite hisresignationexpulsion Kazan remained sympathetic to the Soviet Union into thes when he began directing Hollywood films But that sympathy was long goneby  when he was called before HUAC            The first time hetestified in January Kazan took a principled position He would discuss hisown involvement in the party but not the others who had been in it with him Sothe committee called him back to Washington and put him under oath Underpressure from the FBI and the movie studios he reversed himself Since thecommittee already knew the names it wanted naming names was a loyalty testand humiliation ritual not part of a real investigation There is a chillingDarkness at Noon quality to Kazans questioning by Frank Tavenner Jr alawyer for the committee            Tavenner I understand that you have voluntarily requested the committee toreopen your hearing and give you an opportunity to explain fully theparticipation of others known to you at the time to have been members of theCommunist Party            KazanThat is correct I want to make a full and complete statement I want to tellyou everything I know about it            Kazans prepared statement offered up the names of theeight others who were members of his Group Theater cell The names includedOdets who subsequently named names himself and several actors sinceforgotten in part perhaps because they were blacklisted            It was not just histestimony that made Kazan into a Linda Tripp figure of his time After allOdets gave HUAC the same names as did Lewis Leverett another Group Theateralumnus whom Kazan named But many others who named names did so underostensible protest or later castigated themselves publicly for crawling beforethe committee Kazan embraced his inquisitors Soon after he testified he tookout an ad in the New York Times to defend himself I believe that anyAmerican who is in possession of such facts has the obligation to make themknown either to the public or to the appropriate Government agency he wroteWhatever hysteria existsand there is some particularly in Hollywoodisinflamed by mystery suspicion and secrecy Hard and exact facts will cool itKazan made his case more memorably in the  film On the Waterfront in which Marlon Brando plays a longshoreman faced with a choice about whetherto rat on the murderous and corrupt leadership of his union His decision totestify is portrayed as an act of courageous whistleblowing not betrayal orcowardice            For years afterward Kazan kept his silence about theepisode I dont think theres anything in my life toward which I have moreambivalence because obviously theres something disgusting about givingother peoples names he acknowledged in a  interview But he also refusedto apologize and defended his choice In his fascinating autobiographypublished in  Kazan expresses a range of justifications He wasnt tellingthe committee any names it didnt know as an immigrant he was eager todemonstrate his patriotism he was faced with a choice of two evils            Did he do wrong Thefirst question to ask is what the right thing would have been Kazan might havestood by his original policy asserting that while he hated Communism he wouldnot assist in a violation of civil liberties Kazans soon to be exfriendArthur Miller did something like this four years later when he refused toanswer questions Miller claimed the First Amendment right to freedom ofspeech and association rather than taking the Fifth right againstselfincrimination This was the more principled stand since taking the Fifthimplied agreeing that simply being a Communist was a crime Also there is noFifth Amendment right against incriminating others Unfortunately the SupremeCourt had never ruled that the First Amendment could be used in this way            With McCarthyism much weaker by  Miller avoided prisonand continued to have his plays produced But for Kazan to take Millers stancebefore HUAC in  would almost certainly have meant a contempt citation andtime in jail Kazan would not have made films for many years if ever againFor a great artist like Kazan to immolate himself to protect the rights oflesser artists or more precisely in a quixotic attempt to protect thoserights would have been heroic But failing to be a hero did not make him avillain The villains were the blacklisters Kazan was one of theirvictims            But failing to be avillain doesnt make him a hero either Where Kazan did go wrong was incasting an evil he couldnt avoid as a good His statement that the factsabout Communism were the cure for antiCommunist hysteria was disingenuous Thereal cure for antiCommunist hysteria was a courage that Kazan like mostpeople did not possess But this bit of gratuitous groveling pales next to thesins of othersboth those who remained Stalinists into the s and those whodid not just acquiesce in but advocated McCarthyism For the Academy ofMotion Picture Arts and Sciences which actually enforced the blacklist toreject Kazan for his comparatively minor offenses would have been the sheeresthypocrisy            Some historians have argued recently that new informationmakes all forms of American antiCommunism including even McCarthyism lookbetter in hindsight They contend that the socalled Venona intercepts a fewof which have been released show definitively not only that Alger Hiss and theRosenbergs were spies but also that there was far more Soviet stringpullingbehind American Communism than anyone ever knew But none of these revelationsimproves the case that Hollywood Communism was a significant threat todemocracy Murray Kempton got this story right in  in his book Part ofOur Time  The Hollywood Communists most of them screenwriters wereoverpaid hacks not dangerous revolutionaries The examples of propagandathey slipped into scripts are few and laughable The high point of Kemptonsessay on the Hollywood  is a list of the folderol the blacklistedscreenwriters actually producedwith excerpts from the glowing reviews theyreceived from the Daughters of the American Revolution            Elia Kazan wasnt a hack and he didnt try to be ahero He deserves an Oscar as much as anyone livingfor best director not forbest human being Who in the movie industry qualifies for that second oneanyway
