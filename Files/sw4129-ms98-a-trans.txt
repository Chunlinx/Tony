        okay so what are what are your views on on capital punishment     i have ambivalent feelings because i dont think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is but on the other hand it is very very expensive to maintain you know Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country   yes   and its eating us alive budget wise and um   so are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state   yes we do practice capital punishment but the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that its a very long haul before anybodys ever executed   yes thats similar to Georgia   yeah and then i was reading in the paper just this morning its interesting because i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody than than it does to keep them   thats probably true considering   because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know   yes yes um i guess in a way that it it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if   well i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people   yes   you know who would see it   right that would be the intent of it   yeah but im not sure how successful that is   well i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there werent so many appeals yeah if if the person whos gonna commit the crime knew that they were gonna be punished severely possibly capital punishment   quicker maybe yeah umhum what what kind of work do you do   uh im a research engineer i work uh for with Georgia Tech   hum well see im a school principal   um   elementary school   yes   and in a very poor section of town with predominantly predominantly Anglo kids and i see kids already that are gonna be criminals   hum   in spite of everything we can do and see im afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that i mean course you couldnt do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there   umhum   but i think if we would make a bigger investment in kids wed have fewer decisions to make   um thats probably true but i guess   down the road you know   theres other factors that but pumping pumping pumping more money into the school system is a good thing but its not gonna   oh yeah well im not talking about just in the school system   oh i see   see im talking about like in in uh im afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared uh i know institutions dont work that well but its a bad day because because i have all these kids through my office i have a school of five hundred and thirty seven kids   umhum   five hundred of them are good solid kids and i have the same thirty seven in my office every day   um   and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible some of them in the penal system   so thats a difficult situation   and you know you just see those kids going down the road now not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment but some of them have already been in youth centers   um   and that kind of thing and if we had something to do before they get to be full blown adult criminals and im not talking about necessarily in the school system im not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action   umhum   i think thats one reason we have problems in school systems uh and some of them are our problems but a lot of its because everything society wants were supposed to do   umhum   but thats another subject but   well thats probably true what   anyway i dealt with two or three kids today that are gonna end up where somebody has to make a decision what to do with them   hum yeah i guess thats not an easy solution theres theres no easy solution for that   umhum i dont i dont know that there is an easy solution but if you could find a way to prevent some of it and im not sure what it would be   umhum   it would be money better spent than do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard       thats true   im sure it is yeah   statistically thats true   hum yeah i dont i dont certainly capital punishment isnt gonna solve a lot of problems but   umhum are you for it   uh   im for it in in some cases yeah   i guess i am for certain crimes yeah in certain crimes   what kind of crimes would you do use it for   um premeditated murder   umhum   crimes of that nature i think should definitely any mass murderer type individual   i i would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going you know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children   hum umhum well you always have castration   well you know somebody elected that recently   yes i read about that     and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know   umhum   but uh
