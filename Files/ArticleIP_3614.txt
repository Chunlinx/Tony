unwelcome is in no way resistible Of the part that is mine to passover in silence is perhaps the course both of humility and of humilit That the number of my own works chosen should be trois is a matter forneither protestation nor ingratitude Yet that such an ordering hardly inducesin the author of the aforementioned trois such satisfaction as might behoped to accrue to one looking down with Olympian detachment from beyond thevale of longevity is a statement the validity of which cannot be called readilyinto question It is unlikely to fail to play upon the suspicions of such a onethat the composition of his most highly esteemed should be that most latelyconverted into a wan cinematic confection of fretsome abbreviation Neitherhowever could a figure such as he neglect the observation that the personagewith whom the former is now abstractly in conversation was accorded the meritof only dues livres  and that those due were accorded a positionmore terrestrial which is to say well below those of the former on the listSuch a point once made could not resist the tendency to instill feelings ofenvy and ressentiment on the part of an author perhaps bettercompensated and perhaps more popular but in the view of the criticalintelligenceif any such fitful and discredited light may still be conceivedas being within our spherenot really as good as mine Thus it is anexpression of both discretion and a great humble reverence for the feelings ofothers to leave such a point unmade and unwinced at            Though itmay be additionally unpenworthy there is another point that heavily impelsmaking  It is that of all the volumes some eminent some too muchesteemed in the trail of fashion there is one included that so transgressesthe hesitational boundary of propriety as to induce a feeling of stammeringdyspepsia Attention is called to the uncouth Mr Roth whose effluviations areso juvenalianly unspeakable that I cannot bear to utter their title Thiswork  it cannot be refrained from being pointed out has as its chieftopic that exercise that in our own great palmy day was considered least worthyof writerly elucidation That this basely erotic occupation that was to our owncontemporaries so unsupportable should form the core of the work inquestion might be thought to constitute a disqualification To such vulgariandepths does this fascination descend that there is in one place depicted anact of rank unsalubrious congress between him and a comestible whoseingestion by familial others is ineluctably and tenebrously foreordained Ispeak here of the liver scene For a work whose climax depends on feelingsof the most passionate revulsion to be esteemed ahead of your own labors sofar superior as to be undeserving of inclusion in the same tormented sentenceis my dearest Edith an insult insufferable to all whose reverence forliterature anglais is to be warranted To commiserate against so greatand gaping an injustice presents itself as a course of action

    Frommailerdaemoncom To faulksnopesnoedu Cclistservdeadauthorsguildorg Re Insult as email the email asinsult            Mailer had always thoughthighly of William Faulkner Once when he was younger he had read FaulknersAs I Lay Dying cover to cover Privately he had found it a bitconfusing Why was the mother a fish But he knew that people thought it was afine novel and he resented that he hadnt written it himself Faulkner was aSoutherner probably a racist and hard to understand Mailer was a Jewish NewYorker beloved by black people and a comparatively easy read not to mentiona fine lay Still Mailer thought Faulkner and Mailer were a lot alike Bothwere great American writersbetween them they had written many of the best novels of the  th century Both drank heavily at times liked toget paid for what they wrote and had contempt for lesser talents Mailerthought Faulkner thought highly of Mailer as wellmaybe as highly as Mailerdid himself            Mailer had sent Faulknerevery book he had ever written all with flattering inscriptions and neverreceived so much as a thankyou Mailer suspected that Faulkner had read themall and wished he had written them himself Possibly Faulkner had never somuch as looked at them He had heard somewhere that Faulkner had died StillMailer was irked He felt that it had all been a big literary game Mailer wasnot a critic of Southern literature but he privately wondered whetherposterity might not judge John Jakes a better novelist than Faulkner sourcesclose to Mailer tell Mailer            So to be called Hemingway ona budget by Faulkner made Mailer angry It made Mailer very very angry Soangry did Mailer become that Mailer took the big picture of Faulkner that hangsover Mailers desk and smashed it into a million pieces After he did thatthere were just pictures of Mailer hanging there Mailer recognized that thisreaction was not very mature but Mailer had bigger things to worry about thanminding his literary manners Mailer didnt understand why people were treatinghim like a dead writer either Just recently Mailer had published hisautobiography and a book about Jesus Mailer had the inspired idea to combinethe two subjects in one book Bill Faulkner never had an idea that good or ifhe did no one could understand it            Mailerthought to himself that next time he saw Faulkner he would probably sock himone in the kisser No Mailer thought the next time he ran into Faulkner at aswanky literary party he would return Faulkners insult with his usual wittyinsouciance Mailer hated those parties but he hardly ever missed one Yourbooks stink Mailer imagined himself saying Mailer cant understand a wordof them                                       Fromdharmabumnirvananet To mailerdaemoncomlistservdeadauthorsguildorg Cc

was on there too It made me thinkabout the time Neal and I went to see him in Chicago in             I came in by Greyhoundbusfrom Milwaukee It was an ordinary Greyhoudbus with runaways and oldfolk andthe Greyhoundbusdriver in his Greyhoundbusdrivers cap not saying much ofanything but just driving the bus toward Chi Neal didnt have the busfare sohe hotwired a car not to steal it but just to ride ride ride for the thrillof it like some magnificent highflying parkpigeon Along the way Neal hadmarried or maybe just kidnapped a Scandinavianextracted girl from Kenoshanamed Inga Inga had blond curls and beefy arms like a stevedore and wasexcited about seeing the bigcity but said she wanted to go home and was goingto call the police if he didnt take her Neal should have been worried aboutInga being jailbait but at that point he was pretty focused on medievalliterature and kept on reciting passages from Chaucer and El Cid andtalking about how Giotto was a better painter than Van Gogh nokidding            We were crashing at a coldwater flat on the South side with a guy called Phil and Phils aunt and herchihuahuas The chihuahuas had been shaved real close to the skin so therewasnt much to them just a lot of pointy ears and dogyapping They must havebeen pretty cold in those Chi winters and when they were hungry theyd claw atyour shins Neal wanted to invite Sanchez and Marylou and Freddie Engels overfor a sexorgy but Daves aunt was out of chihuahuafood so before we could dothat we had to get something for the dogs to eat            As soon as we stepped outsidePhils aunts apartment a cruiser spotted us and tailed after us at a slowcrawl down the street Neal had ditched his freebuick but apparently we lookedlike some hipsters who had pulled off a jewelry heist downtown They didntstop us on suspicion but just kept tailing us at a distance which made ustwitchy since Inga kept saying she was going to turn us in for being hopheadsand whiteslavers and a lot of other stuff I couldnt understand because it wasin Swedish We knew they were cops because they had copuniforms and weredriving a copcar So we stopped in a dark dingy old South side tavern to thinkover our plans and have some coldbeers            When wecame out of there Inga had split and we realized we were on Congress StreetCongress Street shoots out West for an amazing distance which is where we wereheaded so we hijacked a lettuce rig pistolwhipped the driver wham and madestraight for Joliet As we were riding through the sweetsmelling Americannight Neal looked up from the book he was reading Les aventures de ladialectique  by Maurice MerleauPonty which he had lifted from thephilosophy section of Krochs  Brentanos in the Loop He turned to me andthe driver of the rig who was wearing a lettucepicking outfit and a redbandanna tied around his mouth and said Oh man we completely forgot to gosee Saul Bellow And now were all on the same list of goodbooks Imsohappy            As ever Jack
