        well what kind of pets do you have   at the present time we have none we intend to purchase a pup in two months   are you youre married   yes   and newly married   no weve got uh weve been married forever about eight years  eight years two kids that was just   oh   sounds like us       only we started off ours with we had we had pets before we had kids thats why i thought when you were saying you know were going to have one in two months or something perhaps that you were newly married   no weve uh my we weve got a five year old but weve had one pet since weve had her but uh he didnt quite work out   hm   so um we are weve been now petless for a couple of years and   yeah   were going to get another one this summer were weve a got a vacation planned and we want to wait until we get back from the vacation before we   yes thats easier   bring a puppy in   are you going to get a dog   yeah yeah   thats what thats what we have is two dogs   what type   big dogs well our first at first they were our child substitutes before we had our children       and we got one right after we got married we both decided we needed a dog we went to the pound and we got this mutt   uhhuh   and hes been it was alright before we had our kids it was hes just hes a real hyper dog he barks and and jumps a lot so we had him for a year and then my husband decided after we had him a year that hed wanted for his entire life to have a Siberian husky   goodness   and i think why didnt you tell me a year ago when we got the other dog   you know this was your dream of your life to have a Siberian husky so we got the other one for him and to keep the first one company when we were at work all day   right   so we have the the old the older dogs a male and hes he weighs about forty pounds and then Pepper is a year younger and she weighs about seventy pounds   yeah theyre big dogs   so we have two massive dogs go through lots of dog food   yeah Are they primarily outdoor dogs   absolutely   yeah   i never wanted my husband wanted indoor dogs because hed grown up with them but i cant stand it indoors i dont they shed and you know the mud and   and the scratches and the smell and the uh wherever yeah   oh yeah there for me dogs are meant to be outside   i firmly believe that large dogs are meant to be outside we had Danes when i was a child and um   goodness   and we had our Danes in the house   oh my goodness   but i mean its almost dangerous  to have them in the house   sure   theyre going to run you down   and uh we went through a time period that we had three Danes   goodness and all of them were in the house   we had yeah and we had we had had a litter and she had uh had thirteen puppies   hm   eight of which survived and uh and she we ended up keeping one of those puppies   i see   we had the mom the dad and one of the puppies and it was horrendous   yeah hm   we wound up getting uh getting rid of the mom selling the puppy and just keeping the dad because dad was the favorite one anyway   okay oh when i was growing up my folks we had fox terriers which are little bitty   yeah   they weigh about ten pounds   yeah   and so we had we had one for a long time and then oh gosh when i was about ten or eleven i guess my parents decided that dogs would be a good way to teach reproduction so then they went out and got a female   uhhuh   and then we started having puppies and she had she had four or five litters she always had to look we always kept them in the house when they had the when she when the babies were little   right   and the rest of the time they were outside they had we had a big uh kind of a play house and part of that was their dog house it was kind of cordoned off   uhhuh   so they had a place to stay out there and then they had the yard and they had a little run that uh they kept them in when we were trying to do stuff in the back yard and didnt want them out but we had the same kind of situation at one point in time we had the mother the one of her last her next to last litter we kept we had one one we never could get rid of he was a real dumb dog  nobody wanted him the puppy was just one of these dogs just as dumb as a stick       and we have him and then our female she had another litter we didnt think she was we thought she was too old to get pregnant again turned out she wasnt       and uh she had her litter i guess her last litter had like four and two of them survived and then she didnt make it   oh   two days after the they were born she had a she died she had some kind of an infection from it all she was just too old we had to feed the puppies we had to get up night and day with those just like with a baby   yeah   and bottle feed them and we just   we had a Schnauzer that got milk fever right after the babies were born and we had to feed all their babies feed all the babies there were five and there were four of them that survived   oh um   yeah   werent they messy too well did she did the mother survive   yeah she did survive   so you could still feed it but she kept them clean   no   oh she didnt she didnt do something   no she didnt even she did not even take the sack this is the laziest dog that ever lived   um   when she had these puppies she crawled up onto my mothers stomach in the middle of the bed had the puppies and woke up my mother   oh no   to cut the sacks off she didnt even lick the sacks off laziest dog on earth she never she never nursed them she never cleaned them she never did anything to them they were like she they didnt exist   yuck oh goodness whats a mess that was like oh boy they are so messy when theyre little too   yeah   we were giving them a bath about every other day boy we were giving them a bath at least once a day but they were so horrible   yeah   because they would roll and everything and oh   yeah they just poop and its yeah they   yeah and crawl through it   yeah   oh i guess i had fish for a while when i was a kid too i had a fish tank and i had a few until   like a nice aquarium   well it wasnt really an aquarium it was an old you know how you used to have these um this was a box and it was originally it was made like an aquarium i guess except it was smaller but it was its original use was to put in the refrigerator on the shelf had a little spigot at one end   oh yeah   and you could get water out of it you know keep cold water   yeah       we outgrew the need for that and so i used it for an aquarium   thats great   it worked except the fish could swim it wasnt tall enough i kept the if i didnt keep the lid on it the fish would uh swim out and flop on the floor sometimes   flip out of the thing but   the cat was always happy   yeah those have been i mean and our dogs now our dogs with our kids i have two little kids three and a half and one and a half   uhhuh   so we built the dog run down the length of our uh back yard because the kids were getting i mean we couldnt even let our older son until he was about two i guess he was two when we built the dog run we couldnt let him go out in the back yard because it was we have a deck with a rail and he could go on that but the dogs were so big and he was so little you know they just even walking by him theyd knock him down and the whole back yard had poop in it all the time   uhhuh   it was a mess for the little one so   yeah yeah   now we have a back yard and a dog run   uh weve uh well probably get real small Cairn terrier   oh thatll be nice   and itll probably be an indoor outdoor dog   yeah back and forth uh   but see my my oldest is five and a half and so she can take part in some of the uh responsibilities a three and a half year old really cant quite take part of many of the responsibilities maybe feeding them   three and a half yeah or probably he or she is old enough to where they wont tease it too you know poke on it too much   oh shes got respect for animals thank goodness   yeah because thats hard ours our kids have gotten over it with the dogs behind it they have the run its kind of like a wire run   uhhuh   so they go the first thing they do is they go out there and play with them but boy the little one still he just wants to poke my older one our older sons pretty good about it hell pet the dog you know   yeah   and and hes three and a half like youre saying and he hes pretty good with them and with other peoples dogs and cats that he runs into but boy the little one still just wants to poke and and see if the dog will back off you know and   i think thats eighteen months   yeah   i mean i think thats just kids trying to figure out you know whats going to happen and it will happen again and again and again   yeah i think it is too its gonna get better yeah yeah       i think if we didnt have pets if we didnt already have our dog and cat now we wouldnt get them because the kids are so little   yeah   i think when theyre really little like the eighteen month old its not fair to the animal because the kids are so miserable to them if theyre out very much   yeah yeah it has to be a real mellow kind of animal that can   yeah thats   uh survive it and child   yeah and not get mad at the kid thats the other thing too that i i always felt Pepper the Siberian husky is really sweet she can i think the kids could walk up and they could literally probably stand on her back and she wouldnt even shed kind of look at them  like what are you doing now shes real good natured about it   well thats what you i mean thats what you need in a pet if your going to have small children too   yeah   but we uh   well i think thats about all my pet stories right now so   oh wonderful       im just flat out of pet stories i dont even have a pet anymore   okay well its been nice talking to you   well thanks thanks for calling byebye   okay byebye
