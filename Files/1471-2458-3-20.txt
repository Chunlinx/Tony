                    Background        The United States began to implement a national plan to        immunize half a million hospitalbased healthcare workers        against smallpox in early  Prospective vaccinees are        healthcare workers in emergency departments intensive care        units and other settings who would be crucial firstline        responders in the event of a bioterrorist attack using        smallpox However vaccination is voluntary and many staff        members are declining In Israel almost half of healthcare        workers and security and rescue squad personnel refused        voluntary smallpox vaccination in  due to concerns        about vaccine adverse events according to one press report                   In early December  just before the current smallpox        vaccination plan was announced we carried out a survey of        US healthcare workers opinions about smallpox        vaccination in order to inform preparedness efforts        Although much has happened to change public opinion since        that time our findings provide insight into factors that        influence the ongoing decisionmaking of healthcare workers        about this vaccine                    Methods                  Study Sample          We surveyed a convenience sample of healthcare workers          at  of  invited acutecare hospitals in  states          between December  and   to determine their          knowledge attitudes and projected behavior regarding          smallpox vaccination All but one of the hospitals were          members of the Prevention Epicenters established by the          Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC or the          Duke Infection Control Outreach Network DICON The          hospitals were located in Massachusetts  North          Carolina  Maryland  Virginia  and Georgia          New York Missouri Illinois Iowa and Oregon  each          The population of interest for the survey was emergency          department ED and intensive care unit ICU staff          although surveys were also completed by limited numbers          of other staff eg radiology technicians who might          plausibly be involved in a smallpox admission Of the           surveys distributed to staff  were completed          within the required timeframe for a response rate of                                    Procedures          The hospital epidemiologists or infection control          practitioners obtained institutional review board IRB          approval or in some cases exemption from review and          administered the survey to their hospitals ED and ICU          staff Collaborators agreed to return a minimum of           completed surveys to the study investigators by December                     The selfadministered survey was anonymous          confidential and voluntary It was distributed during          staff meetings or in person on an individual basis or          occasionally via mailboxes A draft smallpox vaccine          information sheet CDCs  version see          Additional File  was placed inside each folded          questionnaire The draft information sheet did not          include photographs of adverse reactions nor did it          describe the inflammatory response at immunization site          that occurs among a substantial fraction of individuals          At  of the  hospitals a goodquality pen was handed          out with each survey at another small gift certificates          were used the remaining  hospitals did not employ          gifts The completed surveys were collected at each site          by the collaborator who also tracked the total number of          surveys that had been distributed                          Survey instrument          The questionnaire see Additional File  consisted of           multiplechoice questions mostly about respondents          attitudes and projected behavior regarding smallpox and          smallpox vaccination knowledge and topics of concern          and selfassessed health history relative to smallpox          vaccination previous vaccination contraindications A          number of questions addressed demographic and          occupational characteristics A question at the end of          the survey asked how carefully respondents had read the          enclosed vaccine information sheet                          Analysis          The main outcome variable was respondents expressed          willingness to accept vaccination which was dichotomized          as yesprobably vs noprobably notdont know and then          correlated with potential predictors of response          individually and by multivariate logistic regression The          variables initially included in the model were perceived          risk of a smallpox attack region main work area          profession age gender presence or absence of children            years old at home selfassessed previous          vaccination status selfassessed level of knowledge          about smallpox vaccination and how well one had read the          vaccine information sheet This list includes all the          questions on the questionnaire except those addressing          reasoning underlying ones attitude toward vaccination          contraindications and projected behavior under          hypothetical scenarios These excluded variables were          considered irrelevant as predictors or were intractable          for inclusion due to the structure of the corresponding          questions overall results on them are presented in          univariate form without weighting or other adjustment          All pvalues and estimates from the logistic regression          analysis and presented in the tables are adjusted for          clustering within hospital and for different number of          responses per hospital using generalized linear mixed          models     The data were analyzed in SAS using the          NLMIXED procedure A fuller description of the analysis          is available on request                            Results                  Characteristics of the hospitals and          respondents          Seventeen of the  hospitals were in the Northeast          and MidAtlanticSoutheast Table  Eleven were          tertiarycare centers with  of the respondents           were community hospitals with  of the respondents          and one was a Veterans Administration hospital with           The median number of beds was  with a range of  to           Approximately half of respondents worked in the ED          or provided consultation to it approximately half were          nurses and approximately twothirds were women Table                                    Perceptions of smallpox threat and vaccine          risks          Fiftythree percent of respondents thought the risk of          a smallpox attack in the US within the next two years          was either intermediate  or high  while           saw it as either low  or next to zero           and  said cant guess Opinions varied widely among          the various hospitals with a range of  to  per          hospital considering the risk of an attack to be          intermediate or high p   chisquare test on          crude data          Twelve percent of respondents felt they were very          well informed about smallpox vaccination  felt          fairly well informed  said not well informed and           answered not at all informed Table  The topics          about which information was most commonly desired were           the likelihood and nature of adverse events  of          the answers chosen  the risks and health problems of          transmitting vaccinia to others  of the answers and           the risk of a smallpox attack  Table  The          most frequently chosen top concern about vaccination was          the risks compared to the benefits of vaccination           followed by the risks of transmitting vaccinia to family          or friends  Of the different types of adverse          events  of respondents were most concerned about          severe reactions like encephalitis severe infection and          death while  were more concerned about the more          frequent mildtomoderate reactions and  said they          were not particularly worried about vaccine adverse          events          When asked at the end of the survey how carefully they          had read the accompanying vaccine information sheet           of respondents said they had read it carefully  said          they had read parts of it  reported skimming it          quickly and  said they hadnt read it Table           Attention to the vaccine information sheet appeared to be          associated with ones top concern p chisquare          test on crude data with for example  of those          reporting having carefully read it listing transmission          of vaccinia to family or friends as their principal          concern compared to  of the groups reading the          vaccine information sheet less carefully or not at          all                          Selfassessed health history relative to smallpox          vaccination          Fiftytwo percent of respondents reported having been          previously vaccinated against smallpox  said they had          not while  werent sure Of those   years of          age  reported having been vaccinated of those             reported           not having been vaccinated Table           Six percent reported having a child or children            year of age at home currently a precaution rather          than a contraindication to smallpox vaccination          Fortyfive percent of those who completed the question on          contraindications said either yes  or dont know           to at least one of the contraindications in our list          of  The most common selfreported contraindication          was household member with current or past history of          eczema or atopic dermatitis   of respondents reported          this situation The next most frequent contraindication          was current or past history of eczema or atopic          dermatitis in oneself reported by                           Attitudes toward smallpox vaccination          In response to the question If you were medically          eligible for vaccination and were offered smallpox          vaccine today would you choose to be vaccinated           of healthcare workers answered yes  or probably           while the remaining  answered probably not           no  or dont know  Attitudes          varied by hospital ranging from  to  of          respondents per hospital inclined toward accepting          vaccination p chisquare test on crude data          In bivariate analyses ones opinion of the risk of a          smallpox attack was strongly associated with willingness          or desire to be immunized p   with  of          those perceiving an intermediatehigh risk of attack and           of those without an opinion about the risk being          inclined toward vaccination compared to  of those          seeing the risk as low Table  Region other than the          Northeast male sex having children  years or younger          at home being very wellinformed about the risks and          benefits of vaccination and reading the vaccine          information

     Projected behavior under hypothetical postevent          scenarios          Respondents interest in vaccination depended to some          extent on geographic proximity of a hypothetical future          smallpox case Of those in any doubt about vaccination          ie answering anything other than an unqualified yes          to the question of whether they would get vaccinated          today  said they would seek vaccination if a case          were laboratoryconfirmed overseas of the remainder who          said no  said they would do so if a case were          confirmed in the US a thousand miles away of the          remainder  said they would seek vaccination if a case          were confirmed in their city Those uninterested in          getting vaccinated even if a case occurred in their city          amounted to at least  of the starting group possibly          more as there was some dropout over the course of the          multipart question          When asked if they would report to work if they had          not been vaccinated recently and had learned that a          patient with smallpox had just been admitted to their          facility  of respondents said yes while           expressed reservations to varying degrees  said yes          but only if I knew I could get vaccinated on arrival           responded probably  said probably not and           said no Among those answering probably and probably          not the most common contingency mentioned was the          measures taken to containprevent transmission of the          infection followed by location of the patient relative          to oneself Age was a significant factor in willingness          to go to work under these conditions   of respondents          under  vs  of those  or older gave an          unconditional yes There were no statistically          significant differences among gender or professional          strata in this regard                            Discussion        Our findings may explain why smallpox vaccine uptake has        been relatively limited during the first several months of        the US national effort  as of May  only  of the        target group of  health care workers had accepted        vaccination In our survey the most commonly cited concern        was the risk vs benefit of vaccination followed by the        risk of transmitting vaccinia virus These matched the two        most frequently chosen topics about which more information        was desired for making the decision suggesting that the        healthrelated risks of vaccination are paramount        considerations for people and ones about which they feel        insufficiently informed Liability and compensation were        not so important to those contemplating vaccination        although these issues may have become more important since        then Since that time there have been reports of cardiac        problems and deaths shortly after vaccination On the other        side of the balance the major factor affecting expressed        willingness to be immunized was the perceived threat of        bioterrorism Those rating the risk of a bioterrorist        attack using smallpox as intermediate or high were more        likely to favor vaccination It seems probable that a        heightening of concerns about vaccine adverse events        relative to the fear of a bioterrorist attack underlies the        currently low acceptance of smallpox vaccination        There are two likely reasons for the fact that far fewer        workers have been vaccinated than the  expressing a        general willingness and even the  stating a clear        intention to get vaccinated in our December  survey        First wellpublicized decisions of some hospitals and        large unions of healthcare workers in early  not to        participate in the program together with the subsequent        reports of cardiac problems and deaths following        vaccination likely changed the minds of many prospective        vaccinees Second social desirability bias tends to cause        surveys like this one to overestimate acceptance of        vaccination     For example at one study hospital        only  of the  respondents who said they intended to be        vaccinated in our survey actually accepted the vaccine        when shortly thereafter it was offered        A limitation of this study was that the group surveyed        was not a random sample of the population of interest        which has implications for the generalizability of the        results However hospitals from several regions of the        country were included and the response rate was high         including in venues where most members of a        particular subgroup would have been expected to be present        eg staff meetings of ED doctors Moreover our results        for healthcare workers are similar to those of        randomdigitdial telephone surveys of the general public        also carried out in       both in the proportions        of respondents reporting willingness to be vaccinated and        in the perception of risk of a smallpox attack        We found wide variation among hospitals in both the        proportion of staff expressing a willingness to be        immunized and the proportion perceiving a threat of        bioterrorist attack Bivariate analyses turned up no        pattern with respect to geographic region size of        hospital or type of hospital community vs tertiary        care It is possible that local effects eg inhospital        education programs opinions of hospital authorities the        rumor mill are important in healthcare workers        decisionmaking at least on this issue        Knowledge about smallpox vaccination was one of the        factors associated with expressed willingness to be        vaccinated but we think it more likely that an intention        to get vaccinated leads one to seek more information rather        than that greater information leads one to seek        vaccination        Responses about projected behavior under hypothetical        scenarios involving a smallpox release are perhaps not        reliable as the level and effect of panic likely cannot be        accurately imagined Nonetheless it is worth noting that        social desirability bias would tend to overestimate the        proportion of people willing to put themselves at risk for        the common good Thus the onethird of respondents who        said without qualification they would come to work        unvaccinated in the event of a smallpox admission is likely        an overestimate                    Conclusions        We conclude that the success of smallpox vaccination        efforts will ultimately depend on the relative weight in        peoples minds of the risk of vaccine adverse events        compared with the risk of being exposed to the disease        Although more than half of the group we surveyed thought        the likelihood of a bioterrorist smallpox attack was        intermediate or high less than  of the group slated for        vaccination has actually accepted it at this time Unless        new information about the threat of a smallpox attack        becomes available perceptions of the vaccines risks will        likely continue to drive the ongoing decisions of        healthcare workers about this vaccine                    Competing Interests        None declared                    Authors Contributions        KY developed the questionnaire in collaboration with
