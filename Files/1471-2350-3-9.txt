                    Background        Hemochromatosis is common among northwestern European        peoples and their descendants This disorder is typically        associated with homozygosity for the CY mutation of the         HFE gene exon  nt  GA on Chp            CY lies within an ancestral haplotype which        includes the human leukocyte antigen HLA haplotype        AB        The ancestral haplotype is the        predominant hemochromatosisassociated haplotype in many        northwestern European countries including Ireland            Brittany     Denmark      Sweden     and        Germany      This is attributed to the origin of the        CY mutation on an AB haplotype in northwestern        Europe and its early dissemination by Vikings             Modification of the ancestral chromosome by recombination        and admixture as a result of geographic migration explains        the occurrence of chromosomes bearing CY in association        with different HLA haplotypes           Thus        some nonancestral haplotypes also occur with significantly        increased frequencies in hemochromatosis patients in        various countries in Europe and in descendants of Europeans                    In North America phenotype frequencies of HLA alleles        in persons with hemochromatosis and in control populations        have been reported from Canada Utah and Minnesota              HLA haplotype frequencies for hemochromatosis        patients and control subjects in North America have been        reported only from Utah     The purpose of the present        work was to quantify and analyze the frequencies of HLAA        and B alleles and haplotypes in hemochromatosis probands        with CY homozygosity in central Alabama and to compare        the present results to those reported in other        populations                    Subjects and Methods                  Selection of subjects                      Hemochromatosis probands            The performance of this work was approved by the            Institutional Review Boards of Brookwood Medical Center            and the University of Alabama at Birmingham A            presumptive diagnosis of hemochromatosis was            established using an elevated transferrin saturation            criterion each proband was subsequently evaluated for            iron overload and its complications       All            probands in the present study were white adults              years of age Probands were included who had a            diagnosis of hemochromatosis in routine medical care            during the interval    b CY homozygosity            c available HLAA and B typing and d residence in            central Alabama No patient declined to undergo             HFE mutation analysis after it            was determined that heshe had a hemochromatosis            phenotype There were A and B typing data in             probands Haplotypes could not be determined in             probands due to similarities in alleles of probands and            family members or due to unavailability of family            members for analysis Thus there were haplotype data            on  probands                                Control subjects            Data from  apparently normal unrelated white            adult subjects from Alabama who had undergone A and B            phenotype analysis as part of paternity testing were            used to estimate allele and gene frequencies                 RT Acton unpublished observations A and B            haplotypes were determined in  unrelated white            subjects from Alabama children and their mothers            andor putative fathers who had undergone testing to            establish paternity                                    Laboratory methods          Serum iron concentration transferrin saturation and          serum ferritin concentration were measured using          automated clinical methods Sections of liver biopsy          specimens were stained using hematoxylin and eosin          Massons trichrome and Perls Prussian blue techniques          intrahepatocytic iron was graded according to the method          of Scheuer et al                        HFE mutation analysis was performed          as previously described     A and B alleles were          detected using lowresolution DNAbased typing          PCRsequencespecific oligonucleotide probe in probands              Control subjects were tested using the          microdroplet lymphocytotoxicity test     subjects          were evaluated using antisera that detected allele          assignments described in the  thInternational          Histocompatibility Workshop     Because the levels          of resolution of the DNAbased and serological typing          methods we used are similar alleles detected by these          respective methods provide concordant allele assignments          with the exception of B and B that were not          detected by serological methods           HFE mutation analysis and HLA          typing of family members were performed to permit          assignment of Chp haplotypes In each proband in whom a          single A or B allele was detected by DNAbased typing we          verified the alleles and set phase to ascertain          haplotypes of the proband using           HFE and HLA analyses of appropriate          family members For the present analysis all haplotypes          were defined only by A and B alleles and the ancestral          haplotype was defined as a hemochromatosisassociated          Chp bearing AB and           HFE CY                          Literature review          For most comparisons recent tabulations of A and B          allele associations in  casecontrol studies from          thirteen countries and A and B haplotype analyses in          persons with hemochromatosis and control subjects in          eight countries or regions were used     We also          made computerized and manual searches to identify          estimates of the prevalence of CY homozygosity in          hemochromatosis cases in various countries or regions for          which A and B haplotype data were also available                          Statistical considerations          A data set that included HLA types in  probands and

Table                           Comparison of Alabama hemochromatosis probands with          persons with hemochromatosis in other locations                      HLAA and B alleles            We compared the present results with data in a            previously published tabulation of A and B allele            associations in  casecontrol studies from             countries or regions in Europe Australia and North            America     This tabulation yielded a mean A            phenotype frequency of  range    in            hemochromatosis patients and  range               in control subjects     In Alabama subjects            therefore the A phenotype frequencies in probands             and control subjects  were similar to            the corresponding mean values previously tabulated                However the OR for hemochromatosis associated with            A in Alabama probands  was somewhat greater            than the corresponding mean value of aggregate data

increase in this            haplotype was detected in hemochromatosis cohorts in            Brittany and Utah      A significantly increased            frequency of the haplotype AB was observed in            the present Alabama hemochromatosis probands whereas a            relative increase in this haplotype was reported in            hemochromatosis cohorts in Sweden Brittany and Utah

available Table              Additional file                 Additional File                         Click here for file                                      Discussion        A positivity was detected in more than  of Alabama        CY homozygous hemochromatosis probands in the present        study Similarly the frequency of A positivity was        significantly increased in Alabama hemochromatosis probands        diagnosed before the discovery of         HFE     These observations are        consistent with and extend the findings of  previously        reported casecontrolled studies from thirteen countries        which demonstrate the significantly increased prevalence of        A in persons with hemochromatosis     The alleles        B and B were also more common in the present Alabama        probands and in Alabama probands diagnosed before discovery        of         HFE than in corresponding control        subjects     The present analysis demonstrates that        this is attributable largely to the association of B and        B with A consistent with observations in persons        with hemochromatosis patients from many locations        including Ireland     Brittany        Denmark             Sweden       Germany               Portugal      Italy      and Utah            The frequency of the ancestral haplotype defined by        AB in the present Alabama probands is greater than        that reported in persons with hemochromatosis reported from        most other areas It is possible that our method of        selection of subjects for the present study could partly        account for this We selected only probands who had a        hemochromatosis phenotype and CY homozygosity Across        other studies of HLA haplotypes in subjects with        hemochromatosis criteria for definition of hemochromatosis        phenotypes differed Some studies included probands        whereas others included probands and all family members        with hemochromatosis some required demonstration of        segregation with HLA haplotypes and others did not                      None used         HFE mutation analysis as an inclusion        criterion as we required in the present study In several        countries in northwestern Europe however the percentage        of CY homozygotes in hemochromatosis case series is        greater than          In Queensland a        frequency of CY homozygosity of  was reported among        patients identified by phenotype criteria     Thus        the selection criterion of CY homozygosity in the        present study nonetheless resulted in a group of        hemochromatosis probands the         HFE genotypes of which are similar to        those of hemochromatosis patients of northwestern European        descent in other studies        The absolute frequencies of haplotypes AB        AB AB AB AB AB        AB AB AB and AB in addition        to AB and AB haplotypes were significantly        greater in Alabama probands than in control subjects A        significantly increased absolute frequency of the haplotype        AB has also been reported in hemochromatosis        patients in Italy     The present observations        regarding this haplotype may be attributable to the large        subgroup of persons of Italian and Sicilian descent in        central Alabama     A significantly increased        frequency of the haplotype AB was observed in the        present Alabama hemochromatosis probands whereas a        relative increase in this haplotype was detected in        hemochromatosis cohorts in Brittany and Utah only after        correction of the data for the preponderance of other        haplotypes      Similarly a significantly increased        frequency of the haplotype AB was observed in the        present Alabama hemochromatosis probands whereas a        relative increase in this haplotype was detected in        hemochromatosis cohorts in Sweden Brittany and Utah after        correction of the data for the preponderance of other        haplotypes       The absolute frequency of the        haplotype AB was increased in central Alabama        hemochromatosis probands whereas a corrected frequency        of AB was increased in hemochromatosis patients from        Denmark     The other aforementioned haplotypes except        AB and AB have not been reported to occur        with increased frequency in any hemochromatosis cohort from        locations other than Alabama Thus we observed a greater        number of haplotypes which were significantly increased in        frequency among the present Alabama hemochromatosis        probands than have been reported in other hemochromatosis        populations including a cohort in Utah     This could        be attributed to a greater degree of genetic heterogeneity        among whites in Alabama consistent with previous reports        of genetic characteristics of persons with hemochromatosis        in this geographic area      Alternatively we had        greater power to achieve statistical significance in the        present analyses than did some other studies Nonetheless        the percentage of the present probands who were        HLAhaploidentical with at least one other proband        indicates that the haplotypes among hemochromatosis        patients in central Alabama are more restricted than those        in the general population             In Alabama subjects with hemochromatosis the AB        haplotype is not invariably associated with inheritance of        CY The frequency of the AB haplotype was        significantly increased in Alabama hemochromatosis probands        without CY     some of whom had the common         HFE missense mutation HD            AB haplotypes associated with HD have also been        described in Alabama subjects with primary antibody        deficiency     Some Alabama subjects with        hemochromatosis have an AB haplotype which includes        the novel         HFE missense mutation IT            Thus a variety of         HFE missense mutations occur in        association with AB haplotypes in white        Alabamians                    Conclusions        A and AB frequencies are increased in Alabama        probands like other hemochromatosis cohorts Increased        absolute frequencies of the haplotype AB have been        reported only in the present Alabama probands and in        hemochromatosis patients in Italy Increased absolute        frequencies of AB AB AB AB        AB AB AB AB and AB        were detected in the present cohort of Alabama        hemochromatosis probands but these haplotypes have not        been reported to occur with increased absolute frequency in        other hemochromatosis populations Modification of the        ancestral chromosome by recombination and admixture as a        result of geographic migration could explain the previously        undescribed occurrence of HLA haplotypes that occur in        association with CY These results could also be        explained by the greater degree of genetic heterogeneity in        white Alabamians than in other populations and by the        larger numbers of probands and control subjects and greater        statistical power to demonstrate significant differences in        the present study than in some similar previous studies A        variety of         HFE missense mutations occur in        association with AB haplotypes in white        Alabamians                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors
