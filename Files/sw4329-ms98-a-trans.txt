        okay so i guess it starts recording now   okay   i dont know really know that much about the recycling in this area that were in we live in the Saginaw area   Saginaw   umhum and im not real familiar with uh anything that i in fact the far as i know the school doesnt have any kind of programs or anything out here and uh or the grocery story or anything in this area yeah   really the recycling we live in Plano and they started off recycling by um putting the i think at each WalMart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which it now i guess the uh city has has bought these big green trash cans and uh we they have a recycling truck that comes around now and you separate your glass and paper   uhhuh   and uh aluminum and you set it out and they pick it up and it it works real neat they seem to be having a real good response   really   but   that is pretty good im were originally from another state and i know in the state we were from that they did that type similar type thing the city brought out you know separate trash separate trash cans and you separated your stuff and you put it in there and they took it you know   did they did they like on bottles did they give you a so many cents back for   i dont really know i dont really know they they started after we moved down here and so i im not really familiar i just know that and my inlaws up in up in Oklahoma thats how they do you know they pick it up but i dont know if they get a   for cans even ive seen that in really   get anything back on it or do you get money for it   no ive just i noticed in Iowa and other cities like that its a nickel per aluminum can   oh   so you dont see too many thrown out around the streets   really   even bottles you know all kinds of bottles they they they really charge people to uh i guess when you purchase them and and then when you turn them back in   right   i know i remember the old days as a kid where a bottle was a nickel and   right and now now most of them are the throwaway     right so maybe thats one thing they could do to   and yeah i think now theyre a lot more expensive than that um i bought some Cokes the other day in the bread the little bottles   umhum   you know and i think the bottles were like i know they were at least ten cents apiece i was trying to figure out how i was like God how much were those bottles you know and it was they come in like uh eight and and eight and ten packs you know   well thats right   instead of six packs and uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles you know i was like God Almighty costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes   that was my brothers first job in a grocery store he was in the bottle area   were gonna bump our heads what a job   its pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over but but its uh   right   its quite they say that the green glass now that theres a big glut   oh really   of green   of green glass   with the green glass yeah its amazing   uh well out in this area they really dont have anything now i know that like Minyards   uhhuh   and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front   right   yeah different colors for different things and and things like that but i i did know some of these places were doing that and they discontinued them because people coming and dumping their trash in them   right yeah its i notice the plastics have sort of faded away the milk jugs it its   yeah   people just they they really dont uh theres too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff   yeah   yeah its i dont know it it can be its not as easy   more than its worth     collecting you know clean junk as they say   right right well who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away   thats right thats right its like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher   right i know   we all do it        well it was nice talking to you   it was nice talking to you i have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything   well i think i think two or three minutes is fine and yeah   it is that it okay well it was nice talking to you and i i guess ill do this for i was doing this from actually i was gonna do it for my son so that he could uh he hes in high school so that he could uh make some money   right   and but then it has my name on it so im like okay ill sit down here and call it   oh were doing it for a church choir so   oh are you   yeah so   oh thats interesting thats nice well thank you goodbye   well thank you bye bye
