why does aFishers of Men baseball hat make me want to spit bile Two reasons             Aesthetics  Christian sportswear bears the samerelation to piety that Tommy Hilfiger clothing does to good taste Its acheesy commercialized imitation of the real thing For a bracing look athypocrisy in cyberspace take a look at the claims these schmattepeddlers make on their Web sites            XP Apparelhelps people of all ages meet Christs challenge by providing clothing thathelps them share their faith            Spiritual Wear hopes toprovide a means for individuals churches and organizations to express theirreligious convictions Actually they go beyond mere selfexpression Withour products we strive to provide the Christian community with wearablemessages that motivate people to consider their own religiousconvictions            What Would Jesus Do acompany that moves WWJD coffee cups sweatshirts and watches offers thiswarranty Rest assured that when you purchase our WWJD products you

religious to benauseated by entrepreneurs professing sanctity for their productsIncidentally while all the Christhonoring retailing sites I examined claimedto donate a portion of profits to charity
