                                 Libertarianism Is Not Anarchism                        I have been asked to kick off thisdiscussion with Larry about what may be termed the rapid colonization of theInternet As with all new spaces someone has to figure out the rights andduties of all the participants to that new world And to do that it becomesimportant to use but not abuse the analogies that are available to us fromexisting spaces In doing this inquiry we can work the issue descriptivelyand ask how things have gone But the focus I think of Larrys book is toask the normative question given who we are as people what ought to be theway in which this new space is occupied by its new tenants            In answering that question Ill take my cue from Larrys favorite foil thelibertarian to see how he or she would inhabit that space I might also statefrom the outset that I take this tack with a certain rooting interest since myaffection for libertarian thought at least of the limitedgovernment varietylong antedates my concern with cyberspace In so doing I shall break rankshowever from those cyberspace devotees who think on Larrys account thatcyberspace is unique because its basic structure or its nature rules out ofbound any form of effective state regulation            I confess that this is not my understanding of the problem at all The useof nature as a trope for libertarian thought goes back a long way beforecyberspace There were lots of libertarians who thought that human beings wereby nature free or that individuals could acquire property by first possessionthat is for nonlawyers the capture of animals or movables or theoccupation of land Indeed occupation was called the natural mode ofoccupation But these efforts to win the libertarian battle by appealing tosome sort of natural law natural right or natural necessity always turnedout to be losers Someone could come along and argue that the brute fact ofpossession did not translate itself into a right But of course skepticismcould run in every conceivable direction at once so that once the challengewas made at least one riposte was possible Animals lands and chattels arenot communal by nature either Someone has to come up with an argument thatshows why their preferred form of social organization should induce the rest ofus as rational agents to sign on to their program Stated in that way the casefor private property rests on the incentives that it creates for thepreservation and spread of wealth while the case against it rests on similarutilitarian commitments giving private ownership to a river blockstransportation recreation and aesthetic values And then one has to pair updifferent regimes of ownership with different kinds of assets            So it is with cyberspace It is quite possible to think that it is best forgovernment to have a copy of each and every communication that takes placeacross the net and someone armed with that conviction could think it proper tostage nighttime raids in private homes to shut down nonconforming machines Orwe could simply refuse to allow people to communicate over the net much theway in which the old Soviet system refused to allow private individuals tocommunicate with each other by telephone So I quite agree that the legalstructure sensible or Draconian as it might be can shape the nature ofinteractions on the net just as it has shaped interaction first on land andsea and then on the spectrum If Larry wants to call the sum of regulationpublic and private code so be it But I dont see what the use of thatterminology which cuts at variance with ordinary English adds to thediscussion of the matter            That said I think that it is important to answer the question of why somany people who are attracted to the Net call themselves or think of themselvesas libertarian Here on earth the libertarian is not an anarchist whothinks that all government conduct is bad and all private conduct good He doesnot believe as Larry would have him say that government in the modernlibertarians view is the threat to liberty private action is not Page Nor would a libertarian accept that his goal is focused on reducinggovernments power That is surely the current objective given the bloatedgovernment that we have But it is not the way in which alibertariantraditional or modernthinks about government if we start aspolitical theory often starts in the state of nature Rather the libertarianis someone whose objective function starts with the goal of minimizing the useof force and fraud in human interactions The hard part of the system is tofigure out a way in which that minimization takes place over both public andprivate actors Aggression by private persons produces small gains and verylarge losses which is why we allow force in selfdefense But aggressionthatis the use of force by governmentis subject to the same peril and becomeseven more dangerous if the state falls into the wrong hands when it has amonopoly of force against all persons Unfortunately the world is such that wewill not minimize the total amount of aggression by reducing the amount ofgovernment aggression to zero That is why the libertarian is not an anarchistBut we would like with some sense of rough justice to create a system inwhich each increment of government force results in a greater decrement ofprivate force so that at the margin the sum of both is minimized But eventhat program is called into question at least in part because some governmentcoercion is justified such as taxes to secure the creation of infrastructureand the police force to prevent private aggression while curbing the excessesof rogue officers            One real dispute is just how much force results in the social optimum Ifone looks to the Internet it is clear that we can get along with a lot lessgovernment force than in other places Physical aggression against neighbors isruled out in part by the anonymous participation that is possible online Andthere is a widespread recognition of the inability to form a complexinfrastructure by largely private means Someone perhaps the state has to organize someinfrastructure over which all communications must travel But then it ispossible as in physical space to add on to that collective spine all sorts ofgated communities in cyberspace which can be subject to their own internalorganization and rules Larry is right to point out that the architecture ofthe Harvard system is more centralized to its detriment than the Chicagosystem But to a libertarian that is just fine since each of theseorganizations is internally organized under a principle of unanimous consentBut it is the want of force and the successful nature of voluntary interactionsthat allow people to see how much can be done without government            But still the idea that liberty converges onto anarchy seems to me to bemisguided It is still possible to steal confidential information that istransferred on the net and so we need at a minimum some law of privacy andtrade secrets It is possible to defame people over the net and to do so farand wide The problem of multijurisdiction squabbles over libel and slanderdoes not disappear It is possible to blackmail people over the net as wellAnd so it goes As a libertarian I dont see the net as a safe harbor fromgovernment regulation But I do see it as a place in which the social successesfrom following libertarian norms of force fraud and taxation for exampleyield pretty positive results And if those principles work so well incyberspace then maybe we should have a greater attraction to them in our moreearthbound behaviors as well That said its over to Larry to explain why thesame version of sensible libertarianism private property freedom of contractsome state supplied infrastructure and easy taxation should not guide ouractivities in cyberspace as it does on earth
