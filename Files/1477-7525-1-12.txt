                    Background        New antiretroviral therapies introduced in the mid s        have allowed many persons with HIV infection to live longer        before progressing to AIDS and to have longer survival        following an AIDS diagnosis       The annual number        of deaths due to AIDS in the United States peaked in         and has since declined     resulting in an increase in        the number of prevalent AIDS cases Current clinical        guidelines    call for persons infected with HIV to take        a combination of antiretroviral medications to decrease        viral load maintain immune cell function and prevent the        development of resistant viral strains Thus for many        patients the treatment of HIV has evolved more toward a        model of chronic disease management with patients taking a        variety of potent medications for extended periods of        time        Besides clinical outcomes healthrelated quality of        life HRQOL and disability are important issues for        persons treated for chronic diseases                 including HIV infection       Populations with HIV        infection or AIDS have reported different levels of HRQOL        both in clinical trials       and        populationbased research       We present summary        information from a multisite supplemental surveillance        project that describes the levels of HRQOL reported by        HIVinfected persons in different demographic and        behavioral risk factor groups stressing the relationship        between disease progression and HRQOL                    Methods        Since  the Centers for Disease Control and        Prevention CDC has conducted the Supplement to HIVAIDS        Surveillance SHAS Project an ongoing crosssectional        interview study designed to collect supplemental behavioral        surveillance data from persons with HIV infection            Persons  years of age or older reported with HIV or AIDS        through routine case surveillance were eligible for        participation Participants were enrolled using one of        three methods  facilitybased recruitment of all        eligible persons seeking treatment at selected health care        facilities in Atlanta Connecticut Denver Detroit        Florida and New Jersey  populationbased recruitment        of all eligible persons in Arizona Delaware New Mexico        and South Carolina and  populationbased recruitment of        a  sample of men who have sex with men MSM and  of        all other eligible persons in Washington State and Los        Angeles County California During the period examined for        this analysis Arizona Denver Detroit New Jersey and        South Carolina interviewed persons with HIV infection in        addition to those with AIDS Three sitesDetroit South        Carolina and Washingtonopted not to collect data using        the HRQOL module and were excluded from all analyses        Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior        to the interview and the study has received institutional        review board approval at both the CDC and local levels        Trained interviewers conducted a standardized interview in        either English or Spanish that includes questions on        demographic characteristics drug and alcohol use sexual        behaviors and medical and social service information Data        are selfreported and are not verified through medical        record review or clinical tests On average interviews take        approximately  minutes to complete Data were sent to CDC        without any personal identifying information        The format of the SHAS Project allows the questionnaire        to be modified to collect data on additional topics of        interest From January  through December  a module        of questions adapted from research conducted by Albert Wu        and colleagues    was added to study the levels of        selfreported HRQOL Wu et al compiled questions from the        RAND Medical Outcomes Study MOS    as well as        additional items to measure other dimensions of health        energy distress and cognitive function potentially        relevant to HIV disease Wu et al found that their modified        health status questionnaire reliably and distinctly        measured aspects of health among HIVpositive persons        recruited for two clinical trials of zidovudine        HIVinfected persons who were asymptomatic had higher        scores on most HRQOL dimensionsindicating relatively less        disability and a better quality of lifethan persons who        were diagnosed with early AIDS related complex        The SHAS Quality of Life module was used to collect        information on selfreported HRQOL in the following        dimensions Overall Health Pain Physical Functioning        Role Functioning Social Functioning Mental Health        EnergyFatigue and Cognitive Functioning These eight        HRQOL dimensions were measured using  questions a subset        of the  MOS questions used by Wu et al Response scores        for each HRQOL dimension were transformed linearly on scale        of  to  Multiitem dimensions were scored by summing        item responses and internal consistency coefficients        Cronbachs alpha     were calculated For each        dimension lower scores indicate relatively lower        selfperceived quality of life for that health measure        compared to higher scores        Analysis of variance tests were used to compare crude        mean HRQOL scores across demographic and behavioral        categories because the sample was large the significance        level for univariate analysis was set at P          Multivariate linear regression leastsquares means was        used to identify independent factors associated with HRQOL        in the statistical models analyses included variables        noted from the literature as potentially associated with        quality of life eg age sex education and income        Linear regression models were then constructed using the        separate HRQOL dimension scores as the outcomes here the        significance level was set at P   TukeyKramer        adjustments for multiple comparisons were used where        appropriate Age and education were included in the models        as continuous predictor variables CD count gender        income raceethnicity mode of exposure time known to be        HIV currently taking antiretroviral therapy yes versus        no and type of SHAS recruitment populationbased versus        facilitybased were included as categorical predictor        variables To simplify comparisons across HRQOL dimensions        we report results for models including all predictor        variables regardless of whether any individual variable        was predictive of the outcome All analyses were conducted        using SAS Version  SAS Institute Inc Cary NC        USA                    Results        From January  through December   persons        were identified for interview at the nine sites that        administered the HRQOL module Of these  were found to        have died before they could be contacted Of the remaining           completed SHAS interviews          refused to participate   could not be located        and   were located but were too ill either        physically or mentally to participate Sites phased out        the HRQOL module at various times during the twoyear        period HRQOL data were available from  interviews        Persons

HRQOL decreased as CD        count decreased CD count was not associated with the        measures of Mental Health and Cognitive Function        We were also interested in the relationship between        antiretroviral therapy and HRQOL Most of the study        population  was currently taking antiretroviral        medication Taking antiretroviral medication differed        significantly by CD

persons not currently taking        medication  P   However in the        multivariate models examining HRQOL scores stratified by        CD count currently taking antiretroviral medication was        not associated with differences in HRQOL                    Discussion        Disability and healthrelated quality of life are        becoming increasingly important issues associated with HIV        disease New developments in the treatment of HIV have        produced dramatic improvements in the clinical and        immunologic health for many patients with a resulting        reduction in deaths due to AIDS in the United States Along        with clinical indicators of morbidity and mortality        measures of HRQOL such as physical functioning mental        health pain and energy can help guide treatment        decisions for both patients and providers        Like other researchers we found that lower HRQOL scores        and poorer perception of health were associated with more        advanced disease A majority of the SHAS participants had        an AIDS diagnosis at the time of their interview However        a broad range of CD levels is represented in the study        population Both facilitybased and populationbased        strategies were used to recruit SHAS participants The        study population included large numbers of women        racialethnic minorities and persons infected with HIV        through injection drug use or heterosexual risk These        groups have not been extensively reported in previous        studies of HIV and HRQOL in which the populations have        been more representative of white male clinic patients                 Where significant differences were found        by univariate analysis women blacks Hispanics and        persons infected with HIV through injection drug use had        lower mean HRQOL scores However in multivariate linear        regression sex raceethnicity and HIV infection risk        were not associated with differences in HRQOL when        stratified by CD count        Several limitations should be considered in the        interpretation of our findings SHAS is a crosssectional        interview study with data selfreported by the participant        Critical indicators of disease progression such as CD        count were not confirmed through clinical testing or        review of medical records Among those who reported having        ever had a CD count  could not recall the most        recent CD count on most HRQOL dimensions their scores lay        between the scores for the lowest and middle CD groups        This finding suggests they were more advanced in their HIV        disease indeed  were reported to the national        surveillance system as having AIDS The SHAS questionnaire        also did not adequately capture the composition of a        persons past and current antiretroviral therapies or the        duration of and adherence to those therapies        Specifically this questionnaire does not assess the        effects of protease inhibitor therapy on HRQOL as those        medications were introduced during the period the HRQOL        module was used Of the  persons taking antiretroviral        medications at the time of interview only          reported taking protease inhibitors Although other studies        have also reported that questions adapted from the MOS        discriminated differences in HRQOL among populations with        HIV         the SHAS questionnaires shorter        item subset of the MOS questions may limit direct        comparison of our results with those of other studies        Still our findings from the HRQOL analysis in SHAS        generally agree with those in other published research        Quality of life issues are also important for persons        with HIV as they relate to medication adherence Complex        medication regimens and side effects can affect both        quality of life and adherence        Resistant        viral strains may emerge when adherence to antiretroviral        regimens is suboptimal After the initial HRQOL module was        used the SHAS questionnaire was modified to include        questions on use of past and current medications including        protease inhibitors duration of current therapies        measures of adherence and reasons for lack of adherence        These questions should provide valuable new data on the        relationship of disease progression therapy and HRQOL        among participants in the SHAS Project                    Conclusions        The evolution toward treatment of HIV disease as a        chronic illness presents additional challenges for patients        and clinicians Measures of healthrelated quality of life        can provide important information to behavioral and        clinical studies of antiretroviral treatment adherence        and viral resistance  factors that ultimately influence        HIVrelated morbidity and
