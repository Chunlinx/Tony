                                 Were All OneWorlders Now            Back when I first joinedthe ranks of oneworlders more than a decade ago we were an easy species todescribe earnest well meaning and hopelessly naive We envisioned aneventual era of global peace a time when nationalism had lost its edge andnationstates had surrendered some sovereignty to global forums like the UnitedNations or even a true World Parliament This fuzzy idealism earned us themoniker woollyminded oneworlders as well as the often correct stereotypethat we were raving lefties            But then came the sWith the Cold War over and economic globalization accelerating the ideologicalmap went topsyturvy Suddenly books giddily proclaiming The Twilight ofSovereignty were being written not by the beadsandsandals crowd but bycapitalists former Citibank head Walter Wriston in the case of that titleMeanwhile less enthusiastic tracts with ominous titles like One WorldReady or Not  were being written by raving lefties William Greider whonow saw the withering of the nationstate as deeply problematic            Whilethis new debate rages though oneworldism marches on We may never get to theWorld Parliament phase But the migration of governance from the national tothe supranational level is proceeding apace in lots of little but ultimatelymomentous ways If this fact were more widely appreciated globalization mightget a warmer reception on the left            The reason left and right seem to have tradedplaces over oneworldism is that the term has more than one meaningOldschool oneworlders eg Woodrow Wilson were concerned mainly withpeace The aspect of the nationstate they most wanted to constrain wasaggression What excites people like Wriston and Newt Gingrich is theconstraint placed on a nations domestic policies by worldwide capitalismGlobal bond markets punish national governments that splurge on safety netsGlobal labor markets punish nations with a high minimum wage or costlyenvironmental standards One world now means a single planetary market thatcan sweep away national policies designed in a simpler era to blunt themarkets sharp edges            Hencethe sudden provincialism of liberals Supranational bodies like the World TradeOrganization and NAFTA are seen as mere lubricants of laissez faire And fornow at least they indeed are little more than that Still even the newoneworldism ought to hold some appeal for believers in the old version likeme for three reasons            First remember world peace You knowthemushy ideal that got us laughed off the stage in the first place Supranationalbodies are its friend In the recent book War Before Civilization Lawrence Keeley observes that trade by itself is not inherently pacifyingIndeed the dependence it creates can be volatile Witness Japans testyresponse on Dec   to the United States cutting off oil exports Butas Keeley also notes when international tribunals exist to resolve disputestrade is generally pacifying So the WTO should spell less bloodshedThe European Union already does            Second remember universalbrotherhood You knowconcern for the worlds poor and downtrodden As PaulKrugman recentlynoted in Slate free trade gives millions of poor people a step up theladder Yes that may mean working in a sweatshop But these people manifestlyprefer that to their prior condition It may come as a shock to some suburbanAmerican liberals but for children in Pakistan the alternative to stitchingReebok soccer balls is not being driven to soccer practice in a Volvo stationwagon Its deeper poverty            Thirdeven leaving lofty universalism aside international trade organizations canhelp promote a liberal agenda domestically In Britain the left supports theEuropean Union and the right doesnt One reason is that the EU meddles innational affairs with intrusive lefty regulation Maybe the Tories are rightthat some of the regulation is excessive but much of it isnt And anyway mypoint is just that a supranational trade body can in principle be supportedbyand thus be shaped bya centerleft coalition rather than a centerrightcoalition            Consider NAFTA It passed on a centerrightcoalition and reflects that fact But its not beyond change For negotiationsto admit Chile President Clinton wants a reluctant Congress to authorize himto include labor and environmental accords So if Clinton sticks to his gunsa big if and prevails we may have a new and improved NAFTA It could sayimpose stricter environmental standards on Mexico and Chile and give Mexicanand Chilean workers the right to bargain collectively Both provisions wouldraise Latin American labor costs and thus dull NAFTAs adverse effect on somelowwage American workers In essence this approach would use politicalglobalization to to a slightly less jarring pace            It isstrange that so many of those most offended by globalization call themselvesprogressives Early this century the progressives were people who realizedthat communications and transportation technologies were pushing the scope ofeconomic activity outward from individual states to the United States as awhole They responded by pushing economic regulation from the state to thefederal level The analogous leap today is from national to supranationalregulation Yet many of todays progressives are economic nationalists viewingunilateral tariffs as the policy tool of choice            Evolutionary psychology tells us that economicintercourse is about as deeply ingrained in the human brain as any other formof intercourse If you doubt this read Matt Ridleys excellent new bookThe Origins of Virtue  Thats one reason the ever expanding scope ofeconomic activity is essentially a force of natureit can be guided it can beslowed but it cant realistically be stopped The original progressiveschose to swim with this basic current of history Many of todaysprogressives are swimming against it            Stillglobalization is willynilly turning even progressives into de factooneworlders Witness the new antisweatshop consortium featuring Nike LizClaiborne Kathie Lee Gifford et al It sets minimally humane workingconditions that foreign factories must meet if their products are to sport aNo Sweat label And it arose not out of the goodness of Nike CEO PhilKnights heart but to keep leftwing nongovernmental organizationsespeciallyprogressive onesoff his back The of supranational NGO lobbying in generalis analyzed by Jessica Mathews in the JanuaryFebruary Foreign Affairs Thus the old left intentionally or not is pushing us from national regulationto supranational regulationalbeit in this case a kind of privatesectorsupranational regulation            In a way the oneworld battle is over Onceyou exclude fringe elements on both sidesRalph Nader and Pat Buchananbasicallyboth Democrats and Republicans accept the reality of NAFTA and theWTO even as they argue about whether these bodies should include environmentaland labor laws  la the EU Thus the existence of supranational bodies withsignificant functions of governance is no longer the issue Mainstreamconservatives sure arent complaining about the WTOs power to penalizecountries that fail to open their telecommunications to foreign investmentThe issue rather is the perennial issue whether governance will be to theright or the left In that sense were all oneworlders now            In fact were alloneworlders even in the old beadsandsandals sense Well almost all As thiscolumn is posted the Senate is poised to vote on the Chemical WeaponsConvention CWC opponents may muster the  votes needed to prevent atwothirds ratification vote thanks to the earnest but clueless Jesse Helmsand two of the most rabidly reactionary institutions in politics today theWall Street Journal s editorial page and a reptilian Cold War vestigecalled the Center for Security Policy Even so the fact remains that

Republicans PresidentsClinton Carter Ford and Bush and for all we know Reagan            In the old days liberalswanted peace and conservatives wanted law and ordera nice stable environmentfor
