                                  I Antichrist            Early one shiny autumn morning I got in my car anddrove to Lynchburg Va in order to find out whether or not I am theAntichrist You know the Beast the Worthless Shepherd the Little Horn theAbomination the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity That Antichrist            I had my suspicions Nowhere on my body could Ifind the mark of the Beastbut I do have a freckle thats shaped likeBermuda And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies ofSatan in a final bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain ofArmageddon I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia as well as chronic malaiseconditions that Im sure afflict the Antichrist            The surest suspicion Ihad about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I amJewish male and alive These are the qualifications for the job of Antichristas specified by Lynchburgs most famous preacher Jerry Falwell in a speech hemade earlier this year            I was actually going to see the Rev Falwell on a differentmatter the future of Jerusalem but I thought I might just slip thisquestionthe one about me maybe being the Antichristinto the stream of theinterview Falwell I guessed wouldnt be happy to discuss his views on theidentity of the Antichristhe had apologized for the remark but took quite aload of grief for it anyway            As it turned out thoughFalwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist And as it also turned out hedidnt really feel bad for saying what he said In fact he was more convincedthan ever that the Antichrist is a Jew who walks among us            Let me pause for a moment to give three concise reasons whyIm so curious about the identity of the Antichrist             I think I speak for all the approximately million adult male Jews in the world when I say that we get a little antsy whenChristians start looking at us like were the devil This is on account ofChristian behavior over the past  years by which I mean blood libels andpogroms and inquisitions those sorts of things             Ive always been possessed by the delusionalnotion that I am to play a major role in world history so why not a role inthe End of Days And I dont mean the Schwarzenegger movie             Now that we stand onthe lip of the millennium much of the evangelical Christian world is in thegrip of Armageddon fever and according to the evangelical interpretation ofthe books of Daniel and Revelation the Antichrist will make his appearancebefore Christ makes his and his is looking kinda imminent The Antichrist inthis reading will be a world leader who strikes a peace deal with Israel onlyto betray the Jewish state and make war on it until Jesus comes to the rescueThe thankful Jews those who are still alive will then become Christians andlive happily ever after These beliefs held by tens of millions of Christiansare journalistically speaking worthy of note            The day before my visit with the Rev Falwell I had justfinished reading a novelistic treatment of these events Assassins which is subtitled Assignment Jerusalem Target Antichrist Assassins is the sixth book in the Left Behind series left behindreferring to those unfortunate nonevangelical Christians who are not taken upto heaven in the Rapturethe opening act in Gods end days planand areforced to contend with the Antichrists evil reign on Earth The Left Behindseries cowritten by Tim LaHaye the prominent rightwing screwball andhusband of Beverly LaHaye the even more prominent rightwing screwball andJerry B Jenkins who his biography states is the author of  books whichis a lot of books for one guy to write is a phenomenon Ten million copies ofthe series have sold alreadyhundreds in my local PriceClub alone LeftBehind is the Harry Potter of the Armageddon set            The notable thing for meabout the Left Behind seriesbeside the fact that few in the secular mediahave noticed that millions of Americans are busy reading books warning aboutthe imminence of oneworld government mass death and the return of theMessiah is that all the Jewish characters are Christian LaHaye and Jenkinsare both active participants in the absurd and feverish campaign by someevangelical Christians to redefine Judaism in a way that allows for belief inJesus            Jews and again I feel comfortable speaking for all of ushere find this sort of Christian imperialism just a wee bit offensive Justimagine if Jews began an official campaign calling Muhammad irrelevant toIslamcan you imagine the fatwas that would produce            But evangelical leaders who are in my experienceuniformly kind and generous in their personal relations can also be terriblyobnoxious in their relations with Jews            There is only one roadto salvation for Jews and that road runs through Jesus LaHaye told me To hiscredit though LaHaye doesnt believe that the Antichrist will be Jewish Hewill be a European gentile who will kill lots of Jews The Jews will beforced to accept the idolatry of the Antichrist or be beheaded he said Thiswill take place during the sevenyear Tribulation            Jewish suffering though is divinely ordained Even thoughthe Antichrist will not be Jewish Jews are still capable of great evil andhave often been punished for their evil LaHaye explained Some of thegreatest evil in the history of the world was concocted in the Jewish mindLaHaye told me for reasons that arent entirely clearhe knew what the nameGoldberg generally signifies Sigmund Freud Marx these were Jewish mindsthat were infected with atheism            I asked LaHaye to tell me more about the Jewishmind            The Jewish brain also has the capacity for greatgood he explained God gave the Jews great intelligence He didnt give themgreat size or physical poweryou dont see too many Jews in the NFLbut hegave them great minds            Of all the evangelicalleaders I have interviewed LaHaye is capable of some of the most antiSemiticutterances which is troublesome because he is also the most popular author inthe evangelical world            The Rev Falwell is smoother than LaHaye He acknowledgeswhere the sensitivity comes from though he shows no understanding of therole the myth of the Antichrist played in the history of antiSemitism and herefuses to back away from his opinion that somewhere in Great Neck or West LAor Shaker Heights is living Satans agent            In my opinion he told me the Antichrist willbe a counterfeit of the true Christ which means that he will be male andJewish since Jesus was male and Jewish            I asked him if he understood that such statementsstrip Jews of their humanity which is the first step antiSemites take beforethey kill them He responded All the Jewish people we do business with on adaily basis not one has ever got upset over this It is not Jews who pickedthis most recent fight he said it is supporters of President Clinton            Billy Graham made thesame statement a dozen times last year but there was no comment about thatFalwell said But Billy Graham was not calling for the resignation of thepresident Falwell youll recall is no fan of Clintons he has even peddleda video accusing the president of murder            Falwell is right Evangelical preachers are constantlyaccusing the Jews of harboring the Antichrist            I asked Falwell if he knew the actual identity ofthe Antichrist No he said People might say its a certain person itsHenry Kissinger like that but the Lord does not let us know that            So theres a chance then that Im theAntichrist            Falwell chuckled a condescending chuckle Itsalmost amusing that question Of course not I know that youre not            Why            The Antichrist will be a world leader hell havesupernatural powers he said            He got me thereI have no supernatural powers Icant even drive a stick shift            I pressed him further onthe identity of the Antichrist but Falwell wouldnt play Well know theAntichrist when he arrives he said            Most evangelical leaders in fact refuse to publicly guessthe name of the Antichristthough as Falwell suggests Kissinger is aperennial favorite at least among those evangelicals who believe theAntichrist will be Jewish For most of their history Christian leaders hadbeen content to ascribe the characteristics of the Antichrist to the Jewishpeople as a whole Ever since the  nd century CE the verybeginning of the Antichrist legend Christians have associated Jews witheverything unholy Andrew Gow who teaches Christian history at the Universityof Alberta told me In the minds of early Christian leaders the church wasthe new Israel Gods covenant with the Jews was obsolete Therefore the Jewswho remained on Earth were there to serve devilish purposes Gow explained            There are plenty ofevangelical thinkers who differ with Falwell who believe like LaHaye thatthe Antichrist will be a gentile who rises out of Europe The Antichrist issupposed to make a peace treaty with Israel Ed Hindson the author of Isthe Antichrist Alive and Well  explained Why would a Jew make a peacetreaty with a Jewish state            Hindson suggested that Satan will make the Antichrist theleader of the European Unionthe revived Roman Empire eternal enemy ofIsraelthough Hindson disputed one popular idea advocated by Monte Judah anOklahomabased prophecyteacher that Prince Charles is the Antichrist            Theres no way Prince Charles is the AntichristHindson said Satan can do better than that            In his book Hindson runs through a list ofpotential candidates Bill Clinton is there of course as well as SaddamHussein and Ronald Wilson Reagan six letters in each of his three names Getit            Of course none of these men are gay            It says in the Biblethat the Antichrist will have no regard for women and so many evangelicalsinterpret that to mean that he will be a homosexual Hindson said though headded that hes not entirely convinced            This ideathe Antichrist as gaystrikes a chord with manyevangelicals just as the idea that the Antichrist is Jewish strikes achord            I gradually came to see how farfetched it was tothink that I might be the Antichrist Im not gay Im not famous I wouldntknow a euro if I found one in my wallet            Then it struck me Barry Diller is theAntichrist            Theres no way to know for sure But if you wake upone morning to read that Barry Diller is the head of the European Union andthat David Geffen is his deputy well remember where you read it first
