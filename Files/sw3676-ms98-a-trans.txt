                what kind of movies have you been seeing lately   uh  its been probably a month or so since ive been to the movies uh course my my favorite now is is Dances With Wolves   oh its an excellent movie   uh Silence of the Lan uh of the Lambs was good   Silence of the Lambs   uhhuh   what was that anyway because i didnt get a chance to see it   oh its a i guess its a mystery youd call it its with uh Jodie Foster   okay   and it uh its pretty good another one that i think i really liked was uh The Fisher King   umhum lets see who was in Fisher King that was um Robin Williams and uh   right   and um i cant say the other fellows name   how about you what are you   uh weve not been having many opportunities to see movies lately um we really enjoyed um Dead Poets Society   yes   um several years back when we saw uh we saw the we really really enjoyed was uh Ordinary People with um Timothy Hutton and uh Mary Tyler Moore and uh uh who played the father anyway excellent movie   right that was that was an excellent movie have you seen Dances With Wolves   yes we have   that whatd you think of it   oh we loved it   i dont think i can see it enough times   i know what you mean i know what you mean   course im a Kevin Costner fan   yeah um pretty impressed with stuff hes done uh he made kind of an odd sounding Robin Hood but uh i mean you know basic  thick western US accent for a Robin Hood just doesnt seem to fit but   no but you know it wasnt bad movie it got such bad reviews really and and i thoroughly enjoyed it but i then i wasnt expecting any classic either   oh no it was a good movie well um they did a real good job with it   i thought so   um they didnt try to make him super human or you know invincible they just he worked hard at it     have you seen The Fisher King   no i havent not had the opportunity to see that uh   uh it you you know i guess it it really isnt for everybody its its pretty deep and and uh uh philosophical   yeah   but i thought it had a wonderful message to it its kind you came out and looked at somebody says you know i think i liked that  and then the more you got to thinking about it the more you thought you know i did like it   yeah yeah   but when you first came out you werent real sure   it sounds kind of like one uh we saw at home here on the we rented it um Claras Heart   havent seen that   um its Whoopi Goldberg   oh yes i did yes i did   yeah she played a uh they um   uh nanny the nanny type   she was a housekeeper yeah shes a housekeeper she   housekeeper uhhuh   she was um oh no i cant say it not Haitian anyway she uh she seemed to be that sort of person that you know about seems half crazy but then again shes got a whole lot on the ball and the movie had the whole uh a lot of philosophical content more than more than you know it it wasnt a mystery it wasnt a you know blood and guts and violence and and and car chases type thing it was just a good movie   i saw one the other day that was A Kiss Before Dying   a Kiss Before Dying   umhum i had not heard about it when it was on the movies but was out on video   yeah   and its with Sean Young   yeah   and its a its a mystery it was very predictable i mean you knew you knew when the murder was gonna happen or something but it was still so well done   yeah   that it was enjoyable   thats that takes a good bit to make one thats predictable but still worth watching   thats right  i had uh oh uh i like the i think its called the uh   Razors Edge the no no the Jagged Edge the Jagged Edge   not familiar with that one oh okay   with uh
