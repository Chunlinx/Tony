                 okay whats your view   all right huh   whats your view   well i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns   yeah   personally   yeah thats true   i mean   you know even if they give it a shot its still going to be black market all over the place you know   thats right thats right   i dont know coming from Texas youre probably i dont know i i shouldnt make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think   yeah it is but im not really from   yeah   im not really from Texas i just live down here now ive ive lived down here a couple year   oh youre just living down there yeah   im originally originally from Colorado but   oh well   yeah there uh there uh theres a lot of hunters here     yeah well i know how you feel im uh i grew up in Nebraska and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know and   uhhuh   man theres no way  theres no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons thats just i dont know   i just think i think its ridiculous i mean   yeah it doesnt sit with me very well i dont know i anymore i keep a thirty eight in my truck you know   really   yeah i just about all well i live in Minneapolis and i well actually i live in Florida but i am staying in Minneapolis for a year   uhhuh   and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now   right   and its just you you never know who is out there you know its just for self protection purposes and then   right   of course theres the hunting issue so   sure   yeah thats good that do you do Jeff   uh i im in uh program control for a company up here   oh yeah   yeah   all right   we do schedules   yeah   programs programs schedule programs what do you do   im uh researcher of Honeywell up here   oh okay   so uh yeah you guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything or   uh i havent had a chance to do any hunting since ive been down here i dont own a shotgun but id like to go bird hunting   yeah you know thats something i miss quite a bit   so yeah uh when i was in Colorado we went dear and elk hunting   yeah   you you know quite a bit but   all right yeah my brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit but i dont know i guess that what the scale now is its zero for uh for a complete   one for a total ban and uh   thats right i guess i am about eight or nine   yeah i i agree with you there   yeah no doubt about it but uh   i mean if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they cant   yeah   i you know im not for it   yeah if there is if theres a way you know to limit it to to people that i dont know that they they i guess they passed a couple of uh of laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period   uhhuh   where they you know you go to buy a hand gun and then they actually uh i know its this way in Florida they have a waiting period where you buy one and thats a week   uhhuh   and then they check you out and make sure you dont have a record you know and things like that i think thats a pretty good idea uh and thats i dont know thats not a bad idea but then again you can always get around that you could go through the black market like you say you know you always be able to get around   sure   yeah its one of those things but uh i dont know i guess i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like im not real sure why anybody would need a fully automatic weapon   yeah i dont either   you know im just not i think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway   yeah i fully auto but even well        i mean a semiautomatic i guess thats   it kind of takes the sport out of hunting   yeah right     you know its like what can you do with that that you cant do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a or a or a twenty shot twelve   sure   you know you might do the same thing   right   and so its like i dont know it it it does it takes the sport out of it for me i would much rather have a bow any time     oh really   yeah i i like bows you know i have done some bow hunting and i uh i get into it and i think its more of a challenge you know   yeah   but uh i dont know i guess it keeps the shell makers in business   sure   but uh i dont know anyway thats about where i stand     me too yeah i am about the same way   you uh have you uh eaten yet or whatever   yeah   is it seven oclock there   uh yeah its about seven fifteen   you guys central oh okay   how is the weather up there   oh its its not too good its kind of rainy actually you know its   is it   around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh i dont know ten or twenty degrees and its been up around forty so people are   right   people are whining about the rain and stuff but not not too bad about the temperature ice is starting to melt and stuff like that so   yeah   i am just up here for the year or so and its kind of shock to
