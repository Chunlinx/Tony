        all right have you ever been to a family reunion     i go to a family reunion every year religiously its the  well i come from Iowa   oh wow tell me about that   my mother was one of nine children in the family uh seven of those children are still living and uh the family has grown of course and we get uh about a hundred and fifty people a year   wow   that show up at this family reunion i had come from a large like i say a large family i had forty four first cousins on my mothers side and we all know each other pretty well and and uh so its a wonderful occasion when we get together and we dont see everybody each year but you know alternate years we get to see most everybody   is uh       so what makes the reunion a good reunion   oh   what do they do i mean they can be real boring ive ive been to a couple as a kid     well you have to go with the right spirit of course uh i think what makes our family reunions so good is that we there is so much love that is shared there uh   okay so you must keep in touch with each other um other than at the reunion is that right   well yeah many of us do actually uh im in my fifties now and my mother came from a generation where the only option was writing   okay   postcards letters whatever   uhhuh   uh and she used to correspond with her sisters quite religiously and they with her so and of course that older generation still always sends all of us Christmas cards and its wonderful you know   yeah yeah thats   so uh but it it ours is the type of family if i had no place to be i could call anyone of my aunts or my cousins and they would say come and stay with me for a few weeks   oh wow that is good so when so when you guys have your reunion uh   umhum its   now im sure that sounds like you guys are pretty satisfied what about your your uh how how what do you do for the kids   oh well uh these attitudes are projected down to the kids that this is the place where we really want to go and and we can have a good time its not a boring thing uh i guess once in awhile about thirteen or so maybe its a little boring for them   yeah   if if they havent been there enough years to have formed friendships but my kids went every year and therefore they knew you know a lot of the other kids   uhhuh   so then you kind of look forward to seeing some of these second cousins once a year we do go to uh its Clear Lake Iowa where we hold it and we make every effort in the world to get the shelter house so we have a facility where we can be inside but yet the kids can go and be in the lake if they want to   is is uh and and how do you allocate uh i mean how do you decide when youre going to meet and   oh and thats set its going to be its always the first Sunday after the Fourth of July   oh okay well the first Sunday after the Fourth of July has got to be hot right   oh it is but then you cant find any time in Iowa when its not hot in the summertime     thats what i meant could be the springtime or something like that the kids are still in school then huh   oh yeah uhhuh well okay but Iowa is very agricultural and spring is not a good time to try to do anything   i see   because so many were involved with agriculture so so do you have a reunion   well my kids my parents uh used to have reunions and and uh wed go and and uh actually i kind of remember it as a lot of as a lot of fun but its been very tough to talk my kids into the idea of meeting any of the relatives uh i dont know exactly why thats true i think part of its because theyre   oh   uh they just dont know anybody and we our family is all scattered out we started in California but uh now everybodys all over the United States these days   uhhuh well you know with as many people as we have were all over the US too       but uh   i yeah i i know that theres a difference but i havent quite even even locally uh       i i guess ive got a brother that lives uh about a five hour drive from here and i havent seen him for twenty years so that tells you something about my   oh my what did you say your first name was Ralph   but its Ralph   uh Ralph shouldnt act like that   no no i shouldnt im uh i have to admit that its but when i hear these uh well of course i was the last of eight see   oh okay   the very last of eight and my parents were both married before and and uh so i only have half brothers and half sisters so thats i guess thats part of it they were all grown by the time i came along and uh   oh i see   i shouldnt say all grown but anyway its its one of those uh um i was always the youre their kid youre their kid and im not saying theyre not nice but but uh       you you know we dont have those stories   okay theres difference yeah uhhuh   real close uh uh i was always the little kid ill put it that way so thats and then the other side of it and the other thing too is that my parents uh uh my dad had five kids
