                                 Grishams Homily            It has never been hard tounderstand the appeal of Stephen King His is the fiction of the Americansubconscious idlit Tom Clancy is just as easy He stands at the vitalintersection of military documentary and Popular                Mechanics  OnlyJohn Grisham the third in the troika of leading airportbookstore brand namesremains mysterious What does he represent Nominally his genre is legalfiction But true legal fictionthe work of say Scott Turoworganizesitself around the courtroom and Grishams courtroom scenes are lackluster Heseems more comfortable with the before and afterwith the back and forth ofwhiteshoe lawyers who never leave the officethan with showdowns for thejudge and jury Had Grisham written The Caine Mutiny  Capt Queeg wouldhave settled            Nor isGrisham particularly good at the kinds of things you expect from a decentthriller writer Compared to say David Baldacci  Absolute Power  orJoseph Finder  The                Zero Hour  his plotting is pedestrian Whenit comes to character he can do hardworking naive upfromthemiddleclassassociates in their late s He can do brilliant crusty octogenarian seniorpartners And he can do publicinterest lawyers with Jewish last names Butthats about it Grishams protagonists tend to be more memorable in the movieversions of his novels than in the novels themselves which is remarkableconsidering that the movie versions arent terribly memorable to beginwith            So why is Grisham so successful The answer I think isthat his books proceed from a perspective radically different from that of hiscompetitors Most legal fiction begins with the criminal and derives the lawIts what enters at the end deus ex machina like to separate the heroesfrom the villains Grisham by contrast begins with the law and derives thecriminal In Grishams universe it is not the felonious mind that shapes thelegal world It is the legal world and its attendant institutions that shapethe felonious mind Of course lots of other people see the world this waytoo Its just that they tend to be politicalscience professors not thrillerwriters            Grishamsachievement is to use this inverted narrative to create a sense of purpose inhis novelsto make them seem consequential The Chamber  for instancewas a wonderful novel But it was also an incisive and brilliant argumentagainst the death penalty The Runaway Jury  Grishams penultimate bookwas an intelligent and compelling indictment of the tobacco industry thatbecause it was sold in the fiction aisle probably reached a thousand timesmore people than every other tobaccoindustry indictment combined To rereadGrishamin particular recent Grishamis to be struck by how completely he isdevoting his celebrity to the articulation of a passionate and decidedlyunfashionable liberalism This has never been more true though than inGrishams new book In The Street Lawyer  Grisham sheds whateverlingering attachments he may have had to the frivolity of his genre and emergesas a moralista skilled and worthy practitioner of the largely forgotten artof socially redeeming fiction            The Street Lawyer is the tale in the firstperson of Michael Brock a young naive upfromthemiddleclass associate ata large faceless corporate law firm in Washington DC Brock is on track tomake partner when a homeless man carrying a gun takes him hostage in the firmsplush conference room He escapes but the incident jars him He begins aperiod of soulsearching He quits his job He leaves his cold careerist wifeHe moves out of tony Georgetown and into an apartment in the bad part of townHe joins a tiny publicinterest group representing the poor and downtrodden Hebegins to investigate why the homeless man was so angry at Brocks former lawfirm and uncoversas have many Grisham protagonists before hima dirty littlesecret that his firm has tried to cover up            The bookhas a lean linear feel to it Things happen to Brock and he does not stop toask why He becomes involved with a woman a fellow activist but she appearsonly fleetingly She lifted the blanket and tucked herself next to meGrisham writes in the books sole romantic moment I held her firmly if notshe wouldve fallen onto the porch She was easy to hold The moment whenBrock decides to leave his highpaying job to help the poor comes as he sits athis desk comparing himself to Mordecai Green the publicinterest lawyer whoselegal clinic he is about to join This may be the most abbreviated epiphany inmodern literature            I helped my clientsswallow up competitors so they could add more zeros to the bottom line and forthis I would become rich He helped his clients eat and find a warm bed            I looked at thescratchings on my legal padthe earnings and the years and the path towealthand I was saddened by them Such blatant and unashamed greed            Thephone startled me            Grisham it is clear wants nothing to stand in the way ofhis central pointthat a man who surrenders all his worldly possessions todefend the homeless is a hero To have Brock agonize to have him spend thebulk of the book desperately weighing the pros and cons of his decision wouldbe to have him act as people normally act in novels And The StreetLawyer isnt a novel exactly Its a homily            It is hardto understand how Grisham pulls this off His books arent being soldexclusively to residents of Manhattans Upper West Side He is preaching to thekinds of middle Americans that liberal activists long ago gave up for dead Buthe manages to present politically unpalatable ideas with grace andunderstatement The Street Lawyer avoids the kind of selfrighteousnessthat usually accompanies homeless activism Grisham is content with the simpleand compelling observation that as a society we fail to treat the homeless withthe dignity they deserve            At one point early in the book an entirefamily of five whom Brock had befriended dies on a bitter winter night afterbeing turfed out of their apartment He visits their bodies in the morguepulling back the sheet I closed my eyes Brock says and said a shortprayer one of mercy and forgiveness Dont let it happen again the Lord saidto me That momentthat prayersounds like a clich But a clich issomething said over and over again And these are things that in this day andage are rarely said at all
