                                  War of Wills            Amid the saturationcoverage of NATOs bombing of Yugoslavia the Serbian point of view is nowhereto be seen This weekend while American military and foreign policy officialsmade the rounds of the Sunday talk shows the only air time a Serbian spokesmancould get was a brief interview on CNN It looks as though the media arehelping NATO win the war for American hearts and minds But the real PR warisnt about which side is right Its about which side is choosing the courseof the conflict and which side is imposing the consequences And in that warthe American media are helping the Serbs            Virtually the firstquestion posed on every talk show Sunday was the same One of the unfortunateconsequences of our bombing seems to have been to unleash a bloodbath wherethe Serbs military paramilitary are storming into Kosovo and driving peopleaway Tim Russert declared on Meet the Press  Some are suggesting thatthe first phase of the air campaign has only intensified the alleged ethniccleansing the atrocities being committed in Kosovo Wolf Blitzer added onLate Edition  On Face the Nation  Bob Schieffer suggested thatNATOs bombing has simply backfired            American officials disputed these suggestions but theunderlying damage was done The ethnic cleansing in Kosovo was framed as aconsequence of the bombing This is the opposite of how the United Statesenvisioned the story Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was the actor andNATO was imposing the consequences Its an upsidedown argument to think thatNATO or we have made this get worse sputtered US Secretary of StateMadeleine Albright when confronted on Face the Nation with the chargethat the bombing had backfired Milosevic is the one that is to blame He isthe one that is making it worse And what we were trying to do is to make surethat he pays the heaviest price for what he is doing            The bombing can makeMilosevic pay a price but it cant necessarily break his will The longer heholds out at home and escalates the genocide in Kosovo the more the Americanmedia pronounce the bombing a failure Allied Action Fails to Stop SerbBrutality says Wednesdays Washington Post front page The New YorkTimes raises the possibility that Milosevics defiance shows the bombingstrategy was fatally flawed and adds that NATO officials here are on thedefensive insisting day after day that it was not their bombing that sparkedthe Serbian attacks or the huge civilian forced exodus from Kosovo            The bombing was supposed to force Milosevic to accept apeace plan that would grant limited autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in KosovoBut Milosevic has shredded the peace plan by fomenting so much hatred betweenSerbs and ethnic Albanians that coexistence is impossible Instead havingdriven the ethnic Albanians from their homes hes offering to let themreturnand even to remove some of his troops from Kosovoif NATO halts itsbombing first By framing NATO as the actor and the Serbs as the enforcers ofconsequences Milosevic gets to define the options and their costs Rather thanplay NATOs gameautonomy or bombinghes creating a new game ethniccleansing or bombing In the new game all NATO gets for backing off is what ithad in the first place            Milosevic is makingsteady progress in turning the game upside down European NATO leaders havestopped demanding that he sign the peace plan and have started demanding merelythat he stop his repression We are going to continue the bombing until wecan guarantee that the killings stop and will not restart NATOSecretaryGeneral Javier Solana declared Tuesday The new offer implicitlyemerging from the Europeans is Stop the cleansing and well stop thebombing            Will Milosevic play NATOs game or vice versa That dependson which sides will breaks first which in turn depends on each sidesassessment of the strength of the others will which in turn depends on howthe media portray their morale While the Times editorializes on PageA that NATO must muster all the air power it can and use it against MrMilosevics murderous troops its frontpage headlineOn  th DaySerb Resilience Gives NATO Leaders Pausegives him a huge lift The mediaalso help Milosevic by playing up cracks within NATO over how far each membercountry is willing to pursue the bombing Knowing the limits of NATOs willbolsters Milosevics confidence and helps him dictate the terms of thegame            President Clinton did hisbest Tuesday to reframe the war in NATOs terms The ethnic cleansing isnt aconsequence of the bombing but was planned long beforehand Clinton argued TheSerbs terms for ending the bombing are unacceptable he added and NATO isunited and determined to stay with our policy If Milosevic continues thecleansing said Clinton he will suffer further costs the devastation of hismilitary and the loss of Yugoslavian sovereignty over Kosovo And byaccelerating the bombing NATO is warning Milosevic that it is willing to matchhim escalation for escalation Eventually the consequences will becomeunbearable to one side or the other Its a head game War always is
