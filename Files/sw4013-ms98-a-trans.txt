        okay so you have eight children um what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together     oh we spend a lot of time out doors jogging bicycling uh going to the park       um  some time watching VCR movies   umhum umhum   um generally cheap things   uhhuh  yeah we know how that goes uh with lots of kids you dont have lots of money for recreation well thats fun so um   thats right   lets see uh some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot and uh you may think this is funny but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek and  we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when its dark in our house     yeah   and that is so fun the kids just get a crack out of that um we like we do like to go to the park too you like your family um we dont do a lot of vacationing have you taken a lot of vacations together or   most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa we get an occasional one or two day thing but most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa   uhhuh and where oh oh now where do they live   in Arizona   oh so thats a bit of a drive for you then oh so you like to go there for the holidays and   yes oh we dont go very often for holidays generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays     umhum   and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us     oh uhhuh uh what are the ages of your kids then   they range from twenty four to five   oh yeah so you have some in the nest and some out huh  we have ours start at twelve and then they go down to four   thats right how old are your children i think the hardest thing for us has been is to find activities you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together   so   i bet yeah   with the age span that we have you know like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing but the young kids dont understand it   umhum yes uhhuh   and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that and   yes and then if you want to play something on the little kids level then the older kids get real bored and and they want to and do something else so yeah i can i can relate to that   yeah   um do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one   i think its improving actually   uhhuh   we had an interesting experience the other day we we have a pretty much a a routine that we spend we dont have our kids play with other kids on Sunday and we just kind of keep them at home     uhhuh umhum   and our next door neighbor uh we were at a soccer game Saturday and our next door neighbor was there somebody came up and asked if if their daughter could spend  Saturday night at their house and she said no Sundays our family day  and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them   umhum umhum thats good   and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now i think its gone to one extreme where the families were just all running every different direction   oh good umhum   and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now   i think so and i feel like you know like President Bush Bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation and it does begin with the families at home     yeah   and so i im a firm believer in that too   i think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing theyve got to start doing something so   um yes thats thats true well we see that a lot out here in Utah and       um so hopefully hopefully its going to spread huh thats a good     Utahs a lot better than Texas   oh um do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas or     yeah   very few   very few you feel like youre in the minority   yeah oh definitely when we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didnt have good sense but uh   oh dear  oh well out here in Utah five is about the the average yeah     average yeah my wife and i were in Utah until i guess we were about twenty four   oh uhhuh   and weve never been back since then but we have kids up there now so we get up occasionally   oh oh oh i have some relatives out there in Texas in fact my moms out there in Texas right now in Dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch and   where where in Dallas   well uh no im trying Aberdeen   hum   it is that close to Dallas oh dont you its i guess guess its out there clear out they have a ranch it has like five hundred acres and   i dont have any idea ive never heard of it must be a little town   yeah
