                                 Janet Reno            Attorney General Janet Reno has always been viewedas the least Clintonian member of the Clinton administration Her boss believeswords are deeds and images are action The selfstyled awkward old maidimmune to the blandishments of Beltway power is supposedly the beefy substanceof this superficial government Yet no Clinton administration figure dependsmore on image than the attorney general and none has relied so much on wordsand symbols as a substitute for action Renos defining moment after all wastaking responsibility for Waco Taking responsibility apparently meant doingnothing except supervising a postmortem investigation that doesnt appear tohave investigated anything            Even so the symbolic Reno represents a new andmostly encouraging model of attorney general a perfect fit for an age of whatlegal scholar Jeffrey Rosen calls criminalized politics Traditionallyatleast during the past halfcenturythere have been two kinds of attorneysgeneral One is the presidential confidant such as Bobby Kennedy JohnMitchell or Edwin Meese who treats the Justice Department as the presidentsprivate law firm The other is the faceless trustworthy administration footsoldier Remember Bill Barr I didnt think so            Reno is neither She arrived in Washington fromMiami as Caesars Wife and so she has remained She was ignorant andindependent of insider DC and has stayed that way Bill Clinton never muchliked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated She was she saidthe peoples lawyer not his It is this outsiderness that has made her sucha good attorney general and such a bad one            This is a time when themere act of taking a highlevel political job subjects any official tosuspicion of criminal wrongdoing During the Clinton administration aprimaryarguably the primaryjob of the attorney general has been tosupervise the investigations of her colleagues and boss Reno has appointedindependent counsels to investigate six of her fellow Cabinet members and herpresident and has overseen innumerable internal Justice investigations ofadministration corruption You can argue about whether this constantsurveillance of pols is a good thing but there is no doubt that these are themost highly publicized cases the DOJ handles            No one is better suited to them than Reno She is smartbut mostly she is trustworthy She pays the list price for her cars to avoidthe appearance of favoritism She avoids the president because she doesnt wantto be tainted by him Her employees speak with awe about her integrity Renosindependence has given her the courage to appoint counsels to probe hercolleagues and her boss and the courage not to appoint counsels evenwhen the wolves were baying for them She refused to authorize an independentinvestigation into campaign fund raising despite Republican outrage becauseshe believed the law did not require it            Since she rejected afundraising independent counsel some Republicans have painted her asClintons tool charging that she was helping him so she could keep her jobNewt Gingrich even likened Reno to Mitchell But the charges havent stuckRenos entire success at Justice rests on her image as an ethical paragon Theindependent counsel may be tainted but thanks to Squeaky Janet the AG and theDOJ are unsullied            To appreciate the hugeness of Renos accomplishmenthearken back to the Reagan Justice Department Meese was under investigationDOJ inquiries into other Reagan officials were suspect The department wasmistrusted a national disgrace Under any Clinton crony imagine WebbHubbell the DOJ would have been similarly compromised After Watergatelegal reformers proposed making the Department of Justice independent ofpresidential control Janet Reno is the next best thing the IndependentAttorney General            Reno is independent notjust by temperament but also because she is unfireable Every day since shetook office she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing toClintonWhitewater fund raising Lewinsky China espionage etc Clintoncant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her            But Reno pays a price for her life tenure and heroutsiderness The president has allbutexcluded her from policymaking Underthe Crony Attorneys General the Justice Department exercised vast influenceover legal policy Meese and Kennedy for example shook up federal lawenforcement But the Clinton White House has husbanded crime policy to itselfunwilling to entrust it to Reno            This has made her anattorney general without measurable accomplishment in law enforcement orprosecution Crime has plummeted but she gets no credit Reno brought anambitious liberal agenda to Justice She favored alternative punishmentslonged to help troubled kids worried about Draconian antiimmigration policyand disliked the death penalty mandatory minimum sentences and thecrackpowder cocaine sentencing disparity But Clinton and the RepublicanCongress ignored her Instead her Justice Department has had to enforce anexpanded federal death penalty throw more people in federal prison for longersentences punish juvenile criminals more harshly support mandatory minimumsand the crackpowder disparity and double the size of the Border Patrol Renoopposed some of these policies internally but had too little influence to stopthem            Which brings us to Waco where the symbolism and substanceof Reno collide most alarmingly Renos deserved reputation for integrity ismerely negative She has not achieved anything magnificent Her integrity hassimply prevented her from corrupting the process She has not conducted anypowerful investigations but she has had the wisdom not to block others fromconducting them            The Waco mess however has exposed the limits ofmere honor Most reports suggest that FBI agents lied to Reno over and overabout what they had done and Reno believed them In this case she not anindependent counsel supervised the operation and the probes and she settledfor cursory answers Its easy to call this gullibility and incompetence andthats exactly what Republicans are doing A chorus on the right includingSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott the Wall Street Journal editorialpage and Larry Klayman is demanding her resignation Its worth notinghowever that the FBI similarly deceived Republican AGs over the Ruby Ridgefiasco Attorneys general have an impossible relationship with the FBI Theynominally supervise the bureau and hence are held responsible for itsmisbehavior but the FBI behaves like an autonomous agency            An attorney general who exerted more control overthe department and the bureau who was a better headknocker and whohad the full support of the White House might have dragged the truth out of theFBI years ago as Reno did not and could not But no such attorney generalcould have survived the Clinton scandals much less survived them with her ownreputationand her departmentsintact
