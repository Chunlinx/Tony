                                  Warren Beatty            Since Arianna Huffington floated the idea of aWarren Beatty presidential campaign last week the actors ambitions have beenthe summers most delectable political story The jokes abound what Warrenwould do on the Oval Office carpet whom President Beatty would hire as hisintern etc The yearold Beatty has stayed virtually silent but hisfriends are encouraging speculation Warren has been consulting withDemocratic and Reform Party activists they say Warren is taking this veryseriously Click for Jacob Weisbergs revelation that Jesse Ventura may becourting Beatty for the Reform Party nomination Wife Annette Bening theyreport is enthusiastic            The right thinks Beatty is a ridiculous preeningglory hound who would preach limousineliberal ideas The left thinks he canilluminate a grand populist vision with pure charisma Both sides mistakenlyassume that because Beatty is an actor he like Ronald Reagan could flatterseduce and inspire voters He charmed the panties off Natalie Wood MadonnaFaye Dunaway Julie Christie Isabelle Adjani Diane Keaton et al Surely hecould charm the pants off a few million disaffected Democrats And even if theonly people who vote for Beatty are women who slept with him he could make astrong showing in the California primary            But Beatty has alwaysbeen in the words of film critic David Thomson a very uneasy actor Beattyis too cool and distant to be great on screen He has made his mark onHollywood more as a producer and director and it is this that explains hispolitical ambition The media snicker at the actorpolitician who presumes tospeak on the days great issues But consider Beatty as a selfmadebusinessman Beatty sympathizers such as Huffington rightly ask why SteveForbes who inherited his millions is a serious candidate while Beatty is ajoke Beatty has shown a ruthless brilliant talent for manipulating thepolitics of his industry In Hollywood where no one gets his way all the timeWarren Beatty has got his way forever            In Easy Riders Raging Bulls  Peter Biskindchronicles how Beatty parlayed the heartthrob status hed won from sSplendor in the Grass into a controlling position as a producer Healmost singlehandedly brought Bonnie and Clyde to the screen in and made his fortune off it by negotiating a contract for  percent of thegross In the s he bullied screenwriters and directors into makingShampoo and Heaven Can Wait his way In  during the heightof the Cold War he persuaded Gulf  Western to pony up  million forReds  a movie sympathetic to communism A few years later he gotColumbia to spend the thenpreposterous figure of  million on Ishtar It flopped but Beatty walked away unscathed Most recently he compelledRupert Murdochs  th Century Fox to put up  million forBulworth and to give him absolute creative control over the film eventhough  it was a political movie and hence a lousy investment and  itpropounded ideas Murdoch detests There are endless stories about how Beattycharmed or threatened or kneecapped this director or that executive into doingwhat he wanted            Beatty brought those sameskills to his second career as an activist Ron Brownstein who chronicledBeattys politicking in The Power and the Glitter  notes that Beatty maybe the only star in Hollywood history who preferred to participate in politicsfrom behind the scenes Beatty doesnt need the ego gratification of publicpolitics He has been famous his entire adult life In  Beatty gavespeeches on George McGoverns behalf but he disliked the highprofile role Hewas an awkward embarrassed speaker He understood why the public is skepticalof a guy who makes  million a year talking about the class struggleBrownstein says            But Beatty excels at the backroom nittygritty In  heaided McGovern most by organizing fundraisers even persuading Paul Simon andArt Garfunkel to reunite for a McGovern benefit If that isnt great politicsnothing is When he advised Gary Hart in  and  Beatty remained in theshadows planning media and campaign strategies Political pros in thatcampaign thought he was a positive force Brownstein says Of the few publicstatements Beatty has made about his potential campaign the most revealing isthis There has to be someone better than me This is not modestyBeattyhas no modesty It is his cool and honest pragmatism He recognizes that hedbe a better operator than candidate            Though hes supposed tobe a liberal icon Beatty lacks the crystallizing vision of a Reagan Hispolitics are a muddle Its not happenstance that he is backed by such an oddassortment of people ranging from Republican populist Huffington to earnestliberal Bill Moyers Beatty is not cynical He desperately believes thepolitical system is broken and needs fixing He just seems unable to explainhow its broken and how it should be fixed            In interviews Beatty repeatedly chokes when asked forspecific political ideas He seems vaguely to believe that there is too muchmoney in politics corporations are too powerful welfare reform was wrong andrace is a big problem He says he wants to conjure up the spirit of Robert FKennedy and  Bulworth  the closest thing to a Beatty politicalplatform is a mess as political sciencean incoherent condescending slopabout the evils of lobbyists and the innate decency of black folk                           Bulworth isfabulous on daytoday campaign tactics This is Beattys curse His politicalprinciples tell him to deplore gamesmanship but gamesmanship may be what heunderstands best Similarly Beatty spends a lot of time savaging Washingtoncorruption yet he cultivates friendships with folks such as Henry KissingerLarry King and John McLaughlin Washington incarnate            Beatty is meticulous even anal As an actor he is famousfor demanding take after take till hes sure its right Click to see how hisgeneral caution contrasts with his brazen womanizing Movie stars can controltheir images Beatty can forbid interviews decline to answer questions andrefuse to appear in public He didnt speak to reporters from the late still the early s            But politicians must answer questions take abuseand keep smiling The first thing candidate Beatty would have to learn saysHuffington is to get comfortable with ridicule Its not clear that Beattyis willing to do that Hes too cautious After all he twice declinedopportunities to run for office in the s when he was a much more crediblecandidate than he is now According to Brownstein Beatty led the polls in the race to succeed Reagan as California governor but refused to run And in Beatty resisted pleas to make a late primary challenge to JimmyCarter            Beattys flirtation with the presidential campaignmay be a canny political tactic He doesnt really want to run but perhaps hecan use the threat of a candidacy to make himself a behindthescenes playerthe guy who delivers the left to Al Gore or Bill Bradley In the early sBeatty turned down the opportunity to play John F Kennedy in a movie thenbecame a producer This year Beatty may turn down the opportunity to playRobert F Kennedy in a campaign then become a power broker
