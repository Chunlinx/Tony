        so i guess most of what happens happens in Salt Lake which is just about twenty miles south of us and thats quite a bit bigger and     umhum   they were just talking about how they had all these drive by shootings and stuff and it sounded like it was getting to be like LA a little bit but   umhum do you have gang problems   yeah its there they they say its getting a lot bigger uh   well im a school principal   oh are you so youre right familiar with all that i bet   umhum elementary school well its elementary school   oh its a what   elementary but i have gang problems   oh yeah oh at that young huh youre kidding at which   umhum im in a part of Dallas where theres a lot of gang activity and my i have through the sixth grade   uhhuh uhhuh   but some of my sixth graders will be thirteen fourteen years old   yeah so theyre getting started   and they get recruited   oh youre kidding   so uh we we have really very significant problems   ill bet my wife was just uh talking to her mother and uh i guess they said they had an F B I come guy come to there she she works in a middle school and they were talking about how the hats signify you know gang and stuff like that and   umhum yeah   and uh that you know it some day itll eventually past but right now they say theres all kinds of kids getting beat up because of the they wear the wrong hat on the wrong street and thats get its getting pretty darn scary ive got a little eighteen   umhum umhum its its surprising to me that its that true there because  the only time ive ever been to Utah   it umhum   i spent a week on the Brigham Young campus at a workshop   uhhuh uhhuh   and it was very uh dramatically different that the people you saw than what we see here because you had no minorities you know and   yeah yeah thats true yeah i think weve probably got it to a lesser extent i wouldnt say were anywhere close to some of those other places probably like what you have but   umhum umhum   it you know they say i guess a lot of the people that they the the gang related things they put them in jail and then they when they get out they just say get lost just dont hang around L A or dont hang around wherever and so they just move on to new territory and where ever they can find easy pickings but   hum   you can see it getting a little bit worse and worse it its pretty sad like you say you see all these kids thirteen fourteen year olds and you know itll be a school night and theyre out at ten eleven oclock just roaming the streets and   umhum umhum   i just never remember that when you know its been a while since i was in junior high or high school or even elementary school but   umhum   you just i just you were never out past eight or nine oclock on a school night you know if you were even up out of bed you were lucky it seemed like and   but of course you you have a lot of parents that are not really parenting much   yeah thats true and you know and i think when it come   you have that in Utah   pardon   you have that in Utah   yeah its getting worse i you know like i say i   because i would think that big Mormon influence there would uh   yeah with with that with that Mormon influence it may not be as bad but we still get a lot of the two uh the two parent income or the two income families and and i really think thats a lot of the problem its just you dont get all the the values taught in the home that you used to get   umhum   and and the kids are left to to to do their own thing and find their own you know entertainment and stuff and i I really think thats what youre missing we miss a lot of the those good values that were taught years ago to   well i i work in an an area of town like my school   uhhuh   is about seventy five percent Anglo and thats very unusual in the in the Dallas Public Schools   uhhuh yo yeah i would think so yeah   but its very its like the lowest socioeconomic Anglos   oh really   yeah its its what in the South we call poor white trash   uhhuh   and then the other uh significant percentage i have is Hispanic   uhhuh   and course thats growing   yeah   but the kids that i have the biggest discipline problems with are Anglo children   oh really   and i ive got lots of Anglo children who are just not really wanted by anybody   huh not by their families or anything   well and for example i have a boy now he checked out today   uhhuh   hes fourteen hes in the sixth grade he lived with his mother in Mississippi he had been to he thought ten or twelve schools in Mississippi   uhhuh sheesh   then his mother now his mother and father arent divorced but they dont live together in a long time his mother had a new boyfriend who moved in who owed so much back child support for his children   umhum uhhuh uhhuh   that they couldnt afford to keep her children anymore so they sent them here   yeah      and here he was with his father and his fathers pregnant girlfriend   oh jeez   and they pawned all his personal belongings like he had a Nintendo and a VCR and some stuff they pawned that     uhhuh   and hes just been tearing my school up and he told me hes gonna be bad enough to be sent back to Mississippi   jeez   and today they checked him out to send him back to Mississippi   huh youre kidding you know and that and its so sad because you i mean sure its the kids doing it but you know who really is has the blame for that yeah   now those kids yeah but yeah but those kids are ready fodder for gangs   oh yeah the people show them some interest show them some love and   sure they belong gives them something to belong to gives them identity gives them importance   yeah umhum   gives them a certain security   umhum   and um
