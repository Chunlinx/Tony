                    Background        Most mammals in the temperate zones undergo seasonal        changes in physiological state     There are two        mechanisms mammals can use to regulate responses to        seasonal change The first is direct responsiveness to an        environmental cue or cues for time of year most commonly        seasonal changes in photoperiod The second is an        endogenous circannual rhythm entrained by an environmental        cues Endogenous circannual rhythms may serve to protect        the timing of seasonal functions from noise in        environmental cues     and may improve seasonal timing        by buffering variation in the detection or measurement of        even the most reliable environmental cues including        photoperiod        Laboratory rats have been considered the classical model        of an opportunist nonseasonal breeder responding almost        entirely to immediate conditions to regulate reproduction        and physiology However recent work shows that laboratory        rat strains vary in their responsiveness to photoperiod               Laboratory rats of some strains can be        manipulated to unmask responses to photoperiod or        melatonin even though short photoperiod alone does not        affect reproduction       Peripubertal rats in the        inbred Fischer  F and Brown Norway BN strains are        naturally sensitive to reproductive inhibition by short        photoperiod alone       In several species of        rodents peripubertal young have stronger reproductive        responses to photoperiod than adults        and        this appears to be true for inducedphotoresponsive        laboratory rats as well            It is unknown if responsiveness to short photoperiod        persists into adulthood in strains of laboratory rats that        are naturally sensitive to short photoperiod and if so        whether these strains also have any endogenous rhythm of        responses to short photoperiod In this study adult F        rats were first tested for responses to short photoperiod        If F rats are photoresponsive we predicted that adult        rats treated with a short photoperiod would exhibit a        decrease in testis size body weight and food intake In        addition adult F rats were tested for evidence of an        endogenous rhythm of photoperiodic responses by assessing        whether mature rats that had become insensitive to short        winter photoperiods would regain sensitivity in constant        short photoperiod If they have such an endogenous rhythm        we predicted that F rats treated from weaning with a        constant short photoperiod or an intermediate photoperiod        LD INT would exhibit an initial decrease in testis        size body weight or food intake followed by a refractory        period with no differences relative to a control group in        long photoperiod and then a second period of sensitivity        to shorter photoperiods again relative to a control group        in long photoperiod Here we report that adult F rats        retain both reproductive and nonreproductive responses to        short photoperiod and that there is weak evidence for an        endogenous circannual rhythm of reproductive responses to        short photoperiod in F rats but not such a rhythm for        nonreproductive responses to short photoperiod                    Results                  Experiment one          Repeated measures ANOVA on estimated testis volume          over weeks  of short photoperiod treatment LD          SD revealed a significant interaction between          measurement week and photoperiod P   F            indicating that SD treatment produced differences between          the groups over time Fig a Ttests for individual          weeks indicated a significant difference after  weeks          and this result persisted through the time of the last          measurement after week  Fig a SD treatment          resulted in a maximum difference in testis size of          approximately  after  weeks of treatment Fig          b          Repeated measures ANOVA on body weight over weeks           of treatment revealed significantly lower body weights in          SD P   F   Fig a There was a          significant interaction between measurement week and          photoperiod treatment P   F            indicating that SD treatment produced differences between          the groups over time Body weight responded very rapidly          to SD as onetail ttests for individual weeks revealed          a significant difference in body weight from week           through the time of the last measurement at week  Fig          a Differences in body weight were created by slight          reductions of body weight of rats in SD while rats in LD          gained body weight steadily throughout the  weeks Fig          a          Repeated measures ANOVA on food intake over weeks           of treatment revealed significantly reduced food intake          levels in SD P   F   Fig b There          was a significant interaction between measurement week          and photoperiod treatment P   F            indicating that SD treatment produced differences between          the groups over time Differences in food intake between          SD and LD groups were first significant during the week           measurement period Fig b and the lower level of          food intake in SD persisted through the time of the last          measurements on food intake during weeks  Fig          b                          Experiment two                      Testis volume            Rats put into SD photoperiod treatment from the time            of weaning exhibited an initial period of            photoresponsiveness during the first third of the            experiment measurements in weeks  There was a            significant inhibition of testicular growth from

weeks    P              F   Fig b d In the final third of the            experiment the SD treatment group had significantly            smaller testis size than the LD group in the test on

Analysis of            the untransformed data identified a significant overall            decrease in testis size of all of these rats over the            final third of the experiment P   F

     Rats put into an intermediate photoperiod treatment            from the time of weaning exhibited an initial period of            photoresponsiveness during the first third of the

experiment P   F   Fig            b d Analysis of the untransformed data for the            final third of the experiment identified a significant            decrease in testis size of all of these

week  Fig             Truly freerunning rhythms generated by an            endogenous timer should cause individuals to lose            synchrony with each other over time     Thus if            changes in testis volume in the later weeks of            Experiment  were due to an endogenous timer then we            would predict less synchrony among rats undergoing a            second period of testicular inhibition in Experiment             relative to the adult rats in Experiment  subjected to            a sudden synchronous change to SD photoperiod To test            this prediction the degree to which testicular            regression was synchronized among adult rats exposed to            a sudden change to short photoperiod in Experiment             was compared to the synchrony of testicular regression            in rats in SD in the second half of Experiment  Fig             An Ftest for equality of variances was used to            compare the variability in timing of minimum testis            size for the two groups The variance for the mean date            of minimum SD testis volume was significantly greater            in the second photoresponsive period of Experiment             than in Experiment  variance ratio   F              P                                  Body weight            Rats in SD photoperiod treatment from the time of

were assessed at two time points in the first third            middle third and final third of the experiment There            were no significant differences in LH levels in SD vs            LD during any of the weeks assessed P   for            all comparisons Fig                                       Discussion        Previous work demonstrated that young F rats have a        period of photoresponsiveness that delays reproductive        maturation reduces food intake and slows somatic growth             and that these responses are pineal and melatonin        dependent      This study demonstrates that F rats        are also photoresponsive as adults Figs   with        SD inducing lower testis size food intake and body weight        than LD        Decreases in body weight occurred prior to significant        decreases in food intake suggesting that decreases in body        weight might cause the decreases in food intake In species        of hamsters that show photoperiodic regulation of body        weight there is evidence that decreases in body weight in        SD can be independent of changes in food intake    or        caused at least in part by decreases in food intake            Effects of SD on body weight began almost immediately and        persisted for approximately  weeks However between week         and  body weight of SD rats was increasing with the        same slope as that of LD rats Fig a suggesting that        rats had become refractory to the effects of SD around week         of treatment Testicular responses to SD may have        followed a similar period of  weeks of sensitivity        followed by refractoriness Fig b The rapid decrease in        body weight of rats in SD followed  weeks later by a        return to weight increases might make this system useful        in studies on the control of body weight in mammals        The magnitudes of differences in food intake and body        weight in adults were approximately  Fig         similar to those in peripubertal young rats in SD eg        Fig  indicating that adults and peripubertal young rats        have similar nonreproductive responses to SD In contrast        SD had a greater effect on testis size in peripubertal        males  smaller testis volume in SD than LD Fig  than        in adult males  smaller testis volume in SD than LD        Fig  The large difference between the SD and LD groups        in peripubertal males was caused by the rapid rate at which        testes of the LD group were growing compared to a slow rate        of growth in the SD group In adults in contrast        treatment effects were due to testicular regression in SD        The proportionately larger effects of SD on peripubertal        males are consistent with the hypothesis that young animals        are more sensitive to seasonal reproductive inhibition than        adults        The reductions in testis size of        adult rats in SD were slight and might by itself have        negligible effects on fertility in adult rats However it        is possible that the combination of SD with mild food        restriction eg     or other treatments might        interact to cause much more significant responses        It is possible that hormonal and behavioral effects of        SD might suppress fertility of adult F rats even though        testis size remained relatively large In Siberian        hamsters SD can regulate LH secretion and behavioral        responses to a female independently of changes in FSH or        gross changes in testis size     However the fact        that no differences in LH secretion were observed in        response to SD Fig  suggests that this is not the case        in F rats It is also possible that the single point        samples were not sufficient to detect differences in        pulsatile LH secretion between groups as has been        suggested previously for rats induced to become        photoperiodic by androgen treatment     It would be        useful to repeat this comparison of hormone levels using        multiple samples obtained from indwelling atrial cannulas        Repeat sampling using this technique was not feasible        however due to the longterm nature of this study        Previous studies on rats have shown that adults of some        strains can be made reproductively responsive to SD by        manipulations such as androgen treatment             olfactory bulbectomy     but see     or food        restriction     An effect of short photoperiod on body        weight of unmanipulated adult rats has not been reported        previously but has been reported for unmanipulated young        rats of several strains Zucker rats     F rats             Wistar rats     and BN rats     To our        knowledge this study is the first report of reproductive        and nonreproductive responses to short photoperiod in        adult unmanipulated rats        The single large and highly significant change observed        after the early stages of experiment  was a general        decrease of approximately  in testis size of all three        groups that occurred in the last third of the study Fig         The fact that the change occurred in LD controls as        well as experimental groups implicates either a systematic        change in measurement methodology of soft testes or a        change in some uncontrolled variable Possibilities for the        latter include age effects a change in the tap water or        food and various forms of stress This finding highlights        the importance of the LD group as an essential control in        this study Without the LD group as a control this kind of        change attributable to an uncontrolled variable would have        been impossible to distinguish from the effect of an        endogenous timer controlling the response to photoperiod        The change across all groups is similar to many previous        reports on annual or seasonal changes of various        physiological measures in laboratory rats eg               These previous studies provide evidence for        temporal differences among rats held in apparently        identical conditions but these previous studies generally        lack the controls necessary to distinguish between        endogenous timers seasonal cues and effects of        uncontrolled variables        In constant SD in experiment  estimated testis volume        was slightly reduced relative to LD controls in the final        third of the study Fig  but there was no effect of SD        on food intake or body weight The changes in testis size        were desynchronized relative to those occurring in        experiment  Fig  consistent with the prediction that        a sudden photoperiod change would result in greater        synchrony than would changes due to an endogenous timer A        previous study on Siberian hamsters    reported a        similar dissociation between endogenous timing of        reproductive and nonreproductive responses to constant        short photoperiod similar to the results in experiment         Siberian hamsters in constant short days but not long        days underwent two cycles of a seasonal rhythm in testis        size but reproductive changes in the second cycle were not        accompanied by a typical winter molt and there was        inconclusive evidence for a body weight rhythm            However the results of experiment  were not consistent        between SD and INT treatments During the final third of        the experiment there was no effect of INT on testis size        or body weight though food intake was slightly reduced        relative to LD controls Fig  Pairwise comparisons of        SD or INT with LD identified significant differences in        only a few weeks of the last third of experiment  Figs            Bonferroni adjustments to probability        values on these multiple pairwise comparisons would have        resulted in pvalues that were nonsignificant for most        comparisons during the final third of the experiment        Overall these results can be interpreted as only weak        evidence for endogenous timers regulating a type II        rhythm    of sensitivity to photoperiod in F rats        If endogenous timers that affect responses to constant        photoperiod are present they appear relatively unimportant        in adult F rats                    Conclusions        This study provides strong evidence that transfer from        longer to shorter photoperiod can have significant effects        on body weight food intake and the reproductive system        even in adult rats However the results provided only weak        evidence for an endogenous circannual rhythm in the        reproductive system The effects of transfer of adults to        SD on food intake and body weight were particularly        dramatic as they prevented the steady increase in body        mass that is typical of ad lib fed rats in this age group        The mechanisms of this voluntary reduction in food intake        and change in regulation of body mass may be relevant to        the control of eating and weight gain in other mammals        These results have implications for studies on F and        other photoperiodic strains of rats particularly because        the F rat is widely studied throughout the world and        has been the most commonly used inbred rat strain in the        United States     The existence of both reproductive        and nonreproductive responses of adult F rats to short        photoperiod and the possibility for weak endogenous        circannual responses to short photoperiods could complicate        the design and interpretation of experimental results        especially in the case of longterm studies        Recent reports have documented variability in        photoresponsiveness in peripubertal males among laboratory        rat strains      The fact that photoresponsiveness        extends to adulthood in F rats suggests that genetic        variation in the presence and strength of adult        photoresponsiveness is present among rat strains If so        then these responses represent another genetically variable        trait in the suite of neuroendocrine inputs and regulatory        systems that regulates seasonality There is increasing        evidence for genetically based variation in seasonal        strategies among natural populations of small mammals        reviewed by      and in laboratory strains of        rodents       Identifying and understanding the        neuroendocrine basis for this variability in rats and other        species will be important for understanding the        evolutionary physiology of reproductive strategies and for        understanding genetic variation in brain function                    Materials and Methods                  Experiment one          Twentyone male F rats were gestated and then          raised in long day LD LD lights on at  to          age    weeks mean  SE in our breeding colony          Rats were then placed in either a short day SD          LDlights on at  n   or LD treatment n            The light intensity ranged from  lux          Treatments were balanced according to age body weight          and testis volume Rats were individually housed in          polypropylene cages      cm and kept at a          temperature of   C Rats were provided with ad lib          access to food RatMouseHamster  Southern States          Cooperative and tap water Testis volume body weight          and food intake were measured after                and  weeks of treatment Food intake was calculated by          providing measured amounts of food in the food hopper          every two weeks and measuring the difference between          original food weight and the weight of food remaining In          the rare cases in which unconsumed food was present          within the cage the weight of unconsumed food was          included in the food weight Body weight and food intake          were measured to the nearest  g Testis volume          measurements body weight measurements and collection of          approximately  L of blood were performed under light          anesthesia with isoflurane Testis measurements were          taken externally on the left testis using dial calipers          by MBS blind with respect to treatment In order to          check for consistency of measurements  of the          measurements were repeated by PDH blind both to          treatment and to measurements by MBS to determine          measurement precision Testis volume was estimated using          the formula for a prolate spheroid Width  Length            In previous studies in our lab external testis          measurements have been found to be highly correlated to          measurements and weights later taken from the excised          testis     Blood was collected in heparinized tubes          from a small tail nick refrigerated at C after          collection centrifuged within  hours and plasma frozen          at C until hormone assay was performed                          Experiment two          Fifty F males aged  days were gestated and raised          in LD photoperiod in our breeding colony Rats were          weaned at  days and placed into LD n   SD n            or intermediate photoperiod INT LD lights          on at  n   Sibling groups were divided among          the three treatments and body weight was balanced across          treatments Rats in each group were housed in individual          cages and maintained in fanventilated          photoperiodcontrolled chambers In each group  rats          were held in a single large photoperiod chamber and the          remaining  or  individuals in each treatment were held          in a second smaller chamber set to the same photoperiod          The LD group was designed explicitly as a control for any          changes in husbandry allowing us to test for changes in          the two shorter photoperiod groups relative to the LD          group A number of studies have reported explicitly on          seasonal changes in animal colonies including rat          colonies eg       that could be caused by          uncontrolled seasonal variation in husbandry These          potential differences have included such things as          seasonal changes in freshness of food and changes in          water bedding humidity noise or odors The LD and SD          chambers were in the same animal room were identical in          construction and received air from intakes that were          less than  cm apart The INT treatment group was in a          similar chamber in a nearby room Feeding and watering          were identical for all groups Thus seasonal differences          in husbandry should be controlled by comparing the SD and          INT groups to the LD group Testis length and width          measurements body weight measurements food intake          measurements and blood collection were performed at          week  day intervals for the first  weeks of          treatment Food intake continued to be measured at week          intervals except for one week interval late in the          study Some rats were inadvertently given an unmeasured          amount of food during the   week measurement period          food intake data in that period for those rats were          discarded After the first  weeks testis volume          measurements body weight measurements and blood          collection were taken at approximate week intervals          and then returned to week intervals for the last          portion of the study More specifically these data were          taken at weeks                    and  Data collection was carried out as described in          Experiment                           LH assay          The plasma concentration of LH was determined by          sandwich immunoassay with the ORIGEN          Electrochemiluminescence ECL Immunoassay System The          protocol followed was developed by DR Deaver          httpdascaspsueduheclhtm A monoclonal mouse          antibovine LH antibody generously provided by Dr Jan          Roser at UCDavis was conjugated to ORGIN TAGNHS ester          A monoclonal rabbit antibovine LH was used as the          capture antibody generously provided by Dr JJ Reeves          at Washington State University Sheep antirabbit IgG          Dynabeads M Dynal Oslo Norway were used to link          the LH capture antibody to magnetic beads for          measurement Rat LH for a standard curve was provided by          A F Parlow and the National Hormone Pituitary Program          A linear regression model was matched to the standard          curve and used to convert photon counts into LH          concentrations in pgml All samples were run in          duplicate and the mean value of each duplicate pair was          used as a single data point in all statistical          comparisons All samples from a given blood collection          period were assayed the same day and control tubes that          were run every  tubes revealed no intraassay drift          The sensitivity of the LH assay was  pgml for the          l sample volumes The mean of the intraassay          coefficients of variation for tubes containing pooled          juvenile rat serum containing LH at a low physiological          concentration was  and the interassay coefficient          of variation was also           Only plasma samples for weeks      and           of Experiment  were assayed These weeks represented          times at which minimum and maximum SD LH levels should          have occurred based on examination of testis volume          levels at these weeks if an endogenous circannual LH          rhythm existed It was predicted that the minimum level          of LH secretion would occur slightly earlier than the          lowest measured level of testis volume due to the delayed          effects of hormonal changes producing measurable          differences in testis size                          Statistical data analysis                      Experiment one            Data on estimated testis volume were converted to            point running means before analysis Measurements of            soft testes through the scrotum are particularly            subject to measurement error especially small changes            in measurement style over periods of weeks This class            of error has little effect on differences between            groups within a single measurement period but can            cause apparent changes between measurement periods In            previous work on rats we have found that small            differences in measurement style between weeks can            cause estimates of testis volume to fluctuate by            approximately  from week to week     and that            use of running threepoint point means reduces this            source of measurement error eg     For testis            volume statistical analyses were also carried out on            data tranformed by dividing individual data points in            each measurement period by a constant the mean for the            LD group in that measurement period            Repeated measures ANOVA along with Fishers            protected LSD posthoc comparisons were used to test            for changes in testis volume body weight and food            intake using SuperAnova v  Abacus Concepts            Berkeley CA Weekly comparisons of SD and LD testis            volume body weight and food intake were performed for            each measurement period using onetailed ttests with            the expectation of SD  LD Statview v  Abacus            Concepts Berkeley CA Onetailed ttests were            selected because only suppression of reproduction            reductions in body weight and reductions in food            intake have been observed in response to SD in prior            experiments on F rats        For all            tests P   were considered significant            Testis size was not adjusted for body weight First            there was no correlation between body mass and testis            mass in adult rats at the beginning of the study R              F   P   n   rats In addition a            previous study found that testis weight is not            dependent upon body weight in F rats                Therefore adjustment of testis size for body weight            using ANCOVA models is not appropriate                                Experiment two            For all variables statistical analyses were carried            out in two ways Analyses were carried out on both the            raw data and on data tranformed by dividing individual            data points in each measurement period by a constant            the mean for the LD group in that measurement period            The latter approach allowed use of the LD group to            control for temporal changes over the year that were            independent of responses to photoperiod In contrast            the former approach provided information on differences            that might be due to uncontrolled variables over the            yearlong experiment As in Experiment  point            running means of estimated testis volume were used to            reduce the effects of measurement error for testis            size As in Experiment  testis size was not adjusted            for body weight using ANCOVA models            Repeated measures ANOVA comparing LD with SD and LD            with INT were carried out on the first third middle            third and last third of the  weeks These intervals            were chosen because the initial effects of SD on young            rats persist for approximately  weeks                 and because species that have a typeII annual rhythm            generally are photorefractory for a period of at least             weeks corresponding to the middle third of our            experiment and then have a second period of            photoresponsiveness beginning at some time in the final            third of a first year in photoperiod treatment eg            see     Additional analyses carried out on            different time intervals produced similar results to            those reported in the Results Finally pairwise            comparisons of LD with SD and LD with INT were also            carried out for each week of measurement using            onetailed ttests Bonferroni adjustment of            probability values for multiple comparisons in these            pairwise ttests was not conducted However the            likelihood of significant differences occurring by            chance in this series of multiple comparisons is            considered in the Results and Discussion                                      Authors contributions        The authors contributed equally to the original ideas
