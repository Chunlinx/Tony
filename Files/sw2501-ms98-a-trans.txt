        okay were energized um painting interesting uh the guy called me when she called me the computer called me i thought that they were reading my mind im in the middle of um going out for bids to have my house painted   okay oh   uh painting is not hard to do uh as long as its not in not to the point of where its uh needs to be scraped and bleeding and peeling   no right   and our house is not but its starting to bleed through and burn through because the paints real cheap and its just a hassle to go do it so im looking for the easy way out and uh   yeah i know did is it easy to find painters uh painters to do this for you   its easier to find painters but you have to be you have to be aware of what of how messy they can get and are they gonna put on a good a good two coats and are they gonna caulk exterior   right are you talking about outside or inside exterior yeah   yeah uh interiors not so bad its because its more fun its more convenient but you get outside where you have high peaks and those kind of things it can be a real issue   well yeah well when weve painted um right now our house doesnt have to have the same kind of exterior painting there  its more trim because it has  some of the old asbestos shingles   umhum   on the back and theres some sort of stone or something in the front so there isnt as much wood that has to be painted um but it it the problem is that it hits the sun hits it so preparing it is a real problem youve got to prepare it well or else itll flake   umhum umhum  here the   um   some of the home builders are they they dont put brick on the side of your houses to save money so they put up a lot uh little quarter inch Masonite basically and theyre painted kind of like a spun of some sort and so its real cheap and uh uh ive had thirteen hundred dollar bid and ive as low as five hundred and forty dollars so its just a matter of its   wow thats quite a range   oh yeah one guy brags about his his piece of equipment hes using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap and im not so much worried about that as what   yeah   i dont want it all over the brick and windows and and the   yeah which might be a bigger problem than it would be uh yeah absolutely   oh sure so yall you havent had any any jobs painted in your house or recently then   no we have uh done a little painting ourselves um we painted a bedroom uh well within the last couple of months um and we have we have some more that need to be done but the   just fun umhum   the problem that we weve owned this house almost five years now and  um when we bought it the um it had been vacant for a while because the family had retired to Arizona but the daughter was a real estate agent and she was selling it and itd been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house  so she told us that the house had been uh professionally painted recently and it looked pretty good you know the interior walls all basically white but they obviously had been done without to much uh wear afterward  the only problem was when we started having the movers move the uh furniture in we identified the various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood uh the door frames when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it   umhum uh thats not very   big long strips so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly and some of that still has to be redone   oh man just painted over varnished wood oh my   yeah well no actually it had been uh it would had been a repaint job   hm   but they had not um either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top or they hadnt really roughed it up or whatever they would because it was woodwork so it looked as if it had been painted   umhum   correctly with you know uh an enamel or something but um it had not either that or it had had not been prepared underneath and it was greasy or something   sure   it comes off in strips i mean not even little bit so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time we know what a job its gonna be because you almost have to strip the whole thing in order do it again   oh no hm i wish you good luck   okay  thank you bye   thank you very much byebye
