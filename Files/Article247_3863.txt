                                 The Electronic Corpus                        Dear Dennis            Sorry for having to cut things short yesterday            The Future of the Book question is one thats been sothoroughly discussed from Plato all the way to Gass article unless theresone even more recent that I hardly think I could add anything But I dontthink that books are going away in the near future Even if we had some sort ofelectronic book that was convenient and had a good screen physical books indeadtree editions are still superior on so many grounds that theyll bearound for a while Some technologies such as printondemand will have areal affect on the publishing world but thats a different subject And I saythis as someone also perfectly comfortable with computers Id have a hard timegetting any kind of serious writing done on paper though I do love fountainpens and think theyre not at all inconvenient and I can comfortably reviseand edit onscreen            In the world of language studies however I thinkcomputers have already had a tremendous impact and this impact will grow Thetools available for language analysis are so helpful that its hard to imaginegoing back to a time when we didnt have them The largescale electroniccorpus is indispensable for any sort of dictionary work today Briefly a goodcorpus will gather millions of words from a wide and carefully selected rangeof sources so that you can study it for any sort of patterns you want Ifyoure concerned with the words alone you can look up individual words to seehow theyre used A rough idea of how this works can be had by entering amoderately uncommon word such as nugatory into an Internet search engine andseeing what you get But you can also learn about grammatical patterns thatyoud never be able to judge otherwisethe ratio of different from todifferent than in texts for example            Largescale fulltext databases are another tool thathas proved supremely effective Fred Shapiro is perhaps the most skilledresearcher in this area and hes been able to find incredibly early examplesof words and phrases politically correct from the  th century or hopefully in its disputed senseit is to behopedfrom numerous very formal sources in the s through the sshowing that the usage didnt simply pop up ex nihilo in the s As more andmore databases become available were likely to see ever more importantdiscoveries that force us to rethink what we believed about the history anddevelopment of our language            You probably know more than I do about the use ofcomputers for attribution studies Donald Foster is the bestknown scholarhere thanks to his successful exposure of Joe Klein as the author ofPrimary Colors and his advocacy of the awfulFuneral Elegy as a part of Shakespeares canon But whatever one thinks ofthis particular poem he and others have showed us new ways of thinking aboutold problems and Im sure that well get many new insights from the tools ofthis trade            What sort of effect do you find computers have had onyour students Has there been any sort of change in their writing or readingskills that you can attribute to them Do you make use of computers as ateaching tool in any wayhaving students do research on the Web perhapsYouve been at it a long time so youre in a good position to judge whethertheyre helping or hurting in the trenches            BestJesse
