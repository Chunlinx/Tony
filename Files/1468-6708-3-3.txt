                    The problem        Three published      and one recently presented           randomized placebocontrolled clinical trial have        unequivocally demonstrated that Hydroxymethylgluatryl        coenzyme A HMG CoA reductase inhibitors statins reduce        the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary        disease These trials found that when compared with        placebo statins significantly reduced the incidence of        death myocardial infarction unstable angina percutaneous        and surgical coronary revascularization and stroke in        persons with         stable coronary disease Because        patients who had experienced an acute coronary syndrome        within three to six months of enrollment were excluded        these trials did not assess the effect of lipidlowering        therapy on adverse cardiovascular events in those with        recently         unstable coronary disease Whether        lipidlowering therapy would provide incremental benefit if        initiated immediately following an acute coronary syndrome        is an important issue as the risk of a recurrent adverse        cardiac events is much greater in patients with unstable        coronary disease than in the stable setting The Myocardial        Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering        MIRACL trial set out to answer this question                    The answer        MIRACL enrolled  patients within  hours mean         hours of admission for unstable angina or a nonQwave        myocardial infarction and randomized them to  weeks of        atorvastatin  mg or placebo once daily     The major        exclusion criteria were total cholesterol level greater        than  mgdL Qwave myocardial infarction on admission        or during the previous month and coronary        revascularization in the months before admission during        the index hospitalization or anticipated following hospital        discharge The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of        death nonfatal myocardial infarction resuscitated sudden        cardiac death or emergent rehospitalization for worsening        symptomatic myocardial ischemia Secondary endpoints        included stroke worsening heart failure need for coronary        revascularization and change in lipid levels throughout the        study On average patients were  years of age        approximately  were men  Caucasian and the mean        baseline low density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol level        was  mgdL Atorvastatin treatment was associated with a         absolute reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint         vs  RR relative risk RR          confidence interval CI  p   This        reduction was primarily driven by the  absolute        reduction in incidence of emergent rehospitalization for        symptomatic myocardial ischemia  vs  RR          CI  p   The risk of death nonfatal        myocardial infarction and resuscitated sudden cardiac death        were each no different between the two groups While there        were no significant differences in the incidence of        worsening heart failure or need for coronary        revascularization atorvastatin did reduce the incidence of        fatal or nonfatal stroke by   vs  RR          CI  p   Atorvastatin also        significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol and        triglyceride levels but did not significantly change high        density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol by  weeks By         weeks the adjusted mean LDL cholesterol decreased to         mgdL in atorvastatintreated patients but increased to         mgdL among placebotreated patients No serious adverse        events occurred as the result of treatment with        atorvastatin although reversible liver transaminase        elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal        occurred in  of atorvastatintreated versus  of        placebotreated patients p                      The MIRACuLous        The efficacy and safety findings from MIRACL were unique        for a number of reasons Although lipidlowering therapy        was associated with a significantly lower mortality when        initiated early after an acute coronary syndrome in two        large observational studies      MIRACL was the first        randomized trial to suggest that statins confer clinical        benefits in this setting It was also the first trial to        identify a shortterm ie within  weeks clinical        benefit from statin therapy in previous secondary        prevention trials the benefit of statin therapy was not        evident for one to two years And while clinical trial        safety endpoints may be considered less glamorous MIRACLs        most important contribution may have been that highdose        statin therapy was not associated with serious harm        despite its use in the unstable setting Earlier secondary        prevention statin trials had excluded patients with        unstable coronary syndromes largely out of theoretical        concern that statinmediated reductions in vascular smooth        muscle cell proliferation might destabilize healing plaque        That no harm resulted from this aggressive treatment        strategy should allay theoretical fears and by doing so        remove a major obstacle to the inpatient initiation of        lipidlowing therapy after coronary events                    The not so MIRACuLous        Despite these unique and important findings there were        a number of inherent study limitations worth noting First        and foremost the possibility of a null treatment effect        cannot be ignored given the wide confidence intervals and        hence marginally significant p value of  for the        effect of atorvastatin on the primary efficacy endpoint        Furthermore while the number of patients lost to follow up        was small if adverse events had occurred in those treated        with atorvastatin n   but not placebo n   the        overall trial results may have been neutral rather than        positive        The types of events prevented in MIRACL are also worth        noting While rehospitalization for recurrent myocardial        ischemia is an important determinant of quality of life and        health care costs other important endpoints were not        significantly affected eg death myocardial infarction        resuscitated sudden cardiac death worsening heart failure        need for coronary revascularization etc The question of        whether statins can prevent these and other adverse events        when initiated soon after an acute coronary syndrome will        require further study        The short duration of followup is also particularly        troubling While it is impressive that a clinical benefit        was realized after only  weeks of statin therapy the        increased risk of adverse clinical events persists        throughout the year following an acute coronary syndrome        Without longer clinical follow up it is not possible to        assess the intermediateterm effect if any of        atorvastatin on hard endpoints such as death or myocardial        infarction To do so would be critical in light of the lack        of effect on these important endpoints at  weeks        Unfortunately no late clinical follow up is planned        There were also a number of limitations that may have        hampered the studys generalizability First patients who        underwent recent revascularization or in whom it was        planned were excluded Specifically patients who underwent        percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty PTCA or        coronary artery bypass graft CABG surgery within the        previous three or six months respectively were not eligible        for inclusion The investigators reasoned that recurrent        ischemic events in this population were likely to result        from restenosis or bypass graft closure and that statins        would be less likely to affect these processes            Nevertheless a number of trials have established the        benefits of statin therapy         early after coronary        revascularization       Furthermore a number of        recent trials have suggested that higher risk patients with        nonST elevation acute coronary syndromes fair better when        an early invasive strategy is applied      and it        is not uncommon for patients to be treated in this fashion        Second patients with Qwave myocardial infarction were not        eligible for enrollment because it was felt that statins        would not influence the development of important prognostic        determinants such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction        ventricular arrhythmias or mechanical complications            Nevertheless patients who develop electrocardiographic        Qwaves represent a substantial proportion of all patients        with myocardial infarction While their shortterm risk        following hospital discharge is lower relative to those        with a nonQwave myocardial infarction it is still much        greater than in patients with stable coronary disease and        the need for secondary prevention in this population is        equally important Third despite the high risk nature of        enrolled patients ie electrocardiogram ECG changes        andor other objective evidence of ischemia the rate of        platelet glycoprotein IIbIIIa inhibitor utilization was        quite low  Such therapy appears to be cost effective             especially among high risk patients and is        recommended under current American College of        CardiologyAmerican Heart Association guidelines            Fourth it may not be possible to ascertain whether these        findings apply to all patients with recent acute coronary        syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels The small        difference in number of primary endpoint events between        atorvastatin and placebo groups make it difficult to        dissect the relationship between baseline lipid levels and        treatment effect further Consequently it remains        uncertain whether one can extrapolate the MIRACL trial        results to those who undergo coronary revascularization        shortly before or after a coronary event who present with        a Qwave myocardial infarction who are treated with        platelet glycoprotein IIbIIIa inhibitors or who have        relatively low admission LDL cholesterol levels                    Time to change current practice        Although MIRACL and the two aforementioned cohort        studies suggest that lipidlowering agents exert shortterm        clinical benefits when initiated soon after an acute        coronary syndrome this remains an open question Even if        these findings are not confirmed after further study one        could still make a compelling argument that lipidlowering        therapy barring contraindications should be initiated        early and universally in patients who present with an acute        coronary syndrome First the longterm safety and        effectiveness of statins for the secondary prevention of         stable coronary disease is        wellestablished       Second as evidenced by        MIRACL these agents are safe when initiated at the time of        hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome Third the        inhospital initiation of lipidlowering therapy appears to        promote greater longterm utilization of these agents               Finally although lipid levels may be        unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome        excepting total HDL and LDLHDL cholesterol ratios            the overwhelming majority of patients with coronary        disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and        nonpharmacologic lipidlowering interventions to attain        recommended cholesterol targets       newer        guidelines are even more stringent     Furthermore        data from the recently presented Heart Protection Study        suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of        baseline cholesterol level     Thus to withhold        lipidlowering therapy from patients who present with an        acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo        and to date our efforts at cholesterol lowering in the        secondary prevention setting have been dismal                                More MIRACLes ahead        The ascertainment and quantification of any incremental        benefit conferred by statin therapy initiated early after        an acute coronary syndrome will require confirmation There        is currently only one ongoing randomized placebocontrolled        trial of early versus delayed statin therapy in this        setting AZ Aggrastat to Zocor Merck     The        AZ study is evaluating the efficacy of early treatment        with simvastatin in  patients following an episode of        unstable angina or a nonQ wave myocardial infarction In        the first four months patients will be randomized to        simvastatin  mg daily or placebo Thereafter those        patients treated with simvastatin in the first phase will        receive  mg of simvastatin daily and those treated with        placebo  mg of simvastatin daily The primary composite        endpoint is the occurrence of cardiovascular death        nonfatal myocardial infarction or rehospitalization for        an acute coronary syndrome ACS at one year If AZ        demonstrates significant reductions in the incidence of        adverse events during the first four months it would        suggest an incremental clinical benefit from initiating        these agents early after an acute coronary syndrome If        benefits accrue but do so later during follow up it would        be difficult to discriminate between the effects of more        aggressive vs earlier lipid lowering therapy        The Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection        Therapy PROVE IT trial is looking at  patients        within  days of an acute coronary syndrome and        randomizing them to either pravastatin  mg or        atorvastatin  mg daily     Patients will be observed        over at least  years for the occurrence of myocardial        infarction or other cardiovascular events Unlike MIRACL        and the AZ trials this study will not assess the        efficacy of early statin therapy after an acute coronary        syndrome rather it will examine the role of         more vs         less aggressive lipidlowering in        this setting        In  many would consider it unethical to withhold        statins from patients with established coronary disease        This makes it unlikely that additional placebocontrolled        trials will be carried out in this area Future secondary        prevention studies should look at patients with stable         or unstable disease and will need to        address the comparative efficacy of different statins or        newer agents assess the incremental benefit of        combination therapy    and determine whether there is a        serum cholesterol floor below which reductions are        unlikely to provide further clinical benefit
