                                 Chatterbox Goes Soft on Clinton            Watching a CSPAN replay last night of President Clintons press conferenceclick here to watch it click here toread a transcript Chatterbox was struck by the chief executives comfort andease Heres a sample exchange                                             Q Another question about the presidential race Aside from asking GeorgeW Bush to come forward and give specifics on the issues that you mentionedcould you tell us what you find objectionable about his trying to present a newmoderate face for his party just like you did for the Democrats And could youtell us whether youre worried whether he will figure out how the Republicanscan occupy the center of American politics                              A No               Q Do you have any hints               A No no I dont think Ill answer those questions               Laughter                                 I will say I willno look let me say again I wouldnt even agree withthe characterization you gave of my first answer When I ran for president in the first thing I did was tell the American people what I thought wasgoing on in our country and what I would do And if you remember the lateSenator Paul Tsongas and I were actually almost ridiculed at the time becausewe both put out these very detailed plans of what we would do If you go backand get one of those plans now youll see that virtually everything we saidwed do we did do except for the things we tried to do and were defeatedon                                       Clintons relaxed press posture seemed strikingly reminiscent of PresidentJohn F Kennedy whose image has been all over the tube these last few days inthe sad aftermath of his sons death Chatterbox whos had trouble looking atBill Clinton on TV for at least a year found himself  liking thepresident Whats that all about            Chatterbox has a hypothesis President Clinton is easier to like when hispopularity ratings go down            According to the Roper Centers Presidential Job Performance Web site Clinton enjoyed hishighestever job approval percentduring December of last year and Januaryand February of this year This of course was the time of Clintonsimpeachment and Senate trial Clintons bad behavior throughout the Flytrapscandalespecially his smug refusal to confess to perjury during theimpeachment proceedingsmade him easy to despise And yet no doubt largelybecause congressional Republicans were overplaying their hand the public gaveClinton more support than had ever been enjoyed by Richard Nixonpersonal best  percent or even Ronald Reagan personal best percentmass adulation of Ronald Reagan being a largely retrospectivephenomenon Clinton also hit  percent early in  right after Flytrapbroke In that instance the public was probably expressing disapproval of thepress            As the impeachment drama dissipated though and Congress and the pressstarted to lay off Clintons approval rating dropped Since May its beenbetween  and  percent That isnt bad and it certainly isnt Clintonsabsolute lowest approval rating as presidentthat would be  and when Clintons popularity dropped on several occasions to  percentInterestingly this was a period when Chatterbox felt more enthusiasticabout Clintons presidency than he has ever felt since Still in the vastsweep of history a  to  percent approval rating isnt particularlygreatits about where President Kennedys lowest jobapproval ratingsat And Clintons approval rating is higher than the rating for hispolicies an assbackward situation in Chatterboxs view sinceClintontheperson is usually much easier to hate thanClintonthepolicymaker Clintons explanation for this at yesterdays pressconference which seemed a bit of a reach was People think things are goingwell but they want a change in policy  particularly in a dynamic time wherethings are changing you should want continued change            But back to Clintons newfound likability Chatterbox knows what yourethinking Chatterbox is a reporter Reporters always like to take popularpeople down and theyre trained to sympathize with underdogs afflict thecomfortable comfort the afflicted Chatterbox will grant that some of thiscrude psychology may be at work            But part of it was also Clintons performance He just seemed morerelaxed yesterdayless of a snakeoil salesman less apt to be pissedoff byrude questions more willing to hit back but in a goodnatured way and moreconfident about his own achievements Clintons primary messagedont let theRepublicans spend the surplus on tax cutsdidnt seem all that urgent sinceits not clear that even the House Republicans have a majority to dothat But for the first time since Flytrap Chatterbox felt himself thinkingpossibly against his better judgment that maybe Clinton wasnt such a bad guyafter all
