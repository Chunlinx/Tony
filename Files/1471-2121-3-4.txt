                    Background        Cellular morphogenesis is fundamental to all        developmental processes and is essential for cellular        proliferation Morphogenesis depends on the interactions of        steady state and dynamic physical properties that allow a        cell to deform and reform into different shapes such as        neuronal growth cones and columnar epithelia Identifying        the mechanical properties of cells that allow them to        undergo shape changes and elucidating the molecular        mechanisms that cells use to generate the mechanical forces        remains the ultimate challenge of understanding cellular        morphogenesis One dramatic example of a process in which a        cell reshapes itself is during the mechanical separation of        a mother cell into two daughter cells during        cytokinesis        In an animal cell cytokinesis involves the generation        of force in the region of the contractile ring reviewed in            This was first appreciated in the s when        Rappaport demonstrated that the cleavage furrow cortex of        echinoderm eggs produced force that was capable of bending        a glass needle reviewed in     Using calibrated        needles Rappaport directly measured the force that the        contractile ring produced     During the s        nonmuscle myosinII the equivalent of the force producing        molecule of skeletal muscle was shown to localize to the        region of the cleavage furrow cortex suggesting the        molecular basis for contractile force reviewed in             Indeed subsequent genetic studies revealed a nearly        ubiquitous requirement for nonmuscle myosinII during        cytokinesis in organisms ranging from the cellular slime        molds to metazoans reviewed in            One appeal of studying cytokinesis as a model for        cellular morphogenesis is its relatively simple geometry        during normal mitotic cell divisions which produce equal        sized daughter cells This theme can be modified for        specific developmental programs such as the unequal        cleavages of mammalian female meiosis However during        standard mitosis the mother cell may be modeled as a        simple sphere which is deformed in the region of its        equator to mimic the ingression of the furrow The furrow        ingresses until a small intercellular bridge forms The        intercellular bridge is severed or resolved resulting in        separation of the two daughter cells Cell division can        then be thought of as a series of intermediate cell shapes        sphere cylinder and dumbbell that are produced along        this pathway of cleaving the mother cell Yoneda and Dan           suggested a model for cytokinesis based on Hookes Law        In their model the minimal contractile force required for        stabilizing each of these intermediate shapes is        proportional to the global steady state stiffness of the        cell and is dependent on the extent of furrow        ingression        A quantitation of the distribution and flux of each        factor is essential for developing a physical model for a        cellular activity MyosinII recruitment to the cortex and        to the cleavage furrow cortex depends on the thick        filamentstate of this molecular motor        The        ability to form thick filaments is regulated by        phosphorylation of three threonines near the tail of the        long coiledcoil When the protein is fully phosphorylated        it remains largely in the monomeric state whereas removal        of these phosphates allows the protein to assemble into        thick filaments Substitution of the three threonines with        alanines produces the   Ala mutant that behaves like a        constitutively unphosphorylated myosinII It partially        rescues the myosin heavy chain          mhcA  null strain and localizes to        the cleavage furrow cortex A quantitative comparison of        wild type and   Ala myosinII can help to constrain        models about how myosinII is recruited to the cleavage        furrow cortex        In this paper we conduct a detailed ratio imaging study        using green fluorescent protein GFPlabeled wild type and          Ala myosinII and a soluble GFP as a volume marker We        determine the amount of myosinII that is in the cleavage        furrow cortex and monitor the flux of wild type and   Ala        myosinII during cytokinesis We apply the simple        mathematical relationship proposed by Yoneda and Dan           to the geometry of dividing         Dictyostelium discoideum cells By        considering the stiffness of a         D discoideum cell      we        estimate the minimal required force to cleave a cell as a        function of the cells geometry We then consider the        mechanical properties of myosinII that have been measured        using modern biophysical tools       to estimate        how much myosinII would be required to generate a        particular amount of force We find that the amount of        myosinII needed for cytokinesis and the amount of        myosinII that actually accumulates in the furrow region        are in good agreement This analysis provides a useful        framework for relating the biochemical and biophysical        properties of myosinII to the mechanical process of        cytokinesis                    Results                  Ratio imaging Quantitatively measures GFPMyosinII          dynamics          To begin to develop a physical model for cytokinesis          we analyzed the changes in the distribution of wild type          myosinII and   Ala GFPmyosinII during the cell cycle          using ratio imaging This allowed us to quantify the flux          of myosinII during cytokinesis and to examine the role          of heavy chain phosphorylation in this flux Ratio          imaging is preferred to other types of microscopy for          determining local concentrations of a protein of interest          because the whole cell is considered simultaneously and          the signal is normalized to a volume indicator          To perform ratio imaging of GFPmyosinII it was          expressed in a myosinII heavy chain            mhcA  mutant strain where it          completely rescued the mutant It was coexpressed with a          second form of GFP fused to a nuclear localization signal          NLSGFP These two GFP variants GFPVex and GFPBex              have distinct excitation spectra so that          separate images can be obtained for the two fusion          proteins and used to generate ratio images Since NLSGFP          is relatively large  kDa we examined the uniformity          of its distribution by comparing it to a Texas          Redlabeled dextran with a  kDa molecular weight The          fluoresecent dextran was introduced into the cytoplasm of          cells expressing NLSGFP and GFPMyosin II by          electroporation Ratio images of GFPmyosinII were          generated using either the dextran or NLSGFP as marker          of cytoplasmic volume and the results compared The          myosinII concentration in the cell cortex measured using          NLSGFP was    n   all measurements are          mean  SEM of that measured using the fluorescent          dextran This indicates that the penetration of the          cortex by NLSGFP was as complete as that by the dextran          and was therefore not limited by its size Therefore          this NLSGFP is suitable as a cytoplasmic volume marker          with the added benefit of serving as an indicator for          cells entering mitosis     The NLSGFP was used as          the volume indicator for all subsequent ratioimaging          analyses Another requirement is that the fluorescence          intensity remains uniform over the entire thickness of          the sample so that the signal accurately reflects the          volume of the sample We examined the intensity profile          emitted by a film of purified recombinant GFP The          fluorescence intensity was constant over a range of          several m above and below the focal plane data not          shown Thus the experimental setup is appropriate to          determine the concentration of GFPmyosinII in various          compartments of a m cell The correction of          GFPmyosinII images by ratio imaging makes a significant          difference to the perceived distribution of myosinII          within the cell in particular myosinII is more          concentrated in the cell cortex and in the cleavage          furrow cortex than is suggested by uncorrected          GFPmyosinII images alone Figure  The intensities          recorded in ratio images are proportional to local          GFPmyosinII concentrations and were used to measure the          accumulation and dynamics of myosinII distribution                          Patterns of cortical myosinII concentration during          mitosis and cytokinesis          Both wild type and   Ala myosinII had a similar          flux during mitosis but differed in magnitude During          interphase wild type myosinII concentration in the          total cortex was    n   higher than in the          cytoplasm while   Ala myosinII was    n            higher in the cortex than in the cytoplasm Entry into          mitosis was associated with a drop in cortical myosinII          levels a    n   decrease for wild type and             n   decrease for   Ala myosinII          measured between interphase and nuclear division This          drop was followed by a period of relatively stable          depressed cortical myosinII levels that persisted until          nuclear division Figure  This decrease may correspond          to the mobilization of myosinII from preexisting          cortical actinmyosinII structures and may correlate          with the redistribution of actin from the cortex to the          cytoplasm              Following the onset of anaphase relative cortical          myosinII concentrations of both proteins rose throughout          the periods of anaphase and cleavage furrow progression          They peaked close to the time of daughter cell separation          and returned to interphase levels as the daughter cells          returned to interphase morphology and behavior Figure                    The relative concentrations of GFPmyosinII were          compared for three regions of cells undergoing          cytokinesis the furrow cortex the polar cortex and the          cytoplasm Figure  Both myosinII proteins invariably          concentrated in the cleavage furrow cortex during          cytokinesis though the   Ala mutant did so to a          greater extent GFPmyosinII began to concentrate in the          cortex of the presumptive furrow near the time of nuclear          division and it continued to rise in this region until          the completion of cytokinesis The peak concentration of          wild type GFPmyosinII was    relative to the          polar cortex and    relative to the cytoplasm n            In contrast the peak concentration of   Ala          GFPmyosinII was    n   relative to the          cytoplasm and    n   relative to the cortex          at the poles After separation of the daughter cells the          concentration of both myosinII proteins inherited by          their posterior ends declined but remained elevated over          polar concentrations for several minutes                          Conversion of the concentration ratios into real          fractional amounts of total myosinII at different stages          of cytokinesis          To convert the concentration ratios into real amounts          of myosinII the volumes of each of the cellular          compartments cleavage furrow cortex total cortex and          cytoplasm were calculated Table  To do this we          modeled the cell in three shapes a sphere at early          anaphase a cylinder with two spherical caps at late          anaphase and a dumbbell with spherical cap domains          connected by a cylindrical intercellular bridge Then by          considering that the total amount of myosinII in the          cell is  the percentage of myosinII in the furrow          can be calculated at any point during division Even          though there is little or no volume change during          cytokinesis it should be noted that modeling the cell as          these simple shapes does not yield perfect agreement in          the total calculated volumes between each stage The          volume of the sphere appears  less than the volume of          the cylinder while the volumes of the cylinder and          dumbbell are within  of each other This is probably          because the cell is resting on a surface so that in the          spherical stage it is not perfectly spherical As the          cell shape becomes more complex in the subsequent stages          the divergence from the ideal shapes is less significant          and so the calculated volumes are much closer In either          case this result does not affect our ability to          determine how much myosinII is in each compartment          because the concentrations are calculated based on the          volume of that particular shape stage The summary of          these calculations is presented in Table where every          concentration ratio is reflected as percentages of total          myosinII          From this analysis it becomes apparent that about           of the total myosinII wild type and   Ala remains          cytoplasmic in interphase and throughout cytokinesis          During cytokinesis both wild type and   Ala myosinII          increase in total cortical myosinII by            and   respectively          This is reminiscent of the  increase in total surface          area expected if a spherical cell conserved its volume          during cytokinesis and could simply reflect passive          accumulation as a result of the increase in the surface          area to volume ratio During cytokinesis the amount of          wild type myosinII in the cleavage furrow cortex peaks          at the time when the cell is the most cylindrical prior          to the ingression of the cleavage furrow At this point          there is about  of the cells myosinII about             hexameric monomers localized to the cleavage furrow          cortex Although the concentration of myosinII in the          cleavage furrow cortex increases as cytokinesis          progresses to completion the amount of myosinII          decreases This is due to the furrow cortex volume          decreasing as cytokinesis progresses   Ala myosinII          shows a different trend During cytokinesis the protein          progressively accumulates in the furrow cortex until the          cell completes division indicating that heavy chain          phosphorylation normally facilitates removal of wild type          myosinII from the contractile ring                          Where does the cleavage furrow cortex myosinII          originate          Through this analysis Table  it becomes apparent          that only a few percent of the total cellular myosinII          has to move to account for the observed distributions          The first movement occurs between interphase and the          spherical stage onset of nuclear division in which           of the total wild type and  of the total   Ala          myosinII are released from the cortex to the cytoplasm          From the spherical stage to the cylindrical stage the          amount of total cortical myosinII remains constant For          wild type myosinII if the cortical protein were evenly          distributed in the total cortex  of the protein          would already exist in the region of the furrow cortex          with similar amounts in each polar cortex To get the           that are observed at the furrow cortex  of the          total cellular myosinII must move to the furrow cortex          region Approximately  of total cellular myosinII          departs from each polar cortex approximately  of the          total in the polar cortex suggesting that the flux of          myosinII may be from the polar cortices to the cleavage          furrow cortex Similar types of movements are observed          for the   Ala myosinII To begin  of the   Ala          myosinII would be expected at the furrow cortex if the          total cortical   Ala myosinII were evenly distributed          Then an additional  of the cells   Ala myosinII is          recruited to the furrow cortex at the expense of the          polar cortex          As the cell progresses from the cylindrical stage to          the dumbbell stage the amount of wild type myosinII in          the cortex increases from  to  of the total          cellular myosinII The concentration of myosinII in the          polar cortex increases by  while the concentration in          the furrow cortex increases by  This indicates that          the total cortex gains myosinII but the furrow cortex          gains myosinII at a faster rate Similarly the amount          of   Ala myosinII localized to the cortex also          increases from  to  of the total cellular          myosinII However in this case the polar cortex          actually decreases its concentration of myosinII by           while the furrow cortex increases its concentration by           during this interval Thus for the transition from          the cylinder to dumbbell stage the flux of wild type and            Ala myosinII must come largely from the cytoplasm to          the cortex and myosinII is recruited into the furrow          cortex at the expense of the polar cortex One way to          think of these results is that myosinII might diffuse          into the new cortex volume as the cell increases its          surface area and myosinII in the thick filament form is          then recruited to the furrow cortex                          Estimation of the minimal force requirements for          cytokinesis          To relate the amount of cleavage furrow myosinII to          the potential forces that might be generated by the          cleavage furrow cortex we estimated the minimal force          requirements for cell cleavage using the simple          mathematical relationship proposed by Yoneda and Dan              While oversimplified the results from this analysis          provide a basic framework for conceptualizing the meaning          of our quantitative distribution and flux analyses To          justify applying the Yoneda and Dan equation equation           Materials and Methods certain assumptions must be met          One assumption is that the volume is conserved during          cell division Greenspan    described the theoretical          cell shape changes that occur if conservation of cell          volume is maintained In this regime the region of the          cortex proximal to the cleavage furrow will constrict          while the polar cortex expands The proximal and distal          regions intersect producing stationary rings We          overlaid sequential images of a dividing cell and indeed          stationary rings are observed Figure A It can be seen          that the crosssectional diameter of the emerging          daughter cells remains relatively constant if drawn where          the stationary rings have formed Figure B Further as          predicted by the conservation of volume assumption the          poletopole distance increases as the furrow radius          decreases Figure B          By measuring the cell dimensions and using measured          interphase cortical stiffnesses  nNm               we calculated the minimal required force for a dividing          cell at each stage using equations  Figure C D          Table  see Methods From this analysis the peak force          requirement occurs when the cell acquires a cylindrical          shape This level of force persists until the point when          the radius of the furrow begins to constrict beyond the          radius of the emerging daughter cells After this time          the cleavage furrow continues to ingress which results          in cell shapes that require progressively less          contractile force to maintain By the time the cell has          assumed a dumbbell shape the required contractile force          is nearly one third of that required during the          cylindrical shape stage          The amount of myosinII required to produce the needed          force at each point during division was estimated by          considering the physical properties and cellular          concentration of myosinII see Methods We performed          these calculations to approximate the amount of myosinII          required at each stage of division Table  About           of the total cellular myosinII are required in the          cylindrical shape and the amount decreases to about  by          the dumbbell shape The amounts and trends predicted from          the simple Yoneda and Dan equation    are in close          agreement to the amounts and trends measured by ratio          imaging Table                             Discussion        MyosinII localization is the result of a dynamic steady        state in which recruitment is offset by thick filament        disassembly In this model a signal that possibly emanates        from the mitotic spindle instructs the cortex to recruit        myosinII to the furrow cortex and to begin contraction        This leads to the elongation of the cell to the cylindrical        form followed by constriction of the furrow MyosinII is        recruited until enough protein has accumulated and the cell        can constrict in the desired manner More myosinII is        recruited to the furrow cortex when         D discoideum cells are flattened by        agar overlay when compared to cells grown under standard        conditions on the surface of a culture plate            Flattening a cell by agar overlay may increase the apparent        stiffness of the cell by introducing tension into the        cortex from increased hydrostatic pressure Intriguingly        myosinII null         D discoideum cells divide relatively        normally if allowed to adhere to a surface     but        myosinII becomes essential if the adherent cells are grown        under a sheet of agarose            The pathway for myosinII disassembly is most likely        always active and the direction of the steady state depends        on whether the signal to recruit myosinII is active        Consistent with this concept Yumura    measured the        turnover of cortically distributed myosinII by        fluorescence recovery after photobleaching FRAP and        showed that wild type myosinII is localized to the cortex        with a halflife of about  seconds This cortical        halflife is the same regardless of whether the cell is in        interphase or undergoing cytokinesis On the other hand        the   Ala mutant myosinII has a halflife greater than        the several minutes used to track the protein The        quantitation of the distribution of the   Ala        GFPmyosinII verifies that phosphorylationcontrolled        disassembly is a normal part of myosinII turnover The        amount of the   Ala myosinII enrichment in the furrow        cortex might represent normal accumulation of myosinII        that is ordinarily offset by the disassembly of the        myosinII thick filaments possibly as a part of a feedback        mechanism that senses the mechanical needs of the cell        The data presented here does not distinguish between        recruitment of myosinII to the cleavage furrow cortex by        cortical sliding or recruitment from the cytoplasm Between        the period of cytokinesis involving transition from a        spherical cell shape to a cylindrical shape there is        little or no net flux of myosinII from the cytoplasm to        the cortex A simple interpretation is that the myosinII        simply slides along the cortex from the poles to the        cleavage furrow Indeed FRAP studies support a model where        dynamic myosinII filaments progressively slide along the        cortex while exchanging with the cytoplasmic pool of        myosinII monomers     However between the        cylindrical and dumbbell stages of cell shape there is a        net flux of myosinII from the cytoplasm to the cortex        This flux from the cytoplasm to the cortex may simply        reflect the increase in the surface area and consequently        the cortex volume to total cell volume ratio and may not        be specific to cytokinesis per se Then cortical flow        could continue to concentrate the myosinII into the furrow        cortex Since more   Ala myosinII than wild type        myosinII is recruited to the cleavage furrow cortex the        recruitment mechanism is unlikely to be limiting for the        wild type myosinII This suggests that an unlimiting        regulator molecule may control the localization of        myosinII A candidate for a catalytic regulator molecule        is the PAKa kinase which is required for myosinII        localization to the cleavage furrow cortex     This        kinase could act on enzymes that regulate the myosinII        assemblystate or it could act on a cortical receptor for        myosinII thick filaments        During cytokinesis global and spatial mechanical        properties are likely used to deform a cell allowing the        constriction of the cells equator reviewed in            These spatial properties include local modulation of        stiffness and the generation of contractile force A        localized stiffness increase may define the region that is        deformed during a morphological process The cleavage        furrow cortex increases in stiffness above the global        stiffness in mammalian cells as determined by atomic force        microscopy     This regional increase in stiffness is        likely to occur in most or all metazoan and ameboid cells        For example in         D discoideum the cortexillin        actinfilament crosslinking proteins are recruited to the        cleavage furrow where they are thought to contribute to the        stiffness of the cleavage furrow cortex             MyosinII is probably a major contractile force generator        However direct measurement of this parameter is far more        difficult in small cells In this paper we have measured        the amount of myosinII that is recruited to the cleavage        furrow cortex This amount is in close agreement with the        estimate of the amount of myosinII that would be required        to generate the forces that may be required to cleave a        cell        The mechanical model presented provides a useful        framework for conceptualizing the quantitation of        myosinII However there are many issues that must be        considered before a comprehensive model for contractile        force production can be developed First it should be        noted that myosinII null cells can divide if given a        surface to which to adhere The mechanism by which these        cells divide under these conditions is not known However        by considering the mechanics of the process one realizes        that the cell has the highest need for force generation        during elongation and initial furrow ingression Traction        forces may serve well to elongate the cell allowing the        formation of the cylindrical shape Indeed myosinII null        cells in the absence of surface attachment fail to        elongate verifying that myosinII is required for this        step when surface traction is not available     Other        gelation and solvation factors and possibly an        unconventional myosin might complete the process once the        cylindrical shape has been acquired for further discussion        see     Interestingly during interphase the myosinII        null cells are  less stiff in bending modulus and         less stiff in surface tension than the wild type parental        cells      Thus by considering the mechanics of        division one realizes that myosinII null cells probably        require significantly less force to divide making it        easier to cleave Since other proteins are likely to        contribute to contractile force production the        quantitation of the amount of myosinII recruited to the        cleavage furrow cortex allows us to estimate how much force        can be provided by myosinII In fact there are adequate        amounts of myosinII to generate at least the majority of        the forces that are estimated to be required It is        reasonable that the contractile ring may be able to        generate greater force than is minimally required Having        the ability to generate more force than is minimally        required may have great utility in nature Environmental        factors such as cellcell contact and hypotonicity might        place additional demands on the equatorial contractile        apparatus that go beyond the intrinsic stiffness of the        cell cortex        Another issue is that the level of myosinII activity        may be able to vary In muscle there is loaddependent        recruitment of myosinII crossbridges in other words the        duty ratio of muscle myosinII can vary reviewed by            For our calculations we considered the duty ratio to be         which is the value measured for unloaded         D discoideum myosinII        Loaddependent recruitment of crossbridges for         D discoideum myosinII has not been        examined so it is not known whether this is important for a        simple eukaryotic nonmuscle myosinII However this ratio        may be able to change in a loaddependent manner such that        the amount of myosinII that is recruited to the cleavage        furrow may be able to generate much greater forces than        appear to be minimally required MyosinII activity might        also be predicted to vary as a result of localized        activation by myosin light chain phosphorylation However        in         D discoideum myosin light chain        phosphorylation is not required for cytokinesis so this is        unlikely to be a major consideration      Finally        the ratio imaging experiments do not allow us to make        conclusions regarding the radial uniformity of the        myosinII in the cleavage furrow cortex Thus it is        possible that the force generation is not generated in a        perfectly symmetrical fashion However the contractile        force may not need to be generated in an entirely uniform        manner to generate the needed forces to stabilize the        ingression of the cleavage furrow cortex The quantitation        of amounts of myosinII that are recruited to the        contractile ring is an essential starting point for        developing a more detailed but experimentally tractable        model for cytokinesis Given the complex bookkeeping        involved in accounting for the contributions of each        individual force generator to the precise mechanical needs        of every individual cell it is remarkable that the trends        of myosinII distribution are so closely predicted by the        simple theoretical analysis                    Conclusion        Direct measurements of the cortex stiffness and        contractility as a function of position and time during        cytokinesis in wild type and mutant cells will be essential        to identify the contribution of myosinII to the mechanics        of cell shape changes Examination of the effects of other        proteins that are involved in cytokinesis such as the        cortexillins     and dynacortin    will also be        necessary to understand how different factors contribute to        the different mechanical parameters such as stiffness and        contractility It should be remembered that in this study        the agreement between the amount of myosinII required in        the cleavage furrow cortex determined from Hookes law and        the amount measured using ratio imaging is strictly        correlative What is most notable however is that the        trends predicted from the simple model accurately predict        the trends of myosinII recruitment to the cleavage furrow        cortex Other more sophisticated models for cytokinesis        have been presented     However the value of this        simple theoretical analysis is that it more accurately        predicts the trends of contractility which may be assigned        in large part to myosinII and it can be easily tested in a        variety of cell types for its validity If it generally        provides reliable estimates of the mechanical        considerations for dividing cells it would be a useful        tool for researchers who are interested in quantitative        approaches to studying the biology of cytokinesis                    Materials and Methods                  DNA manipulation and cell culture          All DNA manipulations were carried out using standard          procedures    unless otherwise specified          GFPmyosinII and NLSGFP were simultaneously expressed          from the same extrachromosomal plasmid vector p in          the case of wildtype GFPmyosinII p in the case of            Ala GFPmyosinII To generate p the coding          region of Bex GFP    was subcloned into pBSMyBam              The fusion of GFP to the Nterminal region of the          myosinII heavy chain gene was subsequently subcloned          into pBigMyD The coding region of Vex GFP    was          subcloned into pDXAC    as described     and          the NLSGFP expression cassette subcloned into p p          was made by replacing the  region of the myosinII          heavy chain gene in p with the equivalent fragment          from pBIGALA              All constructs were transformed into the parental JH          strain or HS a myosinII heavy chain            mhcA  null strain     unless          otherwise indicated Cells were cultured in DDBroth             with the addition of  gml thymidine for JH          and  gml G for plasmid selection The          pLDASNGFPdynacortin plasmid was transformed into DH          cells and the cells were grown in Hans Enriched HL          with  gml G     For experiments with Texas          Reddextran the fluorescent dextran was electroporated          into cells                          Microscopy          For microscopic observation cells were plated in          chambered coverslips Nalge Nunc for  hours in fresh          medium washed once with Imaging Buffer  mM MES pH            mM potassium chloride  mM magnesium sulfate           mM calcium chloride and covered with  ml of the          same buffer Observations were made with a Zeiss Axiovert          TV with PlanApo x NA objective Carl Zeiss          Inc Fluorescence images from  ms exposures were          recorded using a TECCDTKB camera and ST          controller Princeton Instruments Inc and manipulated          with Image Metamorph Universal Imaging Corp          Fluorescence images were collected with triple          bandpass dichroic  nm  nm and  nm          transmitted Chroma Tech Corp and HiQ FITC emission          filter  nm transmitted Chroma Tech Corp          Pairs of images of Bex and Vex GFPs were recorded in          rapid succession  ms by switching bandpass          excitation filters between  nm and  nm          using a Lambda  filter wheel controller Sutter          Instrument Co                          Ratio image analysis          Image processing was in three principal steps          background subtraction correction for spectral overlap          and ratio generation Mean background signal was measured          in a region of each image unpopulated by cells and          subtracted from the entire image Spectral overlap was          measured in cells expressing only one of the two GFP          variants These measurements showed that the intensity of          the Bex signal using a Vex excitation filter was             n   all measurements are mean  SEM of the          Bex signal using a Bex excitation filter Further the          intensity of the Vex signal using a Bex excitation          filter was    n   of the Vex signal          using a Vex excitation filter These measurements          allowed the contributions of each GFP to the image          intended to represent the other GFP to be subtracted out          Division of the corrected GFPmyosinII image by the          corrected NLSGFP image yielded ratio images with pixel          intensities that are proportional to local myosinII          concentrations except in the region occupied by the          nucleus          Four regions of dividing cells were defined for          analysis purposes the cortex as a whole the cytoplasm          the cortex underlying the cleavage furrow and the cortex          underlying the poles Figure  The cytoplasm was          defined as the entire contents of the cell excluding the          cortex and the nuclei The cortex was defined as a layer          with a constant thickness of  m This number is          justified because the thickness of cortical GFPmyosinII          fluorescence is approximately  m and is consistent          with published electron micrographs of           D discoideum cell cortices              It should be noted that fluorescence that is defined as          cytoplasm also includes fluorescence from the overlying          and underlying cortices However this amount of cortex          contributes less than  of the total fluorescence of the          cytoplasm which is within the error of the cytoplasmic          concentration measurement Table  and is therefore          negligible          The furrow and polar cortical regions were each          subsets of the cortex as defined above The cortex          underlying the furrow is considered to extend outwards          from the equator as far as the point of inflection of the          curvature of the cell Figure  This region corresponds          well to the most advanced part of the furrow and to the          region in which myosinII is concentrated This region          also contains the contractile ring actin filaments              The polar cortex is defined as the two cortical regions          furthest from the equator these regions being of          equivalent size to the furrow region as defined above          Figure E Regions of interest were drawn manually onto          images and their mean pixel intensities were recorded and          processed in Excel Microsoft Graphical representations          were generated in KaleidaGraph Synergy Software          To convert the ratios of myosinII into quantities          the volumes of each of the cell regions of were          calculated from the cells dimensions First the total          cell volume was determined Then the cytoplasm volume          was calculated by considering the dimensions of the whole          cell minus the cortex and the cortex volume was          calculated as the difference between the total cellular          volume and the cytoplasm volume To calculate the furrow          cortex volume at the cylinder stage the furrow was          considered to be the belt that constricts in subsequent          time points At the cylinder stage it was determined to          be  of the cells total length The volume of the          furrow cortex was calculated as a difference between the          outer cell cylinder and the inner cytoplasmic cylinder          At the dumbbell stage the cleavage furrow cortex volume          was calculated as the sum of its parts see Figure E          First the intercellular bridge was modeled as the          difference between the inner and outer cylinders The          portion of the furrow cortex flanking the intercellular          bridge which extend upwards to the flexion point of the          curvature of the main cell body was modeled as a          difference of inner and outer spherical caps The small          fraction of this volume where the intercellular bridge          intersects the spherical caps was subtracted from the          furrow cortex volume          To determine the fraction of myosinII in any          compartment the concentration of myosinII in the furrow          cortex was                       c             the concentration in the cytoplasm was                       c             ratio of furrow cortex to cytoplasm and the          concentration in the polar cortex was                       c             ratio of furrow cortex to polar cortex Then          the sum of the products of the concentrations of each          part multiplied by that parts volume equals  of the          myosinII in the cell Once                       c            is solved for algebraically the concentrations of          each part can be determined and the fraction of the total          cellular myosinII in each region is the product of the          concentration and the regions volume                          Analysis of Cell Geometry and Calculation of          Minimal Force Requirements          To analyze the cell geometry during cytokinesis          dimensions of dividing           D discoideum cells were measured          using NIH Image to determine the number of pixels for a          particular dimension Calculations were made with Excel          Microsoft Corp          To calculate the minimal required force to cleave a          cell we used Yoneda and Dans equation              R           f  S           c cos  Equation           where  is the contractile force R           f is the radius of the furrow S           c is the stiffness of the cell cortex          and  is the angle between the tangent to the cortex at          the base of the furrow and the cleavage plane Figure          C We considered S           c to be  nNm which was measured          using a microcapillary aspiration technique      To          calculate the balance of forces using the equation          proposed by Yoneda and Dan     the inplane stiffness          or surface tension is the appropriate parameter to          consider The glass needle indentation method    has          also been used to measure the cortical stiffness of           D discoideum However this method          mostly measures the bending modulus          To determine the minimal force requirements of cells          undergoing cell division we analyzed movies of dividing           D discoideum cells The diameter          of the cleavage furrow R           f  and the pole to pole distance Z           p  were measured The radius r of          each emerging daughter cell was calculated using the          following          r  Zp  Rf Z           p  Equation           Then Cos was calculated from the following          cos  Zp  rr  Equation           The contractile force was then calculated by inputting          the various quantities and solving for  Parameters were          plotted versus cell shape which change as a function of          time to demonstrate how the minimal required contractile          force varied as a function of cell shape          The amount of myosinII required to produce a          particular amount of force was calculated by assuming          that a single head of myosinII produces  pN of force              To correct for myosinIIs duty ratio t           s  t           c  the following considerations were          used The maximum velocity V for translation of actin          filaments by           D discoideum myosinII is  ms             and the step size is  nm     If V equals the          step size divided by the strongly bound state time t           s  then t           s equals  nm nms or about           msec The V           max for the actinactivated myosinII          ATPase cycle is about  s      Therefore the          total cycle time t           c  is about  msec Thus the duty          ratio is about  for           D discoideum myosinII For          comparison the duty ratio for vertebrate skeletal          myosinII is about               To determine the percentage of total cellular          myosinII the following assumptions were used to          calculate the total amount of myosinII in a cell total          protein concentration in           D discoideum is  g cells              myosinII represents about  of the cells          protein      the relative molecular mass of a          hexameric monomer two each of the heavy chain and          essential and regulatory light chains of myosinII is           kDa and the average size of a           D discoideum cell is about  m in          diameter when grown on surfaces To determine the average          cell size cultures were grown on surfaces resuspended          in media and the population distribution of the cell          diameter measured with a Z Coulter counter Beckman          Coulter Inc From this an average density of myosinII          per m was determined to be approximately  monomers          per m approximately  M so that the amount of          myosinII in any cell with a particular volume could be          estimated assuming that the average concentration          remains the same
