West and there is less of a class distinction amongst the audiencesStandard popular culture is also prevalent ranging from a bland Parisianstyle cabaret to much raunchier girly shows Bigname

except for the Englishlanguage Merlin Theatre on Gerlczy utca tel  all plays are staged in Hungarian thus excluding most of the foreign tourists The language barrier is of course much less problematic with opera ballet and dance or musicThe State Opera House on Andrssy t is the nest of the citys dedicated opera venues the Vigad also produces opera and connoisseurs rank it among Europes bestBallet

bars pubs and clubs in the city Go to the Music Mix shop at Vci utca  for ticketsClubs and BarsHungarys latenight drinking and partying scene is not much different from that in other international cities The Pubs are based either on the English model or more commonly the German bierstube There is also a variety of international bars Continentalstyle cafs and authentic Hungarian bars though the latter are not very apparent in the main tourist areas Look for the sign srzo if you are a beer drinker and boroz if you prefer wine While a srzo is often similar to a German bierstube however a boroz is rarely like a Parisian wine bar and neither serves only beer or wine Live music is quite common with jazz suppressed as subversive in the Stalinist era currently enjoying something of a renaissance in Budapest nightspots Most performances are blues and dixieland and audiences are generally young There are also several cabaret clubs presenting oorshows with bigproduction numbers and scantilyclad dancersFor visitors who prefer the excitement of the casino Hungary has  gambling establishments The place to be seen is the Hilton Hotel which in common with most Budapest casinos offers French and

tip of Castle Hill The latter is housed in a beautiful neoRenaissance building by Mikls Ybl designer of the Opera House Casinos generally open from  pm to  or  amFilmsHungarians take their movies seriously and Hungarian directors have come up with lastingly interesting works But the tourist is out of luck because the domestic product is incomprehensible even locally and most of the foreign films are dubbed into HungarianFolkloreDespite a recent cultural invasion from the West Hungary still has a very active folkmusic scene and where there is music dancing is never very far behind Hungarian folkdancing is well worth watching and takes you through the whole gamut of courtly wedding dances to highenergy bootslapping Lads Dances from the th century As ever its best to catch it at local festivals where performers are there for the love of dancing or local pride as opposed to the tourist dollar In the same vein look out for the real gypsy dancers who have vivacity associated with the likes of Andalucian amenco performersYou can see Hungarian dancersamateur or professionalmost nights at the Municipal Folklore Centre at Fehrvri t  south of Gellrt Hill Folklore evenings are also staged at other venues the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble gives excellent performances Folklore evenings of a different type are also touted by some restaurants These are generally staged for tour groups on whistlestop visits and while they provide an easy option they are not representative of real Hungarian folk entertainmentChildrenThe main roads of Budapest and particularly Pest are busy with people and trafc and children have to be closely watched Many other areas in the city and the surrounding region however are much more suitable for them The obvious place to go is the City Park where the zoo and Vidm Park are within a few yards of each other and the circus makes regular appearances The zoo as well as the amusement park are more traditional than modern but the circus is reputedly one of Europes best If the weather is warm the splendid Szchenyi Baths is the perfect place for cooling off In summer theres a boating lake in the park and in winter this converts to an iceskating rinkThe other oasis in the city is Margaret Island You can spend a good hour or so riding round it en famille on a bicyclecarriage made for four You can also swim here in the citys biggest baths the Palatinus Strand Children also seem to enjoy the openair wave pool at the Gellrt Hotel Out of town Lake Balaton is a good place for water babies particularly the southern edge where the sandy shore slopes gently into warm waterA cogwheel railway and a smallgauge train takes you to the peaceful Buda hills the latter is staffed almost entirely by children apart from the driver see page

horse shows Details are available from IBUSZ or TourinformNightlife possibilities include folkdancing see page  or a notsotraditional laser show at the Planetarium in the Npliget to the southeast of
