                      Where to Go        To help you plan your itinerary we divide Japan into seven        regional sections The first is devoted entirely to Tokyo where youre        likely to begin your trip get your bearings and become acquainted        with modern Japan We then present six tours spreading out from the        capital to the centers of historic and artistic interest as well as to        sites of natural beauty If you have sufficient time to explore Japan        you might want to begin and end your visit in Tokyo In between you        can venture out to explore the rest of the country        Tokyo        Originally known as Edo meaning estuary Tokyo was just        a sleepy little village surrounded by marshland on the broad Kanto        plain until the end of the th century when Tokugawa Ieyasu moved        here and made it the center of his vast domains When Ieyasu became        shogun in  Edo in turn became the seat of national        governmentand its castle the largest in the world Edo expanded        rapidly to accommodate Ieyasus  retainers and their families and        the myriad common people who served their daily needs By  the        population had grown to         The ruling elite lived on the high ground the Yamanote        bluffs west and south of the castle The artisans tradespeople        and providers of entertainment reputable and not so reputable lived        downtown on the reclaimed marshlands north and east in the area        still known as Shitamachi As these two populations interacted a        unique new culture was born Edo became the center of power and also        the center of all that was vibrant and compelling in the arts        After  that center grew even stronger when the movement        known as the Meiji Restoration overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate and the        imperial court moved to Edo The city was renamed Tokyo Eastern        Capital and from that moment on all roadspolitical cultural and        financialled here        In the th century Tokyo has twice suffered almost total        destruction First the earthquake of  and subsequent fire razed        nearly all vestiges of old Edo killing some  people in the        process Rebuilt without any comprehensive urban plan Tokyo remains a        city of subcenters and neighborhoods even villages each with its own        distinct personality        Unlike the great capital cities of Europe there is no        prevailing style of architecture here no monumental core for a new        building to harmonize or clash with Even after the collapse of the        economic bubble in  construction projects are everywhere Whole        blocks of the city seem to disappear overnight replaced in the blink        of an eye by new office buildings condominiums cultural complexes        and shopping centers        Tokyo is a city of enormous creative and entrepreneurial        energy much of which goes into reinventing itself If theres a        commodity in short supply here its relaxation Nobody strolls in        Tokyo and there are few places to sit down outdoors and watch the        world go by The idea of a long leisurely lunch hour is utterly alien        People in Tokyo are in a hurry to get somewhereeven if they dont        always know precisely where theyre going        The Imperial Palace        If Tokyo can be said to have any center at all this is it        Todays Imperial Palace is on the site of Edo castle where the        Tokugawa shogunate ruled Japan for  years it was thereafter home to        the emperors of the modern era The palace was almost totally destroyed        in the air raids of World War II then rebuilt in ferroconcrete This        is the least interesting part of what was once the largest system of        fortifications in the world and in any case you cant get in to see        it What you can see are the lovely grounds of the East Garden the        moat and massive stone ramparts and those few examples of classic        Japanese architecturegates bridges armories and        watchtowersthat have survived since the th century        The imperial family still resides in the palace so the        general public is admitted to the grounds on only two days each year        on  January and  December On these occasions you might find it        hard to compete with the many thousands of Japanese visitors who come        to pay their respects        The Imperial Palaces East Garden is open to the public        every day except Monday and Friday From Otemachi subway station you        enter the gardens at the Otemon Gate and wander through hedgerows of        white and pink azaleas around ponds and little waterfalls edged with        pines plum trees canary palms and soft green cryptomeria japonica        Over the treetops you catch an occasional glimpse of the skyscrapers of        modern Tokyo Also on the grounds are the Museum of Imperial        Collections an exhibition hall for art treasures donated to the public        by the imperial family in  and the HundredMan Guardhouse where        the approach to the inner sanctum of the fortress was defended by four        shifts of  samurai warriors each        A walk clockwise around the palace grounds will bring you        first to the picturesque Nijubashi Bridge and the Seimon Gate where        the public is allowed to enter the palace grounds You then pass the        most prominent of Japans modern government buildings the National        Diet Japans parliament and the Supreme Court A complete circuit        would also include the National Theater and the National Museum of        Modern Art With a short detour you can also take in Yasukuni Jinja        Founded in  this is the Shrine of Peace for the Nation        dedicated to the souls of those who have died for Japan in battle        Besides the main hall and the hall of worship the shrine complex        includes a noh theater stage a sumo wrestling ring several teahouses        and the Yushukan museum of war memorabilia        Ginza        Tokyos bestknown district is named after a silver mint        originally located here Once the epitome of chic Ginza has lost many        of its smartest young shoppers to the fashion boutiques of districts        like Aoyama and Omotesando but the area is still fascinating        The windows of such department stores as Wako and        Mitsukoshi are works of art Inside theres more art all the major        department stores project themselves as bastions of culture        maintaining their own galleries and mounting frequent worldclass        exhibitions of prints painting pottery and sculpture Downstairs you        can find still more artto Western eyes at leastin the        astonishing basement gourmet food displays The basement is also a        good place for cheaper snacks than youll find in the streetlevel        restaurants         Running roughly northsouth through Ginza from the corner        of Hibiya Park all the way to Tokyo Bay is the broad avenue called        Harumidori Taking a stroll down the avenue is such a national        institution that theres even a colloquial expression for it ginbura        Just south of Ginza itself as you walk toward the bay you see on your        left the red lanterns and long banners of the Kabukiza home base for        that most thrilling and colorful form of traditional Japanese drama        The first kabuki theater was built in on this site in  Designed to        invoke the castle architecture of the Tokugawa period the theater was        destroyed in an air raid in World War II and rebuilt in         Still farther south is the Tsukiji Central Wholesale        Marketthe largest fish market in Asia Some  wholesale dealers        do business here supplying  percent of the fish consumed in Tokyo        every day Get here very early am is ideal to see the tuna auctions        and enjoy the orchestrated pandemonium of the market at its finest        From here you could walk to the lovely Hama Rikyu Detached Palace        Garden Originally a Tokugawa family estate the garden became a public        park in  The path to the left as you enter leads to the ferry        landing where the river buses depart for their journeys up the        Sumida River to Asakusa        Asakusa        Asakusa is the heart of Shitamachi the quarter        bestbeloved of that fractious gossipy prodigal population called the        Edokko who trace their downtown roots back at least three        generations Edokko are suckers for sentimentality and for ninjo the        web of small favors and kindnesses that bind them together Sneeze in        the middle of the night and your Edokko neighbor will demand the next        morning that you take better care of yourself stay home with a fever        and she will be over by noon with a bowl of soup An Edokko craftsman        would rather lose a commission than take any guff from a customer who        doesnt know good work when he sees it Edokko quarrel in a language        all their own an earthy local dialect as profane and expressive as        Brooklynese Ignore the proprietiesor offend the pride of an        Edokkoand he will let you know about it in no uncertain terms        respect his sense of values and you make a friend for life        The heart of Asakusa in turn is Sensoji also known as        the Asakusa Kannon temple According to legend the temple houses a        small statue of the Buddhist goddess of mercy found in the Sumida        River by two local fishermen in the year but in fact not even the        temple priests have ever seen it When Edo became the capital of the        Tokugawa shogunate Asakusa began to flourish as an entertainment        quarter In the earlyth century even the kabuki theaters were        located here The Meiji Restoration and the opening of Japan to exotic        new Westernstyle amusements further enhanced Asakusas reputation as        Fun City The first place in Japan to call itself a bar opened in        Asakusa in  and is still doing business the first movie theater        opened here in  Before long the streets and alleys around the        temple were filled with music halls burlesque theaters cabarets        gambling dens and watering holes of every description        Most of the temple quarter was firebombed to ashes in         but by  the people of the area had raised enough money to rebuild        Sensoji and all of the important structures around it So what if the        restorations were in concrete The original is still there in        spiritand no visitor should neglect it        Sensoji Temple and Surroundings        Start your exploration from Asakusa Station on the Ginza        subway line Tokyos first subway A few steps from the exit is        Kaminarimon Thunder God Gate the main entrance to the temple hung        with a pair of enormous red paper lanterns From here the long narrow        arcade called Nakamisedori is lined with shops selling toasted rice        crackers spices in gourdshaped wooden bottles dolls toys fans        childrens kimono and ornaments and souvenirs of all sorts Some of        these shops have been operated by the same families for hundreds of        years        The arcade ends at a twostory gate called the Hozomon To        the left is the FiveStory Pagoda and across the courtyard is the main        hall of Sensoji Visitors should be sure to stop at the huge bronze        incense burner in front of the hall to bathe in the smokean        observance believed to bestow a years worth of good health        The building to the right of the main hall is the Asakusa        Jinja a Shinto shrine dedicated to the three legendary foundersthe        Sanjaof Sensoji Buddhism and Shinto get along quite peacefully in        Japan sharing ground and even deities  The Sanja Matsuri held here        every year on the third weekend in May is the biggest most exuberant        festival in Tokyo        Ueno        North of the city center Ueno was chosen in  by the        Tokugawa Shogun Hidetaka as the site of a vast temple complex Called        Kaneiji it was established on the areas one prominent hill to        protect the capital from evil spirits Kaneiji was a seat of great        power until  when it became the battleground in the shogunates        last stand against the imperial army and most of the buildings were        destroyed Subsequently Ueno was turned into Tokyos first public        park endowed with all the preferred Western improvements museums        concert halls a library a university of fine arts and a zoo Ueno        should be a stop on any visitors itineraryespecially if you happen        to be here in midApril when the cherry blossoms in the park are        glorious        No visitor here should miss the Tokyo National Museum a        complex of four buildings devoted to Japanese art and archaeology        dating back to the prehistoric Jomon and Yayoi periods Outstanding        among the exhibits are Buddhist sculpture of the tenth and        thcentury Heian era illustrated narrative scrolls from the        thcentury Kamakura period paintings by the great Muromachi artist        Sesshu and woodblock prints by the Edoperiod masters

paintings prints and drawings the gift of a wealthy        businessman named Kojiro Matsukata The building itself was designed by        Le Corbusier the Rodin sculptures in the courtyardthe Gate of Hell        the Thinker and the magnificent Burghers of Calaisare authentic        castings from the original molds        Of the Edoera buildings that have survived or been        restored the most important are the main hall of Kaneiji and the        Toshogu Shrine to the first Tokugawa Shogun Ieyasua lesser version        of the great sanctum at Nikko in the mountains of Nagano Prefecture        see page  Also of interest is the Kiyomizu Kannon Hall modeled        after the larger and more famous Kiyomizu temple in Kyoto registered        as a National Treasure this is one of the few buildings that survived        the battle of  intact        At the south end of the park is the statue of Saigo        Takamori leader of the imperial army that overthrew the shogunate in         Saigo is a problematic hero in Japanese history in  he was        killed in an unsuccessful rebellion against the very government he        helped to found         From here its a short walk west to the grounds of        Shinobazu Pond Just inside the entrance on the right is the        Shitamachi Customs and Manners Museum Budget some time here it will        give you a wonderfully concrete sense of the lifestyle that defined        this part of the city for well over  years The displays include a        fullscale reproduction of a nagaya one of the long singlestory row        houses typical of the Edo period Visitors are welcome to take their        shoes off and walk through the tatamimat rooms        Harajuku and Yoyogi Park        The venerable imperial traditions of Japan and the frenetic        celebration of its youth culture are arrayed side by side in this        quarter of the city From Harajuku Station on the Japan Railways        Yamanote loop line its but a few steps to Meiji Jingu the shrine        dedicated to the spirits of the Emperor Meiji who died in  and        the Empress Shoken The entrance is marked by two huge torii gates        their pillars made from yearold cypress trees        From here broad gravel paths lead to the honden the        sanctum of the shrine destroyed in the air raids of  and restored        in  and the Imperial Treasure House museum The Meiji emperor        presided over the emergence of Japan as a modern nation state and his        shrine is surely the most solemn decorous place in Tokyo During the        annual festival  October through  November and on New Years Day        as many as a million people will come to offer prayers and pay their        respects Spring and summer make better visits when you can admire the        irises and flowering shrubs of the inner gardens        Adjacent to the shrine is Yoyogi Park The park is        remarkable chiefly for the National Yoyogi Sports Center comprising        two stadiums designed by architect Tange Kenzo The park itself was        once a parade ground for the imperial Japanese army After World War II        it was taken over by the Occupation for military housing and nicknamed        Washington Heights then redeveloped as the Olympic Village site for        the  Tokyo Olympic Games By the s thanks to the broad avenues        and new subway s tops built for the games this had become one of the        liveliest trendiest and demographically youngest quarters of the        city        On Sundays and holidays part of the avenue through the        park is closed to traffic Rock bands that are not quite yet on a        professional footing truck in their equipment and play all day just        for practice The bands are loudthey have to be to compete with the        groups of Elvis imitators in black leather jackets and sideburns who        also lay claim to some of this great free space dancing in circles to        the oldies on enormous boomboxes Street food body paint inyourface        fashion photo ops on a warm spring afternoon Yoyogi Park is more fun        than any place in town        The opposite west end of the park borders on Shibuya        where you can visit NHK Broadcasting Center headquarters for Japans        public television networka must for anyone wishing to see how        samurai epics are made Your hotel or the Tourist Information Center        will have information on the Studio Park guided tour of the NHK        soundstages        Shinjuku        In the Edo period Shinjuku was where two of the major roads        from the west came together By the early s the area had become a        sort of bohemian quarter beloved of the citys cliques of writers        artists and intellectuals After World War II it emerged as one of        Tokyos major transportation hubs and today an estimated three million        people pass through Shinjuku Station every day The station itself        divides Shinjuku into two distinctly different areas east and        west        West Shinjuku rejoices in a special gift of nature Its        relatively stable bedrock can support earthquakesafe        skyscrapersforemost among them is the new Metropolitan Government        Office more familiarly known as Tokyo City Hall The City Hall complex        was architect Tange Kenzos magnum opus arguably the last great work        of his career It was a staggeringly expensive project and taxpayers        have had an ongoing lovehate relationship with its postmodern        monumental design since it was completed in  The complex consists        of a story main office building a story annex the Metropolitan        Assembly building and a huge central courtyard The main building        soars  m  ft splitting on the rd floor into two towers        Weather permitting the observation decks on the th floors of both        towers offer views all the way to Mt Fuji        East Shinjuku is really two places a daytime quarter of        department stores vertical malls and discount stores and a nighttime        quarter of bars straight and gay cheap restaurants strip joints        game parlors jazz clubs roomsbythehour hotels raves and        honkytonksmost of the latter in a seedy neonlit neighborhood        called Kabukicho The neighborhood isnt really dangerous but its        all too easy for the unwary visitor to wander into a ripoff if you        plan to explore Kabukicho do so with a knowledgeable local guide        A longish walk along Shinjukudori from the station will        bring you to the north end of Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden        Originally a feudal estate this collection of gardens in Japanese        French and English styles became part of the imperial household after        the Meiji Restoration and in  a public parkthe ultimate oasis        in this quarter of the city Shinjuku Gyoen is famous for its botanical        greenhouse for its flowering cherry trees in April and for its        chrysanthemum exhibition during the first two weeks of October        Shinagawa        Not otherwise rich in tourist attractions Shinagawa has        one gem that should not be missed Sengakujia temple that evokes        what is surely the most popular story in all of premodern Japanese        history        In  a young provincial baron named Asano Takumi no        Kami morally insulted by a court official named Kira attacked and        wounded his tormentor Asano was ordered to commit suicide for his        offense however Kira went free Asanos clan steward Oishi        Kuranosuke and fortyseven of his loyal retainers vowed revenge On        the night of  December  despite many obstacles they attacked        Kiras heavily guarded villa on the east side of the Sumida River cut        off his head and brought it in triumph to Asanos tomb at Sengakuji        the family temple This was a dilemma for the Tokugawa government On        one hand their revenge was perfectly in accord with the samurai code        of honor on the other they had murdered a high official Eventually        Oishi and his band were also ordered to commit suicide this they did        and they were buried at Sengakuji with their lord Celebrated in kabuki        theater film and television the story has had an abiding hold on the        imagination of the Japanese people Thousands of visitors come annually        to Sengakuji to lay incense on the tombstones and walk through the        small museum called the Hall of the Loyal Retainers where weapons        personal effects and other memorabilia are preserved        Kanto        The oncemarshy plain of Kanto is Tokyos hinterland the        region where the feudal warlords set up their military bases and        administrative headquarters Their toughminded pragmatism survives        today not only in Tokyo but also in the dynamic industrial zone that        has burgeoned around it in such towns as Kawasaki and Yokohama But        monuments at Kamakura and Nikko still bear testimony to the regions        history And reigning supreme over Kanto is a sublime spiritual comment        on the vanity of all such human endeavors sacred Mt Fuji        Four easytomanage excursions from Tokyo would make        memorable additions to your stay Two of themto Yokohama and        Kamakuraare daytrips Visits to Nikko and to Mt FujiHakone will be        more enjoyable as overnighters        Nikko         Think nothing splendid says an old Japanese proverb        until youve seen Nikko  In the mountains of Tochigi Prefecture        about  km  miles north of Tokyo by train Nikko is the final        resting place of Ieyasu founder of the Tokugawa shogunate who died in         Upon his death he was declared a god by the imperial court and        subsequently known as Tosho Daigongen The Great Incarnation Who        Illuminates the East The following year his remains were taken in a        grand procession to be enshrined here on the site of a religious        center founded some eight centuries before In life Ieyasu had made        himself the absolute monarch of Japan His personal fief alone was        worth enough to feed and support some  million people Toshogu the        mausoleum complex that he commanded for himself in his apotheosis is        extraordinary        Nikko is best reached from Tokyo by train by the Japan        Railways Shinkansen line from Tokyo or Ueno stations with a transfer        at Utsunomiya or by the private Tobu Line Limited Express from        Asakusa The journey takes about two hours The little town of Nikko        is essentially one long avenue from the railway station to the Toshogu        shrine        The Toshogu Shrine Complex        A short bus ride from the station plaza brings you to the        redlacquer Shinkyo Sacred Bridge a m ft span over the        Daiya River where your exploration of Toshogu begins The bridge marks        the spot where the Buddhist priest Shodo is said to have crossed the        river in the year  on the backs of two huge serpents to found the        temple that would later become Rinnoji An entrance to the shrine        complex is just across the road opposite the bridge and up a flight of        stone steps that brings you first to Shodos temple        Rinnoji belongs to the Tendai sect of Buddhism The main        hall called the Sanbutsudo with its almost erotic color scheme of        black and green and vermilion dates to  and is the largest single        building at Toshogu Inside are three huge goldlacquered statues        representing three different manifestations of the Buddha In the        center is Amida Nyorai the Buddha who leads believers to Paradise on        the right is Senju ThousandArmed Kannon the goddess of mercy on        the left is BatoKannon depicted with a horses head on its forehead        regarded as the protector of animals North of the main hall is the        Gohotendo a subtemple where worshippers inscribe their prayers for        health and prosperity on slats of wood that are later burned to carry        the prayers to heaven To the south is the residence of the Abbotby        tradition an imperial princewith a particularly fine garden in the        style of the Edo period        Leaving Rinnoji from the west side you come to the broad        Omotesando avenue that leads uphill to the shrine itself Note the        monument to the daimyo Matsudaira Masatane Ieyasus trusted retainer        Matsudaira spent some  years planting the majestic cryptomeria cedars        on the grounds of the shrine and along the km mile avenue of        approach Alas much of the avenue has been destroyed a few sections        of it survive on the road east of town where many of the  trees        still standing are maintained by corporate sponsors        At the top of the Omotesando on the left is the        fivestory pagoda of the shrine decorated with the  signs of the        Asian zodiac and the hollyhock crest of the Tokugawa family From here        a flight of stone steps leads to the first gate of Toshogu the        Omotemon guarded by two fierce redpainted Deva kings In the first        courtyard is the stable which houses the shrines sacred white horse        the carved panel above the door is the famous group of three        monkeysHear no evil see no evil speak no evil  that has        become a symbol of Nikko the logo on virtually every souvenir At the        far end of the courtyard is the Kyozo Sutra Library which houses        some  Buddhist scriptures in a huge revolving bookcase        As you approach a second set of stone steps you see on the        right a belfry and a tall bronze candelabrum on the left is a drum        tower and a bronze revolving lantern The two bronzes were presented in        the midth century by the Dutch government in gratitude for the        special exemption that gave them exclusive trading privileges with        Japan during the period of national seclusion Off to the left is the        Yakushido a temple honoring the manifestation of the Buddha as healer        of illnesses        At the top of the steps is the twostory Yomeimon the        Gate of Sunlightthe triumphal masterpiece of Toshogu rightly        declared a National Treasure This is the ultimate expression of the        opulent Momoyama style inspired by Chinese Ming sculpture and        architecture Ivorywhite and  m  ft high its columns beams        and cornices are carved with a menagerie of dragons phoenixes lions        and tigers in a field of clouds peonies Chinese sages and angels        all gilded and painted in red gold blue and green To the right and        left of the gate there are paneled galleries also carved and painted        with a motifs from nature pine and plum trees birds of the field and        waterfowl        Inside the gate to the left is the Mikoshigura a        storeroom for the portable shrines that grace the semiannual Toshogu        Festival processions  May and  October To the right is the        Kaguraden a hall where ceremonial dances are performed to honor the        godsand where for a modest fee couples can have Shinto wedding        ceremonies performed complete with flutes and drums and shrine maidens        to attend them        Opposite the Yomeimon across the courtyard is the Karamon        Chinese Gate the official entrance to the inner shrine This        structure like Yomeimon is also a National Treasure and just as        ornately carved and painted The walls on both sides of this gate        enclose the honden main hall of the shrine        The entrance is to the right Here you remove your shoes        lockers are provided to visit the outer part of the hall called the        haiden oratory You may not proceed further than this for at the far        end of the oratory are the naijin inner chamber and nainaijin        innermost chamber where the spirit of Ieyasu is enshrined With him        are two other worthy companions Toyotomi Hideyoshi Ieyasus mentor        and the great thcentury warrior Minamoto no Yoritomo who founded        the Kamakura shogunateand whom Ieyasu claimed as an ancestor        The tour next takes you to another Toshogu icon the famous        Gate of the Sleeping Cat The cat itself on a small panel above the        entrance is said to have been sculpted by Hidari Jingoro a legendary        master carver of the Tokugawa period From here a flight of  stone        steps takes you up through a wonderful forest of cedars to Ieyasu        Tokugawas tomb The climb is worth making if only for the view the        trees and a cool rushing stream The tomb itself a miniature bronze        pagoda that houses the great shoguns ashes is nothing special        A short walk west from Toshogu itself is surely the oldest        of the institutions on this holy ground Futarasan Jinja is a Shinto        shrine founded in the th century to honor the deity        OkuninushinoMikoto God of the Ricefields his consort and their        son In one corner of the enclosure is a bronze lantern some  m         ft high the deep nicks in the bronze were made by guards on duty at        the shrine who believed that the lantern transformed itself into a        goblin at night Such was the incredible cutting power of the Japanese        swordembellished perhaps a bit by Japanese superstition        Iemitsu who was Ieyasus grandson and the third Tokugawa        shogun  undertook the building of Toshogu He has his own        resting place here at Daiyuin to the west of Futarasan Smaller in        scale Daiyuin is in fact the more impressive mausoleum set on a        forested hillside and approached by three flights of stone stairs and        five decorative gates The most impressive of these at the top of the        stairs is the Yashamon SheDemon Gate so named for the figures in        its four alcoves The sanctum of the shrine designated a National        Treasure has a gilded and lacquered altar some  m nearly  ft        high where a seated wooden figure of Iemitsu looks down upon his        mighty works        Lake Chuzenji        The waterfalls and forested hills of the Nikko National        Park area are a welcome respite to the monumentality of Tokugawa        architecture Even if you are here only on a daytrip you should take        the km mile bus ride up the spectacular winding Irohazaka        Highway to Chuzenji Better yet take a cab and tell the driver to stop        at Akechidaira the halfway point The view of Mt Nantai  m         ft and the valley below is magnificent        Lake Chuzenji at  m  ft above sea level was        made eons ago when a nowdormant volcano erupted and blocked the river        courses creating two cataracts The m ft Kegonnotaki at the        south end is the countrys most famous waterfall An elevator takes        sightseers to an observation platform in the gorge below The falls are        especially impressive after a summer rain when the sunshine produces a        single or even double rainbow in the spray In the winter the falls        form a spectacular cascade of icicles At the gorges north end        Ryuzunotaki Dragons Head Falls is broader but not as high it        has the additional merit of a teahouse where you can sit and watch the        water tumble into the lake        Famous for its rainbow trout Chuzenji is too cold for        swimming most of the year but visitors throng to this area for its        spectacular spring and fall scenery and for its numerous hot springs        resorts The most impressive historical monument on the eastern shore        of the lake is Chuzenji a subtemple of Toshogus Rinnoji The temple        enshrines a m ft standing figure of Kannon the Goddess of        Mercy said to have been carved more than  years ago from the        trunk of a single Judas tree        Yokohama        Situated  km  miles southwest of Tokyo Yokohama        was an unimportant little fishing village until  when Japans long        centuries of selfimposed isolation came to an end Foreign diplomats        traders and missionaries were at last able to enter the country But        the unrest they inspired prompted the Tokugawa government to move them        all here to a guarded compound on the village flatsostensibly to        guarantee their safety but more importantly to contain the        contamination of their uncouth ways and ideas        The ploy worked well enough until the Meiji Restoration        when those Western ideas were needed to modernize the country In         Y okohama became an international port and the burgeoning        international community quickly spread beyond its confinement to the        high ground still known today as the Bluff In  Japans first        railway went into service between Yokohama and Tokyo and the city        began to flourish        The two cities have twice shared the same destructive fate        The great Kanto earthquake of  destroyed some  homes in        Yokohama and took over  lives The next twenty years of        reconstruction and growth were wiped out overnight in May  when        American bombers leveled nearly half the city The harbor was hastily        restored during the Korean War and today is one of the busiest and most        important trading ports in the world        With a population of some three million Yokohama no longer        sits in Tokyos shadow In many respects in fact it is the more        cosmopolitan city preferred by many residents of the greater        metropolitan area as a place to live and work If you are on a short        visit to Japan your excursion time might be better spent elsewhere        But Yokohamas great waterfront port redevelopment project museums        and restaurants should still keep it high on your list        The Japan Railways KeihinTohoku line takes about         minutes from Tokyo to Sakuragicho Station in Yokohama the faster        shinkansen leaves you off at ShinYokohama on the outskirts of the        city From Sakuragicho its a short walk to the waterfront which is        still referred to by its old name the Bund and to the South Pier and        Yamashita Park Here you can take a tour of the harbor on one of the        sightseeing launches moored near the ship Hikawamaru now retired from        service It carried passengers between Yokohama and Seattle for some        thirty years in summer it has a pleasant beer garden on the upper        deck        At the entrance to the South Pier is the ninestory Silk        Center Building The Silk Museum on the second floor with its        collection of kimono and exhibits of the silkmaking process evokes        the period when Yokohama was the hub of that industry On the first        floor are the main offices of the Yokohama International Tourist        Association        For a birdseye view of the harbor take the elevator to        the observation deck of the m ft Marine Tower The beacon        atop the tower gives it a claim of being the tallest lighthouse in the        world it also has an interesting oceanographic museum        The Minato Mirai  project launched in the mids was        intended to turn a huge tract of neglected waterfront north and east of        Sakuragicho into a model city of the future integrating business        exhibition and leisure facilities The centerpiece of the project is        the story Landmark Tower Yokohamas tallest building its        observation deck affords a spectacular view of the city and the Bay        Bridge especially at night        Nearby is the Yokohama Museum of Art designed by Tange        Kenzo and housing works by both Western and Japanese artists including        Picasso Braque Kandinsky Kishida Ryusei and Yokoyama Taikan On the        waterfront itself is Nipponmaru Memorial Park where pride of place        goes to the threemasted sailing ship popularly called the Swan of the        Pacific  Now a training vessel it is open to visitors on guided        tours        Yokohamas Chinatown a few minutes walk from Japan        Railways Kannai Station in the center of the city is the largest in        Japan Its narrow alleys are crowded with shops selling foodstuffs        spices herbal medicines cookwarein fact anything that China        exports The restaurants needless to say are wonderful        Fashionable upbeat Yokohama is centered in two areas One        is Bashamichi HorseCarriage Street running from Kannai Station to        the waterfront The street acquired its name in the th century when        it was laid out for the vehicles of the citys Western residents a        more recent redesign evokes that era with red brick sidewalks and        imitation gas lampsbut the boutiques along the street are        uptotheminute The other area extends from Ishikawacho Station to        Motomachi and the International Cemetery Motomachi was the first area        developed in the Meiji period to serve Western shoppers and it has        kept pace with the movements of fashion ever since        The International Cemetery established in  is the        last resting place of some  foreigners of  different        nationalities who lived and died in Yokohama Behind it is the Yamate        Shiryokan a small museum of materials about the citys thcentury        European population Just up the hill at this end of Motomachi is        Harbor View Park where the views at nightwhen Yamashita Park and        the harbor are floodlitare especially fine        The last mustsee in Yokohama is Sankeien originally the        estate of wealthy silk merchant and art connoisseur Hara Tomitaro who        opened his garden to the public in  At great expense he        transferred here a number of important thcentury buildings that once        belonged to the Tokugawa family including the Rinshunkaku villa and        the charming Choshukaku tea pavilion as well as a small temple from        Kyotos famed Daitokuji Sankeien is a special delight from February        though early April when the plum and cherry trees blossom        Kamakura        Kamakura less than an hour south of Tokyo by train was        the seat of Japans first military government The Kamakura shogunate        was founded late in the th century after a long and bloody rivalry        between two noble factions over control of the imperial court The        victorious Minamoto clan chose Kamakura as its headquarters because        this fishing villagegirded on three sides by steep wooded        hillswas a natural fortress Here they created what most of us        envision as the Way of the Samurai the values codes religion and        culture of a warrior caste that would rule Japan for  years        Much of that culture was inspired by the Rinzai sect of Zen        Buddhism and its sense of discipline and selfcontrol its austere        philosophy of art and life The shogunate founded great numbers of Zen        temples in Kamakura Many are still standing and some are registered        as National Treasures From the Japan Railways station at Kita North        Kamakura about an hour from Tokyo on the Yokosuka line you can easily        reach six of these temples        Engakuji founded in  became the second most important        in the group of monasteries called the Gozan Five Mountains a        hierarchy established in the th century for the Zen temples under the        official patronage of the shogunate Engakuji is Kamakuras largest        temple complex often wracked by fire and earthquake  of the        original  buildings have survived Two of these are registered as        National Treasures the shariden hall of holy relics built in         and the huge belfry on the hill above The bell some  m  ft        tall was cast in  The principle building open to the public at        Engakuji is the butsunichian ceremonial hall where visitors can take        part in a tea ceremony        Nearby is Tokeiji familiarly known as the Divorce        Temple which was unique as a sanctuary for the women of the warrior        caste seeking an escape from unhappy marriages If the victim managed        to make her way here and stay for three years as a nun she could        obtain a decree of divorce from the shogunate and go free The        homotsukan treasure house of Tokeiji has a collection of        Kamakuraperiod paintings sculpture and calligraphy some of which        are registered as Important Cultural Objects Also on the grounds is        the Matsugaoka Bunko a research library established in memory of DT        Suzuki  who pioneered the study of Zen Buddhism in the        West        South of Tokeiji on the way to Kamakuras center are        Meigetsuin and Jochiji Zen temples with especially fine gardens        Still farther south is Kenchoji founded in  the foremost of the        Five Mountains  It was modeled on one of the great Chinese        monasteries of the time and built for a Chinese monk who was said to        have interceded with the dreaded Kublai Khan to stop the Mongol        invasion of Japan Kenchoji is still an active monastery like many of        the temples in Kamakura it offers visitors the opportunity to take        part in Zen meditation training sessions Nearby Ennoji boasts a        remarkable group of sculptures representing Enma the Lord of Hell and        his judges        Sightseeing in Kamakura        In Kamakura proper dont miss Tsurugaoka Hachimangu the        shrine complex built by Yoritomo no Minamoto the first Kamakura        shogun It was dedicated to the legendary Emperor Ojin from whom        Yoritomo claimed descent As part of the midSeptember festival at this        shrine there is a spectacular tournament of archery on horseback        yabusame in which contestants dressed in the costume of        Kamakuraperiod huntsmen must hit a series of three small wooden        targets as they come down a narrow course at full gallop The spacing        between the targets gives the rider just barely enough time to drop the        reins notch and fire an arrow and regain control of his mount        On the grounds of the shrine are two museums The Kamakura        Municipal Museum of Modern Art houses a collection of Japanese oil        paintings watercolors wood block prints and sculptureThe Kokuhokan        National Treasure Museum has a fine collection of objects from        various Kamakura temples and shrines including some excellent        thcentury paintings        A short walk east from Hachimangu is the tomb of        Yoritomoan exceedingly plain and modest affair compared with the way        a later dynasty of shoguns chose to immortalize themselves at Nikko In        many ways Yoritomo was a lessthanadmirable figure in Japanese        history but you still might want to stop at this little mosscovered        stone pagoda to pay your respects        If for nothing else Yoritomo earns our admiration for his        determination to create a Seated Buddha for his capital to rival the        huge bronze figure made in  for Todaiji temple in Nara That idea        bore fruit in  with the casting of the ton Daibutsu in the        courtyard of Kotokuin templeafter Mr Fuji probably the most        photographed icon of Japan The massive seated figure  m  ft        high sits in the classical pose of the Amida Buddha Compassionate        One his hands resting in his lap the thumbs touching the palms and        the eyes halfclosed in an expression of profound serenity The statue        is hollow and you can climb a staircase inside to look out through a        window between the Buddhas shouldersA temple was originally built to        house the figure but this structure was destroyed in a tidal wave in         For the five centuries since then the Buddha has been dispensing        his benevolence to visitors in the open air        The Daibutsu and Kotokuin temple are in Hase the district        in the western part of Kamakura The other major attraction here is        Hasedera In the Kannon Hall of this temple is the largest wooden        devotional figure in the country a statue of the ElevenFaced Goddess        of Mercy some  m  ft high carved from a single tree trunk and        covered in gold leaf The  smaller heads in her crown symbolize her        ability to search in all directions for those in need of compassion No        one knows for certain when the figure was carved one legend dates it        to the early th century The Amida Hall of Hasedera houses the image        of a seated Amida Buddha endowed by Minamoto no Yoritomo when he was        a particularly unlucky age according to popular Japanese belief        Yoritomos piety bought him a little more time to enjoy his success he        was  when he was thrown by a horse and died of his injuries        Ryukoji Temple and Enoshima Island        Kamakura history was not shaped by the Minamoto clan alone        No account of this area would be complete without the story of Nichiren         the monk who founded the only native Japanese sect of        Buddhism Nichirens defiance of both Zen and Jodo Pure Land        Buddhism eventually persuaded the shogunate to order him beheaded on a        hill to the south of Hase However legend says that just as the        executioner raised his sword a lightning bolt struck and broke it in        two Before he could try again a messenger arrived with an order        commuting Nichirens sentence to exile on the island of Sadogashima        Later in  the Nichiren sect built the Ryukoji temple on the same        hill        On the nearby Sagami bayshore are Yuigahama and        Shichirigahama two of the beaches closest to the metropolitan area In        the hot humid summer months it can feel as if the entire population of        Tokyo and Yokohama is here searching in vain for a vacant patch of        sand Equally popular is Enoshima the little island just offshore        with a hill in the middle that affordson clear daysa fine view of        Mt Fuji and the Izu Peninsula        Hakone        Hakone is a national park and resort area southeast of Mt        Fuji extremely popular with weekend trippers from Tokyo Just         minutes by train from the city this area makes a very pleasant        daytrip But to enjoy more of the countryside you can stay overnight        and continue down the Izu Peninsula the next day        Even if you have a Japan Railpass we suggest that you        invest in the allinclusive Hakone Free Pass offered by the Odakyu        Railway This entitles you to a roundtrip train ticket from Shinjuku to        Gora connecting with the funicular railway up into the mountains to a        cable car You then swing across the volcanic Owakudani valley and down        the other side for a boat cruise across Lake Ashi to Hakonemachi From        there you can take a bus still on the same pass along the Sumiko        River to Odawara and then back by train to Tokyo        Among the many attractions of this excursion is the Hakone        Open Air Museum Chokoku no mori or Forest of Sculptures at        Miyanoshita Established in  the museum rejoices in a wonderfully        designed and landscaped mountain setting Here the works of such        Western sculptors as Moore Arp Calder and Giacometti share the        garden space with those of Shimizu Takashi Takamura Kotaro and other        Japanese artists The exhibits are chosen for their resistance to the        elements and the museum is as lovely in winter as it is in summer        Visitors stop here on the way to the little town of Gora        to catch the cable car to Sozan and from there the gondola ride up into        the mountains and across the smoking sulfurous Owakudani valley        Theres a stop en route where you can visit the Owakudani Natural        Science Museum which has some uninspiring audiovisual presentations        of volcanic eruptions Down in the basement is the really interesting        display an array of seismographs busily recording the movement of the        vast tectonic plates deep below        Ride the next cable car to the shore of Lake Ashi where        excursion cruisers leave from the piers at Togendai for the minute        ride to Hakonemachi on the other side of the lake On a good day the        reflection of Mt Fuji in these clear blue waters is breathtaking In        early August the resorts on the lakeshore sponsor the dramatic Torii        Matsuri festival when a great wooden arch is set alight and a thousand        burning lanterns are sent floating out across the water        In the Tokugawa period Hakonemachi was an important town        on the Tokaido the only highway through this mountainous area between        the imperial court in Kyoto and the shogunal capital in Edo The        shogunate always suspicious of people on the move maintained a system        of garrisons along the road and no one went through without an        official pass The checkpoint here called the Hakone Sekisho is an        exact replica of the original with a small museum of period costumes        and weapons The surrounding area is well known for its inns and        thermal baths and for its Hakonezaiku woodcrafts with inlaid mosaic        and marquetry        Izu Peninsula        The jumpingoff point for this popular vacation area is        the town of Atami about an hour from Tokyo on the shinkansen        superexpress train The Izu Peninsula is blessed with a sunny climate        fine beaches picturesque little fishing ports andperhaps more to        the pointsome of the countrys best hot springs resorts        Two of the resort towns are of special interest to        Westerners Ito about  km  miles south of Atami on the east        coast is a spa with some  thermal springs and good surf swi mming        along its beautiful rugged coast The nearby Omurasan Park has         cherry trees with different varieties blooming at different times of        year Historically Ito was home for five years to William Adams the        Englishman shipwrecked on the shores of Kyushu in the early th        century who became an advisor to Tokugawa Ieyasu For his knowledge of        seafaring he was given the title anjin pilot At Ieyasus command        Adams the model for the hero of James Clavells novel Shogun set up a        shipyard in Ito and built Japans first two Europeanstyle oceangoing        vessels There is a monument to Adams at the mouth of the Okawa River        and the Anjin Festival is held in his honor every August        Shimoda at the southern tip of the peninsula is famous        in still another historical context It was off the coast here that        Commodore Matthew Perry ordered by the US government to open        diplomatic relation with Japan by force if necessary anchored his        fleet of black ships The shogunate bowed to the pressure and agreed to        accept American diplomat Townsend Harris who established the first US        consulate at Gyokusenji temple in Shimoda in  Two years later at        nearby Ryosenji temple negotiations resulted in the first USJapan        Treaty of Amity and Commerce The monument to Perry and Harris not far        from the harbor celebrates these epochal events as does Shimodas        annual Kurobune Matsuri Black Ship Festival in May        In fact charming though it still is today as a fishing        port and yacht harbor Shimoda was worthless from the commercial or        diplomatic perspective The shogunate had simply stuck Harris there to        keep the dreaded Westerners away from the capital Later he negotiated        the opening of Yokohama as a trading port and foreign settlement Such        was the subsequent dismay among reactionary factions at this sign of        weakness that the Tokugawa shogunate was soon overthrown        Mt Fuji        Most of the worlds national symbolsthe Statue of        Liberty the Eiffel Tower the Kremlin the Great Wallare manmade        Japans is a phenomenon of nature And yet in its near perfect        symmetry the cone of Mt Fuji snowcapped even in summer is so        exquisitely formed that it seems more like the work of an infinitely        patient landscape artist than a volcanic accident The solitary        majestic peak rises  m  ft into the heavens It is in a        word simply beautiful Here more than in any temple garden or ancient        castle ground you can appreciate why the Japanese prefer to blur the        distinction between nature and art        The volcanos name is thought to derive from an Ainu word        for fire  Fujisan last erupted in  and today only an        occasional puff of steam breaks through its crust the fitful snore of        a sleeping giant Graciously it remains dormant for the sake of the        hundreds of thousands of visitors who come every year to climb to the        summit        For some the climb is an act of piety the mountain is        revered as the abode of Japans ancestral gods For others the climb        is an exercise in selfdiscipline and physical purification Still        others come out of no particular religious impulse on holiday making        the ascent mainly to be able to say theyve done it and        leavingalmost in spite of themselveswith a profound sense of        spiritual uplift No travel brochure can make Mt Fuji a clich nor        can the most jaded of world travelers remain immune        Most visitors begin their climb at Kawaguchi Lake in the        resort area north of the mountain getting that far by train from Tokyo        in about two hours The official climbing season is  July to         August although mountain huts at each of the ten stations on the        various routes of ascent are open from April to midNovember Climbing        out of season especially in wet weather is not recommended but        people do it all the time        From Kawaguchi you take a local bus to Gogome Fifth        Station on the north face to start the fivehour hike to the

region is essentially the heart of the nation        While Tokyo usually provides the first glimpse of modern        Japans many strange contrasts it is to Kyoto and Nara that visitors        with even a passing interest in Japanese history and culture come to        peel back the layers of centuries Although Kyoto is internationally        renowned as the countrys de facto cultural capital nearby Nara was        the first important home of the imperial court and still boasts many of        Japans most important temples and shrines        IseShima National Park is the supreme sanctuary

      The city has a unique place in the Japanese national        identity and onethird of Japans entire population is estimated to        visit the city each year Despite this in many ways Kyoto is a        surprisingly typical modern Japanese city with the usual nondescript        concrete buildings along with the remarkable pockets of culture and        beauty        For a thousand years Kyoto served as the cultural and        spiritual capital of Japanese civilization the home of its revered        emperors after the Nara period from the end of the th century up to        the Meiji Restoration in the lateth century The imperial rulers        moved the capital to Kyoto originally to escape from the growing        domination of the Buddhist authorities of Nara In the new capital

originally known as Heiankyo Capital of Peace the name given to        the golden Heian era between the tenth and th centuries During this        time Kyoto thrived as Japans cultural and creative heartland But the        citys fortunes turned during the Warring States period         which was finally ended by the unifying warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi        in the midth century        In many ways the city has never recovered from Hideyoshis        subsequent decision to move the national capital from Kyoto to Edo now        Tokyo in the early sa blow compounded by the young Emperor        Meiji shifting the imperial household to Tokyo in  But Kyoto has        nevertheless remained the repository of the nations noblest cultural        pursuits and architectural legacy        Kyotos

allow a daily        ration of a couple of major temples a museum and a strolling garden        or two than to cram everything into a short time leaving only a blur        of each and a lasting

       now house a dozen affiliated temples and monasteries The great gate at        the main entrance was built in  and became notorious as the site        where a robber named Goemon Ishikawa was boiled alive in an iron        cauldron while holding his son aloft to save him from the same fate        Since then oldfashioned Japanese iron bathtubs have been gruesomely        known as goemonburo  The view from atop the m ft gate        provides a fine overall view of the temple grounds and sacred Mt Hiei        to the north The temples truly unique feature is the large redbrick        aqueduct behind the main buildings which still carries water from Lake        Biwa and is a popular strolling route for local residents        Not far from Nanzenji is the wonderful Eikando an        exquisite temple set against the hillside Its beautiful Amida Buddha        statue is unusually turning to look back over its shoulder Its        strange posture commemorates a legendary statue that

on the        crown of its head and  arms extravagantly known as a thousand        arms wielding bells wheels and lotus flowers However        Sanjusangendos main wonder is its legion of  gilded Kannon images        flanking the central Buddha The identical statues were carved by the        thcentury masters Kokei Unkei and Tankei ably aided by         assistants        Ukyo and Kita        These districts on the west and north sides of Kyoto are        home to most of the citys major temples set within the surrounding        greenery and mountains that prompted the Emperor Kammu to

       arrive Kyoto offers few more memorable experiences than secluded        contemplation of Ryoanjis enigmatic rock garden        Beyond the rock garden you can walk among the maples and        pines of the forest surrounding the lovely Kyoyochi Pond at the foot of        Mt Kinugasa Thick luxuriant moss thrives throughout        From Ryoanji a minute stroll or a short bus ride takes        you to Kinkakuji Japans famous Temple of the Golden Pavilion  The        original latethcentury pavilion completely covered in gold leaf        was typical of the unrestrained opulence of the Muromachi period        favored by Shogun Yoshimitsu Ashikaga who had it built for his        retirement at the ripe old age of  It was burned down by a fanatical        young monk in  rebuilt in  as an exact replica of the original        structure and renovated in  with a brand new goldfoil covering        Most of its buildings are closed to the public but you pass an        attractive

friend and patron Rikyu apparently        incurred the warlords wrath by placing a statue of himself in the        large main gate under which Hideyoshi would have had to passan        intolerable affront to a famously proud warrior        To the south is Kitano Temmangu a large and important        shrine Temmangu shrines around the country typically feature statues        of seated cows and bulls believed to have healing properties You will        always see someone rubbing the part of a statue corresponding to an        afflicted area in the hope of relief from pain and worry The shrine is        also known for its thousands of plum trees whose deep pink blooms draw        the crowds in the weeks preceding the annual cherry blossom frenzy But        the real crowds descend on the th

latter was built by Shogun Ieyasu        Tokugawa to split and counteract the powerful influence of        NishiHonganji which had attracted thousands of followers with its        freewheeling Buddhism it allowed priests to marry and have children        permitted the eating of meat and renounced traditional ascetic        practices        Most of HigashiHonganji is closed to the public but the        main hall and founders hall rebuilt in  after repeated fires are        notable for the rather gross ropes of human hair fashioned from        donations by female worshippers to haul the temples pillars into        position There is much more to see in nearby NishiHonganji an        outstanding example of Japanese Buddhist monumental architecture        combining a bold dramatic silhouette with rich ornamentation The        thcentury buildings owe much of their splendor to the structures        brought here from Hideyoshis opulent Fushimi Castle on the south side        of

temples        The sunset reflection of the twin pagodas of Yakushiji in        a nearby lake is one of Japans most striking and visually poetic        images Of the original buildings only the Toto East Pagoda        remains considered by many to be Japans most beautiful pagoda        Although it appears to have six stories the pagoda is actually a        threestory structure each level having an extra roof for added visual        impact The vermilion Saito West Pagoda was built in  on the        site of the longdestroyed original Between them is the Kondo golden        or main hall

 medicine chest between Bodhisattvas of the sun and moon        A tenminute walk to the north is Toshodaiji which boasts        rare examples of ancient architecture and sculpture Less spectacular        than its expensively restored neighbor to the south Toshodaiji        nevertheless is the largest remaining example of Nara period        architecture Of its numerous period sculptures the most celebrated is        a m ft thousandarmed Kannon statue        Every culture has a single historical hero a visionary        credited with planting the seeds from which cultural aesthetic and        ethical values flourished For Japan that person is the revered Prince        Shotoku early champion of Buddhism Not only did this highly        progressive leader produce Japans first written constitution and legal        code thus laying the foundations of an organized state he is also        credited with having introduced the concept of wa harmony as the        fundamental value shaping the Japanese character His life and        achievements are celebrated at Horyuji a large temple complex in        southern Nara comprising forty buildings that became Japans first        UNESCO World Heritage Site Horyuji was actually built decades after        Prince Shotokus death in  However it stands on the site of one of        Japans earliest Buddhist temples which he built        After entering through the Nandaimon Great South Gate        walk down another long walkway to the Chumon Central Gate and the        inner temple grounds Just past the fearsome Guardian Kings on watch        for intruding evil is the Saiin the western compound This contains        Horyujis fivestoried pagoda and the Kondo main hall built around         and the worlds oldest wooden building Within the Toin eastern        compound is the octagonal Yumedono Hall of Dreams whose exquisite        Guze Kannon statue was considered so sacred that it was completely        hidden from human eyes from its dedication in  until  when it        was unwrapped by a visiting American art scholarwith the Meiji        governments blessing of course        Also in the eastern compound is the Daihozoden Great        Treasure Hall housing Horyujis magnificent collection of Buddhist        art among Japans finest Included are over  items  of        which are classified as national treasures or important cultural        assets Highlights include an Indianstyle Shaka triad the Yumechigae        Dream Changing Kannon said to transform its worshippers        nightmares into pleasant dreams and the Kudara Kannon a graceful        willowy statue named after a region in Korea whose designer and        creator was almost certainly Korean Horyuji was built by craftsmen        imported from Korea and the temple bears much of their distinctive        artistic stamp        Surprisingly Horyuji also contains a building dedicated        to a foreigner Langdon Warner a Harvard art professor whom the        Japanese have mistakenly credited with saving both Nara and Kyoto from        aerial bombing during World War II The decision to spare them was        actually taken by Henry Stimson the US Secretary of War who knew the        cities from his own prewar visits        Osaka        More than just Japans second city Osaka is also the        perfect base from which to explore nearby Nara and Kyoto by train        Although Osaka is overshadowed by Tokyo in the bigcity stakes it is a        vibrant and energetic world capital in its own right and certainly has        plenty to offer the curious visitor        Indeed for many visitors Osaka is more truly Japanese        than Tokyo having a more distinctive flavor and character than its        sprawling rival to the east Osakans pride themselves on being warmer        friendlier and more spontaneous than their Tokyo cousins whom they        love to dismiss as formal and uptight They are also renowned        throughout Japan for two things doing business and eating        Here business and pleasure are inextricably linkedand        have been for hundreds of years The citys commercial reputation        reflects its origins as the national merchants capital and a major        trading hub When Hideyoshi built his main castle in the center of        Osaka after unifying the country in  the citys prosperity seemed        written in stone With an uninhibited merchant class eager to throw its        newly acquired wealth around Osaka quickly became Japans undisputed        entertainment and theatrical center        Despite the economic slowdown and recession of the s        that followed the bursting of Japans economic bubble anyone strolling        around central Osakas famous nighttime entertainment districts will        quickly realize how much its residents love to eat drink and party        In fact so dedicated are Osakans to the cult of eating that they are        known for kuidare eating until you drop or until you go bankrupt        depending on the interpretation        Osaka will win no urban beauty contests but there are        plenty of sights to see here including a couple of interesting        museums a remarkable aquarium and an underground shopping complex        that might be the worlds largest        The best way to see Osaka is by subway Taxis are        expensive and vulnerable to the citys sticky traffic situation and        information on the touristunfriendly bus service is almost entirely in        Japanese only An allday subway pass available at any ticket machine        costs the equivalent of less than four centralarea subway tickets        about US        A good place to start exploring is the bustling Umeda        area containing Japan Railways Osaka Station three subway stations        and two private railway stations It also has most famous department        stores outside Tokyo the gigantic Hankyu and Hanshin buildings whose        private railways serve Kyoto and Kobe The Osaka City Tourist        Information Office is just inside the main entrance to the Hankyu        station Umeda marks the northern end of the business and entertainment        district popularly known as Kita meaning simply North and is the        very essence of modern Osakas hustle and bustle        At rush hour Umedas teeming subway platforms rival the        crowd scenes for which Tokyos subway is so notorious Equally        impressive crowd scenes occur below Umeda in a mammoth network of        shops bars and cozy inexpensive restaurants whose scale boggles the        mind The basement of every large building in a onemile radius is        linked to form a modern commercial labyrinth It actually comprises        several shopping centers seamlessly interconnected to ensure maximum        customer and cash turnover To explore its fascinating subterranean        sights start with the Whity Umeda under the Hankyu and Hanshin        buildings then move on to Herbis Plazabut dont expect to see        daylight again for some time        A suitable cure for your extended period underground is to        go up stories up to the top of ShinUmeda Sky Building This        futuristic and unusual structure is actually two glassandsteel towers        linked at the top from which the Floating Observatory provides a        panoramic view of Osaka city and the surrounding countryside        Shopping arcades are a staple feature of every Japanese        city town and village Unsurprisingly Osaka boasts some of Japans        most impressiveor excessive depending on your taste You can spend        fascinating hours exploring the covered Hankyu Higashidori arcade near        the Hankyu stations less upmarket but no less fascinating than the        more famous Shinsaibashi arcade see below In the south of Kita        across from the US Consulate is Kita Shinchi Osakas premiere dining        and entertainment quarter centered around the main street of Shinchi        Hondori This area is great for peoplewatching but to eat here it        helps to have a generous expense account        The Mint is situated on the west bank of the Dojima River        opposite Sakuranomiya Park Although its museum has a large        exhibition of the history of Japanese and foreign money it is best        known for its long avenue of magnificent lateblooming cherry trees        the citys finest        Just to the east of Sakuranomiya Park is the Fujita Art        Museum which has a fine collection of Chinese and Japanese paintings        from the th century to the present If youve become an adept of the        tea ceremony youll appreciate the excellent collection of        thcentury objects ceramic tea bowls tea kettles and caddies as        well as bamboo spoons whisks and flower vases        For more ceramics stop in at the Museum of Oriental        Ceramics located in the garden at one end of Nakanoshima the central        island in the middle of the large river running through Osakas        center Here you can find fine specimens of the Korean and Chinese        ceramics that so strongly influenced Japans own styles Most of        Osakas municipal buildings are on Nakanoshima including an elegant        Europeanstyle town hall dating from  one of the few redbrick        buildings in Japan        Here youll also get a splendid view of Osaka Castle        which is dramatically illuminated at night To celebrate his        unification of Japan after more than a century of civil war Hideyoshi        had made the castle the countrys greatest fortress so the Tokugawa        felt obliged to destroy it in  after snatching power away from        Hideyoshis heir They later rebuilt it to bolster their own prestige        only to burn it down once again in a fit of pique when the Meiji        Restoration of imperial power abolished their shogunate in  Today        a reinforcedconcrete replica reproduces only the great fivestoried        tower  m  ft high surrounded by moats and ivycovered        ramparts The castle contains an interesting but disappointingly modern        museum displaying armor weapons costumes and historical documents        Theres also an enchanting collection of bunraku puppetsa rare        chance to see them at close range        Providing a welcome touch of green amid all the asphalt        ginkgo and sycamore trees line the impressive Midosuji Boulevard This        thoroughfare runs south from Umeda to Kitas southern counterpart        Minami On one side of Midosuji is Americamura the favorite posing        ground for Osakas desperately trendy youth so named for the large        number of stores selling muchsoughtafter secondhand apparel imported        from the US        One block east of Midosuji is Osakas famous Shinsaibashi        shopping arcade a consumerfrenzy mecca second in national status only        to Ginza and Shinjuku in Tokyo If you have time for only one evening        walk in Osaka this is the one Although the arcade begins over a mile        north start from exit  of Shinsaibashi Station on the Midosuji subway        line between the Sogo and Daimaru department stores and turn right to        make your way south        Every night of the week this entire area is teeming with        businessman frequenting night clubs hostess bars and private drinking        clubs Many of these clubs are confusingly called snack bars  But        tourists beware These bizarre establishments are the true home of the         glass of beer with prices aimed squarely at lonely executives with        expense accounts looking for a home away from home         This is where Osakas trendy youth prowl for action as do        many of Osakas growing pack of young foreign residents seduced by the        lure of easy yen On Saturday afternoons and evenings the place is a        teeming throng of humanity Wandering the side streets at night allows        you to soak up the heady atmosphere of pleasure and commerce that has        characterized this part of Osaka for centuries        At the far south is the small Ebisu Bridge a favorite        meeting place for Osakas trendiest young things Just before you cross        the bridge on your left is an arch announcing the start of Soemoncho        a colorful street of latenight restaurants and night clubs that is        Minamis answer to KitaShinchi near Umeda Note the ultramodern        blackandchrome Kirin Plaza beer hall next to the entrance to bustling        Soemoncho        As you cross the bridge stop in the middle to immerse        yourself in the sights and sounds of the people the blazing neon and        the Dotomburi River below you Hundreds of years ago in Osakas heyday        as the countrys theater and entertainment capital the biggest stars        would arrive by boat to enter the riverside back entrances of the many        theaters on Dotomburi which is just south of the river Frenzied fans        would pack this very bridge for a glimpse of their idols arriving in        ornate medieval waterborne equivalents of the modern stretch        limousine        Turning left on the other side of the bridge brings you to        Dotomburi which at night is Osakas ultimate assault on the senses A        cornucopia of bizarre creatures adorn the buildings flanking this        pedestrian mall giant monsters slither down the buildings        restaurants cinemas theaters games centers and steamy noodle bars        No photograph can capture the intensity of this strange and        unforgettable concourse        At the other end of Dotomburi is the Nipponbashi area        This is where you will find DenDen Town Osakas sadly underwhelming        answer to Tokyos Akihabara electronics district Nipponbashi is also        famous as the national home of bunraku Japans dazzling traditional        puppet theater Although various forms of puppet theater date back to        the th century the remarkably expressive and elaborately costumed        bunraku style was thriving by the th century in both Osaka and Kyoto        Although its popularity waned during the Meiji period it has been        rediscovered this century the most dramatic evidence being the vast        investment in the National Bunraku Theater in Nipponbashi        Bunraku is a Japanese performance art of surprising        dramatic intensity worth seeing if only for an hour or so in the        middle of a busy day of sightseeing Although all dialog and narration        are in Japanese an English interpretation device or an English program        is always available Many of the most popular heroic and tragic dramas        were written by Osakas own Monzaemon Chikamatsu  the        playwright the Japanese claim as their own Shakespeare        In the neighboring Namba district the ShinKabukiza        Theater at the bottom of Midosuji Boulevard gives kabuki performances        only three weeks each year But theres plenty of other traditional        drama such as kyogen farces and manzai comic doubleacts In spring        the Osaka International Festival of drama and music takes place both at        the theater and in the Festival Hall on Nakanoshima Island Even if you        dont bother venturing within the building itself is dramatic and        should not be missed        Between the Nipponbashi and Namba districts try to find        nearby Doguyasuji Kitchen Street a narrow alley of restaurant        wholesalers This is the place to buy souvenirs of all the imitation        food youve seen in restaurant windows together with Japanesestyle        plates bowls glasses sake sets lacquerware giant paper lanterns        and a million other things you never expected to see for sale        South of Namba between Ebisucho and Tennoji stations is        the Tsutenkaku Tower a rather desperate imitation of the Eiffel Tower        and perhaps the only structure that makes Kyotos tower look        impressive The view from the observation deck over  ft up is        panoramic but hardly worth the effort        The nearby Osaka Municipal Art Museum near Tennoji        Station is worth visiting for its celebrated Abe Collection of         Chinese paintings ninthth centuries and its Ming and        Chingdynasty ceramics thth centuries The large permanent        encampment of homeless people around Tennoji Park makes the area more        than a little seedy but not at all dangerous        Close by is Osakas most famous temple Shitennoji        founded in  by the revered reforming lawgiver Prince Shotoku        Unfortunately the buildings in this large temple are concrete        reproductions of the originals destroyed by bombing in World War II        However the

features enjoyed by the        three million visitors who come to make prayer offerings on the first        three days of the New Year Although the shrine is thought to have been        founded in the third century the present buildings are relatively        recent reproductions        Finally Osaka Port at the far west of the city offers two        ideal distractions for all the family The futuristic Kaiyukan Aquarium        has at its core one of the worlds largest indoor tanks containing a        dramatic collection of sharks and other large deepsea fish Arranged        in a descending spiral around it are other tanks representing the        denizens of the Pacific Oceans seismic ring of fire         The aquarium is set in a large complex of unusual shops        and restaurants that also contains the Suntory Museum In addition to        regular art exhibitions this wildly abstract structure features        Osakas IMAX widescreen theater The entire area makes for a great        afternoons break from the pressures of Osaka sightseeing        Kobe        Kobe exploded onto the worlds headlines with the        suddenness of the earthquake that ravaged the city  January         claiming a final death toll of over  But a combination of        remarkable communal solidarity and determination coupled with extensive        private and publicsector investment lie behind a recovery that is        nothing short of astonishing        Hemmed into a narrow coastal strip between the Rokko        Mountains and the Inland Sea this port city came into its own after        American pressure forced Japan to open to foreign trade in  The        merchants who established a foothold in Kobe included large numbers of        Persians and Indian traders Today it is still known within Japan for        its small but highly visible foreign business community some of whose        families have called Kobe home for generations Kobe is a major        cosmopolitan center with thriving restaurants bars and nightlife not        to mention Nankinmachi Japans most famous Chinatown         One early influence of the foreign residents was the        development of the nationally famous Kobe beef in a country that had        never touched the stuff until foreign barbarians began demanding        steaks Although meat eating is now considered commonplace it is still        strongly associated with the cosmopolitan Western lifestyle that has        such allpervasive appeal in modern Japanese society Raised nearby in        Tajima or Tamba the cattle produce a uniquely fatty meat with a        special flavor said to come from a daily dose of strong beer The price        in the restaurants on Tor Road is exorbitant but you might like to try        the beef

districts are Sannomiya        and neighboring Motomachi both featuring large department stores and        fashionable boutiques Numerous smaller shops are in the Kokashita        arcade a long but narrow covered shopping passage beneath the JR        tracks that is definitely not for the claustrophobic        Kobes biggest tourist draw though is mainly of interest        to domestic Japanese visitors Kitano the old foreign merchants        residential district preserves some of the thcentury Europeanstyle        houses that survived World War II For foreign tourists the most        interesting thing about this area will probably be witnessing the        fascination these residences hold over Japanese visitors Kitanos        Hindu temple mosque and synagogue add to the exotic appeal of this        unusual area        Dominating the mountain range that provides Kobes        dramatic backdrop is Mt Rokko which offers a wide range of natural        and manmade attractions To escape the stifling heat of summer        everyone except the superfit takes the tenminute cable car ride to        the top Here you will discover a commanding view of Kobe Osaka Awaji        Island

hotspring resorts around the country        this small town has been the site of furious development and the many        small traditional inns ryokan and bathhouses are now dwarfed by        large ugly concrete hotels Nevertheless Arima Onsen still offers an        ideal introduction to the pleasures of bathing Japanesestyle whether        through a visit of a few hours to one of the large and luxuriously        equipped centers or a night spent in a traditional familyrun        hotspring inn        IseShima        IseShima National Park southeast of Osaka is home to        the Outer and Inner shrines of Ise These deceptively simple structures        are no less than the sacred repository of the national        identityShinto sanctuaries dedicated nearly  years ago to        Japans founding deities Their atmospheric setting in serene woodland        reveals more strongly than anywhere else the profound links between        modern Japan and its mythical origins Be forewarned for foreign        tourists Ise is not a destination for picturesque sightseeing and        there isnt really very much to see or photograph especially since        taking pictures of the Inner Shrine is forbidden Rather it provides        an opportunity to glimpse one key aspect of the very essence of a        society and people whose origins development and identity hold a        fascination for the rest of the world        While no more nor less significant than other countries        national symbols and icons the Shinto identity embodied in the shrines        of Ise is quite distinct from Japans other manmade institutions        Nature itself is the primal essence enshrined and worshipped at Ise as        implied by the carefully orchestrated approach to the sanctuaries past        the limpid Isuzu River and through the forest Although the sacred        structures represent the ultimate focus of the Shinto religion they        are dismantled and renewed every  yearsone of the most explicit        manifestations of the traditional Japanese belief in transience and        perpetual renewal        Both the Inner and Outer shrines comprise a main hall and        two treasure houses each enclosed within four fences Only members of        the imperial family and highranking priests are allowed past the        second of the four fences This restriction reinforces the notion of        the imperial family as living descendents and representatives of the        godsdespite the emperors renunciation of divinity announced as one        of the terms of surrender at the end of World War II when some people        literally fainted upon hearing the emperors voice on the radio for the        first time Indeed so sacred are the Ise shrines that despite the        relatively peaceful coexistence of Shinto and Buddhism in Japan        Buddhist monks and nuns were banned from entering the precincts prior        to the Meiji Restoration of         The shrines are most easily reached from Nagoya via the        Kintetsu Railway to UjiYamada Station In addition to the famo us        shrines you can explore more of this attractively scenic peninsula        with its national park the haunting image of the sacred wedded rocks        at Futamigaura beach and the resort town of Kashikojima at the        southern end of the Kintetsu railways Shima line        The Outer Shrine        A short walk from UjiYamada Station is Geku the Outer        Shrine It is dedicated to the God of the Earth who was sent down to        Japan by the Sun Goddess Amaterasu Originally situated near        presentday Kyoto the shrine was moved here in  The main entrance        takes you to the first sacred gateway torii which in Japan always        symbolizes the threshold of holy ground Both shrines surprisingly        primitive design is thought to be based on those of granaries and        storehouses from prehistoric times        As you walk along the avenue of pines and giant cedars        you pass on the right the Anzaisho the emperors rest house and        Sanshujo the rest house for the imperial family Beyond a second torii        is the Kaguraden Hall of the Sacred Dances In return for a donation        to the shrine the shrine maidens miko dressed in the typically        Shinto outfit of brightred pleated skirts with white blouses will        perform one of the dances The girls wield branches of the holy sakaki        tree and dance to an orchestra composed of wooden clappers hyoshigi        plucked zither koto mouth organ sho and the oboelike hichiriki        together with flute and drum        The avenue ends at the Gekus Shoden main shrine        building whichtogether with its eastern and western treasure        housesis enclosed by a series of four unvarnished wooden fences        This is where Shinto priests in white robes with black belts and black        lacquered clogs stand to bless worshippers as they make a silent        obeisance The Shoden itself is just  m  ft high a little less in        width and  m  ft long        Each shrine is constructed of plain unadorned Japanese        cypress wood brought especially from the Kiso Mountains in the Central        Alps northeast of Nagoya The style of the crossbeamed roofs and        simple wooden frames is the same as that used more than  years        ago before Chinese architecture exerted its influence when Buddhism        arrived here from Korea This is a special style of Shinto architecture        that is prohibited from being used at other shrines        The GekuJinen Sacred Park at the foot of Mt Takakura        is an integral part of the sanctuary and a beautiful place for a quiet        stroll In fact if you dont feel like taking the bus the walk to the        inner shrine takes you along a delightful treeshaded avenue lined with        stone lanterns        The Inner Shrine        The Naiku Inner Shrine is the more important of the two        shrines as it is dedicated to Amaterasu the Sun Goddess and supreme        deity of Shinto The Naiku holds the sacred eightpointed mirror        yatanokagami which is one of the three symbols of the imperial        throne The others are the sword which resides at the Atsuta Shrine        in Nagoya and the jewel kept in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo  The        Naikus layout and the construction of its Shoden are similar to those        of the Geku although the approach to the Naiku over the Uji Bridge        across the Isuzu River is more picturesque Like the shrines the        bridge is renewed every two decades        The ritual dismantling of the shrines every  years        known as sengushiki goes back to prehistoric times when sacred        structures tended to be erected for special ceremonies rather than as        permanent places of worship You will notice beside each shrine an area        of open ground on which the new shrine is to be erectedin in        identical form The structures are broken up into small pieces and        distributed to the faithful as talismans The whole process is both        painstaking and expensive and the democratization of the imperial        institutions since the emperor renounced his divinity means the shrines        rather than the state must now foot the bill To defray costs        worshippers must make a generous donation to receive a piece of the old        shrine        You can join the Japanese visitors down at the Isuzu        River where they perform a rite of purification by washing their        mouths with its clear fresh waters At the same time they play with        the fat red silver and black carp swimming around nearby        Wakayama        South of Osaka is Wakayama a large prefecture whose long        coastline and lush greenery have long been a magnet for domestic        tourists In addition to hundreds of temples shrines and hotspring        resorts Wakayama features some of the countrys most popular        beaches        Farther south is Koyasan the center of the Shingon branch        of esoteric Buddhism and one of Japans most important religious        enclaves Now comprising over  temple buildings as well as numerous        shrines pagodas and stupas this large religious settlement is        located at the top of Mt Koya a m ft peak Koyasan was        already known as a sacred site for ascetic practices when Kobo Daishi        a revered Buddhist priest teacher and scholar received imperial        permission to establish a religious community to develop his new        Shingon sect in         The mausoleum of the kukai great teacher as he is        known is located at the deepest reaches of Okunoin Japans most        famous cemetery and one of Koyasans biggest draws Once the kukai was        buried there the great and the humble alike were quick to see the        merit of a final resting place near the great teacher The graves of        hundreds of thousands from all walks of life now occupy the site with        the remains of emperors warlords warriors samurai and poets all        jostling for space Their tombs and stone markers range from the        ostentatious to the elegant the well preserved to the decrepit        Well over a million ancestorworshipping Japanese descend        on Koyasan and Okunoin on major public holidays especially those        commemorating the dead If you are wise enough to avoid these times        consider spending the night in one of some  temple lodgings shukubo        that offer surprisingly comfortable traditional accommodation to        visitors and travelers The main highlight of a stay at one of these        special temples is the chance to sample the luxurious Buddhist        vegetarian temple cuisine shojinryori served only in such lodgings        The path to enlightenment can indeed be surprisingly pleasurable        Chubu        The central region of Honshu Japans main island Chubu        stretches northeast from Kansai

steep gorges narrow terraced rice paddies and neatly        tailored tea plantations hugging the mountain slopes with not a square        inch of usable land wasted The train stops by riverside markets where        farmers trade fruit vegetables and gossip with passengers        Takayama is a town famous for its carpentersa        reputation going back to the great days of the imperial courts of Nara        and Kyoto With the harvests of its Hida mountain district too meager        to contribute taxes to the national treasury the town sent instead its        skillful artisans Hida no takumi to help build the temples and        palaces of the imperial capital Those skills have been handed down to        presentday craftsmen working in yew wood and the old timbered houses        are exquisitely maintained in traditional style The local lord in turn        borrowed the capitals grid pattern when laying out medieval Takayama        which became known as Little Kyoto

  Some of the old houses have been redeveloped as museums and eclectic        galleries        Just east of the riverside market are two merchants        houses Yoshijimake and Kusakabe Mingeikan the latter turned into a        superb folkcraft museum displaying local costumes woodcarvings and        the fine transparent lacquerware shunkeinuri that highlights rather        than conceals the grain

     crafts and scholarship It is home to a major university as well as an        arts and crafts college Kanazawa is still considered an archetypal        castle town even though the university now

Castle has opulent white walls and myriad        turrets These have earned it the nickname Shirasagi White Heron        Castle for the way its swooping whitegabled profile proudly soars        above this small city The castle dates from the early s When the        famous unifiers Nobunaga Hideyoshi and Tokugawa fought to end the        thcentury civil wars Hideyoshi used Himeji as a base of operations        against the recalcitrant warlords of Western Honshu Although much of        the castles interior seems dark and austere this highlights the        magnificent wood floors and

as the train pulls into Hiroshima        Station might well be surprise After all the very name Hiroshima        has become a modern metaphor the ultimate symbol of total        obliteration Yet

trying to imagine what        they were doing at am the instant of the atomic explosion that        reverberated around the world The movingly simple Peace Memorial        Museum documents the horror with charts models photographs videos        everyday objects transformed by the unimaginable heat of the blast and        a lifesized diorama portraying horribly burned victims One of the        most powerful exhibits is a single photograph a human shadow left        imprinted on the steps of the Sumitomo Bank at the moment of the        flash         The museum will surprise many visitors expecting a        victims account of one of this centurys most controversial decisions        yet the curators have gone to considerable lengths to document the        horror of atomic weapons and nuclear war in general driving toward the        inevitable conclusion that such weapons must never again be used        Outside the museum the Cenotaph contains the names of the         casualties

seen enough Japanese temples you        will certainly be moved by the striking beauty of the bright red        camphorwood arch of Itsukushima Shrine rising  m  ft out of the        sea in front of the low brilliant vermilion buildings themselves        raised above the water by stilts Founded as far back as the th        century the shrine is so sacred that until the fresh wind of reforms        instituted during the Meiji era beginning  pregnant women and the        seriously ill were carried to the mainland to ensure that no births or        deaths would occur on the island Mourners had to undergo  days of        purification before being allowed back on Miyajima While most such        religious laws have been relaxed burials are still not permitted        here        Still Miyajima

people take the ropeway the easily        negotiable trail leading to the top of m ft Mt Misen is an        invigorating hike The forest is lush and past the secluded Gumonjido        Buddhist temple the view from the top over the Inland Sea to Hiroshima        is a fine reward From the top of Mt Misen is one of the three finest        views in Japan        For such a small island Miyajima has much to offer But        stay until after the crowds depart in the late afternoon and early        evening To take in the sight of the great shrine against the glorious        setting sun spend the

the scene If the        tide is out walk down to the base of the shrine to appreciate its        massive scale        Shikoku        Despite being Shikoku islands largest town Matsuyama is        a laidback place mainly serving as the shopping center for tourists        visiting the hot springs situated  km  miles away Dogo Spa is a        great place to try out a public bathhouse don your

receive a particularly warm        welcome The citizens are very proud of Ritsurin Park with its bizarre        twisted pines and strangely shaped boulders The folk art museum here        is worth a visit but also stop for a gracious tea ceremony at the        delightful Kikugetsutei pavilion Dont miss the pavilions little        rock garden a classic of the genre        A minute tram ride takes you out to the Yashima        peninsula formerly an island famed for the momentous battles in which        the Minamoto clan drove out their Taira rivals in  heralding the        countrys rule by military dictatorship for the next seven centuries        Today ruins of the Taira clans dwellings are still visible and        Yashimaji temple houses relics of the battles        Kyushu        Lying the farthest southwest of Japans four main islands        Kyushu has always set itself apart from the others Its climate is        distinctly Mediterranean and even subtropical at its southern tip and        its inhabitants are known for being friendlier more open and even        more Westernized than their compatriots in the rest of the country        Kyushu is also the most volcanic of Japans islands famous for its        flourishing hotspring resorts and several active volcanoes It is a        terrific place to explore if you have the time If you can afford the        bullet train just once this is your chance asin one exhilarating        sweepyou pass through almost all the major cities of Central and        Western Honshu on the way        Easily accessible from the Asian mainland via Korea        Kyushu has a longer history of significant contacts with foreigners        than any other part of Japan This was especially the case after it        found itself on the southern route taken by European merchants and        missionaries of the th century Indeed the famous port city of        Nagasaki served as Japans sole point of contact with the outside world        during  years of selfimposed isolation        Kyushu enjoys its special place in the national mythology        as the cradle of Japanese civilization despite the support of only a        meager amount of archeological evidence Legend tells of the Sun        Goddess Amaterasu sending her grandson to Mt Takachiho in central        Kyushu armed with the imperial mirror sword and jewel that Jimmu        Japans first emperor used on his conquest of the Yamato Plain near        Nara Modern historians version is rather less exotic Jimmu was        probably a pirate from Okinawa who settled in Kyushu before launching        his campaign to conquer Honshu        The islands next important historical encounter was with        the Mongols under Kublai Khan when Kyushu was the target of abortive        assaults in  and  The islanders heroic resistance admittedly        abetted by a timely typhoon kamikaze divine wind earned them a        formidable martial reputation The island proved to be the last bastion        of the samurai ideal when disenfranchised warriors launched the doomed        Satsuma Rebellion in their desperation to forestall the relentless        march of progress It was in Kagoshima that the Imperial Japanese Navy        was created from the nucleus of ships bought from the British at the        end of the th century        Portuguese merchants arrived in Kagoshima in  with        the missionaries of St Francis Xavier following close behind In        addition to becoming a center of Western trade Nagasaki provided a        firm foothold in Japan for the Catholic Churchtoday much revived        after  years of brutal suppression under the Tokugawa shoguns        Northern Kyushu        Fukuoka is Kyushus main commercial center where you can        tour the lively shopping district around the main station at Hakata        The delicate Hakataningyo dolls the towns specialty craft make        attractive gifts although as works of art for adults rather than toys        for children Bayside Place is a thriving nighttime eating and        entertainment district built alongside Hakata wharf in the old merchant        district with attractively illuminated sculptures adding to the        atmosphere Enthusiastic and adventurous eaters should also look out        for the numerous food stalls yatai found throughout the city        especially those offering Hakata ramen noodles famed throughout Japan        Otherwise Fukuoka mainly serves as the launching point for your        exploration of the bulk of Kyushu to the south        The first stop on the east coast is Beppuperhaps the        busiest and certainly the most intense spa town in Japan with a        permanent population of just  but about  million visitors a        year The Beppu district boasts eight different hotspring areas each        with different properties These include a hot waterfall at the        Shibaseki spring hot sand at Takegawara hot mud at Kannawa and        picturesque outdoor baths in hot ponds among the rocks of the aptly        named Hotta Hot Springs        Beppus most popular attractions are the openair hell        ponds around Kannawa which are alternately hilarious and dramatic In        the openair Umi Jigoku Ocean Hell you can buy eggs hardboiled in        a basket In Oniyama Jigoku Devils Mountain Hell a hundred        crocodiles enjoy a hot soak Chinoike Jigoku Blood Pool Hell is a        steaming pond turned bloodred by its iron oxide At the northern edge        of the district is Bozu Jigoku Monks Hell an obscenely bubbling        mud pond where a Buddhist temple once stood until it was submerged in        an earthquake back in the th century        Also near Kannawa are several hotspring developments        including attractive openair rock pools and mineral mud baths with a        Youve got it Well cure it  reputation But if heat is your thing        pay a visit to the grand old Meijiera Takegawara public baths not far        from the JR train station The old wooden building is simply        magnificent although its hot bath is one of the most basic youre        likely to encounter For just  you can lie down and have hot sand        raked over you by a grinning grandmotherly attendanta tenminute        ordeal youll never forget        One unusual attraction not mentioned in the official        tourist literature is Beppus sex museum which is famous throughout        Japan There are several such collections in Japan consisting of        bizarre images sculptures and elaborate dioramas depicting many of        the darker aspects of human sexuality often with fantasies involving        demons and monsters perpetrating unspeakable deeds upon helpless        mortals This is another only in Japan experience one definitely not        for the fainthearted        The rural village of Yufuin is relaxed gentle and        charming featuring oldfashioned farmhouses around tiny Kinrinko Lake        Set at the foot of Mt Yufuan extinct volcano covered by dense        bamboo forestYufuin is famous for its hotspring baths most of        which you can try for just a few hundred yen The helpful tourist        information desk in the JR station can direct you to the most popular        or unusual spots especially those with outdoor baths rotenburo        The excellent Folk Craft Museum in an old manor house        holds regular demonstrations of local arts and crafts Hardcore        seekers of local culture will find a single day insufficient for        visiting Yufuins Museum of Modern Art the unexpected Marc Chagall        Museum and  other art galleries The gentle paths along the small        rivers that meander through the town provide serene views of ricefields        and superb scenery        Farther south the thick groves of palm trees lining the        coast at Miyazaki serve as a reminder of its position on the edge of        the tropics This resort town has a long and usually uncrowded sandy        beach and there are several pleasant golf courses among the palm        trees        Heiwadai Park brings together the prehistoric past and the        frequently strange present The parks prefectural museum displays some        small clay figures haniwa unearthed at nearby ancient burial mounds        together with pots tools and weapons dating back to as early as         bc The grounds are dominated by the bizarre and grandiose        Peace Tower which curiously was erected in  At that time it had        a different name Hakkoichiwu Eight World Regions Under One Roof        embodying the militarist aims of the Imperial Japanese Army More        palatable in its goal is the parks Miyazaki Shrine dedicated to        Japans quasilegendary first emperor Jimmu who reputedly commenced        his glorious career in this region        Just north of Miyazaki is one of the many results of        Japans grandiose spending projects that characterized the bubble        economy years of the s and early s Seagaia Ocean Dome the        largest indoor water park in the world comprises an artificially        landscaped beach complete with palm trees and a giant wave pool to        complete the illusion of a tropical paradise The facilities are        enclosed within a huge retractable roof        South of Miyazaki the little island of Aoshima is        connected to Kyushu by a footbridge and surrounded by strange        wavelike rocks believed to be between  million and  million years        old Beyond Aoshima the picturesque winding Nichinan coast alternates        rugged cliffs with some fine sandy bathing beaches The seafood along        this coast is especially good try the reasonably priced lobster and        giant periwinkles        Southern Kyushu        Kagoshima dominates the head of a deep indentation at the        southern tip of Kyushu and its harbor has played a prominent role in        Japanese military history It was here that the Portuguese landed        bringing to Japan for the first time bread guns and Christianity The        sailors first landfall was on the little offshore island of        Tanegashima which has progressed from matchlocks and muskets to being        Japans principal rocketlaunching center        It was from Kagoshima that the last desperate sorties of        World War II were begun to resist an imminent US invasion including        the kamikaze raids on American warships Inevitably devastating        bombing reprisals flattened the city But modern Kagoshima is now an        attractive green and airy place with wide boulevards delightful        parks and a couple of intriguing historical museums        Shiroyama Park southwest of Kagoshima Station is up on a        hill giving you a fine view of the city and Kagoshima Bay through the        archway of Nanshu Shrine This shrine is dedicated to Kyushus most        celebrated son and one of Japans national heroes Takamori Saigo last        great champion of the samurai He is buried with  of his warriors        who died in the illfated  Satsuma Rebellion This was the last        stand of the samurai against the overthrow of their timehonored        privileges Many of the soldiers like Takamori himself died by their        own hand in a final gesture of defiance A museum in the park is        devoted to his life and battles Nearby the history of the Kagoshima        region is nicely summed up in the ultramodern Reimeikan Prefectural        Museum which includes local arts and crafts as well as examples of        those first Portuguese matchlock rifles        A couple of miles or so north of Kagoshima Station are the        lovely Iso Gardens also landscaped on a hill where the lord of        Satsuma had his villa Be sure to visit the Shoko Shuseikan Museum        housed in an old factory established here by the forwardlooking leader        for arms manufacture and other new industries        Out in the baytowering over the entire peninsulais        Japans most notoriously active volcano the huge threeconed        Sakurajima which sends up tremendous black and white clouds of ash and        steam Take a taxi or bus from Kagoshima Station for a closer look at        the lava and a fine view of the whole Kagoshima Bay area The        Sakurajima peninsula was once an island until a gigantic eruption in         when the rocks and lava joined it forever to the mainland A        powerful illustration of the magnitude of the eruption is found at        Haragosha Shrine where you can just see the top cross bar of the        shrines arch the rest submerged by hardened lava        St Francis Xavier Memorial Church in Xavier Park tram        to Takamibaba stop was built in  to commemorate the th        anniversary of the arrival of the Jesuit missionary His        statueinexplicably pinned halfway up a monolith in a very        martyrlike pose although he died in his bed in Chinastands with        its back to the sea beside a sculpted frieze dedicated to the suffering        of his Japanese converts        Ibusuki south of Kagoshima is a hotspring resort that        caters to honeymoon coupleshundreds of them at a time However the        main draw is its famous natural sand bath Clad only in a cotton        kimono you lie down for attendants to bury you up to the neck in sand        at a mediumbroil temperature Just stare up at the sky while you sweat        off a few pounds and the attendant shovels on fresh sand As the local        chamber of commerce hilariously puts it It is not only effective for        overall beauty but also for whiplash injuries caused by traffic        accidents and popular with newlyweds  A more cynical view is that        the sands provide a cure for which there is no known disease        Chiran  minutes inland by bus from Kagoshima is a        peaceful secluded thcentury samurai village In classically narrow        zigzagging lanes designed to hinder surprise attack the houses today        still inhabited by the Satsuma warriors descendants offer the rare        opportunity to visit some exquisite private gardens otherwise        carefully concealed behind tall hedges The simple serene style of        landscaping with rocks gravel and a few shrubs draws on the        precepts of Zen Buddhism that had such a special appeal for the austere        samurai        Chirans Kamikaze Museum which includes a monumental        statue of a pilot exhibits the young mens uniforms helmets and        final letters to their families explaining that they were continuing        the samurai spirit of defending the countrys traditional values There        are also fullscale models of the planes with a fuel tank big enough        for only a oneway mission        Western Kyushu        Halfway back along Kyushus west coast Kumamoto is an old        castle town that was of considerable importance to the Tokugawa shoguns        as a counterweight to the presence of the annoyingly independent        Shimazu clan down in Kagoshima For visitors today Kumamoto serves as        a convenient gateway for the scenic road trip to the Mt Aso volcano or        a ferry cruise to the UnzenAmakusa National Park        The reconstructed Kumamoto Castle is worth a visit for the        significant role it played during the last hectic days of Japans        feudal era Once a vast fortification of  turrets it ranked        alongside Osaka and Nagoya as one of the countrys greatest impregnable        bastions The  ferroconcrete reconstruction of the main castlekeep        houses a fine museum of feudal armor and weapons and offers a good view        of the city        Suizenji Park is an extravagant but attractive example of        the extensive gardens of the th century Here designers have        reproduced a miniature version of all the major landscape features        along the old Tokaido Highway between Kyoto and Edoincluding of        course a small artificial version of Mt Fuji        The bus ride from Kumamoto to the mighty Mt Aso volcano        takes you across some gently rolling hills past orange groves fields        of watermelon and the special grass used for tatami mats There is        even a rare sight of yellow wheat fieldsgrown for beer and noodles        rather than for bread which is mostly imported The panorama of the        five volcanic craters of Mt Aso blends vivid emeraldgreen mounds with        great carpets of pink azaleas on the surrounding slopes and plateau        Only one of the craters Nakadake is still really active But it is        well worth a visit to the top a short hike from the bus stop to peer        down into the bleak barren crater emitting puffs of sulfurous fumes        and contrasting starkly with the colorful vegetation all around it        On your way back down allow enough time to visit the        fascinating Aso Volcanic Museum This has some very realistic        audiovisual reenactments of eruptions and earthquakes with special        stereo sound effects Threedimensional models of exploding mountains        and molten lava flows from all over the world are shown You can press        a button to see Americas Mt St Helens blow its top or you can        relive the astonishing  eruption of Mt Aso itself        The UnzenAmakusa National Park consisting of a peninsula        and islands west of Kumamoto is most pleasantly reached on a        picturesque onehour ferry trip from the nearby port of Misumi to        Shimabara The harbor is dotted with the pinecovered islands of        Tsukumo offering delightful bathing along whitesand beaches Unzen        itself once the favored hill station of Europeans escaping the        steaming summers of the Asian mainland is now a rather noisy crowded        spa resort It serves best as an overnight stay prior to an early        morning hike around the Unzen volcanos craters The volcano last        erupted in spring  but it is no longer considered dangerous        Nagasaki        Nagasaki is an unexpectedly charming city To a large        extent this reflects its unbroken experience of more than four        centuries of hospitality to foreignersChinese Portuguese and        Dutchduring a period in Japanese history when the country was        characterized by often murderous xenophobia It is also a surprisingly        attractive town sadly a relative rarity among Japans bland        homogenous cities Its natural harbor surrounded by green hills is        one of the most attractive in the world Indeed the citys distinct        geography allowed most of its older neighborhoods to survive the        terrible destruction wrought by the second atomic bomb to be dropped on        Japan on  August despite the fact that the Nagasaki bomb was        more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima three days earlier        Long before the arrival of the first Europeans Nagasaki        had been a major focus of Japans trade with China Indeed the Chinese        influence in the city is clearly noticeable even today Major Buddhist        temples profiting from the suppression of Christianity during the th        century were established by Chinese Zen monks and designed in the        style of the late Ming Dynasty On a more mundane contemporary level        the most popular Nagasaki lunch is a solid nourishing bowl of chanpon        Chinese noodles in a tangy fish broth laden with a cornucopia of        mushrooms fish prawns vegetables and other goodies        Near the centrally located Japan Railways station is the        first sign of the Portuguese role in the citys fascinating history A        monument to  Christian martyrs executed in  at the beginning of        Japans repression of Catholicism includes a small museum displaying        relics including a communion wafer that has survived in dehydrated        form since the th century The museum describes how other Christians        were boiled alive in  at the nearby Unzen hot springs Bear in        mind of course that equally cruel religious persecution of Catholics        Protestants and Jews was quite common in Europe at that time         Even after the persecution and banishing of missionaries        and the ban on Christianity Nagasakis Catholics still managedat        great riskto continue clandestine observance throughout the years of        the Tokugawa shogunate They even went to Buddhist temples to worship        the feminine Kannon deities which were resculpted holding a child to        represent Mary and Jesus        The Dutch however being nonproselytizing Protestants        were allowed to stay on throughout Japans centuries of isolation        Their little community on Dejima Island in Nagasaki Bay sheltered the        only remaining foreigners left in the country Orandasan Dutch        people eventually became the accepted term for all foreigners in        Japan        To get a good sense of Nagasakis personality start down        at the harbor Boat tours begin from the pier at Ohata Port Terminal        taking you on a fascinating minute cruise around Nagasaki Bay Your        excursion steamer will feel like a childs toy as it passes the        gigantic supertankers of the Mitsubishi Shipyard Now the largest        private shipyard in the world this was the intended target that the US        Air Force B missed when it dropped the second atomic bomb        Dejima Pier has been reconnected to the mainland from what        was once the Dutch island concession The museum here has interesting        relics of the Dutch community In front of the museum is a model of the        neat little settlement they established in  when the only Japanese        permitted to visit were trading partners and prostitutes Commerce has        always been an effective bridge of cultural barriers        To see how the Dutch of a later era lived climb the        cobbled street of Hollander Slope number  tram to the Ishibashi        stop where youll see some redbrick and wooden clapboard houses with        colonialstyle verandahs anda rare sight atop houses in        Japanchimneys The houses are an enduring monument to the privileged        position of the foreigners allowed to live here        The British presence in thcentury Nagasaki is        nostalgically commemorated at the hillside Glover Gardens a short        distance west of Hollander Slope Escalators take you up to the houses        of British traders To the delighted curiosity of Japanese visitors        the houses are filled with the kind of Victorian paraphernalia that is        becoming increasingly popular in modern Japan damaskcovered        furniture an upright piano a massive mahogany sideboard and a grand        old gramophone with a big horn manufactured by the NipponOphone        Company        Kofukuji temple was the first of the Zen Buddhist temples        built by the Chinese  after the Tokugawa shoguns had outlawed        Christianity and ordered citizens to register as Buddhists In a        picturesque setting with palm trees in the courtyard the temples        architecture and sculpture are typical of southern China Kofukuji also        offers by advanced reservation a frugal but tasty vegetarian meal        cooked by the priests themselves Meal times are announced by the        beating of a big red fish gong        The pride and joy of the neighborhood is the Meganebashi        a doublearched stone bridge across the Nakajima River It was built in         by the abbot of Kofukuji and is the oldest of its kind in the        country The reflection of the double arches in the river on a fairly        calm day creates a visual image resembling a pair of eyeglasses The        narrow streets bordering the river are full of interesting antique        stores coffee shops and restaurants        Sofukuji temple  is a handsome example of late Ming        Dynasty architecture with its striking vermilionpainted stonearched        tower gate In the courtyard is a huge iron cauldron that was used for        distributing rice gruel to the poor during famines in the th and th        centuries The Chinese Buddha statues here are notable for their        variously proud cheerful or humble stances not to be seen in the        Buddhas of Japanese temples        The Nagasaki Peace Park embraces the epicenter of the        atomic blast that left  people dead  injured and a        miraculous  unscathed The hills surrounding the city did much to        contain the subsequent atomic fallout The park features a monumental        sculpture by local artist Kitamura Seibo that stirred considerable        controversy when unveiled in  The massive figures right hand        points skywardtoward the actual point of detonationas a warning        of the constant threat of nuclear weapons while his left hand        stretches out in a gesture of universal peace As in Hiroshima one of        the most moving monuments is a single piece of masonry left standing        In this case it is the redbrick and graystone remains of an arch        from the Urakami Catholic Church at the time the largest church in        Asia        A visit to Nagasaki is meaningless without a stop at its        provocative and challenging Atomic Bomb Museum The exhibits powerfully        document the buildup to the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki        and the appalling effects of the blast itself and its aftermath The        curators have done a good job of separating any military justification        for the decision from its tragic consequences for the civilian        population Like the Hiroshima museum the final message is not of        victims demanding sympathy but of an entire community committed to        total nuclear disarmament for the sake of the entire planet with its        own message of Never again         Finally at the end of a long day take the cable car to        the top of Mt Inasa  m  ft high for a dramatic sunset view        of Nagasaki and its harbor as city lights begin to sparkle        Northern Honshu and Hokkaido        The regions of Japan to the northeast of Tokyo are more        sparsely inhabited and tend to be less often visited by tourists        either foreign or Japanese But both northern Honshuwhich is more        commonly known as Tohokuand the northernmost island of Hokkaido        offer the advantage of unspoiled countryside and friendly downtoearth        villagers still imbued with something of a frontier spirit Their        folkcrafts are authentic and much less commercialized than in most        other parts of Japan And their festivals in an area without the usual        sorts of urban entertainment are frequent colorful and more        spontaneous than in the more densely populated regions of the country        No overall picture of Japanese life can be complete without a short        visit to these northern territories        Tohoku        Until the Tokugawa shoguns completed their conquest of all        Japan from the th century on the towns of Tohoku constituted the        northern boundaries of the Japanese empire Beyond them were the tribes        of the native Ainu at that time not considered Japanese  It was        only when the Ainu were progressively driven north up into Hokkaido        that Tohoku was opened up to broader settlement        Its massive rice yield as much as  percent of the        national rice crop has made Tohoku the chief supplier of the countrys        needs Thus the general trend for more and more peasants to drift away        from the land to the cities has been noticeably less marked here The        very remoteness of Tohoku was appealing to such religious groups as the        Zen Buddhists who espouse an ascetic unworldly life and constructed        some of the countrys finest Buddhist temples in this northern part of        Honshu        Matsushima is considered one of the countrys three Great        Scenic Beauties part of the Japanese passion for cataloging things in        three of this or eight of that  Although you can reach Matsushima in         minutes by train from Sendai the best way is to stop off at        Shiogama and take the onehour boat cruise across Matsushima Bay        Scores of tiny islands dot the bay their white sandstone shaped by the        elements into arches caves and pyramids and covered with lovely        wispy sea pines The changing perspective as you cruise slowly past is        extraordinary        In the town of Matsushima visit the pretty Kanrantei        Pavilion for one of the best views of the bay from a rocky cliff beside        the landing stage for the cruise ships But practically any point on        the hills rising behind the town will offer you a spectacular view        Zuiganji temple is the center of an old Zen Buddhist        seminary The buildings were constructed in  by the lord of Tohoku        Masamune Date In the temples treasure house you can see a statue of        the crusty old warlord in all his armor He lost his right eyefrom        smallpox not in battleand was nicknamed Dokuganryu OneEyed        Dragon As you walk up the long cedarshaded avenue to the temple        notice the twostory caves hewn from the rock that serve as        accommodation for itinerant monks        In the town of Hiraizumijust a minutes bus ride from        Ichinoseki Stationyoull find a temple dating from the late Heian        period early th century Chusonji was erected by the Fujiwara        family when their power behind the imperial throne in Kyoto was waning        Two of the temples structures have survived the countless wars of the        Fujiwara The Konjikido Golden Hall is a fabulously opulent mausoleum        that Kiyohira Fujiwara built for himself in  Everything except the        uppermost roof covering is coated in pure gold This priceless        treasure now protected by glass inside a fireproof concrete        Kamakurastyle hall is believed to be what Columbus was after in his        search for the country he called Chipangu The Kyozo is even older         and used to house the temples Buddhist scriptures sutras         which are now kept in the modern treasure house        Hokkaido        Not opened up to fullscale settlement until after the        Meiji Restoration of  the island of Hokkaido is Japans Far        North  Here are some of the few Japanese who enjoy uncrowded cities        unspoiled wilderness and a simpler existence in a climate and        landscape comparable to Scandinavia snowcapped mountains and pine

  their families to Hokkaido to carve out a new life for themselves        American advisers helped to develop Hokkaidos agriculture and coal        mining industries and to lay out an urban grid system for Sapporo        After years of neglect and discrimination the cultural        significance of the tiny though historically significant Ainu community        is finally being recognized Hokkaido now has some fascinating museums        devoted to Ainu life and the village of Shiraoi preserves the        artifacts and folkcrafts of their culture        Sapporo        One of the most attractive postwar urban innovations in        Japan is Sapporos Odori Promenade a broad green boulevard lined with        flower beds lilacs and maplesand with fountains down the middle        running east to west for a straight mile Its a great place to start        your visit        Sapporo has a nationwide reputation for its beer        introduced in the s by a German brewer who recognized the        surrounding countrys hopgrowing potential The beer garden to the        northeast of the downtown area is a lusty place to sample the towns        frontier spirit        Around
