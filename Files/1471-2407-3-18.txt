                    Background        Breast cancer represents a serious health problem for        the African American community In New York State breast        cancer mortality         increased  among African        American women while breast cancer mortality in Caucasian        women decreased  between  and             Mammographic screening resulting in early diagnosis        contributed significantly to this mortality decrement among        Caucasian women The disparity in mortality among African        Americans is multifactorial and includes lack of education        and awareness of the importance of early screening and        detection lower screening rates advanced stage disease at        diagnosis lack of or limited access to services delay in        treatment lack of consistent health care providers        distrust of the health care system lack of health        insurance and biology           The educational        and awareness issues are further complicated by cultural        myths and beliefs that foster a fatalistic fearful        conceptualization of breast cancer and that cross        socioeconomic lines            Traditional approaches to cancer education have been        modeled upon white womens attitudes and belief systems and        have been largely unsuccessful in the African American        community due to limited cultural relevance and        interaction The requirement that effective educational        program present information within an appropriate cultural        context in order to gain wide community acceptance and        behavior modification is a concept that is now being        recognized and implemented        The Witness Project of Buffalo is a community based        culturally sensitive breast cancer health education        program targeting African American women that is modeled        after the Witness Project at the University of Arkansas        This program empowers women through education to take        responsibility for their health and effect change in health        care behaviors The primary goals of the Witness Project of        Buffalo are to increase African American womens awareness        of breast selfexam BSE clinical breast exam and        screening mammography as early detection methods for breast        cancer and to improve the utilization rates of existing        breast cancer screening and diagnostic programs in Erie        County New York        Lay health advisors and witness role models form the        foundation for delivery of the Witness Project to the        community They simultaneously function as educators and        natural helpers and their training is designed to integrate        and exploit these attributes Described herein is an eight        week training program created to help reduce breast and        cervical cancer morbidity and mortality rates within the        African American community Implementation of this adult        training program in Buffalo required the integration of        nontraditional approaches in addition to the methods        outlined in the Witness Project Training Manual We report        on the development implementation and evaluation of these        nontraditional learning tools into an adult educational        program for lay educators in the Witness Project of        Buffalo                    Methods                  The community          The Buffalo metro area population  located          in Erie county New York is struggling to transition and          redefine itself from a manufacturing economy to a more          diverse global oriented focus and to train its workforce          to meet future needs Since  the minority          population of western New York has increased from  to           and there are now  African Americans Of these            live in Erie County predominately in          Buffalo The poverty rate is higher than the national          average with thirty five percent of African Americans          living below the poverty level  Census Churches          play a dominant role as centers for community outreach          Approximately  of African American women in Buffalo          attend church          The African American community dates back to the Civil          War since Buffalo was the last stop on the Underground          Railroad As a result the community that has developed          and evolved early on consisted of former slaves and in          subsequent decades individuals migrating from the south          seeking a better life The community is characterized by          extremely well integrated and close relationships between          members and remains open to novel ideas and initiatives          which are critically evaluated and selective The church          continues to be the solid influential and far reaching          center for African American culture and society          simultaneously As a result community access is          primarily controlled through the church In addition to          churches there are several other community centers          serving as the basis for social focus which are both          public and church affiliated centers                          Witness Project program design                      WRM and LHA training            The Witness Project educational model is a belief            and learning theory based intervention that            incorporates the health belief model locus of control            beliefs social learning theory and the trans            theoretical model of change and the MAT System                The training utilizes a self study approach that is            supplemented with traditional learning tools ie            slides and printed materials            Training is initiated by having all witness role            models and lay health advisors attend an actual Witness            Project program on the first day On the second day            witness role models and lay health advisors undergo a            formal  hour training class Lay health advisors take            a short pretest to assess their fund of knowledge            about breast and cervical cancer prior to and following            formal training All trainees then receive an overview            of the Witness Project and view a short video about the            Project Confidentiality issues and expectations facts            pertaining to breast and cervical cancer breast            selfexamination BSE mammography and Pap tests are            reviewed in detail using a slide presentation Break            out sessions are conducted by project staff for witness            role models and lay health advisors respectively            Witness role models introduce themselves tell their            stories to the group and receive group feedback on            their presentation Lay health advisors learn how to            perform and teach BSE Both groups reconvene and learn            how to set up a Witness Project program            Following the initial training session the outreach            training coordinator for the program assists witness            role models in developing their stories condensing            them into short narratives and learning and            incorporating the public speaking skills required to            deliver their message in a relaxed and inviting manner            Lay health advisors study the didactic information            presented in the course outline learn to teach BSE in            a mentored setting and practice the delivery of their            message                                    Description of the sample          Participation in the Witness Project required that          both witness role models and lay health advisors be          articulate comfortable speaking to people possess a          desire to provide health education commit to an          intensive training program have a commitment to          improving cancer education in the community be willing          to be available to the community and to act as a health          information resource Although the Witness Project of          Buffalo provided training stipends for the initial  hour          training to lay health advisors and witness role models          women were not told of this until they reported to the          training session          Twenty three women  lay health advisors  witness          role models comprised the initial training group          Witness role models and lay health advisors were          recruited from one authors surgical oncology practice          TH as well as by word of mouth and through social          organizations The professional socioeconomic and          employment experience diversity of the Witness Project          staff resulted in recruitment of a diverse group of women          to the project The median age of individuals in the          group was  years range  years   years All had          finished high school and  had completed college All          completed the initial eight hour training course                          Training interventions                      Witness role models            The standard core teaching method worked well for            the Witness Role Models Educational contracts and            videotaping presentations were the only two            nontraditional tools employed for role model training            During the first two sessions each woman shared her            experiences with the role model group and each            presentation was timed At the end of the second            session role models were instructed to write their            story in a two to three page narrative prior to the            third session Individuals who had difficulty writing a            narrative were encouraged to write one half to one page            of talking points Individuals who had difficulty            expressing their thoughts in either of these two            formats met with the training coordinator in individual            sessions and formulated a narrative together that            accurately conveyed the role models experience These            approaches provided a narrative that could be presented            within  minutes The stories were then read and            each critiqued for presentation and content by fellow            witness role models in the group in a supportive and            non threatening fashion Major changes recommended by            the group were incorporated into an individuals            presentation            Once the presentation content was mastered            attention focused upon presentation skills and stage            presence Each witness role model signed a contract            that required her practice of her presentation ten            minutes per day in front of the mirror and present her            talk to at least one or two individuals per week At            weekly meetings witness role models each presented            their stories and were critiqued by fellow role models            on content delivery and stage presence This resulted            in a relatively rapid assimilation of presentation            skills Finally witness role models were videotaped            and each woman as well as the group critiqued the            video This method allowed for maximal and rapid            improvement in and optimization of presentation            delivery                                Lay health advisors            The educational approach outlined in the training            manual was followed during the first  weeks of our            training Weekly training sessions for lay health            advisors began within three weeks of the initial            training course In order to assess the knowledge            level a short written quiz replicating many of the            items on the post training course quiz was            administered to lay health advisors The average score            on the first quiz following the initial  hour training            course was  The Witness Project core curriculum            establishes  as the minimum passing score            Training began by teaching breast and cervical            cancer facts followed by mammography Pap facts and            BSE and utilized the self study approach outlined in            the core curriculum The training team met weekly with            the lay health advisors to review the assigned            information in the course outline covered during the            preceding week of study At the end of the first             weeks only   of women acquired the didactic            knowledge and skills necessary to present a            program            A focus group session was conducted to determine the            problems faced by the students Difficulty organizing            the information difficulty remembering the facts            discomfort with medical terms fear of presenting the            information accurately lack of time to study and            feeling overwhelmed by the volume of information were            the most common problems cited by the group These            results prompted our group to reassess the Witness            Project approach to teaching didactic information and            make significant adaptations to meet the specific needs            of our group by introducing nontraditional learning            tools as part of a concrete approach to learning            Five educational tools that are not normally            incorporated into communitybased learning programs            were implemented educational contracts vocabulary            development accessing prior knowledge question and            answer training format and role playing                        Educational contracts required            women to act on their new knowledge by encouraging            learning of the information use of the breast and            cervical health information and promoted studying            through a written commitment Each lay health advisor            signed an educational contract that required her to             study the health fact and BSE packet daily             practice the lay health presentation daily and             share the information with three female friends or            family members weekly Lay health advisors directly            related their past experiences and knowledge about            breast and cervical cancer screening and integrated            them with changing behaviors and preventive health            practices            The core curriculum didactic information is            presented in outline format in the training manual and            proved difficult for the trainees to assimilate To            overcome this we utilized a concrete approach to            learning in which all of the information was            reorganized and presented in two formats color coded            flash cards corresponding to each curriculum component            which were organized into teaching modules and written            and verbal question and answer formats Each module was            taught in  weeks and written quizzes were given to            assess knowledge level at the end of each week A             medical vocabulary was developed            that introduced the medical terms and concepts in            glossary format used in the Witness Project            curriculum Individuals who did not achieve an             score were tutored in a small group or individual            setting Trainees did not progress to the next module            until a passing score was achieved on the written            test            After mastering the flashcards trainees progressed            to a             question and answer training            format that covered the same information presented            in the flashcards Breast and mammography facts were            combined and cervical and Pap facts were combined into            a total of  questions thus further consolidating the            information Four to five questions were assigned on a            weekly basis Questioning skills were emphasized to            promote thinking focus on information organize            responses and build comprehension                        Role playing was also integrated            into this phase of our training program At each            session trainees were paired with one person acting as            the questioner and the other as the respondent Roles            were reversed and the entire process monitored by            Witness Project staff Role playing reinforced the            importance of sharing breast health information with            family friends and the community and fostered creative            thinking ie how the information would be            presented            These approaches continued to build comprehension            and confidence focused students on organizing their            responses utilizing their fund of knowledge promoted            thinking and simulated question and answer sessions at            programs At the beginning of each session an oral quiz            was given to the trainees This technique improved            verbal skills simulated questions that lay health            advisors would encounter at programs and increased            comfort with this format All of the written and oral            examinations used to test competency during our            training program built on the prior weeks session            information The tests became increasingly more            difficult such that the final tests encompassed all of            the information covered in a particular flash card or            question format training module                                Breast selfexamination BSE            BSE training required  weeks and was conducted by            witness project staff who were certified BSE            instructors or physicians and followed the core            curriculum The lay health advisors were paired and            taught each other BSE under the supervision of trained            Witness Project staff Each person critiqued her            partners training in a constructive fashion thus            creating a relaxed atmosphere that fostered continued            experiential growth in teaching BSE Correctly teaching            BSE to a trained Witness Project staff member completed            this module of training A tour of the Mammography            Center at Roswell Park Cancer Institute was conducted            by the chief mammographer to complement and complete            the BSE training This tour enabled lay health advisors            to link didactic information with practical            experience                                Confidentiality issues and informed            consent            The Witness Project core curriculum addressed            confidentiality by stressing the importance of            respecting individual privacy and not circulating            information gained through encounters with individuals            attending a Witness Project program but lacked specific            training guidelines in this area Our program requires            participants to sign informed consent so that Witness            project personnel can contact them at later time            periods provide informational resources and evaluate            program effectiveness The integration of informed            consent training is a novel and nontraditional            approach to communitybased education programs that            enabled us to interact with the community more            effectively and enhance study participation            Addressing informed consent issues required            intervention at the trainer level lay health advisors            witness role models as well as the community based            organization level All lay health advisors and witness            role models received formal training about the informed            consent process from two individuals SW TH who had            experience in this area The rationale historical            significance ethics regulatory requirements and            oversight components of informed consent as well as            approaches for obtaining informed consent were taught            in two training sessions During the second session            participants practiced obtaining informed consent from            each other using the consent form for the Witness            Project of Buffalo under the supervision of Witness            Project staff Trainees critiqued each others            presentations This approach alleviated trepidation            regarding the consent process and enabled the witness            role models and lay health advisors to obtain informed            consent from program audience members in a relaxed            controlled and informed fashion thus allaying audience            fears about project participation            To establish comfort and trust with the            communitybased organization hosting our program the            outreach coordinator met with the program host and            introduced and reviewed the consent form and procedure            and answered all questions A copy of the consent was            given to the host organization for review and            discussion of subsequent questions or issues if            needed prior to the scheduled program                                      Results        The standard training approach for didactic information        outlined in the training manual required  weeks and was        successful in only   of our lay health advisors        Incorporating nontraditional learning tools into our        curriculum resulted in a dramatic improvement in the time        required for the remaining seven lay health advisors to        master the didactic information Two of the seven lay        health advisors mastered the didactic information within         weeks of incorporating nontraditional learning tools        completed their practical training and began conducting        programs after a total of  weeks of instruction utilizing        the nontraditional educational methods Four         required  weeks to assimilate the didactic information        and an additional  weeks of practical training to conduct        a program Fourteen percent of the lay health advisors        required  weeks to master the didactic material and an        additional  weeks to master the presentation skills        The integration of structured training about informed        consent and confidentiality is a novel approach in        community based educational programs Structured training        for witness role models and lay health advisors enabled our        program to overcome the barriers to consent and study        participation Many of the issues and reservation relating        to research studies and informed consent that our witness        role models and lay health advisors expressed were openly        discussed This enabled the women to convey information to        program participants using a forthright and informed        approach that allayed many of the audience members        trepidation An open and transparent discussion of the        clinical study and informed consent with the sponsoring        host and church leadership reduced and in virtually all        cases eliminated concerns about this aspect of the Witness        Project of Buffalo This approach resulted in a consent        rate of  for the initial six programs  for programs         and  by the thirteenth program We have now        conducted over  programs with an overall study consent        rate of                     Discussion        Community based cancer education requires interventions        at many levels that address the fundamental causative        issues contributing to the myriad of health disparities        ie access health insurance transportation MD referral        lack of time fear fatalism and lack of knowledge The        communitys perception of specific health issues has a        major role in determining response to educational        interventions One study evaluated community perception of        health status in one geographic area which was classified        as one of the least healthy areas of the region However         of people surveyed described their health as good to        excellent despite the fact that  had never had        mammograms  had not had a Pap smear within the        preceding year only  had mammography the preceding year        and  felt their neighborhood environment was unsafe The        majority of respondents felt that health education was a        top priority in their community     Also many African        Americans have a false perception that the incidence of        cancer is lower in African Americans than in Caucasians                   A successful community based cancer educational programs        require several components educational programs        appropriate training outreach individuals strong        relationships with the public and private medical providers        and navigational services As confirmed in this report lay        health advisors can be a highly effective component of the        cancer educational program in their role as trained        community educators and liaisons between the community and        medical providers They commonly function in the community        as natural helpers lay people from whom others seek        emotional support aid and advice possess environmental        familiarity and are highly respected and trusted             They can address initial health concerns often bridging        the chasm between the doctor or health care provider and        the patient Perhaps their most important role is        addressing health care issues within the social network of        the community which can translate into increased trust in        the health care system and empowerment of community members        to adopt proactive rather than reactive behaviors relative        to personal health Salber et al    have identified        additional functions of the lay health advisor that include        strengthening professionals ties with the community        channeling knowledge to and from the community        bidirectional education of community members on the role        and function of the health care system and of professionals        about the lay advising system informing the community        about available resources improving the helpers role in        helping others and helping the community to better cope        with health care problems Lay health advisors also        mobilize community resources to sustain and support the        health care system            Many terms have been used to describe lay health        advisors natural helpers facilitators community health        workers Lay health workers comprise an increasing number        of the health care agency workforce In northern        California  of  community based organizations        employed or planned to employ community health workers to        reach out to their target communities     The Pew        Health Professions Committee defines them as community        members who work almost exclusively in community settings        and who serve as connectors between health care consumers        and providers to promote health among groups that have        traditionally lacked access to adequate care            Their roles in health delivery are varied and span the        spectrum from volunteers offering emotional support to full        time health care employees providing medical information at        the lay level Some have argued that training community        individuals to deliver health information destroys their        ability to function as natural helpers     In the        North Carolina Save Our Sisters Project lay health        advisors are the functional unit of one outreach initiative        and are trained as natural helpers They assist individuals        in their community with needs that are difficult for        medical professionals to address negotiate with        professionals for health system support and mobilize        community association resources to sustain support from the        health care system       The environment in which        they work can vary from small group to individual        interactions in intimate as well as depersonalized        environments      In the Arkansas Witness Project        lay health advisors have an integrated role as both natural        helpers and educators            Training for lay health advisors must carefully        integrate the scientific aspects of the information that        they disseminate to the community with maintaining and        strengthening the natural helper aspects of their position        The Witness Project curriculum has incorporated multiple        learning theories PRECEDE MAT health belief model        locus of control transtheorectical theory community        empowerment and PEN into the design of the educational        program     However the witness role model and lay        health advisor training module is based on the MAT system        which addresses the four distinct adult learning types as        well as right and left brain and integrated learners        Briefly type  learners perceive by sensingfeeling and        process by watchingreflecting They learn by connecting        past and present experiences and then examining the        connection Type  learners perceive by thinkingreasoning        and processes by watchingreflecting and prefer        informational learning They learn by imaging the concept        and then defining it with facts and information eg        Mastering and conceptualizing information regarding breast        selfexam and mammography facts Type  learners perceive        by thinkingreasoning and process by doingtrying They        focus on application and prefer using the coaching method        They test concept implications and then elaborate and        reconstruct the defined concepts practicing BSE Type         learners perceive by sensingfeeling and process by        doingtrying They learn by personal adaptation and self        discovery and evaluate and modify concepts to integrate new        connections            In the Witness Project core curriculum lay health        advisors develop the concepts and skills to provide health        education by being taught the facts about breast and        cervical cancer This aspect of the training program is        heavily weighted toward the type  learner Our lay health        advisors had great difficulty with this approach        Therefore we incorporated the nontraditional learning        tools described in this paper into our curriculum to        provide heavier emphasis on type  and type  learning        styles        The educational contract served as tangible commitment        to learning An individualized learning approach wherein        lay health advisors progressed through the educational        process at their own pace provided a relaxed academic        atmosphere Objective evaluation of their training        necessitated adherence to standard approaches designed for        the type  learners However by progressively increasing        test difficulty and integrating both written and verbal        testing formats test taking anxiety was almost completely        eliminated Furthermore the verbal testing formats were        complemented by representing the didactic information in a        question and answer format which further alleviated anxiety        and increased confidence With this approach all lay        health advisor candidates were able to comfortably address        questions posed to them during Witness Project program        presentations        Witness role model training proved less challenging than        for lay health advisors Verbal and written recapitulation        of their experiences enabled role models to create reflect        upon and analyze their experiences with breast or cervical        cancer Sharing their presentations with other role models        and receiving thoughtful criticism and praise increased        self confidence and performance The relevance and        usefulness of their experience were analyzed through group        practice sessions which included critiquing of        presentations for delivery and content Anxiety about        public speaking was almost completely eliminated More        importantly the importance and benefit of sharing their        personal story with strangers was reinforced As the        training process continued they developed original        applications by enhancing their stories or began creating        new stories based upon different aspects of their illness        eg screening diagnosis treatment reconstruction family        and spiritual support This particular phase creating new        stories of their development did not generally occur until        the witness role models had been giving programs         months        One of the most important and novel aspects of our        training focused upon informed consent and study        participation issues There is little published data        regarding the issue of informed consent in communitybased        programs Prior community outreach initiatives have dealt        with informed consent issues by obtaining consent in        general terms utilizing university coverage obtaining        verbal consent or removing identifiers form data to        eliminate the need for informed consent Our program is        unique in two ways  lay members of the community        receive         formal training about informed        consent and are taught how to obtain it and  the        informed consent process is specifically reviewed with the        hosting community organization an approach that has not        been previously reported        Our primary goal was to educate our role models and lay        health advisors about the informed consent process allay        fears related to participating in a clinical study and give        them the tools to repeat this same process within the        community This concept was perpetrated at the individual        as well as the organizational level program host By        directly addressing fears and anxieties about clinical        study participation at the individual and organizational        level the issues of informed consent were minimized        We have presented a detailed description of traditional        and non traditional educational methods employed to train        lay health advisors in a community based breast and        cervical cancer educational program Our educational        approach was tailored to the learning needs of the lay        health advisors and witness role models and differs to some        extent from prior published studies in that rigorous        objective evaluation of learning has been infrequently        used Others have used quantitative methods but have relied        more on subjective knowledge assessment and measured        effectiveness by the number of community members reached               As community health based education        continues to proliferate it is imperative that more        attention be directed to the training process and objective        evaluation of this process While it is essential to be        able to effectively transfer information to the community        at large it is imperative that the educational quality of        the product that a training program produces lay health        advisor witness role model be maximized through well        integrated multifaceted approaches                    Conclusions        The incorporation of non traditional learning approaches        into community based educational training curriculums        enhances training success and increases community        participation                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors
