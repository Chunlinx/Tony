                    Background        Estrogen as a neuroprotective and neurotrophic factor         influences memory and cognition       attenuates        the extent of cell death resulting from brain injuries        ie from cerebrovascular stroke and neurotrauma               and  decreases the risk and delays the onset of        neurological disorders such as Alzheimers disease             Numerous studies indicate that estrogen is essential for        optimal brain function         as estrogen has been        shown to increase cerebral blood flow         act        as an antiinflammatory agent         and enhance        activity at neuronal synapses         Through a        variety of mechanisms estrogen strongly influences memory        and cognition a type of cognition which is especially        dependant on gonadal hormones ie estradiol is visual        spatial memory VSM                  In learning and memory tasks which require the use of        visual spatial cues males acquire and exhibit superior        performance to females            This        sex difference in rats has been attributed to the hormonal        influence of estrogen presumably by way of its         in situ conversion from testosterone        by the aromatase enzyme in brain        and is        observable morphologically in visually spatial critical        brain areas ie frontal cortex  hippocampus                    In this regard endocrine disrupters are environmental        chemicals that mimic or modulate the physiological effects        of steroid hormones especially that of estrogens             Of all of the considered estrogenic endocrine disrupters        examined thus far phytoestrogens have been extensively        studied     however little research has been        conducted examining VSM in relationship to phytoestrogens        Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that are structurally        and functionally similar to estradiol and have the ability        to selectively bind estrogen receptors estrogen receptor         greater than estrogen receptor      Phytoestrogens        have received increased investigative attention due to        their potential protective effects against agerelated        diseases eg cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis and        hormonedependent cancers ie breast and prostate        cancer                These        estrogenlike molecules with a diphenolic nonsteroidal        structure are found in many plants but are especially        abundant in soy products                      which are used as the major protein source in all        naturalingredient commercially available rodent diets        ranging from  to  g phytoestrogensgram diet             Therefore animals ingesting these diets are        continually exposed to endocrineactive compounds                            The available research regarding cognitive function and        phytoestrogens suggests that large amounts of        phytoestrogens consumed as tofu have an adverse influence        on cognitive ability in men where decreased brain weight        increased ventricular size and dementia have been reported            In ovariectomized female rats on the other hand        phytoestrogen treatments resulted in a dosedependent        improvement of VSM     This improvement in cognitive        ability in phytoestrogen treated females may be due in part        to the increased presence of choline acetyltransferase        messenger RNA in the frontal cortex which has been shown        to be associated with protection and enhancement of        cognitive function     Furthermore we have shown that        phytoestrogens significantly affect the brain        calciumbinding protein calbindin CALB which acts as a        buffer by binding intracellular calcium and plays an        important role in mediating cell proliferation programmed        cell death apoptosis and neurotoxicity                This neuroprotective mechanism via CALB appears to be        important in neurological disorders such as Parkinsons        disease and Huntingtons disease                Additionally Cyclooxygenase COX seems to play an        important role in mediating functional neuronal maturation        and responses to certain stimuli in the brain              The expression of COX is associated with key        pathophysiologic events in Alzheimers disease deposition        of betaamyloid protein in neuritic plaques within the        hippocampus and cortex       Of particular        importance to this study is the fact that COX has been        shown to be influenced by steroidal hormones              Therefore the expression of COX in the frontal cortex        may also be hormonally regulated and relevant to cognitive        decline        The design of this study was to examine the influence of        phytoestrogens present via soy in rodent diets on VSM in        three separate experiments utilizing radial arm maze        methods to examine varying aspects of memory Additionally        brain regions critical for diverse parameters of VSM        working vs reference memory were assayed to determine        phytoestrogen CALB and COX levels Our laboratory has        previously reported the phytoestrogen levels in the diets        used in this study and circulating plasma and brain        phytoestrogen levels obtained in rats exposed to these        diets         Notably we have shown that rats        fed the Phyto diet have phytoestrogen plasma levels        similar to that of a human Asian population consuming high        amounts of soy protein per day and the low levels of plasma        phytoestrogens from the Phytofree diet fed animals are        reflective of a Western population where soy foods are        rarely consumed       Therefore we have        established an animal model that approaches the human        population in circulating plasma phytoestrogen levels based        upon consumption of these phytoestrogen soyrich vs        soyfree diets                    Results                  Acquisition of the Radial Arm Maze shaping to          criterion

     diet significantly altered acquisition of the maze in            females Females fed the Phyto diet lifelong            acquired the maze in significantly fewer trials than            did females

   F                p   before the diet            switch As can be seen in figure  males acquired the            maze on average  days earlier than females                                    EightArm Task                      Experiments               Dietary phytoestrogens did not alter working memory            as assessed by the arm task in either females or            males              p   respectively data            not shown when these animals by diet were tested            separately by sex Therefore an across sex by diet            comparison was not appropriate for these separate

significant sex difference was found on            maze performance in the arm task              p   Males entered            significantly more correct arms than females during            trials

 appeared to be dependant upon diet or after the diet          switch Multivariate analysis of variance resulted in a          significant interaction of sex and diet            p   see figure  The          Phyto diet improved performance in females while          hampering performance in males Further analysis via post          hoc comparisons revealed that Phyto females made          significantly more correct arm choices than females          switched to the Phytofree diet during trial             p   and Phyto males          on trials  and            p   Males switched to the          Phytofree diet displayed significantly more correct arm          choices than females switched to the Phytofree diet          trials  and            p   and lifelong fed          Phyto males trials  and            p   These results are          shown in figure  Further multivariate statistical          analysis and post hoc comparisons were used to identify          differences in errors committed in the radialarm maze          These data revealed a significant interaction of sex and          diet on the incidence of reference errors during trials           and             p   but no significant          differences in working or workingreference errors            p   Pairwise comparisons          revealed that lifelong fed Phyto males committed          significantly more reference memory errors than males          switched to the Phytofree diet and lifelong fed          Phyto females            p   data presented in          figure a Additionally in analyzing the amount of time          required for subjects to enter the first  arms in a          given trial it was found that a significant diet effect          independent of sex was apparent where animals fed the          Phyto diet traveled through the maze significantly          faster than animals fed the Phytofree diet trials                     p   figure b                          Brain ContentPhytoestrogen Levels          Brain phytoestrogen levels are displayed in Table           In general in all brain regions examined except the          hippocampus Phyto fed males displayed significantly          higher phytoestrogen levels compared to Phytofree fed          males In the amygdala phytoestrogen levels were fold          higher in Phyto males compared to Phytofree values          Whereas in the hippocampus there was not a significant          difference between the Phyto and Phytofree fed          males However when the frontal cortex and cerebellum          were examined where an abundance of ER receptors are          present Phyto males displayed a fold and fold          higher phytoestrogens levels respectively compared to          Phytofree male values In each brain site examined          except the cerebellum the major phytoestrogen          metabolite was equol and there were relatively low levels          of daidzein and genistein                          Frontal Cortex and Hippocampal Calbindin          The frontal cortical CALB results are displayed in          figure  The abundance of CALB from male Phyto rats          was significantly lower than males on the Phytofree diet                     F              p   This suggests that          high levels of dietary phytoestrogens significantly          decreased frontal cortical CALB levels in male rats          however in females there was no significant diet effect          on CALB levels and the band intensities were similar to          males fed the Phyto diet          In examining hippocampal CALB levels between Phyto          vs Phytofree fed males there were no significant          alterations in CALB levels in the CA  CA  or dentate          gyms regions by the diet treatments data not shown                          Frontal Cortex COX          Western analysis of the same frontal cortex samples          as performed for the CALB Western analysis revealed          significantly lower COX levels in Phytofree males          compared to Phyto males            F              p   These results are          presented in figure  This suggests that high levels of          dietary phytoestrogens significantly increased the          abundance of COX in the male rat frontal cortex In          females similar to the CALB results above there was no          significant diet effect on COX levels and the band          intensities were almost identical to that of male          Phytofree values          Note Due to the low abundance of phytoestrogens in          the hippocampus in both diet treatments analysis of          COX was not preformed Furthermore in preliminary          experiments hippocampal COX signals via Western          analysis were too weak to quantify                            Discussion        Phytoestrogen research has grown rapidly in recent years        due to its potential health benefits in preventing        agerelated and hormonedependent cancers                       In contrast very little research        has been conducted to identify phytoestrogen effects on        cognitive behavior Because phytoestrogens are present in        virtually all naturalingredient rodent diets that use soy        as a source of protein      and since these        compounds are endocrineactive                     it is important to determine whether the amounts        present in rodent diets are sufficient to affect sexually        dimorphic spatial ability        The present study addressed these issues in part by        investigating the influence of dietary phytoestrogens        present in a normal rodent diet on visual spatial        ability In tasks requiring the use of spatial skills a        sexually dimorphic difference has been consistently        demonstrated in which males reliably outperform females                  This sex difference is most likely due        to the presence of testosterone or more likely its        metabolite estradiol in brain                   Because phytoestrogens have the ability to bind estrogen        receptors and alter many of the biological responses that        are evoked by physiological estrogens                    we determined phytoestrogens affects on VSM in        adult rats Measurements of accuracy in acquisition        determined as trials required for shaping to a        predetermined criterion of the radial maze were diet        dependent in that males in experiment  fed the        phytoestrogenfree diet and females in experiment  fed        the phytoestrogenrich diet acquired the maze in fewer days        than females or males fed the alternate diet It should be        noted that the dietary effects on body weight are the same        for both male and female rats and therefore do not account        for the sexually dimorphic maze performance     There        was however no significant dietary effects observed in        the arm task performance in either males experiment         or females experiment  Measures of accuracy on the        baitedunbaited fourarm task experiment  demonstrated        that a diet change in young adult animals a change from        Phyto to Phytofree had a positive influence on the        accuracy in males but a negative influence on the accuracy        in females In a companion paper the impact of hormonal        manipulation and dietary phytoestrogens influence on VSM        is examined and validates several aspects of the findings        from the present study        The discrepancies in maze performance were expressed in        two ways  Phyto males exposed lifelong to the        diet committed more reference errors than males switched        to the Phytofree diet and  lifelong Phyto fed males        and females had increased mobility within the maze which        seemed to be advantageous to females but disruptive to        males It is intriguing to speculate that the increase in        reference errors but not working or workingreference        errors suggests that disruption of maze performance is        occurring within the frontal cortex but not the        hippocampus of lifelong Phyto fed males The drop in        performance is directly correlated to phytoestrogen levels        in brain and the effects of phytoestrogens on brain CALB        and COX levels in that phytoestrogens were identified as        having a negative relationship with CALB  and a        positive relationship with COX  In all other        studies conducted previously the determination of        phytoestrogens in the diet circulating in plasma and        especially in brain have not been performed together The        exception to this line of investigation has been our        laboratory where in general we obtained similar values        previously to those quantified in the present study             when overlapping diet exposure and brain regions were        examined in LongEvans and SpragueDawley rats                    As reported phytoestrogens were  times higher in the        frontal cortex of Phyto vs Phytofree fed males where        there is an abundance of ER receptors     while        phytoestrogen levels were similar in these animals in the        hippocampal region Furthermore males fed the Phyto        diet displayed a significant decrease in frontal cortical        CALB levels in comparison to males receiving the Phytofree        diet As CALB plays an important role in regulating        intraneuronal cellular calcium which protects against        neurodegenerative disease and defends against apoptosis                a decrease in frontal cortex CALB may        result in cognitive impairment due to cell death or        abnormal calcium homeostasis                Furthermore frontal cortical COX was shown to        significantly increase in males fed the Phyto diet        Because the expression of COX is associated with key        pathophysiologic events in Alzheimers disease              the significant increase in COX expression in the        frontal cortex may be relevant to the cognitive decline        seen in the Phyto males In this regard it is known        that the hormonal action of estrogens may be mediated by        the differential expression of estrogen receptors alpha vs        betta in brain structures that activate or inhibit cell        death mechanisms     Although this parameter was not        directly investigated in this study the differing        influence that dietary phytoestrogens had on CALB        significant decrease and COX significant increase in        the male frontal cortex suggests that phytoestrogens may        activate programmed cell death In support of this notion        since the Phyto fed males displayed a fold greater        phytoestrogen levels in the frontal cortex vs Phytofree        males and the greater affinity of phytoestrogens is for        ER  ER it has been shown that estrogenrelated        neuronal apoptosis is determined by ER and the FasFas        ligand system     In fact isoflavones have been shown        to cause apoptosis in rat primary cortical neurons in vitro        via a calcium dependant mechanism     Furthermore the        action of phytoestrogens may be tissue site specific As        our results show phytoestrogens are more prevalent and have        greater affinity for certain brain structures and areas        therefore phytoestrogens may act both as agonist and        antagonist in a sitespecific manner or in other words as        natural SERMtype molecules                 Taken together these findings suggest that soy dietary        phytoestrogens present in the animal diets or the lack        thereof for a relatively short interval even in young        adult animals can significantly influence sexually        dimorphic cognitive behavior Dietary phytoestrogens sex        reversed VSM as expressed in the radialarm maze by        enhancing spatial memory in females but inhibited this        ability in males this finding corresponds to research        regarding increased dementia observed in aged men consuming        high tofu levels     However while it is important to        establish the influence of dietary phytoestrogens on brain        function and behavior in animal models the true        significance in humans remains to be determined as it        relates to the present findings        Finally as established by the above findings of        particular importance which deserves emphasis is that the        Phyto diet used in this study is a typical rat chow        formulation that is similar to other rodent diet products        that are used in many laboratories whereas        phytoestrogenfree Phytofree diets are rarely used As        previously reported Thigpen et al    and Brown and        Setchell    determined the source and concentration of        phytoestrogens in rodent diets The results of this study        showed that phytoestrogen concentrations vary widely among        diets between  gg and  gg of phytoestrogens        Additionally one of our laboratories has quantified        phytoestrogen plasma levels in a variety of physiologic        conditions validating the importance of soyderived        phytoestrogens via rodent chow diets     Therefore not        all diets have the same phytoestrogen levels however all        diets which have soy as their main protein source contain        phytoestrogens It is very unusual to consider the        influence of diet in hormone sensitive research        investigations This may be a critical error due to the        complicating andor confounding role phytoestrogens play        For example we have previously shown that soy dietary        phytoestrogens significantly alter body weight food and        water intake levels puberty onset in females and prostate        weights     Also we have preliminary unpublished        data demonstrating the effects of soyderived        phytoestrogens on several endocrine and metabolic        parameters However brain aromatase and circulating plasma        estradiol levels in male rats does not appear to be        influenced by dietary phytoestrogens       As the        results from this research imply phytoestrogens have        considerable effects on hormonally sensitive parameters and        their influence may be in part responsible for many        reported sexual dimorphisms such as the establishment and        plasticity of sexually dimorphic brain structures like the        sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area SDNPOA        and the anteroventral periventricular nucleus AVPV                    Therefore dietary soy derived phytoestrogens can        influence brain cognition and memory in a manner that was        previously unknown where soy phytoestrogens enhance memory        in intact females but inhibit memory in intact males        Further research is warranted in order to examine this        important and growing research field of endocrine        disruptors to determine the true significance of        phytoestrogens influence that appears to be hormonal and        gender dependent                    Conclusions        Male rats acquire and exhibit significantly better        performance compared to females in learning and memory task        requiring the use of visual spatial cues This study        examined the influence of phytoestrogens present in rodent        diets on VSM and identified phytoestrogens CALB and        COX expression in the rat brain Within the radial arm        maze dietary phytoestrogens significantly sexreversed the        normal sexually dimorphic expression of VSM Specifically        in tasks requiring the use of reference but not working        memory VSM was enhanced in females fed the Phyto diet        whereas in males VSM was inhibited by the same diet It        was determined via TRFIA that males fed the Phyto        diet had significantly higher levels of phytoestrogens in a        number of brain regions frontal cortex hypothalamus         cerebellum but not hippocampus compared to males fed the        Phytofree diet Since reference memory is thought to be        mediated in the frontal cortex and because males fed the        Phyto diet had decreased expression of CALB a        neuroprotectant factor and increased COX an        inflammatory factor prevalent in Alzheimers disease        levels in this brain region compared to males fed the        Phytofree diet these findings suggest that        phytoestrogens present in soy dietary sources may alter        VSM via there presence and action in the frontal        cortex                    Materials and

at similar time          intervals and each study used the same diet treatment and          maze procedure see below           Animals Ten  dayold LongEvans          females were purchased from Charles River Laboratories          Wilmington MA USA for breeding These animals were          caged individually and housed in the Brigham Young          University BioAg vivarium and maintained on a hour          dark hour light schedule lights on  The          animals and methods for these studies were approved by          the Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC at Brigham          Young University Upon arrival all animals were allowed           ad libitum access to either a          commercially available diet with high phytoestrogen          levels Harlan Teklad Rodent Diet  Madison WI USA          containing  micrograms of phytoestrogensgram of diet          referred to hereafter as the Phyto diet or a custom          phytoestrogenfree diet referred to hereafter as the          Phytofree diet obtained from Ziegler Bros Gardner          PA USA and water For the Phytofree diet the          phytoestrogen concentrations were below the detectable          limits of HPLC analysis     The content and nutrient          composition of these diets are described in detail          elsewhere     At  days of age the animals were          time mated within their respective diet treatments so          that the offspring of these pairings would be exposed          solely to either the Phyto or Phytofree diet Thirty          days following birth the animals were weaned and          separated by sex into colony cages  animals per cage          males were tested in experiment  whereas females were          tested separately in experiment  The animals were fed          the same diet as their mother Phyto or Phytofree          At  days of age animals were singly caged and remained          on the assigned diet treatments                          Experiment  Animals          Male and female rats utilized in experiment  received          lifelong exposure to only the Phyto diet using a          diet treatment design similar to that described above for          experiments

 and             At days of age rats males tested in experiment             or females tested in experiment  were put on a            limited feeding schedule and maintained at            approximately  of normal body weight however            animals were allowed to gain an additional  g per week            to account for normal growth One week later the rats            were introduced to the radial arm maze On             consecutive days each rat was placed into the maze for             minutes to explore Following this introduction rats            were placed alone in the center of the maze Three            Froot Loops FL were placed at the start of each arm            If the rat retrieved FL from at least  of the piles            within  minutes then on the following day a single FL            was placed at the start of each arm If  of the  FL            were retrieved within  minutes then the following day            a single FL was placed  cm further out on the arms In            this manner the FLs were gradually placed farther and            farther out on the arms in a systematic manner            Training was completed for a given rat when it            retrieved FLs from the end of at least  of the  arms            within  minutes on  consecutive trials The number of            trials required to reach this criterion was recorded            for each rat Once this criterion level was reached            for a given rat it was tested on this task for             additional trials oneday Each trial was considered            complete when all  arms were visited or  minutes had            passed An arm choice was scored if the rat traveled            threefourths of the way down the length of an arm A            working memory error was recorded if an animal            reentered a previously visited arm Following the            eightarm task the animals in experiments  and  were            sacrificed and blood was taken to determine circulating            phytoestrogen levels and brain samples were collected            for CALB and COX determination            In experiment  following the arm task trials            described above these animals were returned to their            home cages and a dietary change was initiated Onehalf            the total number of male or female random cycling            rats was kept on the original Phyto diet            longterm and the other half was assigned to the            Phytofree diet shortterm This ad lib feeding            continued for  days Following this ad lib period of            feeding rats were again reduced to  of normal body            weight for  days                                Maze procedure fourarm task reference and            working memory examining animals in experiment                        Following the reduction to  of normal body            weight each rat was tested for an additional  days            one trialday during which only  arms were baited            fourarm task To begin these trial each animal was            placed in a bottomless opaque box in the center of the            maze The box was removed opening all arms            simultaneously to the rat These trials were considered            complete when the  baited arms arms  and  had            been visited or  minutes had passed During all trials            the amount of time required to visit the initial  arms            and the order that each rat entered the arms were            recorded Again an arm entry was noted if a rat            traversed at least threefourths the length of the arm            A working memory error was recorded if a rat reentered            a baited arm a reference memory error was recorded if            an animal entered an arm which was not baited and a            workingreference memory error was recorded if an            animal reentered an arm which was not baited All            testing and analysis was accomplished without knowledge            of the diet treatments                                Circulating phytoestrogen levels            The concentration and types of phytoestrogens in            collected plasma samples were analyzed by            gaschromatographymass spectrometry GCMS as            previously performed in our laboratories                  This was accomplished by liquidsolid extraction and            liquidgel chromatographic techniques to isolate the            phytoestrogen fractions using standard assay methods            with internal controls                                    Brain calbindin COX and phytoestrogen            levels            In LongEvans rats brains tissues were collected            for phytoestrogen CALB and COX analysis Brain            phytoestrogen concentrations ie daidzein genistein            and equol were determined in tissues isolated from the            frontal cortex and hippocampus brain structures            critical for

methods for            plasma and urine      The brain tissue method            in brief follows The brain samples were lyophilized            pooled by treatment n   per group from male rats            used as breeders that were on the diet treatments from             to  days of age Following addition of  l of            water and mixing the samples were left at room            temperature for  min and thereafter carefully mixed            and sonicated for  min Tritiated estradiol            glucuronide was added as an internal standard and             l of methanol were mixed with samples Fatty material            was precipitated overnight at C The samples were            then centrifuged  rpm for  min at C and the            supernatant was decanted into another tube The            procedure was repeated by adding an additional  ml            icecold  methanol mixing centrifugating in the            cold and decanting the supernatant into the tube            containing the extract Methanol was evaporated under a            stream of nitrogen until only water remained The            samples were extracted once with  ml of nhexane            which removed the remaining fat the remaining nhexane            was removed with nitrogen Helix Pomatia enzyme was            purified with activated charcoal and used for enzymatic            hydrolysis of the phytoestrogen conjugates The            hydrolysis  h at C was carried out using ascorbic            acid in  M acetate buffer The samples were then            extracted twice with  ml of diethylether freezing            separated the phases and the ether fractions were            combined and evaporated After adding  l of TRIS            buffer pH  TRFIA buffer a sample was taken for            measurement of recovery in a counter The final assay            was carried out as described elsewhere                 Equol was determined in the same way genistein and            daidzein using an antiserum to            Ocarboxymethylequolbovine serum albumin and the            Europium label was synthesized using the same            derivative of equol     The crossreactivities of            the genistein and daidzein antisera with other            isoflavone metabolites have been described previously                The equol antiserum showed a cross reactivity of             for genistein  for dihydrogenistein  for            dihydrodaidzein and less than  for daidzein and its            other metabolites The intraassay CV determined from            a pool of rat brains varied from  to  The            relatively high CV was due to the fact that the samples            were never completely homogeneous and the differences            in phytoestrogen concentrations are great in different            brain regions            In male and female rats from experiments  and             CALB and COX levels in the frontal cortex and            hippocampus CALB only were determined using Western            blot analysis as reported elsewhere      In            brief homogenized samples  g per lane for frontal            cortex and hippocampus by treatment were resolved on             TriGlycine gels and transferred onto Millipore            ImmobilonP membranes Millipore Bedford MA USA by            electroblotting The membranes were probed with rat            calbindin antibody
