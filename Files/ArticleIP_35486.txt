its allied floods Americanshave followed all this obsessively with weather Web sites reporting recordtraffic in the days before Floyds landfall Is there anyone who cant explainthe Richter scale or distinguish between a Category  hurricane and a Category            With all this talk of upheaval Natures Bedlam asNature on the Rampage likes to call it youd think we were suffering aplague of chaosrecord numbers of Category  hurricanes epic tornadoesdroughts and the like Its true that the United States with its endlesscoastline vast climatic variation massive fault lines and dozens of activevolcanoes is exposed to more than its share of Mother Natures fury But thenumber of natural events nationwide and worldwide remains constant Somemeteorologists speculate that we are entering a busy hurricane cycle but thejury is still out            Americans are more alertto Mother Natures rage in part because more people are in its way Accordingto Time   million Americans live in regions threatened by hurricanesEarthquakes floods and volcanoes endanger millions more Because propertyfollows people natural disasters have become more destructive A storm thatrips through Florida today shreds many more houses than it would have in According to the National Science Foundation natural disasters now cause about in damage per American per year five times as much as a generation agoeven accounting for inflation            Its no accident that anxiety about nature is surgingduring a time of domestic tranquility and relative world peace Weather is aform of war Gods conflict with man Weather is defined by martialmetaphorsfronts clashing air masses striking storms War curiouslyis full of meteorological metaphors a hail of bullets the fog of battleEveryone needs an enemy Its easy to understand why we replace vanishingMafiosi and Commies with asteroids hurricanes and volcanoes Natural disasterbooks dominate bestseller lists for the same reason In an age without greatwars these are our war narratives            Todays paranoia about the Earth Mama also owessomething to millenarianism both religious and environmental Pat Robertsonhas blamed Orlandos nasty weather on Disney Worlds hospitality to gaysChristian millennial Web pages find biblical significance in every blizzard orquake Greeniacs too view natural disasters as retribution Hot Zoneauthor Richard Preston the Alfred Hitchcock of germ terror has describedmurderous jungle viruses this way The Earth is mounting an immune responseagainst the human species  Mother Nature is going to get even            Gaia theorists whocontend that the planet is a superorganism in which creatures unconsciouslyregulate the atmosphere in order to ensure favorable conditions for life alsobelieve Mother Nature is on the warpath James Lovelock who proposed the Gaiatheory writes that Gaia  always keeps the world warm and comfortable forthose who obey the rules but is ruthless in her destruction of those whotransgress Her goal is a planet fit for life If humans stand in the way ofthis we shall be eliminated            But the most important reason why Mother Nature seems morepowerful these days is the media The ascendance of the Weather Channel theUSA Today weather page and weather Web sites click for an earlier                  Slate                piece on the weather Web have turned weather into nationalentertainment We can and do view weather satellite photos of any spot onEarth with a click hear forecasts seven and watch live footage of weatherdisasters on television There is an endless appetite for weather It is moreimportant than sports more dramatic than the news and always changing            The media fuel weatherobsession partly because we can now do something about the weather notjust talk about it TV stations send barrages of warnings about stormshurricanes tornadoes floods blizzards These warnings undoubtedly savelives Natural disasters may cause more property damage in the United Statesbut they kill fewer people            The blanket coverage of Mother Nature exacts a priceweather fatigue The more shes covered the less people care about her andthe more reporters hyperbolize All three newsmagazines turned their HurricaneFloyd articles into jeremiads about worsening weather Time warned of afuture of supercanes hypercanes and megastorms that would make Floydlook like a spring shower            The final reason for our Mother Nature obsession ispolitics As Jodie T Allen in                   Slate                in  a primary functionof any disaster is to funnel pork to important states President Clintonchoppers in for commiseration and photo ops The woebegone victims congratulatethemselves for their fortitude The National Guard is called out to do whateverit does guard Congress busts the budget caps to protect the poor soddenfolk Then the victims bank the cash and return to their flood plain or tornadoalley Economists call this moral hazard Politicians call it constituentservice In the end it seems Mother Nature is just another welfare momruining homes and taking billions of tax dollars to do it
