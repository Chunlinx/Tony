                well whats your opinion on capital punishment   well uh i uh i agree with it as long as uh as long as theres no no shadow of a doubt of guilt   right i agree with that too i uh this this is probably going to be not a big debate or anything  uh   uh     i am for capital cu punishment only for murder i mean you know i think they asked in the recording uh what in in what crimes but only   umhum   if someone has murdered someone you know thats about the only thing but uh how is Georgia for uh capital punishment are they executing people or   uh yeah yeah um not very often but they they do send some every now and then you know as   what well needless to say Texas is uh probably the leader uh i we may have started you know capital punishment back up again and uh i think weve probably executed more people than any other state   yeah umhum umhum   but uh a case out in California what was it a week or so ago was rather interesting in how that uh they prolonged the guy that was supposed to be executed   yeah   and i just i cant see any real value in just letting these people live out their sentences   umhum yeah it seems a little bit ridiculous because of just the tax dollar it takes to maintain somebody thats hopelessly you know just uh violent   umhum and   and uh its doesnt make much sense   how do you feel about insanity pleas   i uh i i dont think its much of a a reason for um i i dont think its much of a reason to get somebody off a off the hook i mean like uh Jeffrey Dahlmer i i dont know i havent followed that since you know it was on the news but uh you know ive ive heard that there might be some insanity there i dont you know im im not at all up to date on that but you know if uh something like that if it if you can get off on sanity insanity on something like that which i i believe you know theres a certain degree of insanity there but thats certainly not   umhum   i dont i dont believe its uh an excuse by any means you know   well i had heard of a case out in California of someone who had murdered his parents or some sort of thing and they put him away uh in an insane asylum you know because he pleaded insanity and after he was in maybe twelve years or so they let him out he went out and he killed five more people   yeah yeah i just dont   so   i dont think thats uh an excuse at all   well i guess its sounds rather heartless but i guess if theyre that bad if theyre that badly off mentally then perhaps its just as well to to end their life   umhum yeah yeah   arent we cruel people     oh i dont i dont think so i mean i just you know        if i i think in Japan you know when crime gets bad they you know they take a few criminals out in the public square and they execute them and crime goes down  you you you know       uh so theres i think it i think it works since most people dont believe in being forced you know   well i say they may say its not a deterrent and perhaps it isnt but i guess i just feel if nothing else its justice i know that if someone murdered a member of my family id want justice done and id want to see them punished for their crime   yeah yeah yeah i i agree   so   i agree   uh perhaps the people in the Middle East have kind of a good idea you know if you steal something they cut off your hand and and the punishment fits the crime   yeah yeah uhhuh   but uh   yeah yeah i think thats uh       not a bad idea of course there thered be a lot of people  that couldnt uh couldnt function for awhile you know until they got it through their heads that you know that was going to be enforced   well this is very true     youd have to phase that one in slowly or i think or you would have     use someone as an example and see how it worked   a bunch of yeah        but then you got to pick who its going to be   well i i was a little concerned i was going to get someone on the phone that was totally against capital punishment and in any conversation that ive had through this TI thing you know ive never met anybody that i got into a screaming argument with or even really disagreed with heavily but i thought this could be one you know it could be a very   yeah yeah yeah
