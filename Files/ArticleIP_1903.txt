                                 Human Clones Why Not            If you can clone a sheepyou can almost certainly clone a human being Some of the most powerful peoplein the world have felt compelled to act against this threat President Clintonswiftly imposed a ban on federal funding for humancloning research Bills arein the works in both houses of Congress to outlaw human cloninga step urgedon all governments by the pope himself Cloning humans is taken to be either a fundamentally evil thing that must be stopped or at the very least  acomplex ethical issue that needs legislation and regulation But what exactlyis so bad about it            Start byasking whether human beings have a right to reproduce I say yes I have nomoral right to tell other people they shouldnt be able to have children and Idont see that Bill Clinton has that right either When Clinton says Let usresist the temptation to copy ourselves it comes from a man not known forresisting other temptations of the flesh And for a politician making noiseabout cloning is pretty close to a fleshly temptation itself Its an easy wayto show soundbite leadership on an issue that everybody is talking aboutwithout much risk of bitter consequences After all how much federally fundedresearch was stopped by this ban Probably almost none because Clinton hasmaintained Ronald Reagans policy of minimizing federal grants for research inhuman reproduction Besides most researchers thought cloning humans wasimpossibleso for the moment theres unlikely to be a grantrequest backlogThere is nothing like banning the nonexistent to show true leadership            The pope unlike the president is known for resistingtemptation He also openly claims the authority to decide how people reproduceI respect the popes freedom to lead his religion and his followers freedomto follow his dictate But calling for secular governments to implement a banthus extending his power beyond those he can persuade shows rather explicitlythat the pope does not respect the freedom of others The basicreligious doctrine he follows was set down some two millennia ago Sheepfeature prominently in the Bible but cloning does not So the popes views oncloning are  st century rules applied using  th centuryreligious thinking to a  st century issue            If humans have a right toreproduce what right does society have to limit the means Essentially allreproduction is done these days with medical helpat delivery and oftenbefore Truly natural human reproduction would mean  percent infant mortalityand make pregnancyrelated death the No  killer of adult women            True someforms of medical help are more invasive than others With in vitrofertilization the sperm and egg are combined in the lab and surgicallyimplanted in the womb Less than two decades ago a similar concern was raisedover the ethical issues involved in testtube babies To date nearly such babies have been born in the United States alone Many wouldbe parentshave been made happy Who has been harmed            The cloning procedure is similar to IVF Theonly difference is that the DNA of sperm and egg would be replaced by DNA froman adult cell What law or principlesecular humanist or religioussaysthat one combination of genetic material in a flask is OK but another is notNo matter how closely you study the  st century texts I dont thinkyoull find the answer            Even ifpeople have the right to do it is cloning a good idea Suppose that everyprospective parent in the world stopped having children naturally and insteadproduced clones of themselves What would the world be like in another  or years The answer is much like today Cloning would only copy the geneticaspects of people who are already here Hating a world of clones is hating thecurrent populace Never before was Pogo so right We have met the enemy and heis us             Adifferent scare scenario is a world filled with copies offamous people only Well treat celebrity DNA like designer clothes hankeringfor Michael Jordans genes the way we covet his Nike sneakers today But evencelebrity infatuation has its limits People are not more taken withcelebrities than they are with themselves Besides such a trend would correctitself in a generation or two because celebrity is closely linked to rarityThe world seems amused by one Howard Stern but give us a hundred or a millionof them and theyll seem a lot less endearing            Clones already exist Aboutone in every  births results in a pair of babies with the same DNA Weknow them as identical twins Scientific studies on such twinsreared togetheror apartshow that they share many characteristics Just how many they shareis a contentious topic in human biology But genetic determinism is largelyirrelevant to the cloning issue Despite how many or how few individualcharacteristics twinsor other cloneshave in common they are differentpeople in the most fundamental sense  They have their own identities theirown thoughts and their own rights Should you be confused on this point justask a twin            Suppose that UnsolvedMysteries called you with news of a longlost identical twin Would thatsuddenly make you less of a person less of an individual It is hard to seehow So why would a clone be different Your clone would be raised in adifferent era by different peoplelike the lost identical twin only youngerthan you A persons basic humanity is not governed by how he or she came intothis world or whether somebody else happens to have the same DNA            Twinsarent the only clones in everyday life Think about seedless grapes or navelorangesif there are no seeds where did they come from Its the plantequivalent of virgin birthwhich is to say that they are all clonespropagated by cutting a shoot and planting it Wine is almost entirely a clonedproduct The grapes used for wine have seeds but theyve been cloned fromshoots for more than a hundred years in the case of many vineyards The same istrue for many flowers Go to a garden store and youll find products withdelightful names like Olivias Cloning Compound a mix of hormones to dunk onthe cut end of a shoot to help it take root            One recurring image in anticloning propagandais of some evil dictator raising an army of cloned warriors Excuse me but whois going to raise such an army raise in the sense used by parents Clonesstart out life as babies  Armies are far easier to raise the oldfashioned wayby recruiting or drafting naive young adults Dulce etdecorum est pro patria mori has worked well enough to send countless youngmen to their deaths through the ages Why mess with success            Rememberthat cloning is not the same as genetic engineering We dont get to makesupermanwe have to find him first Maybe we could clone the superwarrior fromCongressional Medal of Honor winners Their bravery mightor might notbegenetically determined But suppose that it is You might end up with such abrave battalion of heroes that when a grenade lands in their midst there is acompetition to see who gets to jump on it to save the others Admirableperhaps but not necessarily the way to win a war And what about the supplysergeants The army has a lot more of them than heroes You could try to breedan expert for every job including the petty bureaucrats but whats the pointTheres not exactly a shortage of them            What if Saddam Hussein clones were to rule Iraq for anotherthousand years Sounds bad but Saddams natural son Uday is reputed to makehis father seem saintly by comparison We have no more to fear from a clone ofSaddam or of Hitler than we do from their naturalborn kinwhich is to saywe dont have much to fear Dictators kids rarely pose a problem Stalinsdaughter retired to Arizona and Kim Jong Il of North Korea is laughable asGreat Leader Version             The notionof an yearold man cloning himself to cheat death is quaint but it isunrealistic First the baby wouldnt really be him Second is the old dufferreally up to changing diapers A persistent octogenarian might convince ayounger couple to have his clone and raise it but that is not much differentfrom fathering a child via a surrogate mother            Fear of clones is just another form of racismWe all agree it is wrong to discriminate against people based on a set ofgenetic characteristics known as race Calls for a ban on cloning amount todiscrimination against people based on another genetic traitthe fact thatsomebody already has an identical DNA sequence The most extreme form ofdiscrimination is genocideseeking to eliminate that which is different Inthis case the genocide is preemptiveclones are so scary that we musteliminate them before they exist with a ban on their creation            What isso special about natural reproduction anyway Cloning is the only predictableway to reproduce because it creates the identical twin of a known adultSexual reproduction is a crap shoot by comparisonsome random mix of mom anddad In evolutionary theory this combination is thought to help stir the genepool so to speak However evolution for humans is essentially over becausewe use medical science to control the death rate            Whatever the temptations of cloning the process of naturalreproduction will always remain a lot more fun An expensive anduncomfortable lab procedure will never offer any real competition for sex Thepeople most likely to clone will be those in special circumstancesinfertilecouples who must endure IVF anyway for example Even there many will mixgenetics to mimic nature Another special case is where one member of a couplehas a severe genetic disease They might choose a clone of the healthy parentrather than burden their child with a joint heritage that could be fatal            The mostupsetting possibility in human cloning isnt superwarriors or dictators Itsthat rich people with big egos will clone themselves The common practice ofgiving a boy the same name as his father or choosing a family name for a childof either sex reflects our hunger for vicarious immortality Clones mayresonate with this instinct and cause some people to reproduce this way Sowhat Rich and egotistic folks do all sorts of annoying things and the law ishardly the means with which to try and stop them            The deep ethical issues about cloning mainlyboil down to jealousy Economic jealousy is bad enough and it is a factorhere but the thing that truly drives people crazy is sexual jealousy Eons ofevolution through sexual selection have made the average man or woman insanelyjealous of any interloper who gains a reproductive advantagesay by diddlingyour spouse Cloning is less personal than cuckoldry but it strikes a similarchord Someone has got the reproductive edge on you            Once thefuss has died down and further animal research has paved the way direct humancloning will be one more option among many specialized medical interventions inhuman reproduction affecting only a tiny fraction of the population Researchinto this area could bring far wider benefits Clintons kneejerk policychanges nothing in the short run but it is ultimately a giant step backwardIn using an adult cell to create a clone the cellular clock that determinesthe difference between an embryo and adult was somehow reset Work in this areamight help elucidate the process by which aging occurs and yield a way to resetthe clocks in some of our own cells allowing us to regenerate Selfishlyspeaking that would be more exciting to me than cloning because it would helpme  Thats a lot more directly useful than letting me sire an identicaltwin  years my junior            To some the scientist laboring away to unlock themysteries of life is a source of evil never to be trusted To othersincluding me the scientist is the ray of light illuminating the processesthat make the universe work and making us better through that knowledgeVarious arguments can be advanced toward either view but one key statistic issquarely on my side The vast majority of people including those who railagainst science owe their very lives to previous medical discoveries Theyembody the fruits of science Dont let the forces of darkness ignorance andfear turn us back from research Instead let us raiseand yes evenclonenew generations of hapless ingrates who can whine and rail against thediscoveries of the next age
