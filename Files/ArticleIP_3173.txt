                                 Meet John Doe            As the forces of rebelliongathered momentum this spring in the Republic of Zaire commentators feltobliged to offer a thumbsucking retrospective on the countrys embattled anddying president Mobutu Sese Seko who had held power for more than threedecades All the commentaries at some point brought up the subject of thedeparting leaders full name Born Joseph Dsir Mobutu in  he changed hisname after consolidating his dictatorship to Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbenduwa za Banga In Mobutus native Lingala language according to one group ofpress reports the name means the allpowerful warrior who because of hisendurance and inflexible will to win will go from conquest to conquest leavingfire in his wake An alternative translation according to a second group ofreports is the cock whose prowess leaves no hen untouched            In an agewhen national power inheres less and less frequentlyor at any rate less andless legitimatelyin the hands of an allpowerful individual the adoption ofa symbolic personal name by way of an aggrandizing personal epithet has sadlyfallen out of favor Among world leaders today the few practitioners of thisform of personal rule include Syrias Hafez alAssad Assad means lion inArabic and Turkmenistans Turkmenbashifather of the Turkmens the form ofaddress favored by President Saparmurat Niyazov the landlocked republicsopra  bouffe strongman who has commissioned a stunted replica ofthe Eiffel Tower with a revolving statue of himself on top for the center ofhis capital city Ashkhabad            Most of the worlds remaining monarchs possess a number ofcolorful inherited titles Defender of the Faith in Great Britain Custodianof the Two Holy Mosques in Saudi Arabia but these are functionaldesignations and little more than quaint vestigial appendages like a whalesarms There is certainly no contemporary leader with an adopted name as coldlypresumptuous as Stalin meaning man of steel an epithet adopted when JosefDzhugashvili was still more than a decade away from power much less onecomparable with Richard the Lionhearted or Vlad the Impaler The one placewhere adopted names retain an organic vitality is in occupations whereprofessionals can still claim some prestige based on a perception of personalexploits or exotic capabilities such as organized crime

The most venerable among the common names inthe Englishspeaking world for an ordinary male citizen or indefinitely forany male person is John Doe and for his female counterpart Jane RoeBoth names along with the nolongercommon Johnanokes andJohnastiles derive from legal custom dating back almost to medievaltimes in cases where suit needed for arcane reasons to be filed against alegally fictitious person They served precisely the same function that thenames Gaius Titius and Seius did in ancient Rome John Doe Jane Roeand a handful of similar variants are used today to shield the identity of anactual person whose identity is known as in the famous abortion case Roevs Wade  or to indicate as in a socalled John Doe summons an actualperson whose identity is not yet known Lawenforcement officials investigatingthe Oklahoma City bombing spent months looking for a suspect who within hoursof the crime was given the designation John Doe No  eventually trackingthe man down and also establishing his innocence The lawyers for TimothyMcVeigh who was designated John Doe No  argued that the bombing wasactually the work of a broader conspiracy The chief defense attorney StephenJones stated We certainly will contend that there is a John Doe  and maybe  and  Such a plurality of Does is typically cause to invoke the variantforms The Supreme Court this month will hand

Jane Roe and John Doe at least give a nod to status basedon the fact of mere personhood the new terminology seems to confer status onthe basis of some salient generic attributeconsider occupant head ofhousehold user the consumer This has come about owing to the continuingmerger of demographic science and marketing and the tendency is probably notreversible            All the more reason perhaps to insist on a little morebravura individuality on the part of our world leaders One could stop wellshort of anything as elaborate as the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassies oldtag line King of Kings

Arts of Oxford University  and yet still provide anevocative garnish One possibility might be to allow sitting Americanpresidents for example to add the name of at least one former president orother
