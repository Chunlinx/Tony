                                 Kodaks Blurry Focus                         Click            When George Fisher came toEastman Kodak in  he brought with him a reputation for being atechnological visionary and a manager who had figured out what it took to turna company around Fishers tenure at Motorola one of the great businesssuccess stories of the last two decades had been marked by dramaticimprovements in quality productivity and innovation capped by Motorolasreinvention of the cellularpager market Similar feats were expected atKodak            Click            Instead Fisher has floundered In his first two years he did do an excellentimpersonation of a turnaround specialist ridding Kodak of the nonfilmbusinessesEastman Chemical and Sterling Winthrop Drugthat it had acquiredduring the days when conglomeration was all the rage But unlike such figuresas Jack Welch at GE or the late Mike Walsh at Tenneco Fisher has not been ableto turn Kodaks core competenceas the management theorists would sayintoa consistent moneymaker On the contrary Kodaks nearmonopolistic control ofthe US film market has been steadily eroded by Fuji Films consistently lowerprices Meanwhile HewlettPackard and Canon have moved strongly into thedigitalcamera market which seems to be the future of photography as awhole            Click            As a result Kodak has hadto lay off  employees since  and just recently announced yet anotherrestructuring plan More tellingly perhaps Fisher has devoted an inordinateamount of the companys attention to its price war with Fuji After Fuji cutprices by as much as  percent last summer Kodak began making noises aboutcharging its rival with dumping film here Kodak had already spent much ofthe last two years pressing a case before the World Trade Organization Itcharged Japan with illegal trade practices that kept Kodak out of consumermarkets there and gave Fuji a profit sanctuary which allowed it to acceptlower margins on its sales in the United States            Although the actualfinancial implications of the case were not huge the psychological investmentthat Kodak had put into the WTO charges was immense That this was a tacticalerror was made clear this month when the WTO vindicated Fuji on all countsInstead of seeming like a minor blow the decision was portrayed as powerfulevidence that Fishers magic had failed him But while dreaming of a tradevictory to solve fundamental business problems seems like a dubious recipe forsuccess theres one important thing to remember That was exactly the recipethat Fisher had learned while he was at Motorola            Cl Out of film            The KodakFuji case was as innumerable pressaccounts have pointed out the most important case to come before the WTO inits two years of existence Unfortunately for Kodakand for supporters of freetrade in generalit was also a case involving issues that seemed to fall justoutside the WTOs jurisdiction The trade organization was created in  asthe third leg of the world financial order along with the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Bank But while the WTO clearly has the authorityto rule in tariff cases and quota cases it doesnt seem to have authority overcases involving more subtle restraints on trade primarily those created byarrangements between companies rather than by governments Click for more onthe US role in that restriction            TheFuji case dealt with the tightly interlocked relationship between Fuji andJapans four largest distributors of photographic film and paper all of whomsold Fuji exclusively Now even under traditional antitrust law exclusiverelationships are not necessarily illegal since they make production anddistribution more efficient And clearly consumer companies are constantly insearch of such arrangements McDonalds sells only Coke Martha Stewartssheets and towels are sold only at Kmart Department stores often fashionexclusive relationships with designers Nonetheless by being frozen out of thewholesale distribution market Kodak has been frozen out of Japans consumermarket as well particularly since Japan has a law restricting the number oflarge retail stores            The problem is that Kodak really had littleevidence to show that it was being frozen out by the Japanesegovernment  There was the retailstores law and Kodak produced evidenceof state intervention to restrict imports but it was evidence from the sand s Fuji pointed out that Kodak had a larger market share in someregions of Japan than in others and that at different points in the last twodecades Kodaks market share actually fluctuated quite sharply If what weredealing with is a monopoly situation then its an imperfect monopoly at bestGiven the limits on the WTOs jurisdiction it was probably unreasonable ofKodak to expect a real victory            In asense though whats most striking about the WTO case is not that Kodak lostbut that it put so much energy into winning Kodaks history in Japan isactually a complicated one In the s and s the company altered thetint of its film to correspond to Japanese notions of skin tone and I realizehow weird that sounds and also invented film that could be developed innormal light because so few Japanese photographers had darkrooms In the sKodak opened a major research center in Tokyo staffed with Japanese engineersand started a joint venture in which Canon made copiers sold under the Kodakname The truth about the Japanese market has always been that it ispenetrable but only after tremendous effort At one point Kodak appeared tobe making that effort But even as it lost focus in its sales efforts at homeit lost focus abroad            Weve become so accustomed to hearing UScompanies complain about foreign competition that its easy to see Kodakspostdefeat recriminations as just more whining But even if the WTO had torule as it did the decision was a blow against open markets and seems likelyto increase protectionist sentiment at home Still there is something aboutthe Kodak suit that smacks of a company relying on a court to do the work itcouldnt do itself If youre looking for reasons why consider thetransformation of Motorola from which Fisher came to Kodak It wasaccomplished not merely through technological innovation or total qualitymanagement but also through the remarkably effective lobbying efforts of thecompanys representatives in Washington            UnderCEO Robert Galvin in the mids Motorola got protection from Japanesedumping for the US semiconductor industry It got the Reagan administrationto negotiate telecommunications agreements with Japan that were then used toensure Motorolas access to the cellular market there And it got the UStrade representative to impose retaliatory tariffs on Japanese cellularproducts until impediments to entering Japanese markets were lifted Thesepolitical interventions were essential ingredients in Motorolas rebirth as ahightech company            The point is not that Motorola was on the wrongside of these questions although dumping accusations too often mean Theyreselling betterquality products cheaper The point is that Motorola only gotits way by relying on a kind of militaryindustrialcomplex approach to tradeClick for more details on Motorolas campaign            Surprisingly though Fisherseems not to have recognized how important Motorolas highpowered lobbyingefforts were to its success in the trade wars As a result he threw Kodak intothe WTO case while failing to see how much it mattered that Kodak couldntstack the deck the way Motorola had And in a sense its this failure to graspthe specificity of Kodaks present problems this inability to separate Kodakscircumstances from Motorolas thats characterized all Fishers efforts overthe past two years The past casts shadows on him that are too long
