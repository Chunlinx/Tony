New Jersey Law JournalNJ Legal Services Consolidated Plan Panned in PassaicMary P GallagherMonday October  The Passaic County Legal Aid Society is suing to block aproposal to reduce New Jerseys  legalservices areas to sixclaiming the consolidation is a concerted effort to defund thePassaic branchThe federal court suit Passaic County Legal Aid Society vLegal Services Corp CV names as defendants the nationalLegal Services Corp which distributes federal grants toproviders and Legal Services of New Jersey which distributesstate moneyPassaic Legal Aid argues that LSC has effectively debarred itfrom receiving future grants without providing the notice andhearing required by lawThe Passaic office is refusing to join in that reconfigurationwhich goes into effect Jan  Deputy Director Maxim Thorne saysthe plan would threaten innovative programs that have expanded therange of services offered and won awards and broad communitysupportLSC and LSNJ on the other hand say Passaic Legal Aidvoluntarily sacrificed its chance for federal funding They say thelocal organization seeks special treatment by being exempted fromrequirements that apply to all LSC grantees in the countryIt was Passaics choice not to be part of the consolidationsays LSNJ President Melville D Miller Jr None of the statesother legal services programs opposes the reconfiguration addsMiller who is a named defendant in the suitUnder the reconfiguration plan only EssexNewark Legal Serviceswould continue to serve a single county The rest of the statewould be divided into five regions of two to seven counties eachPassaic County has been rolled into a Northeast service area thatalso includes Bergen and Hudson At present  providers serve asingle county three serve two counties and one serves fiveThe reconfiguration is part of a nationwide effort by LSC toboost costeffectiveness by reducing the number of providersthrough a competitive bidding process imposed by Congress under a law As a result of the process many states including MaineConnecticut Colorado and Washington now have only a single LSCgrantee while Illinois and Texas have a mere threeBergen and Hudson have submitted a joint bid to serve theBergenHudsonPassaic area Though Passaic submitted its own bidLSC deemed it nonconforming because it disregarded thereconfiguration and sought to continue serving only PassaicCountyBecause it is now too late to submit a proper bid Passaic willnot receive LSC funding in  That will leave almost a hole in its budget of over  million estimates Passaic ExecutiveDirector John AtlasThat is bad but not fatal news If all we lost was the federalmoney we could easily accommodate that says AtlasHe and Thorne however say the loss of federal funds is thefirst step in a process that will also cost them about  millionin state funding which makes up the bulk of their budget Most ofthe state funding is IOLTA money and state appropriations funneledthrough LSNJAnd says Atlas LSNJ seems to be in lockstep with LSCMiller would not say whether Passaics loss of the LSC grantwould be followed by a cutoff of state funding but comments wehave only historically had one provider in any geographicalservice area The consolidation has not cost any staff jobs butwill reduce the number of executive directors he addsHostility and AntagonismLSNJ originally proposed a state plan that would leave thePassaic area separate because of its size and problems that made itan undesirable merger partnerLSCs vice president for programs Randi Youells rejected thatsuggestion and adopted the plan merging Passaic and Bergen andHudson In a letter last March  she said her decision was basedon years of unresolved problems with Passaic combined with itshostility and antagonismYouells wrote It is highly unlikely that PCLAS will ever be ina position to give clients in this service area the level ofservice and benefits commensurate with the amount of resourcesavailable to themA February  Site Visit Report on Passaic Legal Aid by LSCLSNJ and the state Office of Legal Services supports that view Itfound strengths like a highcaliber diverse staff and an activecommunity education program that includes a cable television showBut these were offset by a poor intake system uneven supervisiona failure to undertake aggressive legal work and a disturbingintransigence by management to address longstanding morale andturnover problemsFour former Passaic Legal Aid lawyers who requested anonymityconfirm that those problems drove them and others to leave theprogramPassaic Legal Aid argues that LSC used the consolidation processto deny funding based on performance without a required hearingThough Passaic Legal Aid did meet with LSC president John Erlenbornin June Thorne says the meeting was too limited in scope tosatisfy due processThough LSNJ recommended keeping the Passaic service areaseparate Passaic Legal contends that LSNJ is acting as LSCs agentin defunding the Passaic unit Further Passaic charges that LSNJis breaching a fiduciary duty owed to local programs by competingwith them for money to fund its own programsThe Passaic group also accuses Youells of retaliating against itfor refusing Millers suggestion to hire her as a consultant in an argument Miller dismisses as preposterousOn the policy side Atlas and Thorne contend that the combinedHudsonBergen entity would not be able to take over the communityand economic developmenttype services Passaic Legal Aid has beenproviding along with the core litigation services traditionallyoffered by legal aid providersThey boast of national recognition for their work in this areaincluding the American Bar Associations Lawyer as Problem SolverAward in AugustPassaic Legal has been marshalling political and communityopposition to the merger For example Rep William Pascrell JrDNJ wrote to LSC the Passaic County Board of Chosen freeholderspassed a resolution against it and local mayors the state andlocal bar associations and various community groups clients havewritten letters on behalf of Passaic Legal AidPassaic Legal Aid also met with Assignment Judge Robert Passeroto warn that it might soon be forced to pull out of many of itscasesPassero says he is pleased with Passaic Legal Aids work in thecourts and is concerned because of the differing demographics ofthe counties Compared with Bergen Passaic has many more peoplewho are poor and Spanishspeaking and receive housing aid and theyshould not have to travel elsewhere for legal aid he saysMiller says they will not have to as no county will lose anoffice on account of the mergerNor will community development help be sacrificed HudsonCounty was one of the first to do that kind of work though not tothe extent that Passaic does says Hudson Legal Aid Director TimMaddenMadden Bergen County director Anna Navatta and others met withPassaic Legal Aid representatives in August and discussed thepossibility of directing some of the LSC money to Passaic as asubgrantee for its community development work Bergen and Hudsonnixed the plan last monthWe were willing to explore possibilities and maybe even lendassistance says Madden But the new entity does not want to haveany responsibility for administering a grantWhat the case comes down to is LSCs discretion to reconfigurethe service areas in the state says Alan Kraus who represents LSCand Youells A similar legal challenge in Virginia failed saysKraus a partner with the Newark office of Latham  Watkinsciting ODonnell v Eidleman No  th CirLinda Harvey a partner with Newarks
