                                 The Star on the Starr Report            The tabloids hit a macabretrifecta this month with extensive reports on three of their major stories themurder of JonBenet Ramsey the death of Princess Diana and the dead duckpresidency of Bill Clinton            Whokilled JonBenet the yearold beauty queen has been an obsession of the tabssince her father found her body in the basement of their Boulder Colomansion in December  The coverage of the investigation has been like thecourse of a long fatal illness with many remissions and recurrences But thisweek at least the tabs indicate the end may be near Each of the threeweeklies touts different bombshell allegations that tie the girls parents toher death            JonBenets wealthy father John Ramsey wasnt as surprisedby the discovery of his daughters body as you might suspect says theNational Enquirer  citing grand jury testimony by the Ramseys formerfriend Fleet White According to the publication White looked in the basementfor the supposedly kidnapped girl but unable to locate a light switch hecouldnt see anything in one of the pitchdark windowless rooms Later theEnquirer says he testified Ramsey started screaming at the entrance tothat room before he flicked on the switch leading White to believe Ramseyalready knew his daughters body was there The Enquirer also saysRamsey tried to convince authorities that an intruder had entered the house bylifting a grate outside the basement But the Enquirer reportsanalysis by arachnologist Brent Opell of a spider web covering the grateindicates it had been undisturbed for at least a month prior to JonBenetsdeath Oh what a tangled web we weave            A pair of beaver skin bootscould implicate JonBenets mother Patsy declares the Star  Referringto topsecret police files the publication says that a strand of animal furwas found on the duct tape used to cover the murdered girls mouth Policesuspect it will match the boots Patsy was wearing the night of the murderAlso three weeks after the murder a bookkeeper at a Boulder hardware storenotified police that a man named John had called wanting copies of receipts forpurchases charged by Patsy Ramsey Police believe the duct tape was bought atthe store but the receipt listed only prices not specific items Also Johnand Patsy told police that they had put their daughter to bed after Christmasdinner and never seen her alive again But an autopsy revealed that at midnightJonBenet had a snack of pineapplefingerprints on a kitchen bowl indicate sheand her mother and brother ate togetherand that she died around two hourslater            TheGlobe touts an exclusive from a tipster who claims that in the hoursafter JonBenet was discovered John Ramsey gave away a boxsupposedly of thegirls personal itemsso they wouldnt get ruined during the investigationThe Globe claims that the box actually contains the sheets and severalstuffed animals that were on her bed the night of her murder as well as thenightgown she was wearing An informed source told the Globe theallegations are totally misinformed and completely inaccurate            On the anniversary of Dianas death the tabsexhume their theories about the nefarious reasons her life was cut short TheStar floats what could be called the Anne Boleyn theorythat is theBritish government had Diana murdered Their evidence doesnt quite rise to thelevel where it could be characterized as preposterous Here it goes Thedrunken driver of the car in which Diana died Henri Paul had more than in the bank although he earned only  a year This indicates tothe Star that he was an informer for British intelligence RichardTomlinson an exemployee of MI who was jailed last year for trying to sellhis memoirs asserts that only the British would pay a Frenchman that wellFrench intelligence would never pay him that amount of money says TomlinsonAside from the issue of pay scales on either side of the Channel even if Paulwas an informer the Star doesnt grapple with why MI would want Dianadead Like Boleyn she may have been an incompliant consort but by then shewas a former one            Into thebreach steps the Enquirer  whose theory is that the car accident was theresult of a kidnapping gone wrong British intelligence didnt want to killDiana and her boyfriend Dodi Al Fayed it simply wanted to scare them apartbecause asserts Islamic scholar Yaqub Zaki the idea of the future King ofEngland Prince William having a Muslim stepfather was intolerable And theidea of a halfbrother or halfsister with brown skin was unthinkable            If there was a murder plot the Globe may haveunwittingly ended up pointing the finger at a really big fish In this weeksissue the publication reports that shortly before she died Diana told palsshe was planning to remarry the prince Now if this were true there iscertainly one person who would want to make sure such an event never came topass Or to put it another way does anyone really know where Queen Elizabethwas the night of Dianas death            The tabsare filled with royal news this month Most disturbing is a report in theGlobe that Prince Charles might be suffering from Alzheimers diseaseThe publication says royal insiders are worried about an apparent decline inCharles shortterm memory and say the prince has turned to a specialist forhelp Helping Charles sons deal with their grief over their mothers death isformer nanny Tiggy LeggeBourke Although Diana despised her for calling theboys my babies according to the Enquirer  a royal insider says IfDis looking down from heaven Im sure shes forgiven her And love has foundan exmember of the British royal family According the Enquirer SarahFerguson is head over heels over Italian Count Gaddo della Gherardesca Asthe Enquirer says nobody would begrudge Fergie a little happiness buthow much more euphonious it would be if Tiggy LeggeBourke had coupled withGaddo della Gherardesca Finally an item in the Globe wins this monthsWhen Hell Freezes Over award According to the publication Frank Sinatraswidow Barbara has set her sights on Grace Kellys widower Prince Rainier ofMonaco Reports the Globe  Now pals say its only a matter of timebefore Barbaras mourning is over and she flies off to Monaco and a new lifewith Rainier            Stuck in his old life is our commander in chief and

TheEnquirer is probably the only publication in the world to go with thisLucy Mercer hypothesis Mercer was the lifelong love of Franklin Rooseveltand the revelation of their affair nearly ended his marriage to Eleanor Itsprobably safe to say Clintons real feelings for Lewinsky actually go inanother direction see the Anne Boleyn theory above            Romanticswill warm to further Enquirer disclosures The president was lonelyand starved for affection  Monica made him feel good about himself Hetold her says the publication that his relationship with Hillary was nownothing more than a

Thepublications says the report will include information on how Monica used acigar in a sexually uninhibited manner and how Clinton used one of the tiesgiven to him by Monica in sexy games during

ever been with                           President                laughs             The Star says the Starr report willdisclose that Clinton has particular ideas about the Second Coming when itdepicts a sexual encounter with Lewinsky at the White House following EasterSunday church services The publication also has a thinly sourced account ofhow in July Clinton fondled and made crude remarks to a waitress at a poshWashington DC area country club after a round of golf Reading the storyyou first think This didnt happen he couldnt be that stupid Then youthink Well             The
