                                 Do Cellular Phones Cause Brain Cancer                        Recent news reports out of Britain are giving credence to the theory thatcellular phone use increases the risk of brain cancer What are the facts            Think of cellular phones as little radio stations beaming voice and data tothe telephone network via electromagnetic waves called radiofrequency RFradiation Cell phones emit RF radiation with a  MHz frequency which isclose to the  MHz frequency used by microwave ovens The watt powerof the average microwave oven however is significantly greater than a cellphones watt output Exposure to high levels of RFmany times the amountemitted by cell phonescauses biological damage but the effects of lowerexposure levels are not well established Since this radiation penetrates thehuman body critics theorize that cellular phones could cause physical damageto cellseither through heating or another form of energy release            Some scientists dispute this hypothesis arguing that RF energy fromcellular phones is significantly weaker than the energy occurring naturally inthe bodys cells and would therefore be unable to physically alter them Theyalso contend that even after long exposure periods the phones could only causea fraction of a degree increase in cell temperaturewell within the bodysnormal range In the absence of another plausible mechanism by which RFradiation could cause damage they say that cell phones should be presumedsafe            Most RF exposure studies are inconclusive They either fail to find effectsor have produced statistically insignificant findings Selecting subjects forongoing cellular phone studies is a challenge since the highly exposedpopulation remains relatively small and many forms of cancer may take years todevelop But one recent British study found that RF may cause brain cells toreact as if they were being heated though no temperature increase wasobserved which investigators hypothesized may damage cell function over longperiods of time Another found that cellular phone use was associated with anincreased frequency of a certain type of brain tumor although the overall riskof cancer was not found to increase Most scientists call for further researchand testing Some cellular phone users are reducing possible risk by usingearpiece and microphone headsets that plug into the telephone and make itpossible to talk without the phone being held to the head            Regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and FederalCommunications Commission hedge on the issue neither guaranteeing cellularphones safety nor recommending that users stop using them And the greatestdanger posed by cellular phones yet discovered is an increased likelihood ofcar accidents involving inattentive users            Click here to read the FDAs Oct  update on cellular phonesafety and here to view the FCCs RF safety guidelines In MayRadiation Research magazine published a scientific assessment of the research to date into the cellphonecancer connection            Next question
