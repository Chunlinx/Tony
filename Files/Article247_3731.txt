                                 What Is Gene Therapy                        Two weeks ago yearold Jesse Gelsinger died while undergoingexperimental gene therapy treatment for a metabolic disease of the liver TheNational Institutes of Health are now reviewing the safety of gene therapytrials What is gene therapy            Genes are hereditary units that carry natures blueprints for making themultitude of proteins that build enzymes and other body chemicals to sustainlife Human beings have between  and  genesthe number is hotlydebated among scientistsand many diseases can be linked to defects in one ormore of these genes There are inherited defects like those that cause cysticfibrosis and acquired defects like those that cause some forms of cancerPeople who have geneticbased diseases typically take drugs that treat theirsymptoms not the cause            It may take decades or even centuries to completely understand therelationship between genes and disease But where the connection is understoodscientists are devising gene therapies that aim to eliminate disease byintroducing healthy genes isolated and reproduced in the laboratory tocompensate for the defective ones            One way to deliver healthy genes is by placing them inside a tamed virusthat in turn can enter the patients affected cells In Gelsingers case thegoal was to introduce therapeutic genes into his liver cells His cause ofdeath is still a mystery One theory is that the virus was still active and mayhave killed him This therapeutic trial has been suspended pending aninvestigation            Theoretically gene therapy could be used to cure infectious diseases likeHIV by giving cells extra defense mechanisms            Though the benefits of gene therapy are theoretically large none of thedozens of trials in the US or elsewhere has achieved a longterm cure forany ailment One obstacle is the bodys natural defense The immune systemrecognizes the virus as a threat and attacks it Another is that the cellsengineered by therapy often do not produce enough of the needed protein to curethe disorder            PBS offers a helpful animation of one gene therapy preparation Also see the Web siteof the Human GenomeProject for an exhaustive look at the world of genomics            Next question
