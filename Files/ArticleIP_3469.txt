                                 Toys Are Us            Ever since a scandalizedParisian populace greeted the unveiling of Edouard Manets Olympia withshocked indignation controversy has been one measure of seriousness in Westernart Of the two women depicted in Olympia  the lilywhite nudecourtesan displayed on a chaise longue elicited the outcry Far lessattention was given her fully clothed companion a black maid in a West Indianturban To a contemporary audience the picture is still disturbing but fordifferent reasons Its the uneasy conjunction of race and sexuality thatrankles the suspicion that for Manet the black maid added a kinky allure tothe charms of the snide white prostitute            TheInstitute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia has been at the center of some ofthe recent firestorms concerning artistic expression and its public supportThe institute took flak in Congress for the SM images in its RobertMapplethorpe show and for displaying Andres Serranos crucifix suspended inurine Recently however it has found itself on the other side of thecensorship divide and race is what pushed it there It has made news not bymounting a show but by canceling one before it opened The show in questionscheduled for this month was to be devoted to photographer David LevinthalsPolaroid closeups of some objects in his possession These are what issometimes referred to as black memorabiliaincluding Aunt Jemima cookie jarswindup minstrel dancers Amos and Andy faces and the likewhat another avidcollector Whoopi Goldberg refers to as Negrobilia Two prominent blackscholars Houston Baker and Henry Louis Gates Jr expressed an interest inwriting catalog copy That neither writer was ultimately able to do so may havedoomed the show            According to one institute curator as reported by RichardB Woodward in the Village Voice  the advisory board didnt feelLevinthal was critiquing the objects he was photographing They werenttransformative enough Its not clearnor did the board suggestwhat mighthave counted as critique or transformation But such is the nervousrigidity of our current aesthetic climate where ambiguity is tolerated onneither the left nor the right that when a smaller version of Levinthalsseries Blackface opened in New York at the Janet Borden Gallery in SoHosome reviewers followed the institutes lead in thinking that only twoquestions needed to be posed about these photographs  Are the memorabiliathemselves offensive And  If so does Levinthal condemn them The NewYork Times reviewer examined the evidence and convicted Levinthal of moralindeterminacyhe evidently hadnt condemned them vigorously enough This wasprecisely the sort of charge that was leveled at Manet in             A majorretrospective of Levinthals work including some images from Blackface is now on display at the International Center of Photography on theUpper East Side of New York City The show which covers seven different seriesof photographs taken over the past  years makes clear that some sort ofmoral indeterminacy has always been at the center of Levinthals art He firstcreated a stir  years ago with a remarkable book of photographs andcommentary called Hitler Moves East Levinthals collaborator was his Yaleartschool classmate Garry Trudeau creator of Doonesbury  Theblackandwhite photographs of German troops moving into the former SovietUnion have the grainy blurred look of authentic reportage from the EasternFront and bear an obvious debt to Robert Capas work for Lifemagazine            What was unusual about Levinthals images wasthat he had staged them himselfand not with human models but with toys Astwo soldiers mounted on a motorcycle and cab push inexorably into the frigidlandscapewith flour substituting for snowtheres an uneasy mix of thetrompe loeil and the trumped up Other photographers of Levinthalsgeneration such as Cindy Sherman have testified to the influence of HitlerMoves East in pushing photography away from the sternly mimetic documentarystyle of the s toward a more playful artificial relation to the world            HitlerMoves East was produced during the final phase of the Vietnam War andLevinthal has recently suggested that you come away from the book with astrong antiwar statement Levinthals mockdoc images have none of the chaotichorror of Vietnam Rather theres a softfocus decorum and a powerfulnostalgia for a simpler good war These soldiers have driven out of a dreamworld set far back in an imagined past one drawn from movies and newsreelsNostalgia is also the hallmark of Levinthals next major series The WildWest  which took him in the opposite direction if onlygeographically Again the medium is toysheroic cowboys and occasionalIndiansbathed this time in muted colors A cowboy swings his lariat before arearing white horse and for a second youre caught by the power and carefulbalance of the tableau In other shots Indians with raised tomahawks andspears give rise to a nervous wall panel at the ICP assuring us that Levinthalis mindful of real history and that his work somehow prompts the viewersrecollections of our forefathers injustices cultural expansionism genocideand racism This is absurdif we do think about the white settlers misdeedswhen looking at Levinthals work its only because of how much our culturaldialogue now emphasizes themand the urge to protect Levinthal from potentialcharges of political insensitivity is part of the same lockstep aestheticsthat seem to follow Levinthal everywhere It obscures the fact that Levinthalsterritory in the Western series is much the same as in Hitler Moves East aliminal realm of fantasy where the most successful imageslike that rearinghorse or a man hanging from a noose on a stunted treetoe the line betweenreal and makebelieve Whatever wildness remains in this toyshop Westasinnocent of political engagement as a childs playroom floorderives from avisual imagination stocked with s movies and a reckless willingness to playthese overexposed scenes straight with neither irony nor commentary            Levinthals photographic forays into romance and sexualityare less surefooted The lonely lamplit couples in his Modern Romance contrived with dolls and miniature props soon after his move to NewYork City in  effectively evoke the nighttime diners and hotel bedrooms ofEdward Hopper and film noir But Levinthals softfocus experiments with sbathingbeauty dolls posing on piles of sand American Beauties and Japanese mailorder bondage toys Desire  dont go much beyondthe genres they mimic Levinthals visual games with sex toys are predictablycontroversial is he complicit or critiquing without being particularlydisturbing His latest two series though succeed at being both While theupbeat Hitler Moves East skirted any mention of the destruction of theEuropean Jews Mein Kampf   explores in luridcolorespecially the Nazi colors of red and blackHitlers crimes againsthumanity We see inspections of nude candidates for the gas chambers womenand children shot beside ditches rapes people herded into freight carsallenacted by lifelike dolls The images have some of the power of ArtSpiegelmans comicbook version of the Holocaust Maus  and for some ofthe same reasons Given the rote piety of so much Holocaust rhetoric theresmore of it on the ICP wall panels openly artificial treatments from suchnonserious realms as comics and toy soldiers have an unsettling power to thawand refocus our feelings            Its jarring to move from the luridtheatricality of Mein Kampf  to the headon propless portraits ofLevinthals Blackface series Again we have some silly palaver assuring usthat Levinthal is aware that these items depict stereotyped images ofblacksas though we suspected that he endorsed them or thought they wererealistic In fact the objects Levinthal has photographed are extremelyvaried and the galleries might have helped the viewer out by furnishingdetails about the items provenance and use Nor is the degree ofstereotyping at all consistent among the items They range from crudelybugeyed pickaninnies eating watermelontheir vacant grins echoed by the greatsmile of the rindto almost idealized sculpted heads of black children            Levinthals title for thisseries reveals his interest in a tradition of blackface masquerade that by theturn of the century was largely a Jewish province think of Al Jolsons TheJazz Singer  While Jewish minstrelsy operated on the premise that blackpeople were inherently funny it also reflected a complex identification ofJews with blacksan identification between outsider groups explored by suchcontemporary scholars as Michael Rogin in Blackface White Noise  andEric Lott in Love and Theft             Of course a layer of burntcork smeared over the face does not a new identity make The very luridness ofthe mask preserved as much distance as it bridged And yet these sadfacedcigarmunching Amos and Andy figureswhich seem to date from the time whenwhite actors yielded to black in those roleshave a racially ambiguous pathosIts as though their melancholy derived from the excruciating imperative to beblacks performing according to the conventions of blackface The objects thatinterest Levinthal as he points out in a statement at the Janet BordenGallery could as well be called white memorabilia since they recordpresumably the fantasies of white people including the fantasy of assuming atemporary black identity These Aunt Jemima cookie jars and Amos and Andyfaces dented and scarred with use stare back at us as unnervingly as DianeArbus freaks but with the added accusation at least to white viewers thatyou made us this way
