                all right and and your occupation is teaching   im a im a substitute teacher is is this Pat im talking to now yeah im a substitute teacher in i believe the same school system we both work in   substitute teacher yes it is it is uhhuh right well i was just trying to make an introduction here   oh okay   but oh and and i havent told you im going to be at a different school this year now   oh   ive just gotten a another job at an elementary library at Barron   well i bet youre youre you may dress differently then for that   right i well not really ive got the every day ive got to uh read to kindergartners so im going to be down on the floor with them ive got about forty kindergartners im going to be doing working with every day for uh you know a half hour so ill be ill probably be wearing slacks as often as i do because im im if im going to be down on the floor messing with them im not going to wear nylons and you know nice nylons and dresses   well what i wear sometimes depends on on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in since im a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater   right well of course youve been at Clark enough that you know its always cold   yes   but you dont know uh i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless youve been there   you know you try to layer so you can add or or or take off   subtract right   and its its interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual uh   i i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools thats one of things one of the things i ask about you know whether whether she would allow slacks and she said she doesnt have a problem with that she just didnt like sloppy dressing   uhhuh   and and i said well you know that was okay and im basically i just you know i wear slacks year round except every about once a week i try to wear a skirt and and in the winter you know i just add a maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer and add a heavier jacket or you know wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer   uhhuh   thats about i dont i dont really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and you know look really   right and well for me sometimes they even have dress up days or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different outfits and you have to have the color for that particular school if you if you choose to participate in spirit week   yeah right right   and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat   and you never know that though sometimes when youre going in do you   no but because i sort of stick to several schools uh im usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it and then many schools on a particular day during uh   right right   i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for uh game day which   right on what Thursday Thursday   right it might be Thursday for the high schools and it may be Friday for the senior high schools   right right so that would kind of give you a clue i guess and and sometimes you get the long term stuff so youre aware ahead of time   yeah   of whats going on that so thats and i dont know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the teachers i know wear uh dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that theyve had dry cleaned so they have got the crease and uh you know theyll wear it with a nice top and and uh   uhhuh   i dont know that that looks that bad but if youre going to tell the kids they can have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too   yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think   uhhuh   but it i think it varies it it just so much anything anything can go   uhhuh   and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at Clark theyre all pretty fancy but theyre just sort of into clothes and then theres other departments that arent and theyll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might   right right right yeah theres a couple teachers up there that that do dress up more than others right   might say right and so you try to maybe follow those if you know youre going there you dont want to dress too tacky because youre  going to be in the same room with them   right well and you always course its a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today or there theres     or youre going to be observed   theres usually yeah theres usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i dont know how a coach would feel if that teaches health or     yeah   English you know English or whatever that they had to wear a tie i some of those male coaches that might really   right they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants   right and a Tshirt right that i didnt ever understand i mean weve got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so   yeah well at Vines the coaches dont do that they they dress pretty good i would say and then they go to their coaching and they they put their shorts on there   whether change then well see thats what i would think   uhhuh   thats what i would think   but they they dont look you know they dont wear their sweat pants or or anything theyre they dress like any other teacher would in in a classroom situation not in PE   right course we had had one coach one period hed teach PE and the next period Health and then a period of PE and and thats hard you know so he just left warmups on but   those i can understand yeah   but uh no i think really probably they could they could uh really and i dont know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and   i dont think well ever get to that no i dont think i think were going the opposite direction its the parochial schools that i guess many times theyve had uniforms for years i really dont really know if they still do   you dont think so well some of them yes they do and and its not at some of the private schools but even theres a couple public schools in Dallas where where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress in accordance with that   it certainly makes it easier to dress uhhuh well its certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you dont have to be concerned about your wardrobe   uhhuh well i i think it would make a difference at school i i dont think we should be spending time saying somebodys wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts too shorts too short or theyve got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high you know i mean   uhhuh   its a lot of trouble to to take care of that and of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what i want and and yet we cant to that either id like to see them go to to not necessarily a uniform but saying that theyve got to wear a button down shirt you know that would that would alleviate any Tshirts with sayings on them but if they could wear a buttondown shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy th em anywhere they wanted and you know and   yeah but i doubt that that would come about that that will come about just  i yeah i i   and then the girls could right i dont no not in Plano   no not yeah   they may get away but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there   well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete   Highland Parks thinking about going that route   uhhuh   so it and then i think thats going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do   yeah i i dont think a lot of teachers are very professional but   yeah i agree with you on
