                                 The Lessons of Kosovo            Hoursafter Serb generals agreed to end the war in Kosovo Democrats rose on the USSenate floor to gloat Sen Joe Biden DDel called it a victory forPresident Clinton and his administration and Sen Harry Reid DNev chidedconservatives who had called it Clinton and Gores war More than a weeklater Republicans remain unrepentant NATOs bombing was unnecessary andcaused the Serbs ethnic cleansing former Vice President Dan Quayle chargedyesterday on Meet the Press  This is not a victory I think that thisis going to continue to be a mess            Throughout the  election season and for decades to come Democrats andRepublicans will go on debating who was right and who was wrong in Kosovo Theystill dont get it The point isnt who was wrong The point is to understandwhat was wrong and to learn the corresponding lessons                            Aggressors dont control the rules Cynics reasoned thatthe war was futile because aggression is the way of the world and indomitableferocity is the way of aggressors They said Balkan enmities were too deeplyingrained Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic was too ruthless and the Serbs weretoo fiercely attached to Kosovo to back down While assuming that PresidentClinton was infallibly stupid and weak they assumed that Milosevic wasinfallibly clever and resolute But just as Clinton proved capable of fightingon Milosevic proved capable of giving up                            We can make the rules Within days of the wars outbreakpoliticians and talking heads pronounced it a failure Throughout the bombingthey said NATO the United States and Clinton lacked the ability or resolve toprevail Pundits assessed the wars prospects with detached skepticism asthough forecasting the weather But war is more than an objective eventSubjective factorsresolve confidence and patiencecan prove decisiveNATOs leaders simply refused to lose Rather than accept the law of thejungle they overrode it Clinton wagered as he put it a week ago that wecould raise the price to a point where it would no longer make any sense forMilosevic to go on and where he could no longer maintain his position if hedid By ending the war Milosevic accepted the new rules                            To impose limits on the enemy you must know your ownCritics of the war observed rightly that NATO was protecting itself ratherthan the Kosovars by refusing to risk its pilots in lowflying missions or itsinfantry in a ground invasion According to George Will NATO thereby exposed ahuge limit on its will ie it believes the defense of its values isimportant enough to kill for but not important enough to be killed for Butby depriving Serbia of the ability to kill allied soldiers NATO leadersdemoralized Serb commanders who had counted on body bags to demoralize citizensin the West In essence NATO held Serb forces at a safe distance with one armwhile pummeling them with the other In such a hopeless situation the Serbsgave up By taking into account the limits of its own willthe will to endurepainNATO broke Serbias                            Its not about who wins Hawks deride Clinton for havinglet squeamish NATO partners such as Italy and Germany curtail the early stagesof the war Theyre indignant that we allowed Russia our old nemesis and newdeadbeat debtor to water down our terms for ending the war and sneak itstroops into Kosovo ahead of us They argue that the Kosovo Liberation Army notClinton won the war by drawing the Serbs out into the open where NATO planescould pound them While complaining that the United States shoulders too muchresponsibility in Europe and will end up paying billions for Balkanreconstruction they fret about the loss of American control of thepeacekeeping force They dont understand that the point of the war wasinternational justice and peace not American power                            Its not about who loses Many conservatives who arguedthroughout the war that we shouldnt have got into it now say we didnt reallywin it because we didnt invade Serbia seize Belgrade depose or killMilosevic and force the Serbs to agree explicitly to Kosovar independenceNATO leaders have left the Yugoslavian president in power writes Bob NovakThe peace agreement includes no mention of a referendum on Kosovossovereignty frets Arianna Huffington But the point of the war wasnt toconquer or humiliate the Serbs The point was to stop the Balkan cycle ofconquest and humiliation                            Just because were doing something bad doesnt mean the alternativesare better By NATOs own estimates we killed thousands of Serbtroops and civilians We destroyed bridges crippled power plants accidentallybombed hospitals and wiped out Serbias economy While Serb forces preventedforeign journalists from ascertaining the fate of ethnic Albanians insideKosovo American leftists held up images of Serb civilian casualties as proofthat the bombing was wrong and must be stopped Now that NATO has persisted andhas broken the Serbs lock on Kosovo journalists have gone in and arebeginning to confirm the scale of the atrocities halted by the bombing As badas the bombing was permitting the atrocities to go on would have beenworse                            Just because we didnt do the right thing before doesnt mean weshouldnt do it now Predictably critics on the left denounced thewar arguing that the US governments motives were suspect because we haveoften invaded small countries for selfish reasons and have failed to intervenein conflicts when altruism required it Unpredictably critics on the rightadopted the same argument pointing out that we had failed to act in RwandaChechnya Eritrea and the Sudan While claiming to have judged the governmentby its deeds both camps judged the current warwronglyby who was wagingit                            Its better to build a law enforcement system than to punish oneoutlaw During the war hawks who prized human rights and vigilanceaccused Clinton of going easy on the Serbs They faulted him for lettingEuropean leaders veto bombing targets and rule out ground troops Now that itsover theyre criticizing him for letting Russia broker the peace agreement andparticipate in the peacekeeping force and theyre still complaining thatNATOs generals were impeded by civilian leadership from effectively fightingthe war They dont understand that the allies compromised with each other andwith Russia because they sought longterm peacenot shorttermgratificationand that such peace requires a level of deterrence that can beachieved only by an international consortium of civilian leaders                            Dont define yourself merely by your enemy For decadesthe Republican Party preached military strength in the face of foreignexpansionism But now that a Democratic president whom they despise has led thenation into war GOP leaders have adopted the arguments of the countercultureHouse Majority Leader Dick Armey House Majority Whip Tom DeLay SenateMajority Leader Trent Lott and Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles claim thatMilosevic was open to peace all along that the war and its casualties were ourfault that we needlessly offended Russia and that our victory is false Byforsaking their intellectual heritage just to spite Clinton they have paid himthe ultimate homage They have allowed him through their agency to redefinethe GOP                            History defies laws Political analysts pretend to explainthe past and predict the future with the same certainty as natural scientistsThey trotted out numerous theories to establish the Kosovo missions futilityAir power alone had never won a war the Serbs had proven their invincibilityagainst Hitler and negotiation backed by gradual military escalation hadfailed in Vietnam Thomas L Friedman of the New York Times even had atheory that no country with a McDonalds had ever gone to war against anothercountry with a McDonalds None of these theories panned out in Kosovo Thatsbecause theories apply only in certain circumstances and circumstances changeSurveillance and air power are vastly more sophisticated than in previous warsNATO has a far greater power monopoly in Europe than Hitler had and in Kosovounlike in Vietnam the isolated party in the war was not the United States butits enemy            Who was wrong aboutKosovo Those who were too cynical to challenge the ways of the world toopreoccupied with the past to see the present and too obsessed with who waswrong to recognize what was right
