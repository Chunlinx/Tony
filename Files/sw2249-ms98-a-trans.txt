        where do you live   uh in the Houston area   uhhuh well i used to i lived there for a long time but im now in Palo Alto California which is i think the recycling capital of the world   oh thats great   so we have many recycling activities and im in in full uh support of all of them   oh we are too our community is uh just starting to get organized about it they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our our things and dump them off ourselves   umhum   and uh   well thats something but it it seems to me that weve gotten a whole lot better um cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh actually i dont think we pay very much extra at all too but the uh garbage men   uhhuh   come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb   i think thats great theres a few places in Houston where theyre trying that out i dont know if its the if theyve done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh bins   yeah we have burlap sacks and they give us one for aluminum and   oh   uh steel one for metals   uhhuh   and one for glass and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags so we have we leave three little piles of things out on the curb every Thursday and the garbage men come by and       uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if theyre still in good shape   oh thats great   and the it really pays for itself because oh then the city gets the money from the recycling   uhhuh yeah were were all for it our um weve got several bins in our on in our garage where we uh you know sort things out and and take it to to the appropriate places   yeah the one thing i wish we could recycle is magazines but they claim that because of the way theyre bound they uh its too expensive to recycle them at my office we have   yes   two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail and theyre uh ones for white paper and ones for colored paper so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or   umhum   things like that goes in those boxes but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines and theres no way to get rid of them it just seems like such a waste   oh it does it does but im sure that they can uh find some sort of uh use for them if you know you know there ive seen talk about uh using garbage for uh energy   umhum   and so you know you could also apply the magazines toward that   well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got so little landfill space left that were going to run out before the end of this decade and its really going to be   yes   a mess when we have to start hunting for places to put the things   oh i know it   we did have uh another novel uh experiment start this year now we can put all our yard clippings out you can you buy these super giant heavy duty paper bags theyre about four feet high   oh uhhuh   and you get them for i think its about fifty cents a piece at the grocery store um you usually buy them by the dozen   umhum   and then you put all your lard yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible   oh uhhuh   and those and the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays   oh thats great   and then the uh they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing and at the end of every year uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flowerbeds   right well thats a great idea i wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our city was so involved in that involved in recycling   yeah   like that because you know ive talked to many people and we wouldnt mind going its extra effort to do it uh   if they make it so that its not a horrendous inconvenience i think most people would   yeah oh yeah you know and i dont mind you know at first it was the the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that but now you know i dont mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we dont get reimbursed   right no i think its its to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up   uhhuh   than to get that two cents when you take it to the store we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans   oh i oh i know it umhum   for cash but so few people uh have enough to make that worthwhile youd spend more in gas getting down there than you get back   right yes and then the plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also   now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags   we have i know of one that the one that we use uh has uh recycling for the bags   uhhuh   and uh and theyre promoting the cloth bags you know the reuse reusable cloth bags   yeah well we can get a nickel a piece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused   oh thats great   they just take it off like they do a coupon they just subtract it from your bill   oh   and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags and they say you know as long as its clean they dont want a plastic bag thats full of goop   uhhuh yes   here they dont want your rotted tomatoes but they want       any clean and dry plastic bag so i keep and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that were saving it to recycle so right outside the back door ive got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles   uhhuh   and there right outside the that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers and now weve got the bag for the plastic bags   i understand uh my husband about once a weekend hell go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out   oh yeah   and hell go pick them up because he just cant stand that he he   well how nice thats great   and uh its so you know he we have all our piles of of recyclables also   umhum   i remember at Christmas the the only thing that im when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they did uh provided a place for us to take our Christmas trees   umhum   uh to for them to mulch   yeah   for for city use and   well thats they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular uh compost   uhhuh   pickup so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh three weeks after Christmas and   uhhuh right   uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse it would have to be cut into four foot lengths so you know if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four foot lengths but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags   uhhuh well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there   and they even picked up our uh styrofoam plastic packing materials they brought uh the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybodys front doorknob with a little note on it saying were trying something new next week only   uhhuh   if you have any uh of those little uh styrofoam peanuts that   uhhuh   any of your Christmas presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling and well uh take all of those back and try to recycle them   right well see thats one   but i thats not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after Christmas   well the but uh something need does need to be done about the styrofoam   well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills   that uh oh yeah i mean they dont uh uh   they dont mash  they dont compress at all and they stay forever   no right and ive seen where some places have taken a plastic and uh theyre recycling them into other plastics   umhum   and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines   yeah i do too the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile it they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff   right   uh because otherwise uh you know theyre not going to go house to house collecting it and youre not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts   umhum right oh i was thinking about you know like the uh the styrofoam used at uh the fastfood restaurants   yeah   that if everybody uh and so yeah i know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam but uh   now we quit that about two years ago no three years ago when we got China mugs for everybody   um   so and the only difficulty with that is that were in the middle of a five year drought and so i its a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or uh China cups to use up our water       but at the moment were using the China cups and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year and then uh youre supposed to keep it recycled every day   well thats good thats uh   yeah   they should last a while   well let us hope that everybodys going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because   i believe we are i i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening   yep   and so itll itll be good in the long run well i enjoyed it   it sure will well good to talk to
