                                 Welcome to Boondogglia            Why hasnt thesteelbending numbercrunching competence of the nerds at Boeing and Microsoftrubbed off on those who build this states bridges ferries and nuclearreactors Why is this whiz kids paradise also the world capital ofboondoggles the heartland of the misconceived misdesigned and misbuilt            Atradition was born on Nov   when Galloping Gertie the montholdTacoma Narrows Bridge writhed snapped and collapsed Gertie would be hangingstill a marvel of suspension design but for one rather obvious fault Herstiffening girderssolid plates rather than the usual open trussescaught thefull blast in a highwind corridor Caught on film the catastrophe hasdelighted generations of science students as a demonstration of oscillatingwave motion            The day after Gertie opened so did the worlds longestfloating bridge which connected Seattle to its Eastside suburbs across LakeWashington It took  years but we finally sank this sturdy floater During asummer spruceup its pontoon hatches were opened to catch the dirty runofffrom hydraulic hoses that were being used to clean it The hatches wereinadvertently left open till November when rainwater topped the pontoons andscuttled the whole show These werent the only Washington bridges to whichdisaster paid a visit In  the Hood Canal Bridge to the Olympic Peninsulawhich had supplanted the Lake Washington span as the longest floater sank inhigh seas At least its pontoons were sealed The year before the freighterSS Chavez wrecked the West Seattle drawbridge forcing authorities to build thenew high bridge that West Seattleites had long sought It was whispered thatlocals had arranged for the Chavezs yearold pilot Rolf Neslund to ramthe bridge Neslund took whatever secrets he had to the burn barrel two yearslater when his wife shot him and torched his remains            When bridges fall ferries still float And ifany state ought to know how to build them its Washington which operates thecountrys largest ferry system Even so in the early s it built sixgodawful superferries that required more than  million in correctiverepairs Their electronic propulsion systems tended to conk out especiallywhen braking causing them to smash one dock after another On dry landgovernment projects havent fared much better In  the University ofWashington added a foottall deck to the north side of its footballstadium It was designed by the acclaimed engineers behind many of Seattlescommercial skyscrapers all of which remain standing thank you But this was astate project When a roof support buckled the whole frame tumbled to theyard line Afterward the recriminations flew Was a bad weld to blame ordefective steel from Korea            Fouryears later Hammering Man  the foot ton sculpture that todaystands outside the Seattle Art Museum slipped its chains at installation andhit the pavement Could have happened anywhere At least  other Hammering Menhave been raised around the world two taller than Seattles None hastumbled            While Microsoft programmers made the company billionsstate agencies wasted millions on a failed computerization scheme While localboy Craig McCaw built his cellular empire Seattles transit agency procured a million busradio system that never worked Inspired as these follies arethey pale before the states most expensive boondoggle and historys biggestbond default the  billion WPPSS Washington Public Power Supply Systemcashtoss Consider France has built  cookiecutter nuclearpower plantsthat work WPPSS used three different designs to build five plants one ofwhich worked            Why does this hightech havenproduce such jumbo turkeys My guess is that Washington is the mirror image ofthe old Soviet Union where only the military and space industries functionedThe Russians built the sturdy Sputnik MiGs and AKs but they couldnt makebras or toasters In Washington the private sector makes fine stuff and thepublic sector sinks bridges Perhaps competence is a finite quantityapportioned between the two sectors When one gets too much watch out for theother WPPSS is the price we pay for Boeing and the Silicon Forest            Not thatthe government cant build anything right out here Amid political and legalturmoil it raised the KingdomeSeattles biggest building and the worldswidest concrete roofspanfor a third to half the cost of other s sportsdomes about  million in todays money Granted this home to Marinersbaseball Seahawks football and everybodys favorite tractorpulls isplugugly inside and out But its hyperbolicparaboloid roof system is arenowned engineering triumph It has weathered moderate earthquakes with nary acrack or untoward ripple and looks as fit for the eventual big one as it did years ago            So how has the county government that owns theKingdome dealt with this unseemly achievement By trying its best to undo itFirst it cheaped out on maintenance letting birds peck away the roofs foamcovering Then it accepted an implausibly low bid to recover that roof froman inexperienced contractor who blasted the old foam off with water jets Theresulting leaks dislodged four ceiling tiles which in turn prompted apulloutthestops rush to scour and recover the roof and ceiling beforefootball season A  million job grew to  million            After readying the domesroof for the ages the county and state decided to raze it and replace it witha  million roofless football stadium and a  million baseballstadium with a retractable roof Im sure both projects will come in onbudget and that the retractable roof will work flawlessly Among thearguments advanced in support of knocking down the Kingdome was one thatespecially resonated with any child of Boondogglia It had to be replacedbecause its roof was falling down Ah the things well do to snatch disasterfrom the jaws of competence Now can we get some of that Korean steel for thenew stadiums
