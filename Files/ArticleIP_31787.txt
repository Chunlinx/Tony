                                 Proxy War            In Brent Staples memoir Parallel Time  herecounts a game he used to play while a student at the University of ChicagoStaples who is black would pace the streets surrounding the campus afterdark When he spied a white couple strolling toward him arm in arm he wouldwalk directly at them at a normal pace The couple would first tighten theirgrip on each other Then as Staples continued to head toward them they wouldpanic release their grip and scurry apart Staples would breeze between themwithout losing a step without looking back He called it scattering thepigeons            The pigeons fearedStaples because of his blacknessthey were using his race as a proxy forpotential criminality Using superficial traits to infer deeper characteristicsin people is common and need not be racist Generalizing from what is easilyand quickly knowable to something that is hard to know for sure is whateconomists think of as minimizing information costs If the clouds turn darkand ominous and it starts to thunder while youre out for a stroll you canfind a phone and call the weather service or you can ignore them on thegrounds that predictions about the weather are often wrong or you can takecover under the assumption that its probably going to rain But using race asa proxy is sensitive for good and obvious reasons            If skin color as a proxy for criminal intentions were aprecise toolthat is if every young black man strolling the sidewalks were amuggerit would be hard to criticize And if the implied generalization had novalidityif a young black male was no more likely to be a mugger than anyoneelse approaching on the sidewalkit would be easy to label as racist Butlike most such generalizations it is valid but not perfect A young black manis more likely to be a mugger than a young white manbut the assumption thatany particular young black man is a mugger will usually be wrong So is usingrace as a proxy racist            This is what the currentracial profiling controversy is about Racial profiling is when police userace as a reason to search someones car or to frisk a pedestrian Almost allblack men have tales of being stopped by a cop for no reason other than theirskin color Its derisively known as DWB the crime of driving while blackEarlier this year the governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman fired thestate police superintendent for telling a journalist that blacks were morelikely to commit crimes than whites But she has since admitted that statepolice systematically stop cars simply because the driver is black And racialprofiling has many defenders who say it is sensible hardnosed policing of thesort that has led to a dramatic drop in the nations crime rate            O ne generalization that can be made about racialprofilinga valid but not perfect generalization of courseis thatconservatives tend to support it while liberals tend to regard it as racistIn another controversy the one over affirmative action the oppositegeneralization holds Liberals tend to support it while conservatives tend toregard it as reverse racism            And yet affirmativeaction and racial profiling are essentially the same Affirmative actionamounts to the use of race as a proxy for other hardertodiscern qualitiesracial victimization poverty cultural deprivation Few critics of affirmativeaction are against compensating victims of specific and proven acts of racialdiscrimination And the critics often positively endorse programs giving aspecial break to people whove overcome economic or cultural disadvantage Whatthey object to is generalizing these conditions from a persons race Defendersof affirmative action say in essence that as policymaking generalizationsgo this one is overwhelmingly validand that more justice will be lost thangained by insisting on scientific precision            Defenders of affirmative action and defenders of racialprofiling even resort to the same dodge in defending their cause againstcolorblind absolutists They say they too think its wrong for a person to bepromoted andor arrested just because of his or her race But they say itsOK for race to be one factor among many            Here is Gov Whitmanquoted in the New York Times Magazine last month explaining thedifference between profiling good and racial profiling bad                           Profiling means a police officer using cumulative knowledge and training toidentify certain indicators of possible criminal activity Race may be one ofthose factors but it cannot stand alone Racial profiling is when race is theonly other factor Theres no other probable cause                        This precisely echoes Justice Lewis Powellsfamous explanation of permissible affirmative action in the  Bakkecase                           Ethnic diversity is only one element in a range of factors auniversity properly may consider in attaining the goal of a heterogeneousstudent body  In a constitutional admissions program race or ethnicbackground may be deemed a plus in a particular applicant file yet it doesnot insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for theavailable seats                        The factor fudgesatisfies some critics but it doesnt solve the racial proxy dilemma Stoppingand frisking a driver or admitting a student to Yale is a yesorno decisionAs legal scholar Randall Kennedy wrote in his book Race Crime and theLaw  Even if race is only one of several factors behind a decisiontolerating it at all means tolerating it as potentially the decisivefactor When its the decisive factor it might as well have been the onlyfactor If its never decisive its not really a factor at all                         The main difference between affirmativeaction and racial profiling is that one singles out blacks for somethingdesirable and the other singles them out for something undesirable Reasonablepeople can differ about whether using race as a proxy is OK Obviously itdepends on how valid the generalization is in any given case and how costly orimpractical it would be to get alternative information When you fear a manapproaching you may be a mugger you may not be able to find out in the nextfive seconds whether he happens to be a University of Chicago intellectualheaded for the New York Times editorial board On the other hand raceis not just any proxy and probably should be used more sparinglyespeciallyby the governmentthan the narrow logic of probabilities would justify            Racial proxies are a tough call But its safe tosay that anyone who is outraged by racial profiling but tolerates affirmativeaction or vice versa has got it wrong
