                    Background        The thalassemias are a group of inherited disorders of        hemoglobin     the most severe form of which is beta        thalassemia major Improvements in the management of        patients with thalassemia major in the past four decades        have resulted in one of the most dramatic alterations in        morbidity and mortality associated with a genetic disease            Regular red blood cell transfusions extend        survival eliminate complications of anemia inhibit bone        marrow hyperactivity and support normal growth and        development in patients with thalassemia major            Unfortunately regular transfusions also lead to the        accumulation of tissue iron loading the bodys organs to        the point of dysfunction and finally death in the second or        third decade of life if left untreated            To alleviate iron loading chelating agents such as        desferrioxamine Desferal  and most recently        deferiprone Ferriprox  are available As a complement to        frequent blood transfusions proper iron chelation therapy        further improves the quality of the patients life and        extends survival impeding iron loading complications        Successful management of thalassemia major relies upon        accurate assessment of body iron burden Several indirect        assessment methods are available among which are        measurement of serum ferritin levels urinary iron        excretion and hepatic iron quantification While no one        method is superior for all clinical scenarios until        recently measurement of hepatic iron stores  through liver        biopsy or magnetic susceptometry  has provided the most        quantitative specific and sensitive method for determining        the body iron burden in patients with thalassemia major and        was considered the reference method for comparison with        other techniques      In the future the newer        advanced magneticresonance techniques which allow for the        assessment of both liver and cardiac iron might provide an        even more accurate assessment of total body iron            Measurement of the magnitude of iron loading is useful in        evaluating the effectiveness of the chelating agent        calibrating patientspecific treatment and in clinical        research as a determinant of clinical outcome        The literature on desferrioxamine and deferiprone lacks        consensus on their comparative effectiveness and even on        the methods for its quantification The current evidence is        comprised of many small noncomparative studies that        evaluate the efficacy of a chelator in the short or more        rarely longterm Moreover a significant impediment to        comparing study outcomes is variation in the method        employed to measure iron burden Several systematic reviews        of the literature have been published        None of        them are quantitative comparisons of the efficacy of the        primary chelators We undertook a quantitative review of        the literature to estimate the effectiveness of        desferrioxamine and deferiprone in decreasing hepatic iron        concentrations HIC in thalassemia major                    Methods                  Search strategy and data extraction          All studies of desferrioxamine and deferiprone usage          in thalassemia major patients  whether randomized          blinded comparative case series or crossover           irrespective of language were considered eligible for          inclusion in the analysis Although preference is usually          given to randomized controlled trials  as they provide          the strongest least biased evidence of efficacy  the          scanty information available for thalassemia forced us to          consider all study types Indeed to our knowledge only          one randomized controlled trial comparing desferrioxamine          and deferiprone has been conducted and results for that          study are incomplete as the trial was terminated          prematurely and has not been reported in full                         The National Library of Medicines computerized          bibliographic database Medline  to December           was searched using a combination of the following          keywords thalassemia serum ferritin urinary iron          excretion hepatic iron liver chelation therapy iron          chelation iron chelating agents desferal          desferrioxamine deferoxamine L oral chelate          deferiprone and dimethylhydroxypyridone The          Medline search was augmented by manually searching the          reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews and by          reviewing abstracts from conference proceedings The          studies identified were carefully evaluated for          eligibility they were included if they i enrolled          subjects with thalassemia major  irrespective of age at          diagnosis treatment initiation or study start nor of          treatment history in terms of transfusion regimen or iron          chelation ii followed patients treated with either          desferrioxamine administered subcutaneously or          intravenously or oral deferiprone and iii measured          hepatic iron concentrations to evaluate treatment          efficacy Studies aimed at comparing the relative          performance of different measurement techniques eg          liver biopsy versus MRI were excluded Abstracts that          provided sufficient information on the endpoint under          consideration were retained for the analysis          Duplications were identified and only the original or if          pertinent most extensive report was included No          exclusions were implemented on the basis of sample size          study quality or study duration          Details on study design length of followup number          of patients included patient age presence of iron          overloadrelated complications at study start prior and          current iron chelation drug route dose use of          concomitant medication and outcome measures were          extracted independently by two investigators using a          standardized electronic data collection form          Investigators were not blinded to journal author          institution or treatment All differences in extracted          data were resolved by consensus between the two          extractors prior to locking the database                          Statistical analysis          The main analyses were conducted using individual          patient level data as the majority of studies reported          this level of detail For the purpose of these analyses          all HIC had to be converted from the original value to a          common measurement unit We opted for mgg dry liver          weight For each patient we calculated the absolute          change in HIC over the study period and a responder was          defined as showing any improvement The relative change          was calculated as the absolute change divided by the          baseline HIC          The mean HIC at study end was calculated for each          treatment As initial hepatic iron load was greater on          average in patients receiving desferrioxamine the          comparison of the means needed to take this into account          This was done by carrying out an ANCOVA controlling for          HIC at baseline A second analysis was conducted to          evaluate the proportion of responders and the  test          was used to test for differences in these proportions          The odds ratio of improvement and its  confidence          interval were also calculated Next for the subset of          patients who showed improvement over time the mean          relative change in HIC was compared          Although no fixed dose of either treatment is optimal          for all patients     an attempt was made to          differentiate what would generally be considered a          suboptimal dose for each treatment in line with current          treatment recommendations For desferrioxamine this was          defined as less than  mgkgday For deferiprone the          corresponding threshold was  mgkgday It should be          noted that information on the specific dose used by          individual patients was not provided for the majority of          the studies where the dose varied over a certain range          Rather than ignore the potential impact of dose on the          outcome measure we assigned the mean dose reported for          the entire study population to each individual within a          particular study Analyses were carried out by dose          Finally additional analyses were conducted to explore          the impact on the odds of improvement of including the          few studies that provided summary information at the          study level only          We considered a pvalue less than  to be          significant for all statistical tests No correction for          multiple comparisons was made Analyses were carried out          with SAS version  for Windows                          Role of funding source          The funding source had no role in the collection          analysis or interpretation of the data                            Results                  Hepatic iron concentrations at endpoint          The mean HIC at endpoint considering all patients          was  mgg Based on clinical experience with          hereditary hemochromatosis the optimal range for HIC in          patients with thalassemia major is considered to be          between  and  mgg dry weight above which patients          run an increased risk of complications including hepatic          fibrosis diabetes mellitus and  at concentrations          above  mgg  of cardiac disease and early death              At the end of the respective observation periods           of all treated patients still had an HIC over  mgg          compared to  of patients at the start          Figure clearly illustrates the anticipated          correlation between initial and final HIC and therefore          the importance of controlling for initial hepatic iron          load in comparative analyses Hepatic iron load at study          end  controlling for initial hepatic iron load  was          found to be significantly lower in          desferrioxaminetreated patients adjusted mean

low dose overall p   findings          confirmed in pairwise comparisons                          Inclusion of additional studies          We explored the impact of the three studies that did          not provide individual patient data by including them in          additional analyses To allow for this analysis          improvement had to be defined for each study as          results were reported in slightly different ways          depending on the study Patients in the study conducted          by DiavCitrin    were all treated with deferiprone          and we defined improvement as HIC that were reduced or          maintained at less than  mgg of dry weight liver          tissue A threshold of  mgg tissue iron had to be used          instead for the comparative study conducted by Olivieri          and colleagues due to how these researchers summarize the          results     For the study by Longo and colleagues              patients receiving deferiprone who were in a          negative or stable iron balance at the end of the          observation period were considered to have improved          The odds ratios presented in Figure demonstrate that          the findings remain largely in favor of desferrioxamine          in all scenarios examined that is the  CI do not          include                             Discussion        Based on analyses of individual patient data from eight        studies reporting on changes in HIC over time        desferrioxamine seems to be more effective than deferiprone        in lowering hepatic iron in patients with thalassemia        major Indeed the analyses indicate that desferrioxamine        not only increases the likelihood of lowering hepatic iron        load but also tends to induce larger reductions in hepatic        iron among responders even after controlling for the        imbalance in HIC at study initiation These results remain        when including data from three additional studies that        provided summary information only        There are several important qualifications to these        results The doses of deferiprone  even in the optimal        dose group  are relatively low compared to the        desferrioxamine doses which in most studies are well above        the recommended  mgkgday This is important in light of        the strong connection between the dose of the iron chelator        and the amount of iron excreted On the other hand the        results from the only randomized trial suggest that even at        relatively low doses desferrioxamine outperforms        deferiprone     Moreover the toxictherapeutic ratio        of deferiprone is reportedly low doses of  mgkgday        have resulted in bone marrow toxicity in animals and        humans Second liver iron concentration is only one of the        outcome parameters considered in the studies included in        our analyses and in several cases only available for a        small subset of the entire study population                As it is impossible to determine how or why these        particular patients were selected for repeated liver        biopsy the magnitude and direction of the potential bias        this may have caused cannot be ascertained Finally as        several of the patients included in the deferiprone studies        had previously failed desferrioxamine treatment due to        noncompliance or other reasons it could be postulated        that they are more likely to do badly on deferiprone as        well Despite the fact that compliance is improved on        deferiprone this highlights the dangers of assuming that        this drug with potential toxicity greater than that of        desferrioxamine should be implemented in patients        struggling with desferrioxamine as proposed by some        clinicians        Comparison with specific findings in the literature is        difficult because of the vast differences in study        objectives patient populations studied parameters        evaluated and analytical approach Broadly speaking        however our findings are in accord with other published        data Several systematic qualitative reviews              highlight the clinical benefits of desferrioxamine        treatment and with respect to iron loading acknowledge        its ability to maintain harmless hepatic iron levels in        properly chelated patients The most recent of these        reviews also corroborate our finding that        deferipronetreated patients do not experience the same        degree of improvement in hepatic iron levels as        desferrioxaminetreated patients     and some project        further doubt on the longterm implications of deferiprone        treatment            Measurement of HIC has been established in the field as        the reference method for assessing total body iron burden        in thalassemia major and therefore preferred for research        purposes Nevertheless the methods of measurement namely        liver biopsy and superconducting quantum interface device        or SQUID are often infeasible in everyday practice Liver        biopsies are neither a convenient    nor        patientpreferred      means of monitoring efficacy        in iron chelation therapy Even less viable an alternative        is the new noninvasive SQUID which is both prohibitively        expensive and restricted to only three especiallyequipped        sites one in Germany one in Italy and one in the United        States      Such constraints lie at the root of the        limited number of published studies that use HIC as the        efficacy criterion despite its importance to clinical        investigation It should also be noted that the newer        advanced magneticresonance techniques might provide a more        accurate assessment of total body iron than liver biopsy or        SQUID because iron pools in the heart and liver may be        separate and this newer technique allows for the        simultaneous assessment of both hepatic and myocardial iron        concentrations            The diversity in study design and execution as well as        the reporting of the results posed many challenges for this        analysis The literature is dominated by observational        studies and nonrandomized clinical trials performed on        small selected patient cohorts thereby making a        traditional metaanalysis impossible to complete The        content of the studies is noteworthy as well Many studies        were carried out without treatment protocols while others        reported results only for subgroups  usually undefined        Still other studies reported outcomes only graphically        that is without providing the precise values A further        challenge to evaluating hepatic iron as reported in the        published data is the significant variation in measurement        units and assessment values ie dry or wet as Table        illustrates For example the wettodry weight liver iron        conversions require an assumption of liver water content        which ranges from  to  percent in the literature            Due to incomplete information our analyses do not take        into account some potentially important patient        characteristics such as duration of treatment        administration or presence of ironinduced complications        nor the patients transfusion regimens all of which are        used to calibrate appropriate dose prescriptions and may        influence efficacy outcomes               Given the methodological caveats and the heterogeneity        of study characteristics one could legitimately question        the appropriateness of pooling the results on hepatic iron        concentration across studies Physicians must still select        the optimal treatment for their patients however        regardless of the quality of the evidence In the absence        of large randomized wellcontrolled trials it was felt        that this analysis despite its limitations would        summarize the evidence in a useful way To avoid any        misleading conclusions we have sought to be completely        transparent about the underlying assumptions and caveats of        the analysis        To many deferiprone may not appear as a firstline        chelator but rather as an alternative to desferrioxamine        should the latter not be usable From that point of view        comparative effectiveness may not be an issue The analysis        presented here casts doubt however even on this premise        that deferiprone offers a useful alternative to        desferrioxamine in patients who have difficulties with the        administration of a parenteral drug        Since this review was completed two important new        studies have become available In the first study         patients with thalassemia major and relatively low serum        ferritin concentrations    ngmL were        randomized to either deferiprone n   or        desferrioxamine n   and followed for one year            Although the primary efficacy measure was the reduction of        serum ferritin HIC was assessed in a small subgroup of        patients willing to undergo repeat liver biopsy  in the        deferiprone and  in the desferrioxamine group No        significant difference in the reduction of HIC or the        presence of liver fibrosis was detected in this subgroup of        patients leading the authors to conclude that both        treatments have a similar chelating effect over a        relatively short time period This apparent comparability        in reduction of HIC is in conflict however with the        results of another recently published study A casecontrol        study in  patients treated with deferiprone cases and         patients treated with desferrioxamine controls matched        for age and serum ferritin levels demonstrated that        deferiprone appears to be more effective than        desferrioxamine in removal of myocardial iron         despite significantly higher HIC in        the deferiprone group     Although a larger prospective        trial is needed to confirm the results these findings        would suggest that a combination of both drugs may be most        beneficial in order to reduce both hepatic and myocardial        concentrations of iron                    Conclusions        It has been said that a metaanalysis is only useful        until the next good trial comes along     In the case        of iron chelation therapy for patients with thalassemia        major the addition of         any good prospective randomized        control trial documenting the impact of treatment on body        iron hepatic andor myocardial would contribute        measurably to the evaluation of the longterm implications        of treatment with deferiprone compared to desferrioxamine        Until such a study becomes available we present this        comprehensive and quantitative review of the evidence to        aid patients with thalassemia major and their physicians in        clinical judgment and treatment decisions                    Competing Interests        This work was supported in part by a grant from Novartis        Pharma AG Basel but was carried out without influence from        its
