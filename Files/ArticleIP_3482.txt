                                 The Pottery Barn Revolution            In theritual bashing of wildly successful retail outlets Pottery Barn has receivedits share of scorn Intheknow consumers mock the home furnishing chain forits buyalamp getalifestyle attitude and its antiqued weatheredcolorcoordinated pseudostyle The omnipresent store has also been accused ofinducing a bland homogenization in home design Everything seems more and morethe same wherever you are wrote architecture critic Paul Goldberger in aNew York Times Magazine article last year The stuff may be good but itaint special            Goldberger whilerejoicing that sophisticated design has finally reached the American massesrightly lamented that it has come at the price of individual variation andtaste Just as the Gap look has become as much of a uniform now as the preppyaesthetic it replaced so also has the Pottery Barn look standardized our homesas vacuously as any traditional style But in the big picture the Gapping ofAmerican furniture has actually been one of the most welcome developments inrecent years It has made good design easily accessible and paradoxicallyopened opportunities for American manufacturing that may help consumers developa sense of personal style            Americans have always had bad taste in furniture Its beenhard to say though whether were innately philistine in our artisticjudgments or have merely been deprived of decent choices Until the s mostfurniture that was well designed came from Europe was priced accordingly andwas offlimits to most consumers Then things started to change slowly TheBauhaus design school introduced the idea that good design could be had byanyone in the s the Bauhaus aesthetic led to the American manufacture ofsuch modernist but still too pricey classics as Charles Eames lounge chairand ottoman and Arne Jacobsens Egg Chair In the s an Englishman namedTerence Conran opened a store in London called Habitat selling what has cometo be called transitional furnituremixable pieces so neutral andinoffensive they could fit into any environment Conran brought the idea to theUnited States in  opening his chain Still big manufacturers such asEthan Allen Broyhill and Drexel continued to dominate the market with safeconservative styles or traditional looks from the last century            What finally ended thereign of the big manufacturers was the proliferation of suchhighdesignlowprice stores as Pottery Barn Crate  Barrel and IKEA Inthe last decade Pottery Barn et al have realized the ideas of the Bauhausand Conran and then some Furniture has been Gappedstreamlined to its purestlines in a way that appeals both to people with sophisticated tastes and tothose without a lot of money And while this standardization has produced acertain monotony it has also generated some good design Many a dish or chairat IKEA or Pottery Barn is of better design qualitywith simpler forms andpurer colorsthan its counterpart at Bloomingdales although themanufacturing quality may be not as good Take for example Pottery Barnswidebrimmed Capri bowls which come in bone or light periwinkle Resemblingyet not flatly derivative of
