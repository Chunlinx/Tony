                okay well you   so do you have any pets   um we got two cats   two cats   yeah and uh um yeah we had cat you know my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies so i mean im used im used to having cats around i like them   uhhuh yeah i like having cat cats around or pets around in general i i favor dogs over cats actually but   oh see im not uh im not a dog person at all   oh im im a dog person i had i guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid right   yeah probably i was allergic to dogs when i was a kid in fact i may still be um we   uhhuh but not cats   not um i wonder sometimes  um but we um we house sat for a um my um my wifes boss a couple weeks ago and um   uhhuh   uh he has a dog and everything we were you know we were sitting the dog and everything and uh i felt like just miserable all weekend and it really didnt dawn on me until Sunday it was like hey maybe youre still allergic to the dog it was like oh that could be it   well the thing i dont like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek   yeah   of the dogs and constantly   well dogs are real high maintenances you got to take them for walks and youve got to pay a lot you know you need to pay attention to cats and everything but its not quite the same thing um and um   yeah thats true   um you know its its just nice that cats you know cats yeah you dont have to let them outside you know our cats are indoor cats so you know theyre not you worry youre not worried about them running all around the neighborhood and you know they you know they they make their mess in the cat pan which is   uhhuh limited   yeah its you know its a pain to clean but you know we used to i mean they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats pans they didnt     oh really   well when i was you know when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and you know and use this thing to you know scoop the take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible but now they have like this you get these liners   uhhuh   that is garbage bags you know and you and you you know the   oh that sounds so easy what i did   yeah the cats do it in there you pull it and take it out and throw it away and thats it   yeah i house sat some cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis and what we used to do was just put um newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing   uhhuh same idea   then i would do it you know everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely and so it wasnt so bad well she had two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling i would put just a little bit of cat litter there   everyday oh okay i see uhhuh   because if i put a lot one of the cats would had been all of her animals that she ever had were adopted is that true yeah shes even got shes got one dog now and the two cats and her   uhhuh   dog there is is basically a reject somebody had bought him and wanted him it was her ex boyfriend and you know just was not mature enough to keep the dog didnt realize how much work it was and now shes stuck with it and shes just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals   uhhuh uhhuh   but i think that for me well my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat because thats all there is to it so you know     so you dont have anything right now   no we dont have anything right now   oh except the kid huh thats   oh right  now we have a kid but he was no completely against having a dog or cat he said theyre much theyre as much work as a kid and theyre harder to get rid of for the weekend and   uh i dont i dont know because the cats pretty much um yeah you know we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out     uhhuh   and um uh its not a big deal really i mean theyre theyre happier when were around but you know they theyre pretty much okay by themselves um and i dont you know we couldnt do that with a dog   thats uh yeah  really true but like the friends other friends of mine have cats they have four of them and if they go away they have they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats you know their so use to the attention that if they dont get it they get really upset and you know they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that   well thats thats um pampering the the pet a little   yeah i i tried to have um figured  having pets so i tried to have a goldfish   uhhuh   and um i killed that one within a very short amount of time           but theyre not that much fun you know you cant take them for a walk you cant you know they they dont they cant fetch you know they cant they cant do anything so ive never   right   i think we had fish  when i was a kid but i dont   my brother had fish when i was a kid i remember that and one of his fish jumped out of the um gosh what do you call it fish tank and fried itself  on the radiator behind the dresser ill never forget that because i remember my brother he came home and he counted the fish and one of the fish was missing and they couldnt find it anyplace they couldnt figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on the radiator behind   uh   well it was not that gross i didnt see it but um  he got them trying to remember we had a dog for a while   oh   and i dont know if we got rid of the dog because my brother was allergic to it my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think hes outgrown now but because of that we didnt have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish   uhhuh uhhuh   and you theyre like you say theyre not the most exciting pet to have   no its like i just i dont know i i just never understood why what the attraction i mean theyre you know theyre pretty and everything but ive just never seen the attraction of having fish its not as much fun   well a friend of mine had um an eel       and then he had a um i forget what type of fish it was it was one of these fish that i it would eat it ate a big other fish and things like that there would be sort of moby fish in a tank   oh now we really get sick   yeah and it i i couldnt see having fish like that i could see sort of having maybe some of the tropical fish that are really really pretty but   yeah like i remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha   uhhuh   and uh you know used to drop mice in its like this is not these arent pets  you know this is gross     yeah no that would be what did they do everyone come around and watch them i mean i guess thats fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house and you just destroyed the mice   yep yeah well   but   yeah well a cat will do the same trick   lets see i had a pet rat  for a while and it was a live rat and um this woman just offered it to me while i was in in graduate school and she was actually a very fun pet   i had a friend in college i had a friend in college who had a um had a pet rat for a while um   uhhuh   i forget how she got it but it was um it was the same kind of a deal i think she got it i think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department   yeah mine had been a a a how did this work a male rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said you know this rat is acting really strange i think hes sick and she said i dont think hes sick i think shes pregnant       and they had misclassified the sex of the the uh rat there and so um she asked me if i want to one of those babies and i took the baby and i got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like half the size of a mouse   oops uhhuh   and then she grew to be you know i had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big you know like a pound or something i dont know how much and i had her for over two years and she was very affectionate she would you know   uhhuh   crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working and things like that yeah much more than you would think   uhhuh oh yeah i mean you know if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts so yeah rats are not my favorite animals in the world but i could see getting one from birth and everything   yeah and yeah i sort of weird for me to have had one too but there it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage and you know it was easy easy to take care of and but   yeah yeah i i i have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they they tell me the same thing i just again it gets into these arent much fun  you know what i guess they can be i   uhhuh actually it was more fun than you would think yeah  starting from the beginning but um yeah we live also live in the city now actually in Manhattan and so its   okay   almost impossible its not fair to a pet to have a pet here or certainly certainly not a dog i mean people do   right oh people   but it just not   i dont oh plus i mean theirs a pooper scooper on New York so yeah   oh yeah you see all these people yeah these stately people and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them its really kind of funny     i was living in northern Jersey when that law came through remember hearing all about it we were wondering if they uh they had any special law for the horses in Central Park of course not   uhhuh right no they dont actually they do they have um the bags behind them but i think theyre actually supposed to they keep them yeah keep them clean but oh gosh i cant even walk by Central Park   hit the bags   yeah when summertime just the smell is so bad   oh God i cant   of the horses   havent been up there last time i was there was fall so probably wasnt that bad   oh well its not that long ago it was pretty recent   not this past fall but i mean fall a few years i mean it was it was in the   oh twelve times of the year   yeah it was almost like October of eighty five i think was the last time i was up up there and at Center Park um i had a friend who went to Colombia and i used to go up and visit her   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   um so   yeah thats not too far from were we live do you have you said you had two cats are they um just what you call it are they breed cats or anything or are they just   no theyre just mutts yeah my wife got them from uh   uhhuh   um friend of hers at work and everything you know you know as kittens and it was before i mean this was before we even met um shes had them for a couple years and um you know theyre really cute theyre theyre sisters one of them is a lot bigger than the other one   uhhuh uhhuh   and  she pushes the other one away from the food apparently  i dont know all the details but they were born around Christmas because one of them is named Tinsel and the other one is named Holly you know   uhhuh theyre both females   both yeah both females theyre both spayed or whatever it is neutered   uhhuh uhhuh   you know um and theyre theyre both declawed at least on the the front claws   uhhuh
