                    Background        There are over  telemedicine programs worldwide with        over  of those in the United States     There are        programs in virtually every medical specialty and the        populations they most commonly serve include those who live        in rural areas the elderly and veterans With the growing        ability of modern computer and communications technology to        capture and quickly transmit textual audio and video        information many have advocated its use to improve the        health care provided to individuals in rural areas in the        home and in other places where medical personnel are not        readily available        Many believe that the growth of telemedicine is impeded        by reimbursement policies of the federal government and        private insurers      These authors claim this leads        to a vicious cycle There is a growing call for        telemedicine services to be covered as part of health        insurance Health care payors whether governmental or        private have been reluctant to do so This in turn has        led telemedicine advocates to blame payors for impeding        development of the technology        One reason for the lack of coverage of telemedicine has        been an uncertainty about its efficacy and cost There have        been a number of previous systematic reviews assessing the        efficacy of telemedicine and related technologies                 All of these studies noted that although the        technology showed promise in certain areas the overall        methodologic quality of the evaluative studies was low and        the plan for the most appropriate and costeffective use of        telemedicine was unclear        This systematic review had its origins in a report        commissioned by the US Health Care Financing Agency HCFA        and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality AHRQ        to assess the efficacy of telemedicine in the adult        nonpregnant population     A subsequent supplemental        report extended the analysis to the pediatric and obstetric        population     The goal of this paper is to assess        whether telemedicine interventions result in comparable        health outcomes to inperson care It merges results from        the original two reports and updating them with studies        published since the reports were submitted to the federal        agencies        We broadly divide telemedicine into two general areas        In         officehospitalbased        telemedicine both the patient and clinician are in a        professional health care setting such as a practitioners        office or in the hospital There is a subcategory of        officehospitalbased telemedicine called         storeandforward telemedicine where        clinical data is collected and forwarded for review later        in a completely asynchronous manner but it was not        assessed in this systematic review because our literature        review failed to identify any studies of clinical outcomes        utilizing it In         homebased telemedicine the patient        is at his or her residence with direct communication        between the clinician and the patient or their        caregiver                    Methods        The criteria for study inclusion in this systematic        review were that the study be relevant to at least one of        the areas of telemedicine and contain data on outcomes of        clinical care that compared telemedicine with a control        group of inperson care We excluded services that would        not normally require facetoface encounters between the        clinician and patient eg radiology and pathology        diagnosis used only telephone care or electronic mail or        provided medical advice directly to the public        We developed a search strategy designed to find any        publications about telemedicine and used it to search        MEDLINE EMBASE CINAHL and HealthSTAR through February         see Figure  We also searched through telemedicine        reports and compilations such as the         Conseil dEvaluation des Technologies de        la Sante du Quebec     the         Telemedicine Strategic Healthcare Group        Report    the         International Society for Telemedicine        Conference Proceedings the Association of Telemedicine        Service Providers database     and the         Telemedicine Sourcebook             We also assessed three systematic reviews different in        scope from this study from the International Network of        Agencies for Health Technology INHATA     the        Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews     and the        Agenda dAvaluacio de Technologia Medica     In        addition we identified additional articles from the        reference lists of included reports and articles and also        contacted known telemedicine experts to find additional        articles to identify and describe telemedicine programs        Finally we also handsearched all issues of the two major        telemedicine journals         Journal of Telemedicine and        Telecare and         Telemedicine Journal recently        renamed         Telemedicine Journal and eHealth         through the end of         Each titleabstract retrieved was reviewed by two        reviewers When the two reviewers disagreed a third        reviewer made the final decision We retrieved the        fulltext articles for citations selected for possible        inclusion in the systematic review When an article met the        criteria for inclusion the summary statistics were        extracted To evaluate the quality of the studies assessed        we adapted a scale developed by our evidencebased practice        center Table      We used a second scale to        indicate the direction of the evidence Table                     Results                  Homebased telemedicine                      Diabetes Mellitus            The studies that have assessed home monitoring of            diabetes have focused on tracking insulin dosages and            used Hemoglobin A C as an outcome measure Two of the            studies identified focused on gestational diabetes one            on children and the remainder on adults Only one            diabetes study was adequately designed to rate as a            class I randomized controlled trial RCT     This            pediatric study showed no difference in glycemic            control between groups HgbAC for both groups actually            rose emergency room visits psychological status and            family functioning            The two largest studies of adults showed that both            the experimental and control groups improved with no            statistically significant difference between them                 Three other studies demonstrated a small but            statistically significant benefit in HgbAC                             Both studies of home gestational diabetes monitoring            found improvements in blood sugar values but not in            HgbAC although each had very small sample sizes and            probable inadequate statistical power to detect a            difference                                     General Chronic Disease Management            Three studies addressed general chronic disease            management The largest and bestdesigned was an RCT            where both the intervention and control groups were            provided usual home health care but the intervention            group also received a video system that allowed            realtime remote interaction with the health system                Both groups had comparable compliance with            medication regimen knowledge about their disease            ability to move toward selfcare and scores on the            item ShortForm Health Survey SF            The other studies described the use of videophones            for patient communication with health care providers            In a study in Japan  elderly patients who were            provided with videophones were compared to  matched            patients who used regular home health services                After  months the videophone group significantly            exceeded the control group in activities of daily            living communications and social cognition as            measured with the Functional Independence Measure The            videophone intervention was a supplement to not a            substitute for regular home health services The            second study a qualitative report of  cases showed            a reduction in the number of homecare visits needed            for seven of the patients                                    Hypertension            Of the two studies of monitoring hypertension via            homebased telemedicine one looked at the elderly            while the other looked at pregnant women The study of            the elderly was an RCT that assessed the effect of a            computercontrolled automated telephone system versus            usual officebased care on adherence and blood pressure            control in older hypertensive patients     Mean            antihypertensive medication adherence improved             percent for telephone system users versus  percent            for controls Mean diastolic blood pressure decreased             mm Hg in users compared to a  mm Hg drop in            controls a statistically significant difference There            was also a positive relationship between medication            adherence and blood pressure reduction The study of            hypertension in pregnant women found that an athome            blood pressure monitoring system resulted in comparable            levels of blood pressure anxiety and gestational age            of delivery as hospitalbased monitoring                                    AIDS            Two studies of persons with AIDS demonstrated the            value of a home computer link to information others            with the disease and a health care professional who            could steer the patient to advice One of the studies            showed the system reduced social isolation after            controlling for depression as well as improved            decisionmaking confidence     The other            demonstrated various qualityoflife improvements as            well as fewer and shorter hospitalizations                                    Other areas            The remaining studies provided evidence of benefit            in a variety of areas             An RCT of a home computer link for caregivers of            patients with Alzheimers Disease found improved            decisionmaking confidence                 An RCT of patients in a homeexercise program            using transtelephonic exercise monitoring compared to a            hospitalbased program improved cardiac function by a            similar amount     One caveat of this study was            that it had such low statistical power that it would            not be likely to detect any difference between the two            interventions in efficacy or in complications even if            they existed             An RCT of an Internetbased telemedicine program            for families of children in a neonatal intensive care            unit found that among infants born with weight of             grams there was a trend towards shorter            hospital stays                 A study of videophones for pediatric home            ventilator patients found that the number of            unscheduled hospital visits and hospital admission days            was reduced significantly compared with historical            controls                                        Officehospitalbased telemedicine          The six studies assessing clinical outcomes from          interventions of officehospitalbased telemedicine were          spread across five specialties We actually identified          another study that appeared to be a preliminary report of          another study in the group              Of the two RCTs identified one assessed outcomes in          patients entering an emergency department who were          randomized to inperson or telemedicine care              There were no differences in the need for additional          fellowup care or return to the emergency room ER          showing that telemedicine was as effective as regular          care in this setting Another RCT assessed clinical          outcome which was defined as the need to have a          followup appointment with a hospitalbased specialist              Interactive teledermatology consultation           percent was found to have the same rate of need for          followup care as inperson consultation  percent No          statistical analysis of the differences was          performed          A time series cohort study demonstrated reduced          mortality complications and length of stay in a          community hospital surgical intensive care unit ICU          with continuous intensivist oversight via telemedicine              A study in a neonatal ICU used a retrospective          comparison to show reduced length of stay with the use of          a telecardiology system     Two studies of          neurosurgery patients demonstrated benefit of          transmission of radio logic studies to avert          complications in patient transfer                                 Discussion        Despite the widespread use of telemedicine in virtually        all areas of health care delivery there is only a small        amount of evidence that interventions provided by        telemedicine result in clinical outcomes are comparable to        or better than facetoface care The best evidence comes        from homebased telemedicine where modest benefits have        been shown for patients with chronic disease AIDS and        Alzheimers Disease The most studied area in homebased        telemedicine is monitoring of blood sugar in patients with        diabetes mellitus The benefits are not conclusive with        studies showing no change or a slight drop in HgbAC        levels        In officehospitalbased telemedicine there is good        evidence that telemedicine interventions provide comparable        care in the ER settings and benefit in the surgical and        neonatal ICU settings There is also probable benefit in        its use prior to transfer of neurosurgery patients        Although there is good evidence for the diagnostic        capability of teledermatology     the only assessment        of its outcomes has focused on the need for specialty        followup        Further studies must be done to demonstrate the efficacy        of telemedicine for diagnostic and management decisions        Largescale RCTs must be done to identify the health        outcomes whose benefit appears most promising If the goal        is to show comparability to usual care then studies must        provide adequate statistical power to show that the lack of        a difference truly exists Small studies with inadequate        power are not good evidence The fact that telemedicine is        an emerging technology is not a reason for failing to        perform appropriate evaluation studies Rather new        methodologies such as tracker trials should be used to        assess it systematically     Tracker trials are        designed to assess new andor rapidly changing        interventions and compare efficacy not only of the general        intervention but also specific instances of it such as a        newlydeveloped approach that has become available after        the general trial started We would also advocate that        journal editors exhibit restraint when considering        publication of lowquality evaluation studies As such        studies often accompany otherwise appropriate descriptions        of telemedicine systems they should consider refusing to        publish the portion of the article containing the        lowquality evaluation study and publish the rest        The growth of highspeed telecommunications networks and        their ability to transmit higherquality imaging and other        clinical information indicates a bright future for        telemedicine especially as the infrastructure is built out        to reach to individuals who have historically been denied        highquality health care due to their remote location As        the cost of these services will challenge the health care        budgets of even welltodo nations it is imperative that        decisions to use them be based on appropriate evidence that        they lead to comparable patient outcomes in        officehospitalbased telemedicine and improved patient        outcomes in homebased telemedicine                    Disclaimer        The authors of this article are responsible for its        contents including any clinical or treatment        recommendations No statement in this
