                    Introduction        Antecedent infection with many different microbes is        often associated with the development of autoimmune disease        in humans but the pathogenic mechanisms involved if any        are unknown Most of the microbes associated with        autoimmune disease have been viruses particularly        cytomegalovirus CMV EpsteinBarr virus and        varicellazoster virus CMV has been associated with the        increased production of rheumatoid factor antiphospholipid        antibodies cold agglutinins antimyosin antibodies        antiendothelial cell antibodies and antiganglioside        antibodies One study found an increased incidence of        antiCMV antibodies among patients with systemic lupus        erythematosus                      Neutralizing antibodies induced by CMV are directed        primarily against the major envelope protein of CMV        glycoprotein B gB Antibodies to CMV gB share some        homology with rheumatoid factor thus providing a        theoretical relationship between CMV infection and        autoimmune disease     An adenovirusCMV gB construct        vaccine administered to mice induced a statistically        significant increase in the production of antibodies to        U kD antibody in both normal and autoimmuneprone mice            Newkirk         et al  recently reported an        increased incidence of antibodies to Sm antigen and        antibodies to ribonucleoprotein RNP among naturally        CMVinfected individuals as well as an increase in        antibodies to U kD            To confirm the findings of Newkirk         et al      we evaluated sera        from individuals either naturally infected with CMV or        immunized with the live attenuated Towne strain of CMV for        the presence of antibodies to three antigens Sm RNP and        U kD We also assessed the correlation between        production of antibodies to gB and antibodies to Sm or        RNP                    Methods                  Subjects          Anonymously coded serum specimens had been stored at          C These were preimmunization screening sera from           normal healthy adult females who volunteered for a Towne          vaccine study Forty naturally seropositive and           seronegative sera were used Subjects were aged between           and  years the ages of four individuals were not          recorded Also included were postimmunization serial          sera from eight normal healthy women who had received           plaque forming units of the live attenuated Towne          vaccine as a single subcutaneous injection Following          immunization all eight subjects developed antibodies to          CMV and to CMV gB Seventyfive per cent of the CMV          seropositive subjects and  of the CMV seronegative          subjects were Caucasian the remainder were          AfroAmerican                          Screening for antiCMV antibodies          Sera were tested for the presence or absence of IgG          antibodies to CMV by either latex agglutination CMVScan          Becton Dickinson Sparks MD USA or by enzyme          immunoassay EIA as previously described                              Detection of antibodies against Sm and RNP          An indirect noncompetitive EIA was used for both Sm          and RNP antigens to detect IgG antibodies Microplate          wells coated with antigen bound human antibody which was          subsequently bound by an enzymelabeled conjugate          antibody and quantitated colorimetrically Varelisa          Pharmacia  Upjohn Freiburg Germany Sera were          diluted  for both assays          The Sm antigen used in this assay was purified from          calf thymus The human recombinant RNP antigens used          included the U k UA and UC antigens For both Sm          and RNP specific quantitative values for each specimen          were obtained by extrapolation of optical densities OD          from a standard curve derived from six points For Sm          the negativepositive cutoff value was  IUml serum or          OD   For RNP the negativepositive cutoff value          was  IUml serum or OD                            Detection of antibodies to U kD          To detect the presence of IgG antibodies to the U          kD ribonuclear protein both immunoblotting and EIA          methods were used as described previously                Each sample was tested by immunoblot against Jurkat cell          lysates with a  dilution of sera and by EIA against          a bacterially produced U kD fusion protein that          comprised residues  of u kD All EIA assays were          performed using a serum dilution of  and were run          taking the average OD of duplicate wells EIA results          were repeated for any samples where the OD of the          duplicate wells varied by more than  and for all          samples with positive results by either EIA or          immunoblot In cases where discrepant results were          obtained between immunoblot and EIA testing sera were          immunoblotted using a more sensitive technique against          both intact and apoptotic Jurkat lysates as previously          described     using sera diluted           Negative immunoblot and EIA results demonstrated the          absence of significant titers of IgG antibodies to U          kD Positive results on immunoblot and EIA or a positive          result on one of these two tests and a positive          immunoblot for apoptotic U kD demonstrated the          presence of antibodies to U kD A positive immunoblot          result that was not confirmed by EIA or followup          immunoblot would probably reflect recognition of an          antigen other than U kD with similar electrophoretic          motility ie a negative result An isolated positive          EIA was an indeterminate finding the weaker the          recognition the less likely it was to be valid A          positive EIA result was an OD value above  If          either the EIA or the immunoblot produced positive          results the more sensitive apoptotic assay was used to          verify the presence of antibodies to U kD The          sensitivity of these assays has been previously          established                                 Detection of antibodies to gB          Quantitative levels of antibodies against CMV gB were          measured by EIA in all seropositive sera as previously          described     The OD value obtained for the           dilution for each serum was used for statistical          calculations The gB antigen used in this assay was a          recombinant derivative of human CMV strain Towne gB          produced as a secreted protein in Chinese hamster ovary          cells     The recombinant gB includes amino acids           of the extracellular domain The proteolytic          cleavage site at amino acid  was blocked by the          sitespecific mutation of amino acid residues            and                               Statistical calculations          Comparisons were carried out using Students           t test or chisquare analysis          Regression analysis was performed using Sigma Plot          version  Jandel Corporation San Rafael CA          USA                            Results                  Antibodies against Sm and RNP          Using the manufacturers sera to establish a          negativepositive cutoff value none of the sera tested          contained detectable levels of antibodies to either Sm or          RNP Table  For Sm using the mean OD plus two          standard deviations Table  of the  CMV seronegative          sera to establish a negativepositive cutoff value none          of the  CMV seropositive sera were positive one of the          CMV seronegative sera was positive OD   and none          of the sera from the vaccine recipients were positive          For RNP using the mean OD plus two standard deviations          Table  of the  CMV seronegative sera to establish a          negativepositive cutoff value two of the  CMV          seronegative sera were positive OD   and           three of the CMV seropositive sera were positive OD             and  and none of the sera from the          vaccine recipients were positive          To determine whether there was a statistically          significant association between levels of antibodies to          CMV gB and the levels of antibodies to Sm antigen or RNP          antigen a simple linear regression analysis of gB OD          values versus Sm and RNP OD values for sera from CMV          seropositive subjects and for sera from vaccines at  and           months after immunization was performed No          significant correlations were found Table                           Antibodies against U kD          Using the EIA with U kD as the antigen only one          of  sera tested was positive OD   That one          serum was negative using an immunoblot with apoptotic          Jurkat cells Using an immunoblot three of  sera were          positive and three sera were weakly positive None of the          three weakly positive sera were positive using an          immunoblot with apoptotic Jurkat cells but two of the          three sera positive by immunoblot were also positive          using an immunoblot with apoptotic Jurkat cells No sera          was positive both by immunoblot and by EIA There was no          significant difference for the rate of positivity between          sera obtained for CMV seropositive subjects and CMV          seronegative subjects Table  None of the recipients          of CMV vaccine developed antibodies to U kD Table                                      Discussion        The present study was designed to confirm the report of        Newkirk         et al  They reported that among the        sera of  normal healthy adults  CMV seropositive and         CMV seronegative  contained antibodies to RNP         contained antibodies to Sm and  contained antibodies to        U kD            Newkirk         et al  also observed that the        frequency of autoantibodies to each of the antigens        occurred more frequently among CMV seropositive subjects        than among CMV seronegative subjects     For CMV        seropositive subjects they observed that   subjects        had antibodies to RNP   had antibodies to Sm and          had antibodies to U kD     If Newkirk         et al  used a negativepositive        cutoff value of the mean plus three standard deviations        then overall less than  of their sera contained        autoantibodies        We could not reproduce the data of Newkirk         et al  The subjects in the study of        Newkirk         et al  were similar to our subjects         female and  Caucasian Although there are only a few        published reports on the frequency of these antibodies in        normal populations those published reports all find a        frequency of between  and  similar to those reported in        the present study         One study of over         healthy pregnant and nonpregnant Israeli women found        that none had IgG antibodies to either Sm or RNP IgM        antibodies however were detected in  or less of        subjects Patients with autoimmune disease have        predominantly IgG antibodies to Sm and to RNP and to a        lesser extent IgM antibodies whereas patients with        inactive autoimmune disease are most likely to have IgM        antibodies to these antigens      Both the present        study and that of Newkirk         et al  measured IgG antibodies to        these nuclear antigens        Several factors may account for the difference between        our results and those of Newkirk         et al  Differences in assay methods        or antigens could be important This is suggested by the        fact that the mean OD  observed by Newkirk         et al  in their Sm and RNP EIA        assays was significantly higher than the mean OD         observed in the present study Another possibility relates        to the negativepositive cutoff value used For all three        antigens Newkirk         et al  used EIA assays and        established their negativepositive cutoff value using the        mean plus two standard deviations of  CMV seronegative        sera     This appears to have resulted in a        negativepositive cutoff value significantly lower than        that observed in the present study using either the        manufacturers recommended cutoff value or our own cutoff        value established with the  seronegative sera To detect        antibodies to U kD Newkirk         et al  used only an EIA assay Using        the EIA assay we found only one of  sera contained        antibodies to this protein        Another factor that may account for the difference        between our results and those of Newkirk         et al  is the prevalence of the HLA        antigen DR This HLA type occurs among  of patients        with autoimmune disease and antibodies to U kD but its        prevalence in the normal healthy individuals is only about              Hence if the association between HLA DR        and the presence of antibodies to U kD exists for        healthy individuals and if due to selection bias our        population contained very few  DRpositive        individuals and the population of Newkirk         et al  contained a very high          prevalence of DRpositive subjects this could account for        the observed differences This possibility however seems        very improbable        In another study Newkirk and coworkers also observed        that a recombinant gB vaccine which expressed the gB        protein of the Towne vaccine induced antibodies to CMV gB        when administered to mice suggesting that CMV gB induces        antibodies crossreactive to U kD     If this is        the case it predicts a correlation between levels of        antibodies to gB and U kD in sera In humans neither        the present study or that of Newkirk and colleagues           found such a correlation This indicates that either there        is no such crossreactivity or that if it exists it occurs        very infrequently or only to a few epitopes It is also        possible that the mice Newkirk and coworkers used were        genetically primed to produce autoantibodies in response to        this antigen        Whether viruses cause autoimmune disease is        controversial If they do cause disease several mechanisms        may explain the association between viruses and autoimmune        disease To stimulate a complete autoimmune response two        signals one antigen specific and one not antigen        specific are necessary     The best described        antigenspecific mechanism is molecular mimicry whereby        some component of the offending virus resembles the host        structure on a molecular level thus providing the template        for antibody formation that may crossreact with        selfantigen Several of the nonantigenspecific signals        include costimulatory cell surface markers as well as the        generation of a multitude of cytokines Theoretically        viruses may play a role in eliciting either or both of        these signals        Infection with CMV is ubiquitous within the human        population and nearly  of humans eventually acquire a        CMV infection On the contrary autoimmune disease is        relatively rare occurring in less than  of the        population If CMV was a frequent inducer of        autoantibodies and by implication an autoimmune disease        both the frequency of autoantibodies in diseasefree        individuals and the incidence of autoimmune disease in the        general population would be much higher than observed by        other workers and ourselves It is not excluded however        that a low frequency of these three autoantibodies may be        infrequently but significantly associated with CMV        infection To establish this will require testing of a        large number of sera For example testing of nearly         sera will be required to determine whether an autoantibody        frequency of  among CMV seropositive individuals and of         among CMV seronegative individuals is a significant        difference                    Conclusion        We failed to detect antibodies to either Sm or RNP in        individuals infected with wildtype CMV or in eight        individuals vaccinated with the Towne strain of CMV        Likewise regression analysis of levels of antibodies to        CMV gB the major antibody formed after natural infection        or active immunization failed to demonstrate a correlation        with the levels of antibodies to Sm and to RNP With        regards to antibody to U kD which may be a more        sensitive indicator of autoimmune disease the sera from        only one CMV seropositive subject contained these        antibodies and none of the sera of the vaccinees contained        these antibodies These results indicate that CMV infection        induces these autoantibodies infrequently and that        autoimmune disease associated with CMV infection is        probably rare                    Abbreviations
