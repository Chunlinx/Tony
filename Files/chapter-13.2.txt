International                Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport Bostons Logan International                Airport was a Category X airport ie among the largest facilities liable to

selected for two of the hijackings as were both American and United                Airlines we found no evidence that the terrorists targeted particular airports or                airlines Nothing stands out about any of them with respect to the only security                layer that was relevant to the actual hijackings checkpoint screening See FAA                briefing materials Assessment

occurred at shortly before  AM and when shown photos of the                hijackers she indicated that Mohand al Shehri resembled one of the two she checked                in suggesting they were Banihammad and Shehri However she also recalled that the                men had the same last name and had assigned seats on row  ie the Ghamdis and                that account has been adopted here

 York the mission crew commander considered scrambling the Langley fighters to New                York to provide backup for the Otis fighters until the NEADS Battle Cab the command

Marr the battle commander at NEADS and General Arnold the CONR                commander both recall that the planes were held on battle stations as opposed to                scrambling because they might be called on to relieve the Otis fighters over New                York City if a refueling tanker was not located and also because of the general                uncertainty of the situation in

assumptions regarding how the airplane would                be operated en route to the Washington DC area The shortest time frame assumes                maximum speed without regard to overspeed warnings a straightline path and no                time allowed for maneuvering or slowing to aim and crash the airplane into its                target The probable time frame allows for speeds consistent with the observed                operation of the airplane prior to its final maneuvers and crash as well as for                maneuvers and slowing in the DC area to take aim According to radar data the                fighters from Langley Air Force Base arrived over Washington at about  AM Two                of the three Langley fighters were fully armed ie with missiles and guns the
