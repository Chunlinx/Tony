              well we just had a uh family reunion last summer as it turns out   uh oh did you   and uh the way it usually works is my fathers father all of his children which is all my aunts and uncles uh have traditionally had this rotating schedule sort of thing   umhum   and uh would go to one of the brothers and sisters or my aunts and uncles or my father and theyd plan it and go somewhere exotic and invite all the cousins and so thats kind of the framework that weve been working under   uhhuh well ours is similar to that although it does not fall on anybody in particular uh of course back when my grandparents were alive they always did it and then it seems like our parents kind of let it slide so   umhum   cousins myself and my cousins have started taking this up recently and weve had one oh a few years ago and what we did was uh since we didnt werent sure of all the addresses and what have you that we started sending out flyers a year beforehand and uh   so a pretty big adventure there   yes you know trying to see who knew where who else lived and what have you and also gave them a little questionnaire to fill out as to what would be the most convenient time we gave them a couple of choices there uh time and place whether they would like to go back to our quote old hometown or someplace in between  for all of us   so so how many generations were you trying to round up was this just like from your grandparents on down or we you trying to get second and third cousins and   yes uhhuh yes just you know anybody that was in the family mostly cousins second cousins and what have you and their families and anybody that   umhum   you know wanted to we wound up going to um since i was i was born in Arkansas and thats what we considered our hometown we wound up going to Biloxi Mississippi   umhum   and we uh of course called ahead and got reservations for everyone and uh it turned out real well because the children then had a swimming pool and what have you and it gave us a chance to get reacquainted without all the burden falling on somebody else   that sounds like a good way to do it because what happens with with our system is you know the the family whos turns it comes and and they come every oh lets see every two years every three years something like that   uhhuh   um  generally finds themselves really doing a lot of organization you know they wherever they decide to go theyre responsible for deciding what games that are going to be played and what food the and whos going to bring what and   uhhuh   they dont bring everything but just making the assignments and everything turns out to be kind of a chore   yes it i   and uh was my familys shot just this last summer and uh my sister ended up doing most of the work       and uh weve decided all the all the my brothers and sisters are pretty much grown up now were all married we all have our own kids and its kind of looking like this business of getting all the other cousins my cousins together is just   umhum uhhuh   not really working out so well   uhhuh well that could be   because my children are are now have cousins of their own that theyd rather get with and and so i think whats going to happen in the future is it will be from my father on down and and all of his descendants and and those those cousins so   uhhuh umhum   were were kind of dissipating as we get bigger and bigger here   well we have a pretty small family anyway so uh were only sixty two you know with our cousins and so forth and like my children   yeah   have no cousins no first cousins   well thats kind of sad   so it its like i say our familys dwindling here   thats yeah well my dads one of about eight children and im one of nine       and uh all of my aunts and uncles all have lots of kids so we had lots of cousins by the time you get all of them and their kids together its   oh i bet   its a big undertaking you know we have to find a a big substantially large place just to get everything set up     umhum   and uh what we did this last summer is my sister used to work for uh uh kind of uh a canyon retreat for uh uh disabled children   right uhhuh umhum   and uh since she was an employee she knew what the schedule was and knew when itd be free signed up and and reserved and paid for the place so so we could all show up and it was nice you know therere several cabins there swimming pool and horses and all that and it and we filled the place up   umhum yeah well thats thats good thats well like i say it uh we  have been talking about again this well another cousin and i that seem to want to do this all the time that um weve been talking about getting together for another one because it has been quite a few years now and well probably go the same route that we did before because we had a good response   back back to Mississippi   well i dont know were going give them another choice
