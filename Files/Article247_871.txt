                                 Mother Truckers            The New York Timesand Washington Post lead with the apparent victory inNigerias first free election in sixteen years of Gen Olusegun Obasanjo Bothpapers report that the defeated challenger has charged vote fraud The Los AngelesTimes goes with word that a congressional study to be released todayconcludes that despite the much improved air quality in the Los Angeles BasinAngelenos are still breathing unusually dangerous levels of cancercausingpollutants yielding a risk of cancer  times the safety standard establishedby the Clean Air Act USA Today leads with Janet Renos request that a federalcommission study the legality of taking DNA samples from every person arrestedin the US as opposed to the current practice of taking them only from thoseconvicted of violent crimes and sex offenses An inside story at the WPreminds just how pressing this issue is with a report that research scientistsare working on a palmsized DNA lab that cops could use on blood saliva orsemen at a fresh crime scene to clear or implicate suspects within minutes            Both Times report that the margin of victory in Nigeria was millions of votes and that therefore thefraud observed on behalf of both candidates by international election monitorsincluding Jimmy Carter probably did not affect the outcome Given thatallegations of fraud are the spine of the Nigeria story both papers are rathervague about what is thought to have gone on The NYT goes no furtherthan quoting Carter as saying hed observed stuffed ballotboxes and inflatedvote tallies Hes also quoted referring to results that were manipulatedbut the paper doesnt explain how this differs from the other two infractionsThe WP notes that in one location residents complained about beingunable to vote and leaves it at that Also both papers say Obasanjo was aformer military ruler of the country but neither mentions in their capsulegovernmental histories when he ruled or under what circumstances he ceaseddoing so            The LAT reports that the congressional bad air news about LA willprobably spur the EPA to establish a nationwide network for monitoringcancercausing pollutants in the air The story says that despite the breathingbummer it used to be  percent worse before the Clean Air Act was adopted in Some of the biggest news here is buried after the jump For instancewhy wait until the th paragraph to reveal that the information in the studywas previously collected by the state of California which never released itOr until the nd paragraph to mention that the risks of getting cancer fromthe Socal air are still much lower about  times lower than the risks ofgetting it from cigarettes            The WP front says that a comprehensive study released yesterdayconcludes that mothers who work outside the home are not harming theirchildren The story says that via standardized tests and parent interviewsthe study concluded children whose mothers worked during the first three yearsafter giving birth were not significantly different from those with unemployedmothers But since according to the Post  the variables consideredincluded how many hours weekly the mother was employed and whether periods ofunemployment were interspersed with her working its curious that the storydidnt include any comparisons across those parameters Do the children ofmothers who work only ten hours a week or who knock off completely during thesummer fare better than those who work more The paper doesnt say It alsowould have been interesting if the paper had mentioned whether the studysauthor psychologist Elisabeth Harvey has any children Ditto for the statusof the Post reporter here Barbara Vobejda            The LAT s Column One describes the blooming of a littleknowneconomic phenomenon cropping up here and there in small communities threatenedby the outflow of local cash to say big retail chain stores in the nearbycity the creation of local currencies good only in town There are now saysthe paper  such local denominations like the Ithaca New York HOUR theoriginalcreated nine years ago the Berkeley BREAD and Kansas CitysMissouri or Kansas The paper doesnt say Barter Bucks Surprisingly localcurrency is clearly legal US law prohibits local governments issuing moneybut not nonprofit collectives            The NYT
