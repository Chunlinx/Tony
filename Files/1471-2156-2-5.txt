                    Background        For the yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae glucose is        the preferred carbon source When glucose is present in the        growth media transcription of a large number of genes        encoding products involved in the metabolism of alternative        carbon sources is repressed for reviews see            These genes include the         GAL SUC MAL and         STA genes required respectively        for the utilization of galactose sucroseraffinose        maltose and starch        At many of these genes glucose repression is mediated        at least in part by the glucosedependent repressor Mig        a zincfinger protein that binds         in vitro to DNA consensus sites        consisting of a GCrich core and flanking AT sequences           Mig is thought to bind to several promoters including                GAL GAL SUC and         MAL and to effect transcriptional        repression by interacting with the corepressor complex        SsnTup     Migs activity is regulated by        phosphorylation and subcellular localization in high        glucose Mig protein is hypophosphorylated and in the        nucleus where it can repress transcription upon        withdrawal of glucose Mig is rapidly phosphorylated and        transported into the cytoplasm   This regulated        phosphorylation requires the function of the SnfSnf        kinase complex          Deletion of         MIG however only partially        relieves glucose repression at promoters such as         SUC whereas deletion of either         SSN or         TUP completely abolishes glucose        repression Moreover the         STA gene of         S cerevisiae var         diastaticus which is also repressed        by glucose is unaffected by         mig   Therefore other        proteins in addition to Mig are required for glucose        repression One of these proteins is Mig which shares        sequence similarity with Mig in their zinc finger regions           Genetic analysis suggests that Mig plays a        minor role relative to Mig        Recently a previously uncharacterized gene         NRG Negative regulator of        glucoserepressed genes was shown to be required for        glucose repression of the         STA gene in         S cerevisiae var         diastaticus   These studies        demonstrated that LexANrg behaves as a repressor of a        reporter construct and that this repression is dependent on        glucose Ssn and Tup In addition Nrg and Ssn        interact with each other in twohybrid and GST pulldown        assays indicating that Nrg may repress via the same        pathway as Mig Consistent with these results Nrg        appears to bind to two sites within the         STA promoter        The         SUC gene of         S cerevisiae has been extensively        studied with respect to its glucose repression           Glucose repression of         SUC is mediated by SsnTup and         SUC has two Mig binding sites in        its regulatory region Additionally in high glucose its        promoter is also occupied by positioned nucleosomes which        cause transcriptional repression themselves           Derepression in low glucose is correlated with a loss of        both Mig and nucleosomemediated repression although the        precise relationship between the two pathways is not        clear        Genetic screens have identified a large number of genes        named         SNF Sucrose NonFermenting that are        required for derepression of         SUC transcription in the absence of        glucose     Genetic analyses and subsequent        studies have traditionally divided         SNF genes into two groups One group        encodes the protein kinase Snf and its associated        regulator Snf required to antagonize the repression        caused by Mig    The other group consists of        members of the SwiSnf complex required to counter the        repressive effects of chromatin by remodeling nucleosomes        in an ATPdependent manner for review see          Suppressors of         swisnf mutations such as         spt do not suppress         snf   and         ssn a strong suppressor of         snf only partially suppress         swisnf mutations          In this work we report the identification of Nrg in a        genetic screen for new regulators of         SUC transcription We show that Nrg        plays a role in the glucose repression of         SUC and         GAL genes in         S cerevisiae Thus at these genes        Mig Mig and Nrg are partially redundant for mediating        repression by glucose Consistent with our findings recent        results have demonstrated an interaction between Snf and        Nrg   We also present experiments that test the        genetic interactions between         mig nrg and deletions of various        genes encoding activators that function at the         SUC promoter                    Results                  Isolation of a highcopynumber suppressor of          snf          The SwiSnf complex is required for normal levels of          expression of           SUC when cells are grown in low          glucose To identify factors that might be functionally          related to SwiSnf we screened for highcopynumber          plasmids that could suppress a           snf mutation see Materials and          Methods To sensitize the screen we used an allele of           SUC SUC that allows an          elevated level of           SUC transcription in the absence          of SwiSnf   The           SUC mutation is a single base          pair change AT to GC at position  relative to the           SUC ATG           SUC strains still have a Raf          phenotype in a           snf mutant          To identify highcopynumber suppressor candidates we          used a  circle library to transform the           snf SUC strain FY Table           and screened  transformants for those with a Raf          phenotype Eightytwo candidates were identified  of          which contained the SNF gene Among the remaining          plasmids most conferred a weak Raf phenotype We          focused on the candidate that conferred the strongest Raf          phenotype This plasmid contained a chromosome IV          genomic fragment that spans from within the           NRG gene open reading frame          YDRC through the           HEM gene YDRW Subcloning          experiments identified the partial           NRG clone as the sequence          responsible for suppression of           snf and demonstrated that this          suppression occurred in both           SUC and           SUC genetic backgrounds Figure                              NRG is predicted to encode a          protein of  amino acids with two C            H            zinc fingers in the carboxyl          terminus Sequence analysis revealed that the  plasmid          that confers suppression of           snf encodes just the amino          terminal region of Nrg lacking the zinc fingers To          test if the complete           NRG gene causes the same high copy          number phenotype we subcloned the complete           NRG gene into a  plasmid and          tested it for suppression of           snf Our results demonstrate that          the complete           NRG gene on a  plasmid does not          suppress           snf Figure                           NRGencodes a repressor of transcription          To characterize further the role of Nrg with respect          to           SUC transcription we constructed          and analyzed an           nrg mutant The           nrg mutant grows normally on          media containing glucose sucrose or galactose          demonstrating that           NRG is not essential for grwoth          and that           nrg mutants can utilize several          different carbon sources          To test for the requirement for Nrg in glucose          repression we tested growth of an           nrg mutant on YP sucrose media          containing the glucose analog deoxyglucose DG          DG causes glucose repression but cannot be used as a          carbon source by           S cerevisiae Therefore wildtype          cells do not grow on YP sucrose plates that contain DG          due to glucose repression of           SUC However strains defective          for glucose repression can grow on this medium as they          express           SUC even in the presence of DG          We found that an           nrg mutant was able to grow on YP          sucrose plus DG suggesting that           nrg mutants are indeed defective          for glucose repression To assess the role of Nrg          relative to the two other factors known to be required          for glucose repression Mig and Mig we compared the          mutant phenotypes caused by           nrg mig and           mig as well as testing          combinations of these deletions We observed that the          three single mutants grow with different strengths on YP          sucrose DG plates in the order           mig  nrg  mig Figure           The double and triple mutants had stronger phenotypes          than the single mutants Figure  These results          strongly suggest that Nrg Mig and Mig are each          required for glucose repression at the           SUC locus with Mig playing the          major role We also tested growth of these strains on YP          galactose  DG plates and found that only the triple          mutant was able to grow albeit weakly on this medium          perhaps because galactose is a poor carbon source data          not shown This suggests that each of these three          proteins contributed to glucose repression of the           GAL genes                          Glucose repression of transcription is defective in          nrg          To test whether the           nrg phenotype on DG plates is          caused by altered transcription we performed Northern          analyses to           SUC mRNA levels Under repressing          conditions  glucose the level of           SUC mRNA was increased by          twotofour fold in an           nrg strain compared to a          wildtype control Figure A Consistent with previously          published results a           mig mutant had a nine          tofourteen fold increase in           SUC mRNA levels while a           mig mutant had no detectable          defect in glucose repression of           SUC    We also analyzed the                    SUC mRNA levels in double and          triple mutant combinations In general multiple          mutations caused greater derepression up to fold for          the triple mutant           nrg mig mig Figure A          These data demonstrate that Nrg Mig and Mig all          contribute to the glucose repression of           SUC           We also tested if an           nrg affects glucose repression of          the           GAL genes as described in Materials          and Methods Both           nrg and           mig mutations cause a defect in          the glucose repression of           GAL and           GAL whereas           mig alone had no effect Figure          B As for           SUC additive effects were          observed in double and triple mutant strains up to a          fold effect for the           nrg mig mig triple mutant          Figure B These data indicate that all three proteins          are involved in glucose repression of           GALGAL with Mig playing only          a minor role                          Deletion of MIGor NRGsuppresses mutations in both          SNFand SWISNFgenes          Activation of           SUC transcription depends upon          both the SnfSnf kinase complex and the SwiSnf          nucleosome remodeling complex To address the          relationship of Nrg to both complexes and to compare it          to Mig we tested the abilities of           nrg and           mig to suppress the Gal  Suc           and Raf phenotypes of mutations in           SNF and           SWISNF genes          Our results Figure  show that both           nrg and           mig suppress albeit sometimes          weakly mutations in both           SNF and           SWISNF genes With respect to          suppression of           snf mig is the stronger          suppressor with suppression detectable for the Gal          phenotype Figure A The observed suppression by           mig is consistent with previous          results   The           nrg mutation did not detectably          suppress either the Suc or Raf phenotypes caused by           snf With respect to           swisnf mutations we tested          suppression of both           snf and           swp and observed weak          suppression of the Gal and Suc phenotypes Figure B          Suppression of the Raf phenotype was not detectable          There appear to be some genespecific interactions as          suppression of           swp by           mig was stronger than the          suppression observed for the other pairs tested                            Discussion        Our results demonstrate that Nrg plays a role in        glucose repression of the         SUC and         GAL genes of         S cerevisiae Consistent with a role        in glucose repression an         nrg mutation suppresses the defects        of a         snf mutant Recent results from an        independent study have demonstrated an interaction between        Snf and Nrg   Our results also suggest that Nrg is        partially redundant with two other factors required for        glucose repression Mig and Mig At         SUC and         GAL all three proteins appear to        be involved in glucose repression because double and        tripledeletion mutations have additive effects        Interestingly both         nrg and         mig can also suppress the defects        caused by mutations in genes encoding members of the        SwiSnf complex        While Nrg Mig and Mig are partially redundant        current evidence suggestions that they do not function in        the same relative fashion at all glucoserepressible        promoters For example while         mig and         nrg cause comparable defects at         GALGAL nrg causes a weaker        defect at         SUC Mig appears to have only a        minimal function at either promoter In addition Nrg is        the major repressor at         STA whose glucoserepression does        not require Mig   Therefore some genespecific        specialization exists among these three glucosedependent        repressors        A previous study of Nrg provided evidence that it        interacts with Ssn and confers repression by recruitment        of SsnTup   We initially identified         NRG in our studies by the isolation        of a highcopynumber plasmid encoding a fragment of Nrg        lacking the zincfinger domain Likely the phenotype        caused by this plasmid is caused by interference of        repression by SsnTup        Our studies have not yet distinguished between a direct        or indirect effect of Nrg on glucose repression at         SUC and         GALGAL One possible indirect        effect of Nrg could be by regulation of         MIG transcription However Northern        analysis showed that         MIG mRNA levels are unaffected by an                nrg mutation H Zhou and F        Winston unpublished data We tested Nrg for binding to        the         SUC promoter and those experiments        are briefly summarized here We screened for DNA binding of        Nrg to the         SUC promoter region using a        previously described GSTNrg fusion protein   and a        gel shift assay Our results demonstrated specific DNA        binding to two sites within the  to  region  of         SUC H Zhou and F Winston        unpublished results However a deletion of this region        does not alter         SUC expression Based on the        similarity between the zinc fingers of Nrg and Mig and        our binding studies the binding site of Nrg may contain a        GCrich core Another such site in the         SUC promoter may occur at  with        the sequence AGGCCCA Although we did not detect a gel        shift of a fragment containing this site it is still        possible that it is recognized and bound by Nrg         in vivo Furthermore although an        Nrg consensus binding   exists at  of         SUC we were unable to detect        binding to this site by GSTNrg This region also did not        compete the binding that we detected by GSTNrg This        discrepancy between our findings and previous results can        be explained by the fact that Park et al   used fold        more GSTNrg in their binding studies than we did        Finally we did not detect any binding of Nrg to the Mig        binding sites Thus the DNA binding of Nrg to         SUC remains to be resolved                    Conclusions        In conclusion these studies have identified Nrg as a        third repressor required for glucose repression at         SUC and the         GAL genes Based on the similarity        between the zinc fingers of Nrg and Mig the phenotypes        of         nrg and         mig and the reported interaction        between Nrg and Ssn   Nrg likely functions by        binding to the target promoters and recruiting the        SsnTup complex The relative and possible cooperative        roles of each of these repressors in recruiting SsnTup        remains to be determined                    Materials and methods                  Yeast strains          All           S cerevisiae strains are listed in          Table and are in the SC genetic background             Deletion of           MIG was achieved by transforming          strain yHZ with the           Hind III digest of pJN for           miglLEU or pJN for           migURA   and

used in this study were previously described            Glucose galactose sucrose or raffinose was added          to  final weight per volume For solid media containing          a carbon source other than glucose or glycerol antimycin          A was also added to a concentration of  gml To test          for glucose repression of           SUC and           GAL genes deoxyglucose was added          to YP sucroseantimycin A and YP galactoseantimycin A          plates to a final concentration of  gml   We          discovered during the course of this study that a           ura strain had half the amount          of           GAL  mRNA of a           URA strain when grown in SD media          containing  glucose and  galactose A           ura strain also grew more slowly          than a           URA strain on minimal media          containing sucrose or galactose We do not yet have an          explanation for this phenomenon To overcome this growth          defect uracil was added to YP
