                                 Party Tricks            One of my favorite classroomtricks is to auction off a  bill I explain in advance that the  goes tothe top bidder but the top two bidders have to pay whatever they bidThat way if at least two students bid at least  I come out ahead            In factits far better than that As soon as two students are rash enough to enter thebidding Im almost guaranteed an astronomical profit Once Mickey bids anickel and Minnie bids a dime both are trapped Theres never a right time todrop out of the auction If Mickey quits now he loses his nickel but bystaying in he can quite reasonably bid a quarter for a  bill Minnie ofcourse raises her bid to half a dollar After a few rounds Mickey has bid and Minnie goes to  Mickey cant quit without throwing away  instead hetakes the far more sensible route of bidding  to get  Now my profit isin the bag            But thats only the beginning After a few more roundsMinnie bids  and Mickey bids  Now Minnie can either bid  to get or drop out and pay  for nothing she bids  At this point poor Mickeycan either bid  to get  accepting a  loss or drop out and pay  fornothing he opts for the lesser of two evils and bids  Similar reasoningleads Minnie to bid  The spiral stops escalating only when one or the otherruns out of money or exhausts my willingness to extend credit If my studentswere sufficiently wealthy and sufficiently shortsighted to enter the auctionin the first place I could earn a lifetimes income in a  minute classperiod            My auctiongame is a crude but instructive metaphor for political campaign spending Itmight even be a reasonably accurate metaphor if we lived in a world where thebiggest spender always wins In any contested election candidates wouldcontinue to spend until they had exhausted all their own and their supportersresources Foreseeing that outcome no politician would ever contest anelection The first candidate to file would always win by default            But in our world outspending your opponentdoesnt always make you a winnerit only increases your probability ofwinning And beyond a certain point it doesnt increase your probability byvery much The candidate who runs  commercials has little advantage overthe candidate who runs  So sooner or later politicians reach a pointwhere one more commercial just cant justify its cost That puts a naturallimit on what theyre willing to spend Mickey will always bid another dollarto get a  bill but he wont always bid another dollar to get a slightlyincreased chance at a  bill            All this is importantbecause campaign finance reform is important and you cant predict the effectsof campaign finance reform unless you think about the incentives it creates forpoliticians Let me offer a few potential scenarios                         First imagine the most simpleminded of all possiblereforms The government subsidizes each of the two major candidates to the tuneof oh say  million apiece You might expect that plan to backfire byencouraging the candidates to spend more But think again The subsidies dontaffect the cost of the  st commercial and they dont affectits benefitso if a candidate has already decided not to run that commercialhe still wont want to run it Therefore total expenditures dont changetheyjust get covered by the taxpayers instead of the fat cats The only exceptionis if the candidate is literally out of money and never had the option ofrunning the commercial without the subsidy            Heres a different scenarioSuppose that instead of giving  million apiece to the top two candidates thegovernment agrees to give a million to any candidate who meets certaincriteriasay a  percent showing in major opinion polls Now the main effectis to encourage new candidates to enter With more candidates must there bemore total expenditure Not clearly Suppose for example that Al Gore andGeorge W Bush are in the middle of a hotly contested race for the presidencywhen Colin Powell suddenly throws his hat in the ringand suppose that Powellhas a  percent chance of winning Then Gore and Bush are no longer battlingeach other for the presidency theyre battling each other for an  percentchance at the presidency With the value of the prize diminishedtheyll be willing to spend less in its pursuit So what Powell spends is atleast partly offset by what Gore and Bush choose to save            Thatexample points to an important general principle Total expenditure isdetermined by the value of the prize whether were talking about presidentialcampaigns or state lotteries If the Powerball jackpot is worth  million andless than  million worth of tickets have been sold then the odds arefavorableand rational betters will rush in to buy tickets guaranteeing thatat least  million in tickets will be sold Likewise if thepresidency is worth  million and there are many potential candidates withessentially identical chances of winning theyll keep entering the race untiltheyve collectively spent at least  million            In a state lottery your odds of winning dependonly on how many tickets you hold compared with everyone else Thats whatguarantees that people will keep buying tickets as long as the odds are intheir favor Thats a good analogy to an election with many equally plausiblecandidates whose odds of winning might depend only on how much they spendcompared with everyone else But if some candidates tower over others theanalogy breaks down If you know that the state lottery is likely to be riggedyoull buy fewer tickets And if politicians believe that an election isrigged in the sense that the favorite will probably win regardless ofexpenditures theyll buy fewer campaign commercials            Thatmeans there are only two kinds of reform that have any chance of actuallyreducing total expenditure on presidential elections The first is to reducethe value of the presidency itself say by putting new limits on presidentialpower or installing a permanent independent counsel or requiring thepresident to sleep on a bed of nails The second is to reduce the uncertaintyabout whos going to win            How do you reduce uncertainty The most drastic way is toallow only one candidate This makes the outcome completely certain and drivescampaign expenditures to zero Short of that you could try to deliverinformation about the candidates that might drive voters to make up their mindson some basis other than political advertisingfor example you could sponsora series of debates            But that cuts both waysSuppose its  the candidates are Gore and Bush and Gore has a slight butnot insurmountable lead in the polls Now Gore trounces Bush in a debatesubstantially widening his lead and making it all but certain that Gore willwin Rational creatures that they are both candidates reduce theirexpenditures rather than try to change a foregone conclusion But suppose onthe other hand that Bush wins the debate closing the gap and putting thecandidates into a virtual dead heat Then expenditures will rise as eachcandidate fights to resolve the new uncertainty in his own favor            If the debates essentiallysubstitute for commercials then theyre equivalent to the scenario where thegovernment gives a certain amount of money to each candidate and expendituresdont change If the debates are fundamentally different from commercials thentheyre equally liable to cause the race to tighten or to widen andexpenditures can go either up or down Of course debates have civic virtuesother than their effects on spending so this is not an argument against themBut it is an argument for being realistic about what we can and cannotchange Whenever theres a big prize to be wonwhether its a lottery jackpotor the presidency of the United Statespeople will find a way to spend a lotof money trying to win it
