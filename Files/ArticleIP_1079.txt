                                 Iraq Since the Gulf War            The United States is poisedto launch its third major military strike against Iraq since the  Gulf WarThis latest tussle is over Iraqs refusal to admit American members of a UNinspection team into its military facilities Iraq has scoffed at new UNsanctions that punish its intransigence and has threatened to shoot down USsurveillance planes Bill Clinton calls this a nightmare scenario What hashappened to Iraq since the war How strong is its economy Dictator SaddamHussein Its military            In thefinal days of the Gulf War most American strategists anticipated that adecisive Iraqi defeat would lead to a coup against a weakened Saddam HusseinThese strategists overestimated the damageboth physical andpsychologicalinflicted by the war Saddam remains powerful and Iraqrepaired major infrastructural damage to roads industry andcommunicationswithin four years of the war            Economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations have beenmore injurious to Iraq than the war was The sanctions  prevent Iraq fromaccessing billions held in foreign banks and  embargo all trade Since Iraqs gross domestic product has shrunk an average of  percent each yearInflation is rampant In  a US dollar fetched  Iraqi dinar today itbuys approximately  The Iraqi standard of living has suffered More than  percent of Iraqis live in poverty up from  percent at thebeginning of the war And the United Nations estimates that  children dieeach month from malnutrition and disease The middle class has been hitespecially hard Crime prostitution and blackmarket trading are also said tohave become endemic            UNresolutions require that sanctions remain in place until Iraq destroys itscapacity for creating chemical biological and nuclear weapons  LastDecember the United Nations eased up on the sanctions allowing Iraq to sellbillion worth of oil every six months on the condition that the profits gotoward food for Iraqs people and war reparations to Kuwait            The economic decline has not destabilizedSaddams regime This is due largely to its repressive state securityapparatus  which Saddam modeled on the Soviet KGB and East German Stasi inthe s Three major domestic intelligence agencies report directly to himand each reports on the other two as well as on civilians Assassinationtorture and a network of informers keep the masses in line Families leftbehind by defectors are routinely shot                           Saddams perpetual war with the United States plays well domestically asIraqis continue to stew over the damage left behind by the Gulf War defeatAlso Saddam has bolstered Iraqi nationalism by linking his regime with theancient Babylonian empire constructing massive monuments that celebrate theparallels                           How does Saddam fund these projectsSpeculation  through the covert shipment of oil to Iran  from theapproximately million worth of oil the United Nations lets him sell toJordan each year  by skimming funds from the sanctioned sale of  billionin oil that is supposed to buy food for his people  from a secret Swiss bankaccount  by playing the oil futures market which he manipulates by creatingthe impression that the United Nations is about to lift the sanctions in rewardfor his changed conduct                           Saddamhas no viable opponents Iraq is dominated by a Sunni Muslim minoritywhich crushed a spontaneous  rebellion by the Shiite majority Since thenthe Shiites have been passive Saddams family and tribe who hold significantpower could also challenge him There are rumors that a cousin attempted tokill him last year But Saddam has kept the family in line Following a recentspat with his son Udaywho heads the staterun TV station andnewspaperSaddam burned Udays million antique car collection When asoninlaw defected to Jordan in  Saddam enticed him back to Iraq withpromises of forgiveness but then had him assassinated            Saddams other potential adversary theKurdish minority in the northhas been hobbled by infighting and directrepression This nonArab ethnic group makes up  percent of Iraqspopulation But the Kurds are too busy fighting one another to threaten SaddamLast year Saddam allied with the Kurdish Democratic Partywhich he bombardedwith cyanide and mustard gas in to seize Irbil the most importantKurdish city This campaign dislodged Western aid workers several thousandUS troops stationed there and a CIA outpost  It also provided anopportunity for Saddams intelligence groups to infiltrate Kurdish ranksIraqs attack violated the  ceasefire limitations so the United Statespunished it by bombing military targets in the south            Aman unit called Saddams Commandos  led by one of his sons alsosnuffs out unrest Last summer the unit which watches for signs of a militarycoup executed  soldiers suspected of planning a rebellion            Since the  ceasefire UN inspectors have largelydisarmed Saddams nuclear chemical and biological arsenal using randominspections and surveillance cameras to do their work During the recentstandoff Iraq tampered with monitoring equipment and the fear is that theIraqis will use this window to create a cache of chemical weapons This is notthe first prolonged interruption of inspections On dozens of occasions Iraqishave refused to admit inspectors to facilities In January  the Bushadministration launched cruise missiles at Baghdad to force compliance                           Whathas inspired Saddams most recent flexing Having fractured theinternational coalition Saddam no longer fears the prospect of invasion fromthe coalition Nations like France Russia and China have sworn to veto anyUN military action because they want to protect the postsanctions oildeals theyve penned with Iraq These countries only reluctantly agreed to thisweeks new UN sanctions that bar international travel by Iraqi officialslinked to the inspection dispute Also Saddam is taking advantage of thecurrent Arab backlash against the United States  sparked by the lattersfailure to broker a peace settlement with Israel Even moderate Egypt hasexpressed sympathy for Saddam                           The United States is ready for war having amassed more than  troops in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia There arecurrently  US Navy warships in the Persian Gulf carrying cruise missilescapable of hitting Baghdad Iraq has backed down before on its demands that theUN teams leave The US has never backed down                        Iraq is weak but it couldstill wage a fierce ground war Its strong army is onethird the sizeof the one that went into the Gulf War but it is better trained Since theceasefire Saddam has continued to build conventional arms for these forcesunder the watchful eye of the UN inspectors The inspectors report that Iraqhas a handful of missiles including SCUDS capable of traveling  miles andat least a small stockpile of VX gas  one of the deadliest chemicalweapons VX gas is banned under the terms of the ceasefire
