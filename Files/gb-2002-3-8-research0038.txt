                    Background        During the development of multicellular organisms        complexity builds sequentially in discrete steps as cells        proliferate and their descendants choose between        alternative developmental fates Much of our understanding        of these processes in         Drosophila has come from mutants that        have developmental defects There are many examples For        instance mutations in the homeodomain protein genes of the        Antennapedia and Bithorax complexes provide evidence for        the role of transcription factors in making developmental        decisions Flies with gainoffunction mutations in the         Antennapedia          Antp  gene cannot grow normal        antennae but instead make extra legs with their antennal        cells Conversely loss of Antp function causes        transformation of the second leg to antennalike structures          Another example is the         glass gene which encodes a        zincfinger transcription factor that is expressed in many        of the cell types in the eye imaginal disc and is required        for photoreceptor development   The common functions of        these and many other genes in regulating gene expression        suggest that developmental fates are manifested in part in        the transcripts that different cell types produce        Although the number of         Drosophila mutants with interesting        developmental phenotypes is large we cannot assume that        the genetic screens that have been carried out identified        all the relevant genes Many         Drosophila genes have been refractory        to genetic analysis either because they are duplicated and        may code for redundant functions or because they have        mutant phenotypes that are difficult to recognize In        addition genetic and biochemical approaches have yielded        few downstream genes that the key transcription factors        regulate The recent release of the         Drosophila genome sequence   and        the demonstration that cDNA microarrays can be used to        catalog the transcriptome of both unicellular and        multicellular organisms                          opens up a new approach        Hybridization of mRNA pools to DNA microarrays can        potentially identify the differences in gene activity that        define every developmental state Thus transcriptional        regulators and their downstream targets can be identified        simultaneously        The         Drosophila larva contains two        developmentally distinct sets of organs One set comprises        the vital organs of the larva  the epidermis and        musculature the central and peripheral nervous systems        and the organs of the digestive tract Most of these        tissues will be destroyed at metamorphosis and will be        replaced by imaginal adult cells The imaginal precursor        cells have no functional role in the larva For some adult        structures such as the eyes antennae legs wings        halteres and genitalia the imaginal precursors are        sequestered as physically distinct primordia  the imaginal        discs The different discs are determined as to disc type        but do not differentiate until the late larval and        subsequent pupal stages when they form the adult        structures The distinct developmental phases of the        imaginal discs their easy accessibility along with the        numerous advantages of         Drosophila as a model genetic and        developmental organism make imaginal disc development an        ideal system to explore the feasibility and usefulness of        such an analysis at a genomic scale        The principal technical difficulty such a study must        surmount is that the quantity of probe needed for efficient        hybridization to microarrays is large relative to the        amount of RNA contained in a single         Drosophila imaginal disc        Approximately  g polyA RNA is required to make a        probe but a third instar wing imaginal disc has only about         ng Figure  Thus several thousand discs would need        to be dissected for each set of experiments In previous        reports of expression profiling         Drosophila embryos adult flies and        adult heads and collections of animals were pooled after        carefully timing or otherwise selecting individual animals             However any scheme to stage animals is        inherently inexact In addition parameters such as genetic        variability nutritional state pathogen exposure and        effects of the isolation procedure cannot be easily        controlled or measured Pools of animals therefore yield        only an average of their varied inputs and depending on        the extent of variability critical differences between        samples may be submerged Furthermore the level of        resolution is relatively low when RNA preparations from        whole animals are used For many biological questions it        is necessary to detect differences in subsets of cells that        might account for only a small fraction of the many        thousands of cells in the animal To circumvent these        problems we used techniques that allow us to carry out        several hybridizations with probes derived from different        tissues of a single animal        We applied linear RNA amplification methods that were        first introduced by Eberwine and coworkers    and        have been refined by Baugh         et al   We used two rounds of        reverse transcription RT and         in vitro transcription IVT and        achieved as much as    fold amplification The        amplified RNA aRNA from different tissues of single larva        was used to perform pairwise comparisons and to identify        sets of genes with preferential expression The        preferential expression of many of the genes in these sets        had been previously shown by genetic or molecular analysis        We also confirmed the preferential expression of ten genes        that had not been previously characterized by         in situ hybridization to imaginal        discs Several of these genes had particularly interesting        patterns of expression Our findings show that this method        can be applied to determine the expression profile of        individual tissues and to identify candidate genes with        specific expression patterns                    Results and discussion                  Principle of amplification          The amplification procedure we used is based on          protocols described by Eberwine     Wang           et al   and Baugh           et al   and details are given          in Materials and methods Briefly doublestranded cDNA          was synthesized either from total RNA isolated from          imaginal discs or from polyA purified embryonic RNA          The cDNA was used as a template for           in vitro transcription routinely          generating an RNA product that represented an          amplification of approximately  fold This RNA was          subjected to a second round of RT and IVT The yield from          the second round represented an approximately fold          amplification resulting in an overall amplification of              Probes for hybridization were synthesized by          RT and labeled with either Cy red or Cy green          Arrays were hybridized simultaneously with Cy and          Cylabeled probes and the intensities and ratios of          bound fluor were measured for each spot Because of          inherent variability in the hybridization efficiency of          individual microarrays only the ratios of the red and          green fluorescence were interpreted to indicate relative          transcript abundance in the starting pool of polyA          RNA          A known drawback of linear amplification is that          sequences at the  end of transcripts can be          preferentially lost This reduction in sequence          complexity can probably be attributed to incomplete RT          to priming from subterminal locations and to incomplete          IVT To overcome this problem we supplemented the random          hexanucleotides that were used to prime the second RT          reaction with a templateswitch TS primer   This          primer includes a guanosine triplet that is designed to          pair with a  cytidine overhang created by the reverse          transcriptase Clontech   Control amplifications          with the TS primer alone or random hexanucleotides alone          yielded similar quantities of aRNA When these aRNA          preparations were used for microarray hybridizations          many spots had significantly different signal intensities          data not shown The  cDNAs with the most intense          signals for the probe amplified with the TS primer alone          had an average length of  kilobases kb In contrast          after amplification with hexanucleotides alone the           cDNAs with the most intense signals had an average length          of  kb We interpret the bias towards long transcripts          in TSprimer amplified probes as indicating better          preservation of complexity                          Representation of transcripts in amplified          probes          The most important feature of RNA pools that          amplification must preserve is proportionality the          maintenance of the relative concentration of different          RNAs We established the quality of our amplification          method in several ways First we isolated polyA RNA          from embryos and subjected  pg  ng and  ng          aliquots to two rounds of linear amplification The size          distribution of the aRNA ranged from about           nucleotides to highmolecularweight products with the          majority between  and  nucleotides Figure a          aRNA from independent amplifications was then used to          generate probes and to compare hybridization efficiencies          of pairs of probes Such separate amplifications of          aliquots of  ng of the same embryonic polyA RNA          produced signals with similar intensities A scatterplot          of the Cy and Cy signal intensities showed a tight          correlation coefficient CC of  with a low standard          deviations SD of the redgreen RG ratios for all          spots SD  log            transformed Figure b          Comparisons of probes made from  pg and  ng and from           ng and  ng polyA RNA yielded essentially the same          level of reproducibility CC  SD  data not          shown We conclude that the amplifications were          reproducible and that good proportionality of RNA was          maintained during amplification even if the concentration          of polyA RNA differed by tenfold          Comparisons between amplified and unamplified RNA          indicated that essentially no transcripts were lost          during amplificaton Of the spots that hybridized to          probes generated from amplified and unamplified embryonic          polyA RNA   out of  did so with both          probes Differences in intensities were nevertheless          significant CC  and SD  data not shown We do          not know whether these differences in intensities were a          result of changes in relative abundance or in transcript          length both of which will affect hybridization signals          Nevertheless the good correspondence of the hybridizing          spots shows that the aRNA is an essentially complete          representation of the population of transcripts present          in the initial pool We conclude that comparisons of two          different probes on microarrays are valid if the RNA          pools have been amplified in the same way                          Pairwise comparisons of imaginal discs and larval          organs          We carried out  separate hybridizations comparing           different pairwise combinations of tissues Table           This analysis identified many genes that are          preferentially expressed in specific tissues it also          provided an independent and quantitative measure of the          distinct nature of larval tissue and imaginal disc          cells          Hybridizations that were carried out were of two          types with probes generated from different imaginal          discs and with probes from imaginal discs and larval          organs Comparisons between imaginal disc probes revealed          a high degree of similarity but comparisons between          imaginal disc and larval organ probes identified many          differentially expressed genes We now give a general          description of these results starting with those tissues          that were most alike It should be noted that these          results were obtained with microarrays that represent a          pool of cDNAs obtained from the Berkeley           Drosophila Genome Project BDGP          containing approximately   of the          transcription units predicted to be in the           Drosophila genome As this pool may          not be a truly random subset extrapolations to the whole          genome may be of limited value Indeed a preliminary          comparison of our cDNA arrays with microarrays that          contain short cDNA sequences for all annotated genes          suggests that the total number of genes that produce a          signal with these probes is similar It is possible that          the set of  cDNAs distributed by the BDGP is biased          toward genes expressed in the tissues we analyzed                          Expression profiles of imaginal discs                      Left and right wing discs            We first asked whether microarray hybridization            could detect differences in expression profiles between            left and right wing discs Although few differences            might be expected previous studies have revealed a            leftright difference in wing size suggesting that the            respective developmental programs are not identical              When probes were prepared independently from the            polyA RNA isolated from left and right wing discs of            a third instar larva only minor differences in the            intensities were observed CC  and SD  Figure            c This tight correlation again shows the            reproducibility of the amplification procedure                                Leg discs            We then asked if any of the genes represented on our            arrays were differentially expressed in first second            or third leg discs Among the several genes that have            been shown to be differentially required or expressed            in the different leg discs for example             Ultrabithorax               Antp   and             Sex combs reduced               only             Antp was among the set of cDNAs            on our microarrays Comparisons of probes from first            second and third leg discs yielded CC values in the             ranges To identify differentially expressed genes            in the leg discs cluster analysis was used to group            genes with similar expression profiles   For this            and all subsequent analyses a threshold setting of                log              transformed ratios was applied            to identify subclusters We identified   or             differentially expressed genes in the legleg            legleg and legleg disc arrays respectively            Figure  The induced expression of             Antp in the second leg discs was            noteworthy This finding is consistent with previous            studies showing that although             Antp is expressed in all three            leg discs it is expressed at a much greater level in            second leg discs                                  Leg and wing discs            Comparisons were also made between the first leg and            wing imaginal discs two experiments Cluster analysis            identified  genes that were preferentially expressed            in the leg discs and  in the wing discs Figure             Notable in the wing cluster are             broad  which is expressed in            imaginal cells and encodes a family of transcription            factors   and             apterous  which is expressed in            the dorsal wing cells and is required for wing            formation                                  Wing and eyeantennal imaginal discs            Comparing probes from the wing and eyeantennal            discs isolated from the same larva revealed a higher            degree of divergence Eleven independent            wingeyeantennal comparisons were made Twentyfour            genes were identified that had elevated expression in            the wing discs and  genes were identified with            elevated expression in eyeantennal discs Figure             Many of these genes are known from previous studies to            be expressed specifically in these tissues Among the            genes with elevated expression in wing discs were             apterous and             engrailed apterous is expressed            in the dorsal compartment of the wing disc but not in            the eyeantennal disc             engrailed is expressed in the            posterior compartment cells of both the wing and            eyeantennal discs However inclusion of             engrailed in the wing group is            reasonable as the posterior compartment represents            approximately half of the wing disc but is less than a            quarter of the eyeantennal disc Among the genes with            increased expression in eyeantennal discs were             white  which encodes an eye            pigment precursor transporter and the eyespecific            transcription factorencoding gene             glass  Consistent with the            neuronal fate of many cells in the eyeantennal disc            ten genes known to be expressed and to function in            neuronal or glial cells were grouped into the            eyeantennal cluster             prospero atonal fasciclin I            longitudinal lacking locomotion defects Rapgap            unc sanpodo Caps and             betaamyloid protein            precursorlike             In addition to the genes whose tissuespecific            expression was confirmed by this array analysis many            have not been characterized previously One of these            novel genes CG was notable for its fold            relative induction in eyeantennal discs Figure  We            also single out             Gliolectin glec in the            eyeantennal cluster as this is not consistent with            previous studies             glec is expressed in midline glia            cells but previous             in situ hybridization and            immunohistochemistry failed to detect it in discs              We did not characterize             glec further and cannot therefore            distinguish whether this discrepancy should be            attributed to greater sensitivity of the array analysis            or to possible contamination by glial cell RNA in the            eyeantennal RNA            To gauge the validity of these sets of genes eight            genes with uncharacterized expression in imaginal discs             four from the wingdisc cluster and four from the            eyeantennaldisc cluster  were chosen for examination            by             in situ hybridization These            genes were chosen to represent a spectrum of relative            intensity of expression from just above the threshold            to the maximum observed All of the patterns we            obtained correlated with the array analysis and had the            preferential expression as predicted for each cluster            Figure  Two out of eight genes were expressed            specifically in either wing CG Figure c or            eyeantennal CG Figure g discs CG was            expressed specifically in the peripodial cells of wing            discs Figure b CG Figure f and CG            Figure g were expressed specifically by cells in or            near the morphogenetic furrow of eye discs CG was            expressed in R precursor cells that also stained with            the neuronalspecific C antibody in a pattern            reminiscent of             atonal data not shown it was            also expressed in the optic lobe in Bolwigs organ            the lightsensing organ of the larva and in a subset            of neurons in the embryonic and larval central nervous            system CNS data not shown Another notable but            unexpected finding was that Arrestin  the            metarhodopsinbinding protein was expressed in all            imaginal discs we tested not only in eye discs            Indeed             in situ hybridization indicated            that it is expressed more abundantly in the wing than            in the eyeantennal disc Figure d This distribution            suggests that the             Drosophila Arrestin  might            function outside the visual system                                Haltere and genital imaginal discs            In five direct comparisons of haltere and genital            imaginal discs  genes were found to be            preferentially expressed in the haltere disc and  in            the genital disc see Additional data files As with            the wingeyeantennal analysis known genes clustered            as predicted from previous studies For example             caudal  a homeobox domain            transcription factor partitioned into the genitaldisc            cluster             caudal is expressed in the            genital disc but not in more anterior tissues such as            the haltere disc               abdominal B  which would be            predicted to show preferential expression in the            genital disc was not represented on the arrays These             differentially expressed genes correspond to  of            the entire set of  and represent the largest            cluster we obtained in all pairwise comparisons of            imaginal discs                                    Expression profiles of larval organs          In order to compare and contrast the expression          profiles of larval organs and imaginal discs we made          probes from the polyA RNA isolated from several larval          organs We directly compared probes from the wing          imaginal disc with the salivary gland an anterior          fraction of the midgut parts of the fat body and the          brain hemisphere including the optic lobe primordium          For each experiment probes prepared from a single larva          were compared With the exception of the comparisons          between the first leg disc and fat body which was carried          out once each of the other comparisons was repeated at          least three times          Visual inspection of the array scans of imaginal disc          to larval tissue comparisons revealed a large number of          red and green spots indicative of a high degree of          divergence A representative block from one wing          disctofat body scan is shown in Figure b These          results contrast with disc to disc comparisons which          produced mostly yellow and only few red or green spots on          the arrays For purposes of illustration the same block          of spots from a leg disctoleg disc scan is shown in          Figure a When the intensity of Cy and Cy signals for          all cDNAs was plotted on a scatterplot only a small          number of data points are positioned away from the          bisector on which signals of equal intensity in the two          channels fall Figure c This is indicative of strong          similarity in expression profiles and is reflected in a          high CC  In contrast the wing disctofat body          comparison had many data points located on each side of          the bisector CC  Figure d This disparity          between leg disctoleg disc and wing disctofat body          comparison was also observed for all other disctodisc          and disctolarval organ comparisons we carried out          Figure aillustrates the numbers of cDNAs that were          expressed differentially in the various pairwise          comparisons as a bar diagram All disctodisc          comparisons showed small numbers of differentially          expressed cDNAs whereas the disctonondisc comparisons          revealed many The only exceptions were the comparisons          of the wing imaginal disc to the brainoptic lobe see          below To score for the differences in expression for          all  genes the standard deviations of the RG          ratios log            transformed for each gene were          calculated for all  experiments and represented in a          scatterplot Figure b Standard deviations from the          datasets derived from disctodisc comparisons           experiments were all   indicating the high level          of similarity among the different imaginal discs In          contrast the disctonondisc comparisons           experiments were with a single exception see below            reflecting a high degree of divergence Figure          b These observations are consistent with the distinct          developmental programs of imaginal and larval cells          The only exceptions to emerge in this analysis were          the cells of the optic lobebrain hemisphere Comparisons          of these neuronal tissues with wing discs revealed only a          small number of differentially expressed genes Figure          a and had low standard deviations that were in the          range of disctodisc comparisons Figure b The optic          lobe primordium and brain of late third instar larvae          have only limited functions in larval photoreception and          contain only a small number of mature neurons The larval          brain is populated with clusters of immature neurons          neuroblasts and ganglion mother cells whose descendants          will generate the neuronal and glial populations of the          adult optic neuropil and the brain hemisphere The brain          hemisphere also differs from other larval tissues by not          degenerating during metamorphosis Instead most neurons          of the larva join with newly formed adultspecific          neurons to build the CNS of the adult   and          references therein We interpret the high degree of          similarity in the expression profiles of imaginal discs          and the brainoptic lobe preparations as a manifestation          of the apparent commonalities of their developmental          programs          The number of genes that were found to be induced in          the larval organs is significantly greater than the          number of genes in the sets defined by the disctodisc          comparisons Most of the genes in these sets have not          been characterized previously and therefore have no known          function but the known genes in these clusters          illustrate the predictive power of the method we mention          three examples          Many of the genes that are preferentially expressed in          the optic lobebrain hemisphere have predicted or          described expression andor function in neurons or glial          cells data not shown One of these is           lola  which encodes a          transcription factor involved in axon guidance and is          expressed in the embryonic optic lobe placodes as well as          other tissues   Another is           beta amyloid protein precursorlike          Appl  with known expression in the larval optic          lobe            The expression profile of the cyclindependent kinase                      Cdkcdc  is also noteworthy          Cdk is believed to regulate the G checkpoint of the          cell cycle and is required to maintain diploidy          Mutations in           Cdk drive cells that would          normally remain diploid into endoreplication   We          found           Cdk CG to be repressed in          larval tissues when compared to imaginal discs Figure           As most of the cells in the larval fat body salivary          gland and midgut are polyploid reviewed in   the          array hybridizations are in good agreement with the known          function of           Cdk                           Experimental design and data analysis          Two methods for comparative hybridizations to DNA          microarrays have been used in previous studies Most          commonly experimental samples have been compared to a          common reference sample that contains an appropriate          diversity of cell types and states An alternative          method which we have used in this study is to directly          compare probes generated from two experimental samples          This second method should be the more sensitive The          amplification technique we used was such that product          generated from a single imaginal disc was sufficient to          make several probes and to carry out multiple array          hybridizations By comparing samples that had been          isolated from a single animal this method minimized          differences due to biological variability By repeating          experiments several times and by reversing the label          dyeflip for experimental samples in repeat          hybridizations we also attempted to minimize          experimental noise          In addition to these design aspects of the          experimental protocols we applied a number of filters to          the data analysis We selected only those genes with          hybridization signals over background in  of all          experiments and with a fold difference between the          two channels in at least  Applying this method to           arrays that compared wing and eyeantennal discs we          found two subclusters representing genes preferentially          expressed in either disc These lists of genes are          largely validated by the previously described expression          pattern in either tissue and by           in situ hybridization analysis We          understand that the use of any such threshold settings is          likely to filter out biologically relevant genes For          example when less stringent settings were used for          example a fold intensity difference increased the          gene sets by  additional genes such as           twin of eyeless were included in          the eyeantennal cluster and           Antp and CG Figure e in the          wing cluster Relaxing the requirement to produce a ratio          in at least  of all experiments to  identifies yet          another group of genes and includes LD Figure j          Conversely setting a more stringent threshold to          fold intensity difference decreased the gene sets by           and removed genes such as Arrestin and CG          Figure df          Setting a threshold level for the clusters is          arbitrary and as some candidate genes may be expressed          by only a small subset of cells in the experimental          sample each analysis must be evaluated separately          Nevertheless we interpret the good correlation between          the array analysis and expression patterns we have          described as indicating that the method is both efficient          and reliable Subsequent to the analyses described above          we carried out singledisc comparisons with microarrays          that represent a nearly complete set of the approximately           annotated           Drosophila genes The short cDNAs          spotted on these arrays were produced with specific          primer pairs obtained from Incyte Genomics Inc Use of          these arrays for disctodisc comparisons also identified          only a relatively small number of differentially          expressed genes data not shown The list of induced          genes was apparently more complete however and          included for example           vestigal in the wingtoleg disc          comparisons AK G Schubiger and TBK unpublished          observations          Although the absolute number of genes included in the          lists of tissuespecific genes is not meaningful the          relatively small number of genes that differ between          imaginal tissues and the significantly greater number of          genes that differ between imaginal and larval tissues          certainly is                            Conclusions        We have shown that linear RNA amplification is        reproducible and can be used to generate probes for        microarray experiments with limited quantities of starting        material We used this technique to determine the        expression profiles of imaginal and larval tissues by        pairwise comparisons of tissues dissected from single        larvae Our approach was validated by the presence of        characterized genes in the appropriate cluster and by        confirmation of expression patterns by direct analysis        Applying stringent threshold criteria we found that less        than  of the genes represented on the arrays were        preferentially expressed when discs were compared to each        other Many of these genes have either not been        characterized previously or lack obvious similarity to        known coding domains Those that have been previously        characterized or share sequence similarities represent a        broad array of cellular functions These include basic        metabolic and transporting functions structural        celladhesive and signaling functions as well as        transcriptional regulation We lack sufficient        understanding of the specific processes in most cell types        to interpret the significance of the genes that they        specifically express Future studies will be required to        identify the functional networks that the identified        candidate genes describe and to establish how they        contribute to the execution of specific developmental        programs        We anticipate that the methods we describe here can be        applied to determine and compare the expression profiles of        small cell groups in         Drosophila tissues We look forward        to a further enhancement in resolution that can be achieved        by combining cellsorting techniques with this type of        array analysis We found that starting with as little as         pg polyA RNA yields enough aRNA for one hybridization        This amount roughly corresponds to  cells of the third        instar wing imaginal disc                    Materials and methods                  Microarray production and labeling          Spotted cDNA microarrays were produced
