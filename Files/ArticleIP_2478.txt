                                 Woodwards Molten Meltdown            Investigative journalismaint what it should be Too often it coughs up the long newspaper story thatthe average intelligent reader having read it carefully puts down and saysWhat the heck was that all about Bob Woodward produced such a story on Page of the Oct  Washington Post             Woodwards word article was titled A Lobbyists Lucrative Ties to GoreExAide Raised Funds From Client Helped Its Federal Business Click here to read it The length the placement and theauthorship all suggest that this is a big storyapparently an important newrevelation of some sort about the campaignfinance scandal But for anyone butthe most ardent Thompsoncommittee groupie the piece is a massiveunenlightening infodump containing paragraph after paragraph of brainbendingdetail thats barely placed within a conceptual framework            The story tracks the wheeling and dealing of Peter Knightan influential corporate lobbyist who used to work for Al Gore and is now aprominent Gore fundraiser Knight lobbied for Molten Metal Technology ahazardouswaste firm that collected a large federal contract and whose chiefexecutive coincidentally or not was a large donor to various Gore causes            TheGoreKnightMolten connection had already been reported So whats the storyThere are perhaps three ways to tell it One is chronologicallynot a bad ideawhen the plot is complicated Another is pyramid stylethe traditionalnewspaper approach with the nub of the story on top and an expanding base ofdetail Then theres Woodwards waya sort of postmodernist literary techniquein which time and space loop around and tie each other in knots The piece is asurprise coming from someone who has produced many readable scoops            In the spring of  the story begins andcompressing it makes the story far more comprehensible than the fullblownversion Molten executives pledged to raise  for the ClintonGorecampaign Knight sent them a thankyou note Three weeks earlier Gore hadvisited and praised one of the companys plants The CEO of Molten sent Knighta thankyou note for arranging the Gore trip Six weeks later the CEO attendeda dinner for contributors at the vice presidents mansion Now governmentinvestigators are looking into this Into what exactly In the eighthparagraph we learn that this is a stark picture of how business and politicsoften overlap demonstrating the advantage of having friends in high placesAnyone previously unaware that business and politics overlap whatever thatmeans and that its good to have friends in high places has now had thatcleared up But without any more guidance about why readers who werent bornyesterday should keep reading Woodward resumes the narrativecarpetbombing            We areneckdeep in the morass when Woodward offers up something that smells likenews On March   the Molten Metal CEO donated  to help endow achair at the University of Tennessee to be named after Gores deceased sisterTwo days later the Department of Energy boosted an existing contract with thecompany by  million Even later in the piece the most devoted reader isrewarded with another significant item On the day the companys expanded DOEcontract was announced the Democratic Party received  from MoltenPeter Knight was simultaneously a lobbyist for the company and a fundraiserfor both the Gore campaign and the university chair At that time a DOEofficial involved in the contract was a former Gore staffer            Believe me you now have a better grasp of this story thanyou could possibly have gained from reading Woodwards entire pieceonce Youalso have maybe half an hour of your life back What you dont have isWoodwards descriptions of various dinners attended by the principal figuresThe choice is yours Click here for another chance to read the Woodward story            Anothertraditional journalistic concept like pyramid style is that the news ought tobe new Despite the frontpage placement and Woodwards brandname byline thePost s Oct story added little to a report posted two days earlier byTime reporter Michael Weisskopf on his magazines Web site Clickhere to read it Weisskopf presented the story in a fewhundred comprehensible words reporting that Moltens federal contract wasexpanded at the time the company and its chief were making largeKnightbrokered donations to the Democratic Party and Gore A month earlierWilliam Safire made an elliptical reference to the Molten case in his NewYork Times column Click here to readthe column            The traditional investigative story at leastin the movies works this way The intrepid reporter through gumption andlegwork exposes the evildoer then the government takes over to flesh out thecase and administer punishment These days all too frequently this chronologyruns backward Specifically the government process predates the journalisticexposand in fact is its major source Following what is by now standardWashington procedure Thompsoncommittee investigators routinely shop storiesto reporters The pile of documents that Woodward relied on for his articleand Weisskopf too were in all likelihood provided by the committeesinvestigators Many reporters including me make deals with congressionalinvestigators to get material by promising not to reveal the source Such dealsare sometimes necessary to get a good story But readers deserve to know thatsome of the big important stories thrust in front of them are actually theproduct of Washingtons political games            Actually more than a yearago June   the Wall Street Journal s Michael Frisby wrote along story on Peter Knight that disclosed Knights connection to MoltenMoltens donations to the Democrats and the companys success in obtainingcontracts from the Clinton administration I dont know where Frisby got hismaterial but he wrote the story before the Thompson committee even existedClick here to read that story Woodward did advance the storyby reporting on the  donation for the university chair honoring Goressister and the DOE contract expansion Still Frisby did a better job thanWoodward in offering meaning He summed up the Knight case rather well            Mr Knights link to thevice president is now the power axis for a circle of his friends and clientsall of whom benefit from the relationship It works like this Mr Knightsclients some of whom are old friends and contributors to Mr Gore donate tothe Democratic Party In return the vice president occasionally helps themEverybody wins Mr Clinton rewards Mr Knight for his fund raising Mr Gorelays the groundwork for his anticipated presidential bid four years from nowand the companies by hiring Mr Knight get the administrations ear            So thats what its allabout Now you know
