        well what do you think about how weve changed in the last ten twenty years     i think its pretty amazing i think um that my grandparents especially have seen a whole lot of change in their lives but um   in in like in what ways particularly are you thinking   well technology but also morals morals and things like that i think even even in the last like four years you can still see things falling so fast and that can be   uhhuh   for me thats the biggest change its so frustrating um to see everything     disintegrating   disintegrating and losing control your your losing control it seems like of the moral fiber of our society   yeah it seems that well it its a seems like its definitely a transitional time im not sure exactly whats happening therere good things that have happened but but at the moment were suffering from       i think information overload for one thing um just just the technology like you mentioned   umhum umhum   faxes and car phones and VCRs and all of that that make us so immediate there theres no time for relationships talking sitting being with each other all of that   i think youre really right i think like well even with computers um   oh yes   you can there i mean theres so much thats happening in in that field and it it just has forced us to go so fast and um even the way we write it used to be if you read a book like you know Thomas Hardy takes two chapters to establish the mood and   umhum   and just describes the scenery and whats been going on and stuff and now we just chopped all that out and say well lets get to the point and   exactly no patience   yeah   no attention span   yeah exactly   these sound bites youre exactly right i mean all theres all that and then weve got the rich getting richer and everyone else getting poorer with with you know with with little hope of of having any impact i think impotence is a is a a word that that suits most of America now we dont feel like we can influence you know influence anything   yeah you feel out of control   uhhuh uhhuh like just a few people have it all wrapped up and theyre not going to let you through um   yeah umhum umhum     and its a bad feeling   yeah it is its really frustrating and the way our families you know our nuclear families are disintegrating and stuff its just a real   umhum umhum   you dont have the the social networks we used to have to   yeah go ahead   to protect the family and protect the people in the family and things like that with everyone moving you know every five years you lose your contacts you lose trusted friends that you know theyll do things you know in America it seems now its independence is the thing and   umhum umhum   you know heaven forbid if you ask anyone for anything   yeah then thats   whereas we used to be able to depend on each other and trust each other and youll help me and ill help you not and not in this corrupted sense but in the sense of you know when youre in trouble and you need someone you know someone to babysit the kids sure   umhum the interdependence interdependence in a nice way   yeah exactly   yeah i think uh i i dont know there was a lot there was good and bad in the nuclear family weve certainly found out a lot about the bad about it   yeah   uh but but but the community however the family looked and it didnt always look like a nuclear family even then you know you had generations living together or you know whatever community has just definitely been lost and   umhum   i think a lot of people are trying to reestablish it in all sorts of different ways um you know well okay so we dont have a small town and okay so we move but you know maybe theres some way that we can have a group that works together you know everything from people who do live in communal you know almost commune areas that theyve started up again you know um special cities or little towns that do that to people who do it through a church or through a book club or something i mean something you know  even offices have started sort of becoming the community   yeah yeah i think i think because its a necessity     yeah   as as as human beings we need a network around us of people we can rely on i guess thats uh thing is that right now its such a um   umhum and yeah   temporary thing that how far does it go how far can you depend on them and theyre so much more fragile at the touch you know   yeah yeah and thats a good point and and we dont have the intergenerational generational community either which means that do you do you have to be between twenty and forty to be accepted and if
