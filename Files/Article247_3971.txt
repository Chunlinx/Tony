                                 How Vietnam Could Have Been Saved                        Jim            Hmmm Ronald Reagans on your side and not mine I dont think so He wasthe fellow who declared in  that Americas intervention in Vietnam was anoble causeand the press trumpeted the comment as a gaffe This didntbother Reagan who was used to such treatment and it didnt affect hisposition on Vietnam He not only supported the war he often voiced theconservative argument that Washington politicians had prevented the generals inVietnam from pursuing a winning strategy Lind rejects this view and so doI As president Reagan was willing to commit American troops but he didntneed to The Reagan doctrine of backing antiCommunist guerrillas around theworld worked Reagan pulled the Marines out of Lebanon both because of thebombing that killed  of them and because the Marines didnt have a missionthere in the first place This doesnt make him a minimal realist The truthis the Marines should never have been sent in            I think we disagree over what constitutes revisionism The kind Id beenlooking for would bring fresh analysis and a new interpretation of events Thelate Peter Braestrup did that in Big Story  which showed how badly thepress had misreported the Tet Offensive in  and repercussions it causedMcNamara didnt do that he simply embraced the lefts contention that the warwas unwinnable and America shouldnt have intervened I have to plead amnesiaon what Nixon and Podhoretz said exactly I read their Vietnam books but Idont remember them Must be old age            The problem with so much thats been written about the war is that it stopsin  At the time things did not look good for South Vietnam despite theutter failure of the Viet Cong to achieve what they wanted in the TetOffensive The United States was still tied to the Westmoreland strategy ofstaging big battles But postWestmoreland things did get better but themedia scarcely noticed To cite one example in A Bright Shining Lie one of the most riveting books about the war Neil Sheehan doesnt takeevidence that the war was finally being won by the United States and SouthVietnam seriously Nor do most others who covered the war Theyre frozen intime I think and that time was  By the way I know of only twojournalists who wrote about the war critically and then lamented the outcomeand what theyd written They are William Shawcross and Jean Lacouture            Casualties Americans definitely are casualtysensitive Im reminded ofthis every morning and night when my commute takes me past the VietnamMemorial Theres always a crowd there I think its partly because people feelthese soldiers havent got a fair shake from historians the media etcAnyway Lind is right that if casualties had stayed at the  level therewould have been a huge political price to pay at home far bigger than the onethat was actually paid But they didnt stay at that level President Nixonbegan bringing American troops home in  Nonetheless the war went betterThe South Vietnamese fought better The Viet Cong were driven away from theoutskirts of Saigon and isolated in pockets By  the US side had theupper hand And some have claimed the war was essentially won The first time Iheard this argument was in  when I took a course on the military at MIT Itwas taught by Prof William Kauffman who used to write the Pentagons annualposture statement I didnt believe him at the time But more recently the casehas been made strongly by the late William Colby in Lost Victory andjust this year by Lewis Sorley in A Better War             All this leads to a question Id like you to answer Its about the Koreamodel What if the United States had not pulled all its troops out of Vietnambut left say two divisions behind and kept up military and economic aidMight South Vietnam have beenyou wont like this wordsaved I think so Ofcourse Im rewriting history here In reality Henry Kissinger allowed theNorth Vietnamese to keep thousands of troops in South Vietnam when henegotiated the  peace settlement and all the US troops came home andall aid was cut off in             Lind mentions the Korea model but doesnt really pursue this point Whatsyour view Jim
