   FightinIrish                        I have to take issue withFranklin Foers piece Pataki and Potatoes            I agree with his criticismof the New York law mandating the teaching of the famine as a historicalexample of genocide As a sometime teacher I see this sort of legislation asthe worst kind of politicallymotivated government meddling in education It isalso clear that the motivation behind such legislation is a reaction tomulticulturalism and the history of European brutality toward nonChristiannonEuropean peoples The resulting titfortat is perhaps the best possibleargument for refraining from even wellintentioned political efforts to shapethe publicschool curriculum I object however to Foers characterization ofboth the famine and the current vogue of IrishAmerican identification withIrish history and culture His understanding of the famine and the Britishgovernments role in itat least as demonstrated in this pieceis shallow atbest            British economic policyaggravated a desperate situation That Irish grain should have been exportedwhile Irish people starvedfor little other purpose but to hold down the priceof grain on the English marketwas as morally repugnant to contemporaryobservers as it is to modern ones Many contemporary English observersadvocated intervention to thwart the famine Their voices went unheeded by thelikes of Peel Russell and Trevelyan and the ideology of laissezfairepolitical economy meshed with antiIrish bigotry to produce catastrophicresults for the Irish poor            Unfortunately Foersapparent ignorance of Irish history goes deeper still The English governmentwas responsible for the underlying conditions of the Irish agricultural economythat made the Irish poor so vulnerable to the blight The dispossession ofIrish Catholic farmers which took place in successive waves over severalcenturies relegated them to the most marginally cultivable pieces of land Acashcrop market system supplanted the traditional locally based subsistenceeconomy and placed Irish farmers in a position of dependence on a single cropWhen that crop failed several years in succession they had no viablealternative to starvation or if they could afford it emigrationEnglishimposed legal disabilities also hobbled the efforts of poor IrishCatholics to redress illtreatment by AngloIrish landowners and merchantsFurthermore Foer makes no mention of the deliberate withholding of corn fromthe Irish market to prop up prices for corn producers in England            As Foer points out otherareas of Europe experienced blights of the potato crop from the same fungusbut none suffered the human devastation that Ireland did The historic policiesof the English crown and later the British government turned a crop failureinto one of modern historys most tragic episodes To argue as Foer doesthatthe notion that the British government bears a substantial measure ofresponsibility for the humanitarian crisis of the famine is merely an Irishfolk traditionis as absurd as arguing that the blight itself was introduceddeliberately in a genocidal conspiracy            As forFoers criticism of IrishAmerican identification with Irish culture as part ofa socalled Diaspora chic he is unfair to those Americans of Irish descentwho do not romanticize terrorism support Sinn Fein or the IRA joinorganizations like the Ancient Order of Hibernians or celebrate St Patricksday by getting obnoxiously drunk and excluding IrishAmericans who happen to begay That there are IrishAmericans who do these things in no way devalues theefforts of others to connect with their past If IrishAmericans tend to have asuperficial understanding of their own history and to focus on the positiveaspects of their culture to the exclusion of less admirable parts this onlyproves that they are human and as prone to historical myopia as Anglophiles orAfrocentrists As an IrishAmerican who is unapologetically proud of both partsof my hyphenated identity I find Foers piece less offensive than tendentiousand historically illinformed                           DanGorman                                       FeedingHunger                        The article Can We Really Feedthe World only scratches the surface of this issue by focusing on themurky areas of politics raw power and corruption            A more indepth view wouldrecognize that when the basic framework of a society disintegrates externalfood supplies may just lead to additional reproduction and thus morewidespread starvation Desperate people who have lost all hope for themselvesare biologically driven to propel possibly surviving offspring into the nextgeneration            This in turn is just one ofthe issues posed by the relationships between technologically advancedsocieties TAS and technologically primitive societies TPS Should we whois we let nature run its course and let TAS groups eradicate the TPSculture or the people themselves Or should the TAS groups take it uponthemselves to elevate the TPS to their level Or should the TAS build andpatrol walls around the TPS to keep adventurers and entrepreneurs from preyingon the TPS Should the TAS withhold medical technology from the TPS to preservetheir balanced ecosystem            Clearly Ihave no answers but a suggestion Look at the global picture and step downfrom ideological and judgmental postures onto the plane of common sense andcompassion                           PaulKailor                                       Buns ofSteel                        As
