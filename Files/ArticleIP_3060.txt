                                 Jews You Can Use            The following are fields inwhich Jewish men are believed to excel gastroenterology the violin politicalconsulting the domination of world financial markets and particle physicsOne field in which it is believed we do poorly however is beating people upWe are the stereotype has it lousy fighters and this rankles Some of usrespond to this slander by embracing in the words of the cultural criticDaniel Boyarin our sissy heritage and taking up among other things thestudy of Yiddish not for nothing is it known as mamaloshen  themother tongue Others move in the opposite direction and join the Israeliarmy where Yiddish the language of our sissy exile is most definitely notspoken Still others take up ice hockey            And thereare those who steel themselves with memories of our gangster past Men withnames such as Kid Twist and Gyp the Blood and Pittsburgh Phil once roamed theJewish ghettos These gangsters were as tough as the Irish and as powerful asthe Italian mob and when I discovered this fact at age  or so it thrilledme This reaction is easy to understand I was at the time facing theoppression of antiSemitic schoolyard thugs and in my revengefantasies BugsySiegel and Gurrah Shapiro were lining up on my side blackjacks in hand            Of course all this was happening when I was  By thetime I hit  my understanding of Jewish gangsters had become substantiallymore nuanced Great nicknames and fists aside I began to recognize theseJewish gangsters as fools and thugs who preyed on their own communities robbedthe Jewish poor and murdered their own people            RichCohen author of a new book titled Tough Jews Fathers Sons and GangsterDreams  doesnt get this fact For Cohen a writer for Rolling Stonemagazine the Jewish gangsters are the purest expression of the Jewish spiritand the means through which he defines his own Jewishness            There are two books here One is a very badbook of social history defined by Cohens tendency to make up factsimagineis his wordwhen he doesnt know something I do not know what YashaKatzenberg looked like he writes but I have tried to imagine him I seehis eyes as mirrors reflecting not what he is looking at but what he willsee mountains rivers wars I imagine him tall and slender wearing a hoodtaking his timesomething long prophesied a nomad who has crossed wastes toget here            Thesecond book is his attempt to portray himself as a spiritual heir to the Jewishgangsters He does this by striking a tough guy pose throughout a pose thatfails to hide his sense of physical inadequacy which he blames on hisJewishness            When Iwas growing up any mention of Jews as Jews would make me cringe Other than myparents I really knew of only one type of Jew cerebral bourgeoiskidstocollege suburbanites Do Jews get drunk Do Jews trash hotel rooms DoJews defend themselves Questions I never thought to ask            His father is different he maintains by dint of hisBrooklyn roots Cohen writes affectionately and ad nauseam about his father andhis fathers aging Brooklynborn schemerfriends who sit in delis blowinghard about the glories of tough Jews One of his fathers best friends is LarryKing and these passages are charming only if you believe that being in a roomwith four people just like King would be charming            Cohenbelieves his book is revolutionary a violation of a taboo against speakingabout Jewish gangsters Jews he writes have pushed aside the image of thegangster Forget Forget when you were bullies When I tell old Jews about thisbook  the blood drains from their faces Cohen is infuriated by thispurported tendency to suppress the gangster past and is even more angered byattempts to make light of it I once heard a comedian refer jokingly to theJewish Mafia he writes The mere mention of a Jewish gang broke up theaudience  Sometimes when I see this comedians bit rerun on cable Iimagine Pep Straussa hit man in the hitman organization called MurderIncentering stage left and cutting him belly to chin            I will put aside Cohens bizarre dreams ofviolence for a moment to address the idea that the memory of Jewish gangstershas been suppressed which of course is not the case Just because Cohendidnt know about Siegel and Dutch Schultz doesnt mean everyone else didntThe subject of Jewish gangsterism has been well mined in recent years by bothhistorians and Hollywood Albert Frieds The Rise and Fall of the JewishGangster in America and Jenna Weissman Joselits Our Gang Jewish Crimeand the New York Jewish Community are two recent additions tothe nonfiction literature and films such as Once Upon a Time in Americaand Bugsy feature Jewish criminality When Cohen is not imagininghistory he rewrites other peoples research sometimes mangling quotes duringhis copying as he did when he took a quote from a  book Murder IncThe Story of the Syndicate  by  also about Jewish gangsters Eventhe title of Cohens book and its cover arta brassknuckled fistare lifteddirectly from a book published eight years ago Paul Breines Tough JewsPolitical Fantasies and the Moral Dilemma of American Jewry  which analyzesthe psychological underpinnings of the cult of Jewish toughness born afterIsraels victory in the  Six Day War            Cohenhits bottom when he compares the gangster Louis Lepkes flight from justice tothe plight of Anne Frank and when he compares his own grandfather to a drugdealer When I think of someone like Tolly Greenberg I think of my grandpaBen he writes The same restless energy drove both men toward invention Benworked in a diner and was tired of clunky sugar dispensers and so converted anexisting piece of machinery a tea bagger creating the first sugar packetTolly worked in narcotics and knew there was a Southern market for drugs and soconverted an existing piece of machinery creating the first morphine pill I would like to say Tolly was working for evil my grandfather for good but Idont know if its that simple            This is stuff that defies analysis Cohen has written abook that he undoubtedly believes extols heroes and explains a suppressed bitof Jewish history but what he has done is expose the architecture of his ownpathology He wants desperately to be a thug because that is the only way heknows to be Jewish Instead of writing this bookand bookwriting is surely ajob for sissieshe should have gone out and beat someone up or sold drugsThen his pathetic selfloathing might have been exorcised            I am not opposed to Jewishtoughness Breines in the original Tough                Jews  argues that theHolocaust disfigured the Jewish soul turning the victims of fascistpersecution into the fascist persecutors of another people the PalestiniansBut Breines is avowedly antiIsrael and he sees any expression of Jewishselfdefense as a sign of nationalism gone awry To my mind though Jewishtoughness of the sort that was in evidence in Entebbe Uganda  years agowhen armed Jews flew thousands of miles to rescue Jewish innocents from deathwas one of the great moments in postHolocaust Jewish historya statement tothe world that Jews will no longer sit idly by and watch themselves beingoppressed Jewish toughness was seen in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising against theNazis and in the sacrifices of Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman inMississippi in  Also Lou Reed is tough            Thepresence of Bugsy Siegel and Kid Twist in our recent history does not mean weare a tough people At most it means we are simply a people like anyother                           If youmissed our link to a comparison of two versions of Jewish mob historyCohensand Turkus and Federsclick
