                              Plane Speaking            Nothing underscores the subtle complexities oflanguage more strikingly than the miscommunicationsthat occur among pilots crew membersand air traffic controllers  An experienced flight instructorreports noticing considerable power on justbefore touching down while checking out a pilot in asmall airplane  He had thought he was saying Backon the power  with a stress on Back and a pause beforeon  but he was interpreted by the pilot as having saidBack onthe power  with the stress on on and thepause after it  A pilot who had been instructed tomaintain  feet and who was then toldtraffic at ten oclock three mileslevel at  to pass under you                        responded We have him  and was then challengedby the controller when he was observed descendingthrough  feet  The pilot had misconstrued thephrase level at  imperatively as an instructionfor himself meaning Descend to and remain levelat  rather than understanding it declarativelyas it had been intended as an assertion about histraffic meaning The traffic is level at   OnJanuary   an aircraft over Cove Neck NewYork ran out of fuel and  of the  personsaboard died in the resulting crash including thethree crew members in the cockpit  The flying pilothad instructed the copilot Digale que estamos enemergencia and the copilot had responded Si senorya le dije  but what he had actually radioed to thecontroller was Were running out of fuel   The specificEnglish word emergency is required in the aviationprotocol to convey to the controller that thedisaster is imminent but the copilot failed to usethat word even though the pilot had used its exactSpanish equivalent in telling him what to say            As I show in my book Fatal Words CommunicationClashes and Aircraft Crashes University of ChicagoPress  these examples are representativeof a wide range of accidents and near misses inwhich language misunderstandings or omissionshave played a contributing and sometimes centralrole  An instructor reports responding to the towercalling traffic by saying I got it  with the intendedmeaning I see the traffic but being interpreted byhis student as meaning that the instructor was nowflying the aircraft  In similar incident a copilot reportsthat the landing field was in sight by saying Ivegot it  with the result that the flying pilot let go ofthe controls  The sentence Maintain runway headingis interpreted sometimes as meaning that the pilotmaintain the heading indicated when lined up on theextended center line of the runway and sometimesas meaning that the pilot take a heading after liftoffto keep the aircraft traveling on that line  In somesituations this difference can lead to a conflict betweenaircraft in a cross wind after takeoff  At anairport at which Local Control and Ground Controlwere combined a construction vehicle B calledAt the localizer road to proceed to the ramp   A controllerknowing that B had called but not surewhat the request had been replied B Ground GoAhead and then proceeded to talk to aircraft whilewaiting for a reply  B misinterpreted the phraseGo Ahead as referring to his driving rather than hisspeaking and was halfway down his normal route oftravel before the controller realized what had happened            Homophony and more commonly nearhomophonyin which different words or phrasessound exactly or nearly alike can be just as problematicas syntactic ambiguity  For example thesentence Pass to the left of the tower is ambiguousbecause left can mean either the speakers left or thehearers left but further confusion is also possiblebecause left can sound very much like west   A pilotreports practicing short field landings in a small airplaneas a student when his instructor said Last ofthe power  meaning to reduce to zero while flaringHowever the pilot thought the instructor had saidBlast of power  fearing an imminent stall  The resultwas confusion and a longer landing  A pilot who wasobserved on radar to be somewhat higher thancalled for and flying in the wrong direction turnedout to have misheard a clearance for a Maspeth climbas a clearance for a massive climb   Maspeth is a fix inthe New York metropolitan area but the pilot wasunfamiliar with the local geography  An outboundpilot who was told to receive his clearance from theCenter when he was on the deck misheard this as offthe deck and proceeded with his takeoff consequentlyfinding himself headon with an inbound aircraftIn another incident one widebody airplanebarely missed colliding with another after landingbecause the pilot heard Hold short as Oh sure in responseto his asking the controller May we cross  inreference to a runway            An international carrier inbound to the UnitedStates was handed off to a new Center after the captainhad read back the clearance Cleared to descendto two zero zero cross two zero miles south of XYZ attwo two zero and the First Officer had set the altitudeselector to  feet  To the initial contactfrom the flight Leaving two two zero for two zerozero  the new Center responded Were you clearedto two zero zero   The Center claimed later that theclearance had been only to  that is  feetbut the crew had understood otherwise  A Captainwho was flying with an assigned altitude of feet while being vectored for a landing on runwayL thought he heard the copilot say Cleared toseven took this to mean Cleared to seven thousandfeet and started to descend  The copilot had reallysaid Cleared two seven in reference to the runwayConfusions between the identical sounding to andtwo almost led to a midair collision when a pilotmisheard Climb to five zero as Climb two five zeroputting him on a collision course with another aircraftthat was just fifteen hundred feet above him itdid lead to a fatal accident when a pilot in anotherincident read back the instruction Descend two fourzero zero as OK Four zero zero and then proceededwithout correction from the controller to descendto four hundred rather than twentyfour hundredfeet            To is not the only preposition that can kill  OnMarch   the pilot of a KLM  radioed Weare now at takeoff as his plane began rolling downthe runway in Tenerife the Canary Islands  The airtraffic controller mistakenly took this statement tomean that the plane was at the takeoff point waitingfor further instructions and so did not warn the pilotthat another plane a Pan Am  that was invisible inthe thick fog was already on the runway  The resultingcrash killed  people in what is still the mostdestructive accident in aviation history  The KLMpilots otherwise perplexing use of the very nonstandardphrase at takeoff rather than the more standardphrase taking off appears to have been a subtleform of what linguists call codeswitching a process inwhich bilingual or multilingual speakers inadvertentlyswitch back and forth from one of their languagesto another in the course of a conversation  Inthe KLM pilots case what linguists call the presentprogressive aspect which is expressed in English by averbs ing form can be expressed in Dutch by theequivalent of at plus the verbs infinitive  Perhapsbecause of fatigue or the stress of having to work inconditions of no visibility the Dutchspeaking pilotswitched into the Dutch grammatical constructionwhile keeping his words in English as required  TheSpanishspeaking controller had no clue that this wasgoing on and so interpreted the at in the most naturalway as indicating a place the takeoff point            Codeswitching can take place even within thesame language when different dialects or variantsare available  On February   at John WayneOrange County Airport in Santa Ana California AirCal  was cleared to land while Air Cal  wascleared to taxi into position for takeoff but the controllerthen decided that more time was needed betweenthe takeoff and the landing and so told  togo around  The  Captain resisted this instructionby having his copilot radio to ask for permission tocontinue landing but he switched from technicalaviation jargon to ordinary English and used theword hold to express this request  In aviation parlanceto hold some action always means to stopwhat you are doing and thus to go around in a landingsituation but in ordinary English hold can alsomean to continue what you are doing and thus toland in such a situation  The resulting confusionled to  injuries four of them classified as seriousand the complete destruction of the aircraft by firefor Air Cal  landed with its landing gear retractedthe Captain having finally decided to followinstructions to go around but too late to do so            There are technological means of amelioratingmiscommunications in the aviation setting as I discussin Fatal Words but there are broader lessons tobe learned from these examples  Not only pilots andcontrollers but people in general need to learn tobe more mindful of their own language use and to bewilling to use more words to get meanings acrossWe all need to learn to listen with more care and toask for clarification rather than assuming that wealready know what is going to be said to us in advance

Dementia                           Dementia is a term often used by laypersons andby medical personnel both of which haveemployed the word in different ways at varioustimes  The resulting confusion is furthered by inconsistenciesamong definitions in medical dictionariesand textbooks  A survey of source material wastherefore undertaken to provide a history of theword and of how its use has evolved                           Dementia derives from the Latin de  away orfrom and ment  root of mens mind  The OED incorrectlyattributes the initial use of dementia toPhilippe Pinel in  the word was first used in anEnglish text in  by Richard Cosin Member ofParliament in defense of the hanging of a conspiratoragainst the monarchy  Cosin defined dementia asa passion of the minde bereaving it of thelight of understanding  The word first appearedin an English medical dictionary in George Motherby  A New Medical Dictionary  said itwas madness or a delirium and used the samedefinition for insania   Dementia insanity  and madnesswere synonyms throughout most of the thcentury  Robley Dunglison in his series of medicaldictionaries  echoes medical thinkingof the time when he says of dementia in commonparlance and even in legal language this word issynonymous with insanity It is characterized bya total loss of the faculty of thought  Medical use ofmadness then disappeared but the word was retainedby the laity  In the s insanity also fadedfrom the medical vocabulary and it is now used bylawyers and judges when deciding on responsibilityfor acts committed while mentally deranged notguilty by reason of insanity            Modern understanding of the meaning of dementiabegan in  with A Dictionary of PsychologicalMedicine  by Daniel Tuke where it was definedas a state in which manifestations of mind areto a greater or less degree absent in consequence ofdisease or decay of the brain itself  It is always anacquired condition and as such is to be distinguishedfrom amentia which is either a congenitalstate or one closely connected with that periodTukes definition has a remarkably contemporarysound  It recognizes degrees of the syndrome ratherthan the previously described total loss of mentalityThe condition is attributed to disease or decay ofthe brain and is acquired  Tuke also commented onreversibility and dismissed acute dementia as reallyinstances of Melancholia cum stupore   In the lateth century he listed nineteen forms of dementiafrom acute and accidentalis to senile and toxica             The meaning of dementia frequently changed inthe th century the word lost popularity in thes and s  Selected definitions from DorlandsMedical Dictionary illustrate some of the shifts th ed Insanity characterized by loss orimpairment of intellect will and memory th ed A generic designation for mentaldeterioration less frequently used than formerlyexcept in the term dementia praecox rd ed A general designation for mentaldeterioration th ed A generic designation for mentaldeterioration called also aphrenia aphronesiaand athymia th ed Organic loss of intellectual functioncalled also aphrenia aphronesia andathymia th ed DSMIII An organic mental disordercharacterized by a general loss of intellectualabilities involving impairment of memoryjudgment and abstract thinking as well aschanges in personality  It does not include lossof intellectual functioning caused by cloudingof consciousness nor that caused by depressionDementia may be caused by a numberof conditions some reversible some progressive                        Each definition has deficiencies  Will is difficult to determine and was soon abandoned  Ifdementia means only mental deterioration to  it is not separated from neuroses and psychosesThe word organic  addresses thisproblem  The three synonyms cited in  and repeatedin  came from a lexicographer whosemind was fixed in an earlier th century  The quotation of the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual DSMIII returned Dorlands Medical Dictionaryto the th century DSMIII is the standardpsychiatric manual defining mental disorders            In the s and s dementia was seldomused except for types of schizophrenia eg dementiapraecox  or catatonic and paranoid dementiaPsychiatrists during that time officially replaced theword dementia with chronic brain syndrome  a uselessphrase now almost completely abandoned            Let us examine critically some representativedefinitions of the word dementia to illustrate thecomplex nature of the term and to marvel at the diversityof words used to define this single conceptLishman Organic Psychiatry  An acquiredglobal impairment of intellect reason and personalitybut without impairment of consciousness                                       Global  meaning all aspects of intellect is usedby many medical authors but is incorrect  The decayis not global at onset discrete disorders of mentionmay dominate the clinical picture in midcourse andeven in the final stages cognitive impairment may beselective  Maintained consciousness is accepted bymodern authors as necessary to the definition butnothing is said here of the cerebral origin of dementiaits organic nature or its degree of permanenceButterworths Medical Dictionary  A form ofmental disorder in which the cognitive and intellectualfunctions of the mind are prominentlyor predominantly affected invariably asymptom of organic cerebral disease and as arule impairment of memory is one of the earliestsymptoms  Dementia necessarily impliessome degree of permanent change totally recoverableconfusional states in which cognitivechanges are prominent are thus excluded                                       Cognitive and intellectual are synonyms for thefaculty of knowing  OED  use of both words is redundantOf the mind is unnecessarywhere else isknowing located  Impairment of memory is a frequentearly symptom of Alzheimers dementia butnot necessarily of other types  The concept of irreversibilityarose from initially equating all dementiaswith senile dementia  Toxic and infectious dementiascan be halted or reversed as illustrated by theeffect of penicillin on dementia paralytica  the cerebralform of neurosyphilis  It is therefore incorrectto state that some degree of permanent change isimplied for all types of dementiaDiagnostic and Statistical Manual DSMIIIR The essential feature of Dementia is impairmentin shortand longterm memory associatedwith impairment in abstract thinking impairedjudgment other disburbances of highercortical function or personality changes  Thedisturbance is severe enough to interfere significantlywith work or usual social activities orrelationships with others  The diagnosis of Dementiais not made if these symptoms occuronly in the presence of reduced ability to maintainor shift attention to external stimuli as inDelirium however Delirium and Dementiamay coexist an underlying causative organicfactor is always assumed Dementiamay be progressive static or remitting                        Emphasis on memory loss does not take into accountdementias other than Alzheimers  Insistenceon severity eliminates mild cases of dementia or instanceswhere a mildly demented person is able tomanage when little intellectual ability is needed  Allmental and physical disorders may interfere withwork or usual social activities hence these lossesare not diagnostic of dementia  The assumption thata causative organic factor is always present is notproved in rare cases  Complete studies including autopsymay occasionally fail to disclose the cause            The definition of dementia has changed oftensince it was used by Richard Cosin in  and itwill continue to change as new information becomesavailable  Any definition therefore must be tentativebut it should not contain outmoded conceptsas occurs too often in medical dictionaries  Currentmeaning may be sought in articles published in recentmedical journals but authors are contentiousand judgment must be used            Dementia is not a single symptom but a syndromea group of symptoms and signs that occur indifferent combinations depending on the site andnature of changes in brain tissue  It therefore cannotbe properly defined in a few words  A synthesisof current uses of the word would include the followingconcepts an acquired syndrome of mentaldeterioration without loss of consciousness onsetoften uncertain early changes from normal to abnormalfrequently imperceptible  Furthermore dementiais chronic and usually progressive but it maybe static or reversible  It arises secondary to structuralor biochemical alterations of the brain henceits medical description is organic  Dementia is characterizedby changes in personality and behaviorwith disturbances of orientation memory abstractthinking and judgment  Altered cerebral functionmay also result in disordered language and difficultyin movements requiring dexterity            It should be noted that individual symptomsmay occur in normal persons at various times andthat memory commonly declines in normal old agePopular and medical use of dementia first associatedit with senility but since World War II has linked itpredominantly with the type first described by AloisAlzheimer in   Alzheimers and multiinfarctdementia the result of multiple small strokes arecurrently considered the most frequent causes of dementiaThe devastating and untreatable effects ofsenility and of these two types of dementia excitehorror and pity  Other causes of dementia howeveralthough less common can be treated effectivelyand reversed  These conditions include thyroiddeficiency mercury poisoning infectiousdiseases such as neurosyphilis and meningitis nutritionaldisorders including pellagra and perniciousanemia that involve deficiency of elements of thevitamin B complex and chronic alcoholism  UnfortunatelyAIDS is a recent addition to the list ofcauses of dementia that lack an effective treatment                              The True Meaning of Christmas            Mistletoe and festivities holly and ivy peace tothe world commerciality Just what isthe meaning of Christmas  This is a question askedall too often these days  A little research soonreveals the true meaning of the season of good willto all men            The word Christmas derives from the late oldEnglish Christes msse  meaning the mass ofChrist  That is easy enough to follow but digging alittle deeper into the meaning of Christmas leads usto a strange anomaly  Mass has its roots as alreadynoted in the old English msse which itself derivesfrom the written Latin missa which means sendsend away or dismiss  The earliest occurrences ofthe word being used to refer to a religious serviceare to be found in the epistles of Saint Ambrose andthe itinerary of Silvia of Aquitania in the last quarterof the fourth century when it was applied to matinsand vespers however in its most eminent sensemsse was used to denote the Eucharist            Some etymologists believe that missa at first denotedthe solemn conclusion of a religious servicethe words Ite missa est Go it is the dismissal beinguttered at the end of the ceremony but later appliedto the service itself  And it is here that the anomalycan be seen in its most rudimentary form Christmasmeans Christs dismissal quite the opposite of itsmeaning of Christs birth today            The angel may well have sung The First Noel but what exactly is a Nol  A Nol originally was acanticle or song sung at Christmas time in countrychurches in France but it soon became a generalterm for a Christmas carol  The English wordnowel is closely related to Nol  although there is aslight difference in meaning nowel was a wordshouted or sung as an expression of joy to commemoratethe birth of Christ  Both words derive fromthe Latin ntlis birth            Another term used to describe Christmas isYule  Yule has its roots in both Christianity and paganismIn Old English the word el was used tomean Christmas Day or Christmastide  It correspondsto the old Norse jl which was a heathen festivallasting twelve days from December to JanuaryIt was this festival that was adopted by the Christiansand later became known as Christmas hencethe twelve days of celebration around the Christmasperiod            Christmas is known as the Festive Season  Thetime of year when we remember the poor and needyby spending wallets full of money and gorging ourselveson turkey sage and onion stuffing and Christmaspudding  Indeed the word festive comes fromthe word feast which derives from the Latin festawhich was a feastal ceremony  Festa itself derivesfrom festus which probably according to etymologistshad the same root as feria fair            Such is the true meaning of Christmas   It is exactlythe same as it means to us now twelve days ofceremonial feasting  Maybe Christmas has alwaysbeen the most commercial time of year and it is justour perception of it that has changed                              Reading NonSequentially The Peculiar Kanbun System            European languages are written from left toright Hebrew and Arabic from right to leftChinese and Japanese may be written vertically andAncient Egyptian was written multidirectionallyThe word boustrophedon is used to describe inscriptionsthat run as the ox ploughs left to right thenright to left and back again  Despite the widerange of directional options all writing systems haveone thing in common they are intended to be readin the direction they are written  Actually there isone significant exception to this rule a written languageused in Japan called kanbun                            Kanbun   is essentially Classical Chinese wnynwn     as read by Japanese scholarsIt began as a decoding system in which thereader learned to read texts from China as thoughthey were Japanese and developed into a way ofwriting employed by Japanese themselves            In the Kanbun system special punctuation enablesthe reader to convert phrases presented inChinese order usually subjectverbobject to Japaneseorder usually subjectobjectverb and tosupply missing inflectional endings to producesomething approximating Classical Japanese  For examplelet us consider the phrase             Mandarin    English translation   sho    young   nin    year   y      easy   lo     old   xu     study   nn     difficult   chng   accomplish                        The Mandarin Chinese speaker from Beijingwould read this from top to bottom it may also bewritten left to right as shonin y lo xu nnchng  and understand it to mean something likeIt is easy for a youth to grow old but harder tocomplete ones studies  Speakers of other dialectswould pronounce the characters differently butwould associate the same meaning with the sentenceA Mandarin speaker from Chengdu wouldsay sonin y no x nn cn  while a SouthernMin speaker from Amoy would say siolin  l hkln sng             The Japanese speaker educated in Kanbunwould punctuate this sentence with the aid of thesymbol           Japanese pronunciation   sh   nen   yasuku   oi   gaku   gatashi   nari                        The symbol indicates that the character above it isto be read after the following character  Parenthesesindicate inflectional endings not found in Chinese inferredby the Japanese reader  The text would thusbe read shnen oi yasuku gaku nari gatashi which retains the meaning of the original as much asany translation can            Note that some of the Japanese readings arevery similar to the Chinese original sh nen  andgaku are etymologically related to sho nin and xuoriginally gak   On the other hand the readingsoi yasuku nari and gatashi  are unrelatedto Chinese lo y chng  and nn   Characters areeither pronounced in a Japanized version of theChinese  on reading or else a synonymous Japaneseword  kun reading is read in place of the Chineseword  The choice of which reading to use for a specificcharacter is determined by context            Sometimes for additional clarity kanbun writerswill add the inflectional endings to the right ofthe line using phonetic symbols called katakana    Sh   nen   yasu      gaku   gata                           Of course to get from Chinese to Japaneseword order a simple transposition of two charactersmay not suffice  More complex reordering may beindicated through punctuation as well  A sequenceof  signs means that the text so marked is read inreverse order                 Circles represent any character          and numbers indicate          the order in which they are to              be read                           In addition to the symbol there are two otherdevices for indicating that characters are to be readout of sequence  First the characters  ichi  oneand ni  two may be used                                    Note that these numbers may be used more thanonce in a long phrase               The first occurence of  fol          lows the first occurence of       etc  That is the application of      the reversals must be consecu      tive without overlapping or          nesting                              In cases where reversals overlap or nest a secondpair of characters is used namely  ue  upand  shita  down  Here are two examples                                                                                                                In general the reordering markers are easily understoodthe main source of ambiguity relates to thechoice of on or kun readings and if a kun reading hasbeen selected the choice of inflectional endings intendedNot surprisingly this arcane system of readingcontrary to written order takes years to learn andhas fallen out of fashion in recent decades  Whilethere are still many people who can read kanbuntexts very few can actually write them  In the nineteenthcentury however kanbun was still widelyused and it is interesting to note that some of the firstEuropean language instruction books written in Japanemploy similar systems for reading English andother languages in Japanese                              A Balance of Trade            I was amused and bemused by

butnot a single word of Franglais nor would any Franglaisexpression appear in the paragraph were ittranslated into French  The current balance of trademay be in favor of English but overall it is clearlystill heavily in favor of French            As Martyn Ecott cleverly demonstrates francophonepurists have reason for alarm the flow absoluteflood of vocabulary from French into Englishonce resulting in a kind of hybridization has latelybeen somewhat reversed depositing in the elegantFrench language such grotesque neologisms as unpins or hip hop  Certainly though most of thesefreaks will be dislodged and swept away by the passageof time while those already rooted in theFrench language like smoking and weekend havebecome naturalized and no longer jar in the Gallicear  The real threat to the French language is notthat some faddish expressions and technical termsare invading French  No the real menace alreadyalmost a fait accompli is that English will replaceFrench altogether in

toward writersand editors who have the wit to harbor doubts abouttheir infallibility which ought to include just aboutanyone worthy of consideration as a professionalAs I have said on numerous occasions books thatinform are of no use to people who think that theyknow it all for it never occurs to them to look up thestandard American spelling of words like programedprograming  and programer                        But let me interrupt what is a frontispiece  Ialways thought it was a fullpage illustration at thefront of a book  I checked in the RHD Unabridgedand found that definition  What made me check wasa reference in the editors Preface to names listedon the frontispiece  Sure enough on the page facingthe title page is a list of among other things thecontributing editors  Maybe I was out of date withmy understanding of frontispiece  so I looked it up inthe Writers Guide itself  Sure enoughA frontispiece is an illustration that appears oppositethe title page  If there is no frontispiecethis page may contain a list of the authors otherworks or information about other books in theseries                        New to me  I checked in what I consider one of thebest authorities on books Glaisters Glossary of theBook  by Geoffrey Ashall Glaister University of CaliforniaPress nd edition   Glaisters hasan illustration facing the titlepage eitherprinted with the prelims or separately pasted andguarded into a book                        From the wording it is obvious that Glaister is Britishand either frontispiece might not be used thatway in Britain or perhaps this is a new sense of frontispiecenot in use in   I checked in MWIII andin the OED e  neither yielded the definition soughtthough the OEDe has a definition labeled obsoleteand obviously not

Printing  There is an annotated bibliographywhich lists my Oxford Theasurus but fails toinclude notice of the myriad illustrative sentences itcontains  I trust that I shall be forgiven for skimmingover the Usage chapter partly because much of it iscut and dried and the parts that are not confuse theissue of avoiding prejudice with political correctnessa subject that gives me dyspepsia  It is beyondme for example why people in eastern Asia shouldbe offended by the word orient  which is no morethan a reference to the place where the sun rises  Ishall also skip Grammar which seems quite straightforwardand predictable  Scattered here and thereare helpful vignettes that focus on ancillary mattersSPOTTINGA RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE THE HISTORYOF THE SEMICOLON etc            In the chapter on Style I expected to find underpunctuation a fuller treatment than that afforded Ilooked in vain for two things the wisdom offered regardingserial commas whether or when the secondcomma is required or desirable in A B and C andwhat the position is on the use of a comma followingetc in the middle of a sentence  I found neither nordid I find the common editorial term serial commas inthe Index which seems a little thin  It seemed bestnot to try to go through the book systematically butto dip into it here and there  Good advice is givenabout hyphens and adverbs ending in ly precedingadjectives were I being pernickety I should say thatthe word modifier is not necessarily applied only towords that precede a noun and that the rules changewhen a modifier is in apositive or predicative positionas in a wellknown man vs a man well known forhis generosity   Would that it were possible to distillthe vagaries of English compounding into a fivepagetable the editors are forced to offer comments likeequal titles of functions equality is not always easyto decide words go together naturally naturallyfor whom etc and even then to include a columnof exceptions  If you want my advice settle on onelarge dictionary as a standard and look up any compoundsit contains following it slavishly your writingis more important than whether vice president has ahyphen or not  However that does not apply as consistentlyto editors as to the authors of what they areediting            I disagree with the suggested treatment of fractionsin which we are told to write twothirds threeeighths etc  Nonsense  Two thirds and three eighthsare exactly the same in construction as two thousandthree millions  and four birdhouses  Third and eighthare perfectly legitimate nouns in English and do notconform to the convention that requires eightysix                        In the section on Computers I was particularlyinterested in reading a vignette on spelling checkersp  made to appear ludicrous and on scanningp   I agree that no nonparsing checker couldfind the error of writing ewe for you  wile for while bin for been  or sum for some   Such errorsbut nothalve for haveare unlikely if the text was writtenby a literate person  In any event I have found thatspelling checkers do find typographical errors thatresult in nonwords like fulkly for fully  which resultfrom fast huntandpeck typing  As far as scanninggoes I have been shopping for a flatbed scannerbecause there are many sources I am now usingthat I should like to have in machinereadable formfor sorting and other processing  The handheldscanner I have used is very tricky and sensitive andas the Writers Guide admonishes creates as manyproblems as it solves but I am going to pursue thesubject nonetheless hoping that a useful balancemight be struck in which less time is spent correctingthan in initial keyboarding plus correcting            In the chapter on Typography information thatappears in an illustration p  is somewhat misleadingfor the inference is that small capitals arethe same height as xhigh letters of a given fontThat might not have been the implication for smallcaps are usually sixty per cent of cap height thoughthere is no standard  In the example shown a sansserifface the xheight of the characters is quitelarge in different faces the xheight to capheightratio varies as does the smallcap height  I have myown notions of typographic design which are likelyto be at odds with those of many designers and Ihave seen fit to comment on particularly heinous examplesof design encountered in reviewing  This isnot however the place to embark on a disputatiouswrangle leading nowhere  Suffice it to say I findnothing serious to quibble with in the basic advicegiven though I would caution against using theGuide as a quick course to typographic design            The Writers Guide contains a huge amount ofuseful information and if one does not already havea style manual it might be as good as anotherthough many would argue that nothing could equallet alone surpass the Chicago Manual of Style   Ifone has become accustomed to a particular manualthe temptation is to stay with it it is like a comfortableold shoe even when a new edition becomesavailable the information appears in approximatelythe same place and in a familiar format  Things arechanging though and I am a little surprised that Ihave heard nothing about the availability of a stylemanual integrated with the software of a word processingpackage            Laurence Urdang                              Random House Historical Dictionary of AmericanSlang            To refer to the publication of the first volume ofthe HDAS is longawaited would be to give awayno secret for many linguists have long been awareof Jonathan Lighters announcement of his projectseveral years ago and it was Stuart Flexners coup tograb it for Random House            In his substantial Introduction Lighter treatsseveral aspects of his subject from What Is Slangthrough Slang in Its Cultural Environment SomeFeatures of Slang The History of Slang Influences onSlang Military and Civilian Slang in Other EnglishSpeakingCountries to Motives for Using Slang and afinal word History of the Project the last revealingthat the editors initial interest in such a project wentback to   The Introduction is followed by a Bibliographywith useful brief annotations the followingpages are occupied by the usual paraphernalia involvedin a Guide etc            So many reviews of the HDAS will have beenpublished in the press by the time this appears thatmost of our comments will seem redundant  Still itis useful to note a few things that journalists arelikely to overlook or pay little or no heed  For instanceit is worth noting that although the Dictionaryof American Regional English  edited by FredericG Cassidy serves as a source for Lighter it isnot listed among the titles in the Selected BibliographyIt is not in the slightest way suggested thatpicking up citations from other works is in any waycurious or reprehensibleanyone would be a foolto research any subject without relying on the scholarshipthat has gone beforebut one would haveexpected the DARE to be found among books likeFarmer and Henleys Dictionary of Slang and ItsAnalogues  Chapmans New Dictionary of Slang Wentworth and Flexners Dictionary of AmericanSlang  and the others listed            A dictionary is a reference book not a text andwith few exceptions its purpose is to provide a reliablesource of information about the words andphrases one looks up  It is not a text whose purposeis to teach users words that they do not alreadyknow  Yet the writing of a review puts a differentcomplexion on the use of a dictionary and I haveoften remarked that the most useful realistic reviewsof such works can be written only after onehas lived with the subject book for many monthsusing it all the while  It is thus with some of thereference books that I have edited users have toldme that although the style of a given work was unfamiliarto them at first they made the effort to masterit and were rewarded by information and itstreatment not available from books previously used            For many slang and its treatmenthoweverclinicalis taboo for it is loaded language not somuch with the expected fourletter words of whichthere are only a handful but with racial religiousand ethnic slurs which are both derogatory and offensiveand are shunned like the plague by liberalsA high percentage of slang consists of such matter            Like other reviewers who have not had the leisureto become acquainted with the HDAS graduallyI am compelled to browse through snatchingat pieces here and there  Because of a recent criticismI was recently moved to express concerning thespelling of flack for press agent I looked it up andfound it under flack  where the fancied etymology isquoted from Better English June  That alert weekly Varietyis trying to cointhe word flack as a synonym for publicityagent  The word is said to be derived from GeneFlack a movie publicity agent A Yiddishword similar in sound means one who goesaround talking about the other fellows business                        The editors comment is the Yiddish word referredto is unkn the closest words available are unlikely onvarious grounds  I have known the term for most ofmy life and its source was never a mystery to mestill I must allow that like others I am not immuneto succumbing to the trap of believing in the infallibilityof a fact that is simply not so  My own etymologywhich seems painfully obvious is revealed ifone acknowledges that the proper spelling is flak which at once clarifies the etymological origin flak The metaphor is too transparent to waste the spacefor an explanation            I confess to being less gregarious than the restof the population much of my contact with theworld comes through periodicals radio and televisionConsequently I am known to vent my spleenwith a hearty Caramba a loancurseword not tobe found in the HDAS   Neither is the socalled bypuzzlers minced oath Egad  which was utteredby a blimpish comicstrip character whose identity Iam too lazy to look up  These interjections could beconsidered marginal slang but they are not so labeledin dictionaries and do not meet Lighters criteriaOn the other hand egg in the goodbad eggcontext is in and I should not expect many dictionariesto label that sense in contrast to the aerialbomb sense which is slang anything but Informalor depending on their style Colloquial   Still thelabeling in dictionaries is not only erratic but internallyinconsistent  The Random House Unabridged Second Edition labels fuck as Vulgar  but none of thedefinitions given for that term in the dictionary itselfseems to fit  The label for cunt is Slang  vulgar  andthe distinction is lost on me  My vote would havebeen for Taboo for all such terms and these daysthere are fewer and fewer  The pattern of labelingat shit in the RHD is quite arcane  I ought to mentionthat as Managing Editor of the First Edition ofthe RHD  such matters fell into my purview butonly shit labeled Slang vulgar  was entered in thatbook  I cannot recall the reasoning behind the labelover which we agonized for many hours but itmeans nothing to me now            Noteworthy are shifts in language levels  Dingbat in the printing sense of a typographic ornamentlike the open book symbol at the end of thisreview was once slang but is now standard EnglishCook  in the sense of juggle the books was oncestandard but is now slang  It would be interesting tofind more of these            Humility is a desirable attribute of those whodeal with language and it ill behooves puristsand precisions to turn their noses up at vulgariansand others who fail to preserve the language in itssupposedly pristine condition  People who cleave tosuch attitudes may also scorn slang but they arevery often unaware of the true pristine conditionof the language or of the origins of words that arestandard in contemporary speech  Such peopleshould be advised that much if not most slang ismetaphoric in origin and that much of it can be quitesubtle  True there is not much subtlety in callinga gun a cannon  a ship a canoe  or an incompetentprizefighter a canvasback  but that a canoe inspectoris a gynecologist is not immediately obvious that CementCity might be thought picturesquely obliquefor a cemetery and that chain lightning is certainlyas descriptive as rotgut for cheap potent liquor cannotescape anyones notice  When overworkedsuch images cloy which is why slang is constantlyshifting and why some of its elements like neat andkeen  are occasionally recycledwhy waste a goodword  It must also be said that the th centurymore than any earlier time has seen the accumulationof a more detailed documentation of life as anyoneknows from the plethora of scratchy saccadicoften soundless images thrown on our televisionscreens a series on American gangsters for instancerepeats radio broadcasts of the s ands bringing to us vividly not only the pictorialimages of the day when to modern youth everyonewore black and white clothing and makeup but thewords and accents of Franklin D Roosevelt HueyLong Walter Winchell and others who epitomizethe era  Such language ought not be allowed to goto waste it is ripe for recycling            What is also brought dramatically to the attentionof a reader of the HDAS is the relatively largenumber of words and expressions that have remainedcurrent in the language over the yearsSome have been retained by becoming standard oftenbecause there is no other convenient or adequatelydescriptive standard term for the samething like Charley horse for a leg cramp others aregenuinely standard words but were applied in aslang context like chassis for a womans body manyare not frequent enough to have bored their userssufficiently to drop them like chew out for scoldsome might have been dropped by those who are inonly to be picked up by the squares to make themselvesappear to be in like cheeba for a cannabiscigarette  Many have little use today but are colorfullike Chicago piano or typewriter for machinegun  Some have experiential reference for somepeople but are obscurely metaphoric for others likecatbird seat vantage point which is often treated asarcane but which is meaningful to anyone who hasseen the way a catbird alights on a tree branch fromwhere the surrounding territory can be surveyed forprovender or predators            As one might expect I enjoy reading dictionariesbut some make more interesting reading thanothers  The HDAS should serve not only as superbdocumentation of an aspect of the language too oftenleft to amateurs among whom most professionallexicographers including me must be counted butalso as an engaging colorful source of the pleasure tobe derived from revelation and reminiscence  Furthervolumes are eagerly awaited            Laurence Urdang                              Ship to Shore            Those of us who deal with the lexicographicside of

largely among naval typesthose yachtsmen who enjoy the leftover jargon ofthe sea and a handful of eccentrics like Jeans a fewothers I could mention and me  My own connectionstems from a lifetime of sailing a brief stint inthe WWII US Navy and an abiding lexicographicconcern for terms nautical the last of which is manifestingitself in the preparation of a historical nauticaldictionary

does not deny thatindeed provideshis own quotation from the Pall Mall Gazette of February  not listed in the OEDe  to supportthe architectural referencebut he persists in offeringthe opinion that because the word is used in associationwith buildings in Liverpool this makes it likely that the word is of nautical origin  Thatis imaginative but unsupported by the evidence andI fear that Jeans has stretched a point  My suspicionsaroused I found that a number of entries hadneither a nautical origin nor perceivably any nauticalconnection jingo  offered as probably a Basqueword acquires a nautical connection becauseBasques were among the earliest organised whalersin Europe and as harpooners their expressionswould have carried some weight with other seafarersThat is a fancied nautical origin at

aswell some of which have been given thorough treatmentI have not seen elsewhere as complete a discussionof loggerheads  but it is offset by the veryinclusion of mind your ps and qs  about which

theory to theeffect that the Spaniards used to throw starvinghorses overboard when they were becalmed whichI maintain to be an incredibly poor fiction he alsobrings in Golfo de las Yeguas gulf of

intriguingsuggestion that horses aboard sailing ships oftenhad to be lifted overboard into the sea to relievetheir thirst a theory that even Jeans regards as ludicrous            There are four

whether some Britishmatron in Harrods wasnt even now saying chafor the same reason            The alteration of tsk to tisk is like the backformationof certain words  Someone comes up witha spelling to approximate a sound which someoneelse eventually reads mispronounces and thus turnsinto a new sound  Over the years the new soundmay acquire its own distinction a dignified gentlemanannouncing Ahem

English has merits and demeritsNot all ideas that arise in my mind in my own tonguecan be expressed in English as well because not allwords phrases sayings and usages in my mothertongue have English equivalents  It was when I wasa highschool student that I became convinced ofthis fact for the first time            A classmate of mine came to me one afternoonwith a question  As I was the best student in Englishhe expected a correct answer  What he askedme was How can we ask a question in English thatelicits an ordinal number as answer  Abraham Lincolnwas the th President of the US try to form aquestion to which the answer is the th  I wasstill amat a loss for an answer            When seven years back I started writing anEnglish language column entitled English Corner ina wellknown Malayalam magazine for students andcandidates it became evident from the letters ofmy readers that most of them wanted to know howto ask such a question  I had already learnt that althoughthere is no idiomatic way in English of askingsuch a question it is very common in Malayalam andalso I think in other Indian vernaculars  UnlikeEnglish those languages do not distinguish betweenorder or position            As a consequence we have found our own waysof asking such questions in English  I have collectedthe following ones  What is the rankpositionordinal number ofBill Clinton as the Presidentamong thepresidents of the US  What is the chronologicalnumerical orderof Bill Clinton as the Presidentamong thepresidents of the US  Which of the presidents of the US is BillClinton                        But none of them is really acceptable as idiomatic toEnglish speakers  The second one would be acceptableto them if it is changed into Where in thenumerical order of the presidents of the US doesBill Clinton come            Sir Randolph Quirk the most famous Britishgrammarian says that the ordinal question can beobliquely asked in English like this How manypresidents were there before Bill Clinton  Butsuch a question does not satisfy us  Our answer tothat question will be the total number of formerpresidents            I have recently come to know that it is correctin colloquial British speech to ask What numberpresident of the US is Bill Clinton  In my estimationthis question is undoubtedly the best solution            Recently a reader of my column sent me a letterasking me whether it would be correct to useHow manieth to form an ordinal question  Howmany yields answers with cardinal numbers likefive ten fifteen How many children have you  Ihave five   Then what about using How maniethHow manyeth for an answer that contains an ordinalnumber like fifth tenth fifteenth  UnfortunatelyHow manieth president of the US is BillClinton does not exist in

in his old age wrote about his having learnedabout the difference between the American languageand my native Unitedkingdomese  He saidthat as a young man recently out of Oxford in he encountered Americans other than the fewhighly educated Rhodes scholars he had met at OxfordHe then became aware of the significant differencesbetween the two Englishes and of the increasingdominance of American English  He told aboutthis in his book of reminiscences and reflections Experienceswhich was published in  seven yearsbefore his deathEngland was now in a minority in the EnglishspeakingWorld  The majority of the people whoselanguage was English were now living in NorthAmerica and North American English had becomethe standard form of the language  It was irrelevantthat English had been spoken in England long beforeAmerica had been heard of in Europe  Historynever stands still and this had reduced my Unitedkingdomesedialect to the status of being a bizarreprovincial brogue                        Toynbees dialect actually was Englandese Scotlandeseand Irelandese are quite distinct from thatdialect  And Unitedstatesese had become a linguisticreality before the thirteen American colonies had rebelledand declared their independence  Soon afterthe American Revolution several of the founding fathersof the new nation advocated establishing anacademy similar to those of France and Sweden tostandardize and in effect enshrine an official Americanform of English  The academy was not establishedSoon after the independence treaty betweenGreat Britain and the United States had been signedin  Noah Webster then in his midtwenties issuedhis book Grammatical Institute of the EnglishLanguage  This was the first of the several bookswhich made him a leading authority on Unitedstateseseand in some ways a creator of it  His mostimportant work The American Dictionary of the EnglishLanguage was published in             Todayas Englishspeaking people in all partsof the world should be awarethere are several distinctdialects in American English  The predominantone which in itself has subdialects is convenientlycalled General American  Experts estimate thatabout two thirds of the American people living onabout  per cent of the land area speak this dialectorwith this accent if one prefers that termThe terms are not quite synonymous but in thiscontext they can be taken as such  Recently a polishedprecise form of General American has cometo be called Network Standard it is the speech ofmany of the prominent announcers and commentatorson national television            General Canadian EnglishCanadeseis closerto General American than it is to any of the BritishEnglishes but it is distinct from the American ones insome spellings usages and pronunciations and in afew peculiar intonations                              Borrowings            Borrowed words fill gaps in a language for whichthey were not designed much as if one wereto take pieces from one jigsaw puzzle and use themin another which happens to be missing a few  Orto use another simile they are like shrubs transplantedto an alien climate sometimes the shrubloses its spreading habit or becomes dwarfed sometimesit expands luxuriantly taking up more spacethan when on native ground occasionally it keepsits original shape and size            These were some of my reflections as morethan a decade ago I watched the evening newsbroadcasts and accompanying advertisements  Bythen  I had lived in Greece for more than two decadesand was aware of the many English words alsoat home there but now I was struck not just by thelarge number but by their use in official GreekUntil then I think I had assumed that only theeveryday speech of the man in the street andthe very demotic Greek of some magazines andnewspapers had incorporated these borrowings  Inthe space of a few weeks I jotted down several hundredEnglish loanwords most of which could begrouped under the headings of EntertainmentFood Games and Sports Technology and Transportation            Predictably Hollywood has given a good manywords to Modern Greek  Cowboy detective gangsterthriller western all refer to film categoriesthough gangster or rather gangsterism  can bemany kinds of coercive behavior even schoolyardbullying  Picnic rock striptease  and video have enteredGreek with their meanings intact rock considerablynarrowed

long before snackbars arrived on the scene            But perhaps the greatest number of loanwordshas been provided by games and sports  Some havebeen trimmed basketball  to mpsket   Others areunaltered baseball football golf jogging pingpong soccer surfing tennis volleyball water polo But bridge foul goal  team manager match out and rally have in Greek none but the meaningspertaining to

andstationwagon has lost its wagon             Allowing as always for a difference in pronunciationmany other words are perfectly recognizableand many acronyms too  BBC CIA FBI FOBNASA NATO UFO  et al  Nevertheless the usage ofsome recognizable words can certainly muddle conversationsbetween foreign Englishspeakers andGreeks  Flirt Gk phlrt  is no longer a person whoindulges in harmless dalliance but a lover male orfemale or the love affair itself more often thannot illicit hula hoop means leotards nylon is thetransparent kind of plastic shocking used as a pluralnoun Gk skin  means offcolor or risqu storiesand Texas  as in the sentence It has become texasmeans out of control maniacally chaotic and violentthough this may be an idiosyncratic use by asmall group of people            Words that are or become nouns in Greek areassigned articles indicating gender and some wordsare also inflected like Greek nouns but the majoritybecome uninflected neuters which anyway havefewer inflections than feminines or masculines sothat a change in the article is often the only indicationof case and syntax  One inference to be drawnfrom this might be that the choice of neuter is inevitablesince the gender of most English nouns is inscrutableAnother inference might be that the sametolerance displayed by Greeks in their dealings withresident foreignersat any rate American and Europeanoneshas been extended to English wordswhich are as noted largely exempted from thestrictures of Greek grammar and allowed to retaintheir alien habit  A thirdperhaps only a corollaryto the secondmight be that the longer a borrowingremains in use the more likely it is to be treatedlike a native  Recordwoman  if it was not a nonceword and is still in use may be an example of thisthough obviously feminine it was uninflectedwhereas lady  a Greek resident of much longerstanding has acquired all the inflections of a femininenoun  Further evidence is that the many Turkishloanwords in use for centuries and with no obviouspreponderance of one gender are with veryfew exceptions fully inflected as are Italian musicaland nautical terms likewise of long standing  Inshort it seems that a process of naturalization hasbeen and may still be at work            If in the future Modern Greek continues to beas hospitable to English words as it has been in therecent past there are likely to be more and moreneuter nouns with few inflections or none at all atleast until the new words have put down roots  Stillbecause these borrowed aberrant words representrelatively rare infractions of the timehonored rulesof grammar I doubt that matters will ever reach thepoint where literate Greeks would be driven tognashing of teeth and tearing of hair by Greekequivalents of barbarisms such as to you and I and Usteachers are   Such trials and temptations to mayhemare reserved for the literateand haplessspeakers of English                              Living with Fossilized Ears            I returned to England in  after spending years in Canada  Since then I have had to doalmost as much readjusting to this changed Englandas I did when I moved to Canada for the first time  Iexpected many details of daily life to have changedor to be unfamiliar but I was not prepared for thealterations in the pronunciation of words which hadoccurred in such a relatively short time  I have alsonoticed a sharp acceleration in the decline of dialectalusages less in pronunciation than in vocabulary Ifind that many people in my own county of Suffolkfor example no longer know dialect words and expressionsthat were universal currency as recently asthe s            Some quite common words have undergonestriking changes  I am still waiting for somebody toexplain to me just how and when yoghurt  which hadalways been pronounced YOHgert mysteriouslymetamorphosed into YOGert  At first I suspectedthat some television advertising campaign hadcaused the change but then I remembered that theBlue Band Margarine commercials of the s ands never did succeed in reviving the old pronunciationof margarine with a hard g             It seems that nobody calls the police any morethey dial  for the pleece   If houses sink into theearth the cause is no longer subsidence  pronouncedSUBsidence it is subSIDEence an obvious backformationfrom the verb subside   The inhabitants ofmy own home county of Suffolk used to be noted forpronouncing the word wholly to rhyme with bully just as Elizabeth I would have done while everyoneelse rhymed it with holy   I keep hearing it pronouncedas HOLly  How did this start            It is possible that radio and TV announcers areto blame although the Blue Band example showsthat TV is not accepted as an authority on pronunciationwhen the purchasers of the product kept oncalling it marjoreen in spite of the manufacturersinstructions to the contrary            TV and radio announcers seem to obey changesin pronunciation rather than initiating them  I findmyself often confused by the accelerating trendtowards adopting back vowels in diphthongs to replacefront vowels  I was baffled for quite a longtime by a conversation on a bus in which someoneannounced that because the cool autumn weatherhad arrived they were going to buy a kite   I wastrying to speculate on how a kite could keep youwarm when I finally realized from the context thatthey were planning to purchase a coat             This particular alteration in pronunciation seemsto have been widely accepted  Many people nowseem to live in a hice rather than a house and thispronunciation is by no means confined to Royalty andthe aristocracy speakers of the famed Received PronunciationPlus  The BBC announcer Michael Buerkis an invariant user of this diphthong for what wasformerly a low back diphthong  He stumped mewhen reporting that the dissident physicist AndreiSakharov had been shited dine when trying tospeak in the Soviet Parliament  Sakharov had ofcourse been shouted down  It would be an interestingexperiment for phoneticians to ask Michael Buerkto recite the line how now brown cow             There seem to me to be numerous explanationsfor these phenomena  The continuing drift from backvowels to front vowels is surely no more than thecontinuation of the Great Vowel Shift which began inthe fifteenth century  Like the building of the Alpsand the Himalayas it is a process that is so slow thatwe cannot perceive it happening            Another factor not quite as old although not anovelty either is the pressure of the speakasyouspellmovement first described by the Fowler brothersin Modern English Usage   The pronunciation ofplace names has been tending to conform to theirwritten appearance ever since the coming of therailways and I notice that the letter t is now alwayssounded in Hertfordshire  as is the letter l in Colchester The speakasyouspell faction have definitelywon a final victory over the Fowlers when itcomes to the word conduit   The pronunciationKONdewit has now established itself as the standardform and there is no point in trying to reviveKUNdit  The same applies to untoward the oncecorrectpronunciation unTOEerd is dead and mightas well be buried            Now of course conduit and untoward are notwords common in everyday conversation so it ishardly surprising that when people have to say themfor the first time they guess the pronunciation fromthe spelling always a dangerous procedure in EnglishIt is a puzzle though that the verb conflictshould have had its stress changed to CONflict so as toconform to the stress in the noun conflict             One important lesson to be learned from thesechanges is that the expected tendency of recordingsto stabilize pronunciation has not in fact happenedWhen sound recording was first invented many peopleremembering how the invention of printing hadfrozen grammar in its Renaissance forms thoughtthat recordings would do the same for the spokenlanguage  I can remember that as late as the smany people conscientiously pronounced glue asglyoo and went to the office wearing a syootI have not heard suit pronounced that way fordecades            One might look ahead a hundred years to imaginethe squeaky English pronunciation of the late stcentury all front vowels and with a heavy rhythmcaused by habitual stressing of the first syllable inwords  Perhaps Old English sounded something likethat            My French mother who has lived in Englishspeakingenvironments since  still uses theFrench pronunciations and expressions from that periodto the great amusement of her younger relativesI find it fascinating to observe the parallelchanges in English pronunciation particularly sobecause everyone I ask assures me that no suchchanges have taken place and that everyone has alwayscalled yoghurt YOGert  It is strange that a backvowel has displaced a diphthong there I would haveexpected YIEgert instead  Where is there a PhDstudent some latterday Grimm who will propoundthe laws by which our pronunciation is still evolving                              Titillating Titles Allison Whiteheads engagingexploration of schools of titling XX  cautionsagainst titles
