                    Introduction        Recombinant human interleukin rhIL is a        pleiotropic cytokine that regulates the growth and        development of hematopoietic stem cells and decreases the        proinflammatory mediators of cytokine and nitric oxide        production   Treatment with rhIL decreases the        production of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor        necrosis factor TNF and interleukin IL and        inhibits NFB binding activity     In animal        models both of collageninduced and adjuvantinduced        arthritis rhIL reduced both the level of synovitis and        the histologic lesion score in the joints          Rheumatoid arthritis RA is a chronic inflammatory        disease of unknown etiology Its worldwide prevalence is        approximately    There appears to be no single        therapeutic regimen or combination of therapies that has        consistently been associated with sustained improvement        ie remission   A number of diseasemodifying drugs        eg methotrexate are available to treat RA but are        limited by significant toxicity requiring adjunct therapy        or are of variable efficacy There are currently a number        of anticytokine and other immunemodulating therapies in        clinical trials   The proinflammatory cytokine TNF has        been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of RA           Etanercept sTNFRFc and infliximab chimeric        antiTNF monoclonal antibody have been shown to be        efficacious in the treatment of patients with RA for whom        treatment with at least one diseasemodifying antirheumatic        drug had previously failed    both of these        biologicals have been approved by regulatory agencies for        the treatment of patients with RA        rhIL has previously been assessed in a PhaseIII        masked placebocontrolled trial in patients with active        Crohns disease The data suggested clinical benefit as        assessed from the mean change from baseline in the Crohns        Disease Severity Index after  days at doses of  and         gkg per week          P   The researchers        concluded that rhIL was safe at the doses and schedules        used and had a therapeutic effect    The findings        supported the initiation of a phaseIII clinical trial in        patients with RA                    Materials and Methods                  Patients          Men and women at least  years of age were eligible          to participate if they had met the American College of          Rheumatology ACR criteria for RA for at least one year          and were in functional Class I II or III   All          patients had to have had at least one failed trial of a          diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug DMARD and had to          have at least  painful and  swollen joints at entry          No DMARD therapy was allowed within  weeks of          randomization Patients receiving nonsteroidal          antiinflammatory drugs corticosteroids   mg per          day or both were allowed in the trial if they had been          on stable doses for at least four weeks before          randomization Required baseline laboratory values          included serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen             the upper limit of normal and alanine aminotranferase and          aspartate aminotransferase    the upper limit of          normal Exclusionary laboratory values included a          platelet count of  mm  hematocrit           and a whitebloodcell count  mm  Other          exclusionary criteria included use of intravenous or          intraarticular corticosteroids within four weeks of          randomization any prior use of cyclosporine or          cyclophosphamide use of any investigational agent within           days of randomization severe extraarticular          manifestations of RA acute infection requiring          antibiotic therapy within two weeks of randomization          other autoimmune disease eg systemic lupus          erythematosus or any other condition that the          investigator thought might have placed the patient at          undue risk if they had participated in the trial Men and          women of childbearing potential were required to use          approved methods of birth control Women had to have a          negative result on a test of serum beta human chorionic          gonadotropin at screening          Medications including cyclosporine cyclophosphamide          and any DMARD were not allowed The use of intravenous or          intraarticular corticosteroids was not permitted The          following analgesics were permitted acetaminophen          acetaminophen with codeine acetaminophen with oxycodone          and propoxyphene Patients were instructed not to take          analgesics within  hours of their planned study          visit                          Study protocol          An Institutional Review Board approved the protocol at          each of the  participating centers Patients gave prior          written informed consent to any studyrelated          procedures Within  days before randomization patients          had a complete medical history taken and a complete          physical examination A standard hematology profile was          prepared including whitebloodcell count with          differential count and a serumchemistry profile was          prepared consisting of sodium potassium chloride          blood urea nitrogen creatinine glucose phosphorus          total bilirubin alkaline phosphatase aspartate          aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase albumin uric          acid total protein Creactive protein CRP          fibrinogen and a microscopic urinalysis An additional          serum specimen was taken on days    and  to          measure for the presence of IL Screening clinical          assessments included vital signs counts of tender and          swollen joints the patients global assessment and          assessment of their pain and a physicians global          assessment using a point Likert scale   none or          good to   severe or very bad Rheumatoid factor was          also measured A serum pregnancy test was done in all          female patients of childbearing potential Disease          activity and clinical laboratory values were assessed          again on day  and then every  weeks for  weeks and          at  weeks post dosing Day procedures were performed          before the first dose of study drug was administered          Rheumatologists or trained study coordinators          performed clinical assessments To minimize variability          the same person assessed disease activity during the          trial whenever possible          Patients could withdraw from the trial at any time for          any of the following reasons at the patients request          if a serious adverse event occurred if a concomitant          medication not permitted by the protocol was required or          if a patient became pregnant did not comply with          studyrelated procedures or needed surgery                          Treatment          Twelve centers randomized patients using a central          randomization to one of five treatment groups placebo           or  gkg of rhIL twice per week or  or           gkg of rhIL given subcutaneously once per week The          maximum dose in any single injection was  g The          study coordinator taught patients how to administer the          study drug subcutaneously themselves Either rhIL or a          placebo saline was supplied as  mg lyophilized powder          in a phosphateglycine formulation and reconstituted with           ml water for injection                          Statistical analysis          The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate          the safety and tolerability of rhIL given to patients          with active RA The safety endpoints were the incidence          and severity of reported adverse events and abnormal          laboratory findings Adverse events are reported without          regard to causality and are described for the study as a          whole and by treatment group Descriptive statistics          summarizing the incidence and severity of adverse events          are presented          The secondary objective of this trial was to evaluate          and characterize the clinical activity of rhIL The          endpoint used to characterize clinical activity was the          proportion of patients whose disease improved according          to the  ACR criteria   The overall proportion of          patients whose disease improved within each individual          category of the ACR criteria is also presented          Exploratory comparative tests on differences in the          proportions of improvement between the rhILtreated          groups and the placebo group were done using a twosided          Fishers exact test Logistic regression was used to          explore the effect of total weekly dose dosing schedule          treatment duration and outcome on clinical activity          Missing data were handled by both the ad hoc          lastobservationcarriedforward method and the          worstcasescenario method In the          lastobservationcarriedforward approach when an          observation for a week time point was lacking for a          patient the last available observed value was carried          forward In the worstcasescenario approach dropouts          were treated as failures The sample size was based on an          assumed  placebo success rate The sample size had a           power to detect a  difference from the          placebo success rate in at least one of the rhIL          treatment groups at the    level of          significance                            Results                  Characteristics of patients          The pretherapy characteristics of the patients are          summarized in Table  Sixtyseven women and  men were          randomized to the study and  patients received at least          one dose of study drug One patient was randomized but          never received the study drug as they withdrew consent          prior to treatment The mean age of all patients was           years range  and the mean time since diagnosis was           years range  No significant differences          between the pretherapy characteristics of men and women          were noted The mean numbers of tender and swollen joints          in all patients at screening were  and           respectively Fortynine of the  patients  who          were dosed completed  weeks of dosing The majority of          patients  of  or  who discontinued early          withdrew due to lack of clinical effect Eleven patients           withdrew because of adverse events Of the          remaining six patients four withdrew their consent one          was lost to followup and one received a prohibited          medication Patients who discontinued from the trial were          evenly distributed among all the treatment groups                          Safety          rhIL was well tolerated No doselimiting          toxicities were observed In the  patients who withdrew          because of an adverse event none of these events were          considered to be drug related One patient died during          the study from complications associated with a          spontaneous pneumothorax this patient was in the placebo          group The only adverse events clearly related to rhIL          were reactions at the injection site which were seen in            of  of patients who received rhIL and          none of the  placebo recipients The incidence of          injectionsite reactions was not related to any dose or          schedule These reactions erythema or erythema with          induration were mild and resolved within days after the          study drug was discontinued There were no statistically          significant differences in the incidences of respiratory          infections nonrespiratory infections or edema A          higher incidence of infection in the rhIL treated          group  than in the placebo group  was not          statistically significant            P   Clinical trials with          other agents that affect levels of circulating TNF have          also found more frequent nonstatistical differences in          the incidence of upperrespiratory infections            Adverse events occurring in more than  of patients are          summarized in Table           No significant changes in hematology or chemistry          parameters were noted during the study There were no          statistically significant changes in fibrinogen levels or          platelet counts in rhIL treated patients compared with          placebo during the study at all doses and schedules                          Disease activity          No clear therapeutic effect associated with the          administration of rhIL was observed Figure describes          the data using the  ACR criteria for response at the          various doses or schedules tested The placebo response          rate at the  improvement criteria was unusually high           for a placebocontrolled trial Several           patients in the placebo group experienced a significant           improvement in their tender and swollenjoint          counts during the study These findings in the placebo          group obscure any comparative rhIL benefit Values for          placebotreated patients regressed towards baseline          during the followup period in all analyses          performed          The group treated with rhIL at  gkg once per          week produced a statistically significant improvement in          tenderjoint counts            P   at  weeks Figure           The mean percentage of improvement in the tenderjoint          count at this dose and schedule was  Figure  This          trend was consistent when an intenttotreat ITT          analysis was used to evaluate changes from baseline in          tenderjoint count in all rhIL treated cohorts            P   There is no obvious          reason why an improvement in tenderjoint count were not          mirrored by changes in other clinical measurements          Comparative assessment unadjusted for multiple          comparisons at the endoftreatment time point revealed          statistically significant correlations between serum          levels of IL and CRP to each of the six clinical          outcomes tenderjoint count

other four clinical assessments and ILCRP were          stronger with all                            Discussion          In this study no therapeutic benefit of rhIL at          the doses and frequencies of administration studied was          found Some individual measurements of therapeutic effect          tenderjoint counts and biologic activity IL levels          were observed rhIL was well tolerated at all          doses          Except for the tenderjoint count none of the          observed disease activities was statistically different          from placebo according to the ACR criteria at the           improvement level The inability of rhIL to bring          about a statistically significant improvement in the ACR           criteria may also be the result of an inability of          rhIL to stimulate the synthesis of acutephase          proteins of the significant clinical response of several          placebotreated patients or of a lack of adequate power          of the study to show efficacy Larger clinical trails of          rhIL at higher or more frequent dosing intervals and          for a longer dosing period may provide more definitive          data on the safety and efficacy of rhIL in the          treatment of patients with RA          The mechanism of action of rhIL in the treatment of          active RA most likely results from the ability of rhIL          to reduce levels of TNF IL and IL p The          antiinflammatory activity of rhIL is mediated in part          by inhibition of NFBdependent transcriptional          activation of proinflammatory cytokine genes The ability          of rhIL to affect levels of IL is also probably          mediated through this mechanism An analysis of          pharmacodynamic markers in skin biopsies obtained from          patients with moderate psoriasis treated with rhIL          revealed lower levels of INF TNF and inducible          nitric oxide than before treatment                            Conclusion        These preliminary data suggest that rhIL may be        safely administered to patients with active RA at a variety        of doses and schedules No doselimiting adverse event was        observed The dose of  gkg of rhIL once per week        suggested a minimal therapeutic effect an improvement in        tenderjoint counts Further studies are warranted to find        out if higher or more frequent doses of rhIL may be safe        and efficacious in treating RA                    Abbreviations        ACR  American College of Rheumatology CRP  Creactive
