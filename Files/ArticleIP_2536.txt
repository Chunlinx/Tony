                                 Beyond Research            No one can say what thewelfarereform bill will bring but one unlikely outcome already shows signs oftaking place Childcare policy may finally receive practical rather thanpolemical attention For more than three decades social scientists have beenstudying the costs and benefits of child care and their work has yielded onlyone consistent result Their research is seized upon waved about politicizedand in the end nothing much gets done But the polarized stalemate cantcontinue much longer for two reasons Child care has become an inescapablepublic issue and social scientists themselves have been expressing a newhumility about childcare research Politicians now have to stop hiding behindthe experts and start improvising policy            Does the welfarereformbill provide enough money to take care of the kids whose single parents are nowforced to work The lines that get drawn on that central question are fairlypredictable Liberal child advocates the Childrens Defense Fund prominentamong them regard the funding billion available over six yearsasalmost surely insufficient to offer the poor a true choice of quality day careWhat we know from childcare research as a press release from Child TrendsInc puts the standard position is that the quality of child care matters forchildrens development and it matters the most for lowincome children            Conservatives are content to assume that a majority ofwomen who leave the rolls will rely on free or cheap unregulated child careby relatives and neighbors as the poor have generally done in the past RonHaskins an influential Republican staff director on the House Ways and MeansCommittee has been outspoken in invoking social science to defend thisposition The latest research he argues has been unable to demonstrate withany certainty that the quality of day care has much of an impact on a childsfuture Why invest more money if it wont make a difference in the longrun            The interesting twist here isthat as far as the science is concerned conservatives are right and liberalslag a wishful step behind when they cite sure proof that early day caredecisively influences a childs development To make sense of the shakierexpertise both sides now confront it helps to trace the history of childcareresearch through three unsettling waves during the past quarter century            The first wave crestedin the s when researchers faced the question What happens when motherswork The mood was apprehensive the phrasing negativewhat harm wasbeing done to babies whose mothers leave them in the care of othersPsychologists looked at maternalinfant bonding as measured by the socalledStrange Situation test in which they observed the partings and reunions ofbabies and mothers and graded the babys behavior from secure to avoidantAll in all the evidence seemed to suggest that infants who spent more than hours a week in nonmaternal care risked being less attached to their mothersand risked displaying uncooperative behavior later in life            When these findings left the lab they werepromptly construed as political propaganda They were part of a backlashagainst the womens movement declared Sandra Scarr a professor of psychologyat the University of Virginia and prominent daycare expert now the CEO ofKinderCare in the strident mood of the moment The advice for women hasalways been to get out of the work force This is just another way of sayingthe same thing            The second wave of studiesfollowed in the s They were more textured and hopeful the question behindthem less dour What kind of nonmaternal care can help infants and childrenLongitudinal studies sought to measure childrens developmenttheir languageskills school achievement cognitive gains social and emotional adjustmentetcgiven different kinds and quality of care in their early years When thewidely varying studies detected shortterm benefits from betterquality careliberals and child advocates trumpeted them Meanwhile conservatives seized onfindings that such benefits faded in later years            Daycare research sincethe early s has been characterized by what the experts call a moreecological approach Studies have lately aimed to take into accountchildrens family characteristicsparental living arrangements and attitudesincome experience with welfare etc But as Sandra Scarr confessed in a recentpaper surveying the childcare landscape the results have pulled the rug outfrom under two decades of work Taken together these studies seem to showthat given basically safe childcare settings the quality of care has next tono measurable independent effect on childrens longterm fates Poor day caredoesnt seem permanently to harm kids whose lives are otherwise in OK shapeNor can good day care be solidly proven to give a dramatic or lasting boost tokids whose home lives are a mess Sometimes it can help but a childs familyappears to be what really counts            In retrospect its clear that earlier studiesmade too much of small effects on development that were derived from very smallsamples The complex interaction between family and daycare situationsto saynothing of individual temperamentsdefies ready measurement But where doesthat leave us Liberals and childcare advocates no longer armed with evidenceto bolster their demands for big investments in childcare quality have twochoices They can either rely on outmoded studies to argue with conservativepoliticians who for the moment have the more authoritative pretext forscrimping on daycare cost and quality Or they can follow the example set byScarr Acknowledging the new research and doing some of it herself Scarrstill champions quality but now on more immediate less quantitative groundsHer approach points the way for liberals to gain credibility by shedding theonus of being social engineers and take their turn at playing the populistantiexpert card            Liberals and child advocates can now explainas conservatives have before them that social policy isnt about enforcingofficially approved choices They can say that regardless of what theexperts tell us its perfectly obvious that cheap care by relatives andneighbors shouldnt become the only feasible alternative for strugglingmothers Parents can make the best decisions for their kids and if they arelooking for quality day care it isnt likely to be because someone in a labcoat tells them it will mean an IQ  points higher at age  It will bebecause they hope it may mean a happier more secure week for their kid and aless anxious one for themselves Whats more the chance to take an activechoice in the matter as a parent may itself be a step toward the moresuccessful better monitored arrangements that poor working parentsand moremiddleclass parents toosay they need and want            A similarly pragmatic spiritbeckons on the conservative side Republican Gov Tommy Thompson of Wisconsinand Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York the conservative vanguard on the issueshow no inclination to exploit research that says in effect Why care aboutdaycare quality Instead theyre busy scrounging for funds to spread good caremore widely Thompson recently came up with  million more for affordablequality child care as welfare mothers head to work million to ensure thatthe working poor arent edged out of the subsidized care they count on and million to increase the supply and quality of overall care Of course thisdecision raises plenty of questions of its own Is  million more going to beenough in a state like Wisconsin How should that money be usedon moreinformal arrangements or on more daycare centers on stiffer regulations or onother financial incentives to improve quality On some of everything Thepolitical debate over those questions will be more practical and lessideological paradoxically enough if scientific claims about a longtermpayoff or the lack of one are left out of it
