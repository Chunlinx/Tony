                                  The Phony War            This is a season of refusal in American politicsThe Clinton scandals exhausted refuse to revive themselves Texas Gov GeorgeW Bush anointed refuses to campaign for president till summer arrivesCongress terrified of Social Security refuses to do anything at all            Politics too abhors avacuum so Washington has concocted a story to fill the void Bill Bradleywhose presidential campaign was written off just months ago is surging andVice President Al Gore the nominee presumptive is in deep trouble No matterthat the New Hampshire primary is  months away In recent weeks the NewYork Times  the Wall Street Journal  the Chicago Tribune many smaller papers and all three newsweeklies have touted the viability ofBradleys campaign and the messiness of Gores Last Sunday the great sageDavid Broder declared that Gore was struggling and conferred the mantle ofelectability on Bradley Bradleys numbers seem to be rising in the polls Oneshows Bradley favored by  percent of Democratic voters trailing Gore by only points Other polls show Bradley in the s trailing Gore by at least points            Bradley is an impressive candidate blessed with celebritythoughtfulness and a good heart and Gore can be an erratic campaigner Butthe Bradley Surge and Gore Stumble have little to do with the candidates Weare witnessing one of the first fake battles of what the Progressive PolicyInstitutes Will Marshall calls the phony war of the campaign This is theperiod when voters are indifferent and when journalists Democraticcandidates and Republican troublemakers spin and position and jockey to writethe script for the coming real campaignin this case a script that makesBradley a white knight and Gore a looming disaster            The first reason for theBradley Surge is that Dollar Bill is proving himself a better fundraiser thananyone expected He collected  million in the first three months of theyear less than half what Gore raised but more than enough to make him alegitimate candidate His first fundraising reports two weeks ago gavejournalists an opening to laud him            The Bradley surge also owes something to his fameBradley is the John McCain of the left the politician who turns baby boomermen weak in the knees His Princeton basketball senseofwhereyouareRhodes Scholar New York Knick mystique won him a free pass as the thinkingmans senator This was only reinforced by his celebrated reluctance to run forpresident in  and  and his politics is broken retirement speech in His reputation as the politician too good for politics has been a keyfeature of the early adulatory campaign coverage            But the most importantreasons for Bradleys supposed surge are independent of the candidate Bradleyhas lucked into a oneonone race Besides serving as yet another usefulbasketball metaphor for BradleyIm going oneonone with Al Gorethetwoman race gives Bradley instant viability Hes automatically one gaffe awayfrom the nomination Political Washington is desperate for a Democratic horserace but a horse race can only happen if Bradley is perceived to be strongand he will only be perceived to be strong if everyone says he is            The oneonone campaign also explains Bradleys apparentrise in the polls As the only challenger Bradley collects all the antiGorevotes Bradleys numbers have climbed as pollsters dropped Richard GephardtPaul Wellstone and Jesse Jackson from their surveys Fiftytwo to  looks alot better for Bradley than  to  to  to  gripes a Gore staffer            Bradleys media boomletalso depends on Democratic anxiety about Gore Gore trails both George W Bushand Elizabeth Dole in nationwide polls More than  percent of one poll samplecalled Gore boring Gore has become a kind of voodoo doll for Clinton Whenthe president is in trouble his approval ratings remain high but Goresnumbers sag A recent Pew Research Center survey found that the vast majorityof Americans are sick of the Clinton administration scandals and they aretaking out their frustration on Gore Americans want someone who continuesClintons policies and programs but who is not Clinton Gore ought to fit thatbill says Pew Director Andrew Kohut But somehow there is a link betweenClinton and Gore that is hurting Gore Democrats feeling panicky over the Gorenumbers are touting Bradley as the remedy Every piece on Bradley emphasizesthat he shares Gores moderate thoughtful New Democrat politics but isnthandcuffed to Clinton            Republicans are doing their best to intensify thisDemocratic anxiety about the vice president They are trying to Quaylize GoreRepublican house members Republican senators the Republican NationalCommittee and Republican interest groups have been assaulting Gore for thepast few months trying to turn him into a figure of fun They have ridiculedhis creating the Internet comment his claim that he and Tipper were themodel for Love Story  and his anecdotes about growing up as a farmboy            The notion that Bradleyis rising and Gore is falling can become true if everyone keeps declaring itso But whats more likely is that time and the natural course of campaignswill take their toll Campaigns are selfcorrecting If Bradley gets closeenough to be a real challenge to Gore he will be subject to the same witheringfire that Gore faces It will be pointed out again and again that Bradley isjust as awkward a campaigner as Gore Bradley who has belittled Goresmicroproposals sprawl traffic etc will see his own selfproclaimed questioned As the plucky challenger Bradley can campaign both to the left andright of Gore picking up support from antiGore prolabor activists on oneday and boosting his probusiness profreetrade agenda to Wall Streeters afew days later But if his campaign really prospers and he has to explain whathe believes hell have a hard time holding that coalition together At themoment Bradley can promote his support for campaign finance reform but if hedoes well hell be battered with questions about his own aggressive fundraising            The progression of the campaign will also rescue Gore fromhis Vice Presidential Malaise The Democratic fretfulness about Gores polls ispremature Vice presidents always poll terribly in the year before theirpresidential campaign George Bush you may remember trailed Gary Hart in polls and Newsweek even ran a cover story about Bush and the wimpfactor Gore has been Clintons lackey for more than six years Hes loyal tohis president and that loyalty makes him look ineffectual George W Bushkills Gore in poll questions about leadership Bush is the manly governor ofTexas while Gore moderates Reinventing Government seminars            The cure for the phony war will be the real oneCome fall and winter surges and stumbles will really mean something By thenGore will be campaigning seriously distancing himself from Clinton andrunning macho ads Bradley will have defined his big ideas and endured theinevitable media backlash to his current rave notices and the voters willactually be paying attention
