                                 Deadbeat Dads            I had done this beforesays the heroine of Mona Simpsons The Lost Father  as she setsoff on her search for the mysterious Egyptian man who left home when she was achild I was always doing things over again in my life she reiterates as ifto reassure readers that she knows the territory looks familiar It does Likeher characters Simpson is addicted to quests for lost fathers Her first bookAnywhere But Here  was the story of a mother and daughterunmoored by the absence of a father The Lost Father  its sequel hadthe daughter seeking to rectify the situation announcing I knew I hadntreally done it right the first time In A Regular Guy  her latestnovel Simpson has yet another heroine looking for her father The trouble isthat Simpson really did do it right the first time and by now she has gottenrather tired            Itsfitting that Simpson cant seem to stop herself for what galvanizedAnywhere But Here was its obsession with obsessives Upon her emergenceon the literary scene almost a decade ago Simpson seemed like a sort of PhilipRoth in reverse a virtuosic ventriloquist for a compelling nonJewishnonurban highenergy American neurotic type Her heroines were restlessMidwestern females absurdly full of optimism and fatally drawn to exoticismwhich presented itself in the form of an unreliable Egyptian Abandoned byMohammed Atassi Ann Stevenson joined her magnificently deluded mother Adelein a compensatory fantasy of escape and renewal This pair of romanticprovincials came from a hardscrabble rural gynocracy and also from theprecincts of mythic caricature An intense realist and a fierce satiristSimpson turned this motherdaughter journey from smalltown Wisconsin inpursuit of fame and a new father in the promised land Los Angeles into asurreal odyssey of female frustration Ann and Adele products of theclaustrophobic s fought and clung to each other and never found their manWith them the classic search for the American Dream became a brilliantlyeccentric matrilineal comedy of no manners            In A Regular Guy  Simpson apparently has concludedthat the time has come to be witheringly ironic rather than comic about theAmerican Dream No longer picaresque the quest for father and fortune now aimsto be profound So it is a famous West Coast entrepreneur rather than obscureMiddle American hicks to whom Simpson grants the chance to display a zealousambition born of delusory innocence This elusive father is no longer awanderer pursued by driven furies Hes the multimillionaire founder of abiotech company and the motherdaughter pair in pursuit of him are hippiedrifters who whimper for their chance at legitimacy and reliable love whereAdele and Ann howled and scratched            Tom Owensis the yearold handsome vegetarian jeanclad driving force behindGenesis a California enterprise that has become extremely successful extremelyquickly He has one friend a man who is an obvious foil Noah Kaskie is acripple working slowly in comparative obscurity trying to map a gene andworrying about money and love But otherwise Owens is surrounded mostly bywomen Chief among his many conquests is Olivia his current girlfriend abeauty who enthralls him by night in the ramshackle mansion hes never botheredto fix up and disappoints him by day in her modest desire for a career nogreater than that of a nurses aide            And then out of Owens offbeat past appear hisyearold daughter Jane and her mother Mary di Natali whom he once urgedto get an abortion and has since done his best to forget Theyve been livingtruly on the fringe in a succession of communes and finally alone in a tinycottage in the northern California woods though Mary has made sure never todrop completely from sight Each year she sends a photograph of Jane to Owenswho never acknowledges it As the novel begins shes preparing to send Jane byherself in their rusty truck having laboriously and implausibly taught thegirl to drive            Commenting on that nighttime drive over the mountains with the child perchedon a seat stacked with phone books Simpson writes The most terrible andwondrous experience in Jane di Natalis life was over by the time she was tenbefore shed truly mastered the art of riding a bicycle Thats not what youwant to hear on page  of a page novel in which Jane a central characterwill have many more experiences And its not as if Simpson has expended mucheffort on making the truck ride all that terrible or wondrous Simpson hereplays omniscient narrator for the first time and the poetic intensity and surerhythms that drove the monologues of her first novel and still echoed in hersecond are gone That vapid sentimentalizing declaration about Janes ride istypical of the flaccid style she now favors and what it says proves true Thenovel is all anticlimax            Simpson apparently meant to write an acerbic socialportrait of Americas postpostindustrial revolution and of the formercountercultural baby boomers who lead it But she cant summon up muchcuriosity about Owens who rarely rises above portentously ironic clichs Hewas an American industrialist we learn early on a believer in the potentialaccomplishments of state and in a way he couldnt explain proud So we knowhes riding for a fall professionally and personally just as we know thatNoahthe most prominent of the many characters whose roles in the book soonpeter outwill have a shot at the Nobel Genesis might as well be sayMicrosoftyou know no neckties brainy employees only the freshest fruitjuice in the machines Actually the model for Owens is pretty clearly SteveJobs who is Simpsons brother Its hard even to figure out what the companyproduces Simpson gives us an acronym for a medically useful protein LCSF andthats about it            Nor is itclear why exactly Owens gets ousted from power except that thats whathappens to overconfident egotists even or especially when they flaunt ademocratic granola style As for Owens fate with his various women itsimpossible to carebecause Simpson doesnt She indulges Owens the celebritygenius in endless narcissistic agonizing about who will be his wife and givesOwens the man no emotional substance His selfish vacuity is of course thepoint Still hes also supposed to have charisma and fascinatingidiosyncrasies He drives fast regularly runs out of gas forgetsappointments has lots of answering machines he ignores Simpsons idea ofbigshot oddity is not very odd But really as the title warns he comesacross as just a guy whos a jerk with chicks            Why do the women put up with him Since thesoul of this latest tycoon isnt interesting Simpson might have found a storyin the social insecurity of the women who are his hangerson and theirambivalence about ambition But the upwardmobility drama of Ann and Adele maybe a nearly impossible act to follow Jane and Mary dont even try Again thatseems to be the point Where Adele brought the fiercest most infantile needsto maternity Mary is the mother as mellow flower child Where the steak andcornfed Ann rushes down the road to rebellion Jane the wild child from thewoods becomes a conformist            Neither mother nor daughteris made distinctive this time around except in the most heavyhanded wayJane continues to eat her scabs even as shes being civilized Mary takes upwith a gentle birdsaving loser Meanwhile Olivia fits right into the role ofthe beautifulblondewhoisntreallyabimbo Jane and Marys dependence anddeference as they maneuver for Owens attention and money Owens domineeringresponse to his family Olivias defiance of Owens at the endall arepresumably meant to suggest with due irony that in America plus a               change   But that is not a very original moral and there arentnearly enough sharp findesicle observations to rejuvenate it It ishowever a motto that all too accurately applies to this novel itself
