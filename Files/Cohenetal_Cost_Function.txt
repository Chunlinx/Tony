countries areremarkably alike Each of the major functions delivery mailprocessing transportation and window service is conducted usingsimilar methods and technologies Therefore it may be possible fora fairly simple model to explain total and unit cost differencesbetween posts Ideally developing a cost model for the  plusindustrial posts would involve collecting data on many individualcost elements from each and using regression analysis to estimatethe coefficients of a cost function In todays environment this isimpossible because virtually all posts in industrial countriesconsider much of their operational cost data to be commerciallysensitive and will not share themIn our previous paper Cohen et al  we developed amodel that related unit costs to volume per capita The model isbased on US costs More specifically it is based on the accruedcost of the major functions and their cost elasticities withrespect to volume A plot of that cost function reveals the classichyperbolic shape with unit costs increasing more rapidly as volumeper capita declines because of the loss of economies of scale SeeFigure In our previous paper we made adjustments to the model to allowfor comparison with Poste Italiane In particular adjustments weremade for differences in labor cost amount of worksharing and mixof mail by shape In this paper we add an adjustment for countercosts The resulting model estimate of Poste Italianes unit costis  cents versus the actual value of  cents It must be pointedout that the cost model is used to estimate costs over an extremerange of volume US volume per capita in  was  pieceswhile Italys was  pieces per capita Given this range theauthors are encouraged by the relatively small deviation of theestimate from actualSee the Appendix to Cohen et al The USPS has only  counters per  population whilePoste Italiane has  counters per  populationFigure  Model Estimates of Unit CostBenchmarked by US Costs and VolumesCost per Piece US         Pieces per CapitaIn this paper we examine the hypothesis that the cost modelprovides reasonable estimates of the unit costs of other posts ofindustrialized countries The hypothesis cannot however bedirectly confirmed because we do not have sufficient cost data onother countries to compare with the model resultsWe provide indirect confirming evidence of the hypothesis usingthe fact that the model implies that mail processing and deliverycosts will comprise specific percentages of total costs at specificper capita volume levels We have obtained the actual percentagesof mail processing costs and delivery costs relative to total costsfor seven posts with which we compare the predicted percentagesAlthough the evidence is not conclusive it confirms thehypothesisWe first present our model for total costs and unit costs Wenext present the test of our hypothesis by comparing the predictedpercentages for each of the seven posts with the actualpercentages We then produce a trend line through the data pointsand compare it with the model results Finally we compare actualunit revenues and some derived unit costs for the seven postswith the models prediction of unit costsThe editors of the book in which our previous paper Cohen etal  appears suggested that we examine the hypothesis thatthe cost model accurately describes the costs of other posts THE COST MODELThe model is the same as that used by Cohen et al except that we now present it as a generalized cost function Themodel assumes that there are two primary determinants of cost for apostal system volume and size of the network For each activity apost performs there are volumedriven attributable costs andnetworkdriven institutional costsTo create a total cost function we use FY  US PostalService data to define the relationship between costs and costdrivers Costs for each postal activity mail processing deliveryetc that can be attributed to mail volumes are divided by totalvolume to obtain an estimate of the marginal cost The remainingcosts are institutional costs that are primarily driven by the sizeof the network Population is a reasonable proxy for the size ofthe network and therefore institutional costs are divided by theUS population to obtain the additional cost per person Thisproduces annual cost functions for each of the major postalactivities and a total cost functionSince all costs are variable in the long run it is reasonablethat nondelivery institutional costs would decline over the largevolume range we explore with this model For purposes of thisanalysis we assume that  percent of nondelivery institutionalcosts would be volume variableNo portion of delivery institutional costs is considered to bevolume variable however because route structure generally doesnot change as volume drops As long as coverage is relatively highcarriers will have to cover their entire route Thus fixeddelivery costs would not be expected to drop until volume percapita were so low that the resulting very low coverage allowedcarriers to skip parts of their routesAttributable costs using the PRC cost treatment are greater thanvolume variable costs Consequently the estimate is slightlyhigher than the true marginal costThe results are not very sensitive to this assumption as can beseen in Cohen et al The cost function in US dollars isVariable InstitutionalMail Processing  V  P Delivery  V  PTransportation  V  P Window Service  V  PAll Other costs  V  P Total costs  V  Pwhere V  Volume and P  PopulationIt can be seen that the total cost of providing postal servicein the US for FY  was  cents per piece plus  perperson The total cost for other countries can be estimated bysubstituting volume and population into the above formulaThe total cost function can be used to estimate average unitcost by dividing the terms by VAverage Unit Cost     P  V This can be restatedin terms of V  P or pieces per capita ppc asAverage Unit Cost      ppcThe percent of total cost for each function included in themodel and cost elasticity with respect to volume are shown inTable The model assumes constant unit variable costs Thus whenvolume is reduced total variable cost is reduced by the samepercentage At lower per capita volumes the ratio of fixed tovariable cost increases and the cost elasticities decrease becausea greater proportion of total costs is fixed Similarly the modelassumes a constant coefficient for populationTable  FY  USPS Percent of Total Cost and Elasticity withrespect to Volume of the MajoraSource Postal Rate Commission Docket RbIncludes both in and out of office activitiescDoes not include intra city transportation costsThe US cost elasticities in Table  when applied to theaccrued costs of each function determine the coefficients in thecost function which in turn generate the unique shape of the unitcost function Figure  Further these coefficients determine thepercent of total cost that comes from mail processing and deliveryat a specific volume per capitaThe total cost for an individual country can be expressed as afunction of pieces per capita by rewriting the above basic totalcost equation asTotal Cost for country i   PiVPi   Piwhere Pi  population for country iPi  slopePi  intercept The values of the slope rate of increasein total costs and intercept institutional costs are directlyrelated to the population of the country If country A has twice asmany inhabitants as country B then the slope and intercept of Ascost function will be twice as large as the slope and intercept ofBs cost functionFigure  displays the total cost curves as functions of piecesper capita for each of the countries in the sample The differencesin slopes and intercepts reflect population differences If totalvolume instead of pieces per capita were displayed on thevertical axis then the Yintercepts would remain unchanged but thecost curves would be parallel Although Figure  shows a family oftotal costs curves Figure  displays a single unit cost curvebecause the unit cost curve depends on only one variable piecesper capitaFigure  Total Cost Functions for Sampled PostsNot Adjusted for Structural Differences      Pieces per Capita ADJUSTMENTSTo estimate the cost of a post using the model it is necessaryto take into account labor cost differences between the US PostalService and the given post The test of our hypothesis howeverdoes not involve predicting unit costs of other posts It involvespredicting the percentage of total cost devoted to mail processingand delivery Thus labor costs do not need to be adjustedThe total percentage of mail processing costs would have to beadjusted if worksharing automation or mail mix had significantlydifferent impacts on mail processing costs We have adjusted mailprocessing costs for La Poste and Posti Finland Both France andFinland include the costs of cancellation and mail preparation incounter costs Because the US Postal Service classifies thesecosts as part of mail processing we adjust the percentages of mailprocessing costs upward for France and Finland to reflect a similartreatment This has no effect on total costs and therefore onlyaffects the mail processing percentageThe number of deliveries per week varies among the posts in thesample Canada Finland and Portugal deliver five times per weekGreat Britain delivers  times weekly in urban areas and six inrural areas Consequently it is necessary to adjust the percentageof delivery costs for these posts to the level it would be with sixdeliveries per week as in the US When the percentage ofdelivery cost is increased or decreased for a given post thepercentage of mail processing cost is decreased or increasedaccordinglyCONFIRMING THE HYPOTHESISDataCanada Post Consignia Royal Mail Posti Finland and La Postesupplied the percentages of delivery and mail processing costs tous The authors supplied the data for CTT Correios de Portugal andPoste Italiane Only La Poste delivers unaddressed mail separatelyfrom normal mail Consequently the volumes and percentages oftotal cost for La Poste do not include unaddressed mailUnaddressed mail is included in the calculations for otherpostsThe cost percentages reflect labor and non labor costs exceptfor Germany The Deutsche Post percentages are derived fromworkforce full time equivalents contained in its annual report forFY  and an internal Post Italiane study on German deliveryoperations developed in part from meetings with Deutsche Postmanagement The Deutsche Post annual report provides the totalnumber of full time equivalents involved in postal operations andthe Poste Italiane document provides the number involved indelivery operations While this is a proxy for labor and non laborcosts it is considered realistic since in the US the use ofworkforce full time equivalents provide estimates within a fewpercentage points of those calculated with labor and non laborcostsThe population density or more specifically the postal density the average time it takes to travel between addresses of acountry has an impact on street delivery costs Ideally we couldadjust for this if data were available See Bernard et al Empirical FindingsEmpirical findings from the investigation are presented inFigure  The top line represents delivery cost percentage oftotal cost as a function of pieces per capita as predicted by ourcost model The bottom line represents the same for mail processingcostsFigure  Functional Percentage of Total CostsBenchmarked by US Costs and VolumesPercentage of Total Costs         Pieces per CapitaWith the exception of the lowest volume post Poste Italianethe models predicted percentages are close to the actualpercentages for delivery We think Poste Italiane a very lowvolume post may have a somewhat lower percentage of delivery coststhan predicted owing to low coverage on very low volume routesespecially in rural areas When carriers deliver to only a smallnumber of stops on a route they tend to cover the route in a waymore similar to a traveling salesman than following a fixed routepast every stop Thus there may be less fixed costs on theseroutes than indicated by the elasticities embedded in the costmodel based on US costs which reflect very high coverage levelsIf this conjecture is correct then Italys delivery percentagescould be adjusted upwards by an unknown amount towards thepredicted value and their mail processing costs would then have tobe adjusted downwards A downward adjustment would also improveItalys relation to the mail processing prediction but movePortugal further away Some of the deviation for Italy and Portugalmay be due to the fact that they have proportionally much largerretail operations involving collection and acceptance than the USand other posts For example Portugals retail post officeoperations account for  percent of total costs while in theUS they account for approximately six percent Poste Italianealso has a relatively large percentage of costs in collection andacceptance  percent Nevertheless the authors cannot explainwhy Portugals percentage of mail processing cost is so low incomparison to the other posts in the sampleA significant virtue of these curves is that they areindependent of the price of labor Thus by using this evaluationtechnique we are able to avoid the need for obtaining productivehourly costs translated into dollars using purchasing powerparitiesIt appears that other factors for which adjustments are notmade do not cause significant differences This could be becausethese factors do not vary significantly from the US do not drivecosts significantly or tend to cancel each other out Trend AnalysisThe bold lines in Figure  display trend curves for the actualprocessing and delivery cost percentages from the test countriesThese curves were generated using Excel They have virtually thesame shape as the curves predicted by the model and further confirmthe fit between the model and the data The low delivery costpercentage of the low volume per capita country Italy pulls thedelivery trend line down away from the predicted line The factthat the actual mail processing percentages for Italy and Portugalare about equidistant below and above the predicted values causesthe mail processing trend line to match the model line at lowvolumes despite relatively large errors These disparities at lowvolumes between the trend and model lines reinforce our belief thatthe model is less useful in predicting costs for low per capitavolume posts than it is for medium to high volume per capita postsIt is to be expected that the accuracy of predictions will diminishas the range over which the predictions are made increasesThese trend lines were selected because they best fit the

forproductive hourly wage in purchasing power parities PPP Data forthese adjustments were not available except for Italy TheUS values used in making adjustments for Poste Italiane dataare listed in the appendix In the absence of actual cost data wecompare model cost results to actual revenuesFor the posts in our sample we have used the model to estimateunit costs and adjusted only for deliveries

stated in the introductionwhen we adjust for Italian labor costs worksharing mail mix andnumber of counters we get a modeled unit cost of  cents CONCLUSIONSThe principal conclusion is that empirical evidence corroboratesthe validity of this model because the predicted functionalpercentages of costs are reasonably close to actual values SeeFigure  In particular the general shape of the unit cost curvewith respect to per capita volume appears to be valid for theposts of industrialized countries sampled See Figure  The modelhowever is a more accurate predictor of the cost behavior ofmedium to large per capita volume posts than for small per capitavolume posts The model also demonstrates that both volume andpopulation are important explanatory factors of postal costsClearly additional research is warranted Regulators andoperators in any industrialized country are encouraged to use thedata in the appendix on US cost characteristics to makeadjustments to the model and determine if the model forecasts costswith reasonable accuracy Of course we would not expect exactcorrespondence even after adjustments are made owing to differencesin efficiency and service qualityAppendix FY
