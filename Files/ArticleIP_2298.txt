                                 Dear Microsoft            ToMicrosoft Top Management            FromJacobwe            ReUnsolicited Advice            I am oneof the journalists who has embarked on the experiment of working for a softwarecompany I probably speak for all of us when I say that it has beeninteresting Recently its been especially interesting A few months agoeveryone I met seemed to think that working for Microsoft was a pretty coolthing to do Now strangers treat us like we work for Philip Morris Thecompanys current legal and publicrelations headaches leave me personally inan awkward position Ive devoted a good chunk of my career as a politicaljournalist to criticizing the mercenary culture of Washington influencepeddlers PACs and so on Suddenly I find myself working for a company withbig political problems My bluff has been called With my own prosperitypossibly at stake would I urge my employer to remain aloof from the Beltwaybazaar            No one else seems to share my disquiet Ironically one ofthe charges leveled against Microsoft of late is that the company has sinned bynot playing the Washington influence game forcefully enough Only nowthe analysis goes is Bill G realizing his mistake in neglecting to hirelobbyists dole out huge campaign contributions and so on The theme of arecent frontpage story in the New York Times was that the failure toflex political muscle demonstrates an arrogance and stubbornness for whichMicrosoft is now paying the price            The chargeof lacking respect for Washington blurs the issues It confuses  the validobservation that Microsoft often has a haughty attitude in general  the atleast arguable contention that it has run afoul of antitrust law  theplausible suggestion that hiring more lobbyists etc would be a smart thingto do and  the entirely absurd notion that refusing to pay tribute insidethe Beltway amounts to some kind of ethical failing Sit out the Washingtonlegalizedbribery game Why thats downright unAmerican            As you know its a bit of a myth thatMicrosoft is only now noticing the other Washington Since the JusticeDepartment filed suit Oct  the governmentrelations department has hired nonew lobbyists inhouse or on contract The old roster is intact It includessuch hired guns as Grover Norquist Jr an adviser to the speaker of the Houseand former Reps Vin Weber RMinn and Thomas Downey DNY who happens tobe one of Al Gores closest friends Norquist and Downey have worked forMicrosoft for some time as have Michael Deaver and his colleagues at EdelmanWorldwide who do PR Microsofts DC office with three fulltime lobbyistshas been in operation since early  Before that the company had the helpof lawyers in the Washington office of Preston Gates Ellis  RouvelasMeedsas it still does This team has lobbied Congress and the executivebranch on all the issues that matter to Microsoft Internet freedom encryptionpolicy immigration for hightech workers the taxdeductibility of stockoptions extending the R  D tax credit software piracy abroad taxationof Internet commerce and so on            At thesame time Im sure you will agree that Microsoft is somewhat diffident aboutplaying politics ATT has  fulltime representatives in Washington toMicrosofts three ATT donated  million in PAC contributions to bothparties in the last election cycle Microsoft gave  I cant say whetheryou have kept your political profile low for the right reasonmaybe you werejust cheap or lazy or out of your depth on the other coast But whatever thecause I would argue that your relative passivity in Washington is something tobe proud of You havent tried to corrupt the democratic process by handing outwads of cash You have done less than any company approaching your size tounderwrite the sleazy business of influence peddling Because Microsoft isntlooking for favors from the federal government it resists paying a fee toselfappointed middlemen The company gets no credit for this stance MotherJones has a piece in its new issue blasting Microsoft for politicking inWashington which gives you the distinction of being attacked both for lobbyingand not lobbying in the same month            The practical issue is much harder than the ethical oneSure the world would be a better place if there was no corporate money inpolitics and no hiredgun lobbyists as it would if there were no land minesor nuclear weapons But can one big company disarm unilaterally Even CharlesLewis of the Center for Public Integritythe least compromising critic of therevolving doorwas quoted in the New York Times suggesting thatMicrosoft has to do what everyone else does Other stories have pointed outthat competitors are hauling out the big guns Netscape recently signed amongothers Bob Dole who couldnt even give his own Internet address correctly onnational television and Greg Simon Gores former domesticpolicy adviserMicrosofts competitors see Washington as their salvation How can you fail tomount a defense            I cant ingood conscience argue that you shouldnt field a team Modern legislation andregulation are technical and complex Any big company needs skilled people whocan process the implications of proposed changes and argue for its interests Iregretfully acknowledge that it may even make practical sense to have a fewhired guns like Norquist Downey and Weber aroundpeople of value only fortheir connections to power not for any knowledge or talent            Dont get me wrongI think that what thesepeople do for a living is slimy Theyre not all equally bad but I havetrouble deciding who is worse Is it the rightwing commissar Norquist whodefied subpoenas from the Thompson Committee about his role laundering campaigncontributions for the Republican National Committee he is contemptuousof the law Or is it Downey a former reformer from the postWatergate Classof  who wants everyone to think of him as a Boy Scout even as he sells hisconnections to anyone who can pay his fee            Anotherquandary Is it worse for lobbyists to exploit their personal relationshipswith government officials or to sell the illusion that they are doing soAfter years of covering lobbying my impression is that the business is about percent con You never know for sure what youre getting whichunfortunately is an argument for ponying up The company has billiondollarissues at stake At  a year for Norquist and  a year forDowney its a cheap lottery ticket And odd as it sounds hiring influencepeddlers generates good will on Capitol Hill In Congress where people thinkof themselves as underpaid theres hostility toward Bill Gates based on thefact that hes got a lot of dough and doesnt share it with people like themRepublican staffers in particular see Microsoft as a Democraticinclinedcompany that is never going to hire them when theyre ready to go through therevolving door This is a pretty venal outlook but its built into theWashington operating system the way say Internet Explorer is said to beintegrated into Windows Many people think Microsoft can easily separateWindows and IE if it wants to but nobody would claim that Microsoft cansinglehandedly recreate the culture of Washington            There are however advantages to not being heavy hittersinside the Beltway Refusing to pay an unjustified toll may be contemptuous ofWashington but its respectful of democracy In a way I think it has alreadyhelped Microsofts image Youve been slammed for not throwing your weightaround in DC but would certainly be criticized much more if you did throw itaround Microsoft has been defensive about its lowkey Washington role when itcould legitimately be boasting about it            Of course its hard to bragabout your reluctance to hire Washington sleazeballs when you have MichaelDeaver on your payroll Deaver isnt just an ordinary convicted felon He wason the cover of Time making a phone call from his limousineas thesymbol of the influencepeddling excesses of the s Im sure he experienceda great deal of personal growth during his community service but hes not theguy to organize a PR blitz around the theme of restraint in playing theWashington game
