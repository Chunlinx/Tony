                                 Poor Us            Economist Juliet Schor isamong a handful of academics to have achieved the widely held and rarelyadmitted to dream of the professoriate reaching a popular audience with workthat also passes muster technically Success as a pop academic requiresoperating on two levelsthat is making distinctly different arguments for popreaders and academic readers Schors pop argument is We spend too much onstuff we dont need Her academic argument is For complicated sociologicalreasons which Ill explain in a minute American spending patterns havechanged in ways we need to take notice of            Usuallyin the popacademic genre the pop side will be interesting and the academicside dutiful and obscure In the case of The Overspent American  thereverse is the case            Intellectuals have never warmed to American consumerculture Bashing it is a tradition that begins with the advent of a nationalconsumer market in the early decades of the  th century rereadBabbitt if you dont believe me The idea that a country founded uponhighflown principles has come to care more about fame money and accumulatingstuff than about the principles has long been galling to those who hold theprinciples dear So when Schor scoldingly writes for example In  aloneAmericans spent  billion on residential lawn care much of itenvironmentally destructive it doesnt feel like a fresh thought Even if youaccept that lawns and cars and credit card debt and designer logos arepernicious to attack them seems as a writing project a little easy The mainpoint of Schors previous book The Overworked American which can beadduced from the title was less familiar than her main point here            ButSchors sociological theory is fascinating It involves a change in mostconsumers reference groups A reference group the term was invented in by a psychologist named Herbert Hyman is the set of people with whom youcompare yourself in order to appraise how youre doing Your level ofaspiration and contentment varies not according to some absolute standard butaccording to your choice of reference group Change your reference group andyoull find that youre suddenly feeling much better or worse about yoursituation            The reference group is one of the most widelyused concepts in social science and also in market research The first personto apply it to the field of consumer spending was James Duesenberry theHarvard economist who wrote a book in  arguing that for most people thereference group is made up of neighbors Hence keeping up with theJoneseswe buy whatever it takes to have what our neighbors have            Schorbelieves that for most consumers neighbors have been replaced as the primaryreference group by a much broader and betteroff panoply of coworkersacquaintances and characters presented by the media Primetime television isfull of supposedly ordinary typical families who live in fancier circumstancesthan anyone at the median income could afford The entry of mothers into thework force has exposed them to people across a much wider income range thanobtains in the neighborhood In a survey Schor conducted at a big corporationsounds as if it is Southwestern Bell although in keeping with academicconvention she doesnt give its real name only  percent of the peopleresponding said neighbors were their primary reference group            Switching reference groups has pushed Americans spendinghabits hugely upward Schor has come up with the slightly wacky statistic thateach hour of television a person watches per week will generate  a year inspending Between  and  she says the average persons spendingadjusted for inflation increased between  percent and  percent            The ideathat the referencegroup calculations that underlie consumption habits havechanged makes sense If this is a problem then what do we do about it Schorstheory leads inescapably to one answer Find another reference group for theaverage consumer            So far so good But then we come to thereference group Schor proposes as an alternative Schor calls themdownshifters people who have scaled back the desperate workandspend cycleand are much happier as a result She claims somewhat implausibly that percent of Americans not counting retirees voluntarily downshifted between and  In the chapter she devotes to anecdotal portraiture ofdownshifters though they dont come across as being very appealing One waslaid off Another is living on unemployment insurance Another found herselfperilously close to the rock bottom Another is trusting that somehow it isgoing to work Is this the reference group that launched a thousand ships            Schorcelebrates downshifterspeople defined by not spendingbecause she viewsconsumerism as evil To her way of thinking no nonessential spending no desireto possess things can ever be innocent or morally neutral Instead all tasteall aesthetic judgment all pleasure taken in things must be a matter of whateconomists call positionality It is merely a way of signaling status evenif weve deluded ourselves into thinking its not There isnt much room inSchors schema for even the interesting curlicues of spending culture such asthe joy in finding a bargain or personal variances in taste eg uptown vsdowntownlet alone the idea that a possession could bring its buyer simplepleasure If to use two of Schors examples you dont want to put aluminumsiding on your house or garb yourself in polyester the only possible reason isthat you dont want people to think youre a Bubba            Schors rightit is depressing when people get into thegrip of an allengulfing need to establish their identity by buying stuffespecially if its stuff they cant afford It is also the case thatnewspapers magazines radio and television are so financially dependent onconsumer advertising that theyre unlikely to lead the charge against thisproblem            Still thesolution Schor proposes seems almost as forced and obsessive as overspendingitself Why cant buying things be a pleasurable sideshow to the main events oflife Why does it have to screw everything else up            Let me propose another reference group that theculturati might glorify in the perhaps vain hope of curbing spendingmaniahappily functioning people Membership in this group would be defined in apossessionneutral way A person would belong by virtue of doing something sheloved and believed in and by being enmeshed in a web of community family andfriends A selfappraisal and remember the entire purpose of a referencegroup is to serve as a yardstick for selfappraisal would entail evaluatingthe richness of relationships and the satisfactions of accomplishments ratherthan the cataloging of possessions Buying a new tie would be fun not anobsessive central tailwaggingthedogoflife activity If you can affordit great If not no big deal            It would also have been niceto see Schor wrestle with the contradiction between her point and the Keynesiantradition of treating higher incomes and more spending as the royal road to thegood society Ever since the s American liberal economists have celebratedconsumerismnot because they find it culturally attractive but because itoffers the promise of marrying the cherished liberal goal of incomeredistribution to overall economic prosperity Put money in ordinary peoplespockets and as they spend it the assembly lines will hum and unemployment willfall            This is the economic schoolto which Schor belongs She has a brief epilogue in which she admits that heranticonsumerism conflicts with it but does it in a way that demonstrates thatshe hasnt resolved the problem I have always believed there is great meritin the Keynesian view she says stiffly and then goes on to admit thatdownshifting might cause a slowdown in productivity growthwhich from aneconomists point of view is pretty close to the ultimate horror A great bookon her subject rather than a good one might have found a way to propose aneconomic ideal that would not lead as inexorably into a social nightmare asSchors seems to
