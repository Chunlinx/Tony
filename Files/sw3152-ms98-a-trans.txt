of his music and and what not plus my parents are well especially my dad likes a lot of classical music and he introduced my brother and i both to a lot of it so   oh gosh Chris Xeros  you grew up with his children too then     yeah   oh gosh   yeah sure did   gosh small world huh   yeah we all went to high school together and were still in contact with each other we all go back to parents houses on the weekends and what not so   oh oh gosh well actually i used to play in the Richardson Symphony i played violin in the orchestra for several years   oh really   you know yeah so   it is a small world isnt it   yeah small world so i you know i know Chris   yeah he a pretty nice guy     most of the time   yeah  well i never i had to work for him and i never would want to work for him so   no no well life just took different turns here so uh it just  doesnt work out to do that now so hes hes about ready to retire another year and he   yeah yeah he sure is he just became a grandfather   yeah i heard that its its daughter its his daughter that   uh uhhuh yeah they just had the babys christening so   oh   it was really nice so   was it a boy or a girl   hes a little boy   yeah what did they name him   i cant it its a oh gosh its like Elijah or something like that   oh   i keep forgetting what what she named him   oh   his middle name is Chris or Christopher for for her daddy but i think its Elijah   of course oh yeah yeah   it starts with an E i cant remember     oh so youve heard the Richardson Symphony yeah   yes yeah weve heard them and liked liked it real well of course   yeah   do you have a favorite instrument   um actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord   yes   i really like those in fact i had a harpsichord played at my wedding   oh did you   yeah   oh   which was real nice i got married uh during the Christmas season and we we played uh old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not and it was real nice i liked that a lot   oh   i liked the sound of the harpsichord   and it played by itself   no somebody played it   well i mean but you didnt have oboe or something with it   no no no no no just by itself just by itself   oh yeah oh well thats really yeah thats i bet that was nice   it was real nice yeah it went well it was a change you know from your traditional normal normal normal you know stuff and since it was Christmas time and and uh we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and you know stuff like that and   oh   so we did the harpsichord with old time traditional Christmas carols not not you know the bouncy you know sing along kind but   right right   some of the old older ones that some i dont even i recognize the the melodies and whatnot but i didnt recognize the names   right right   so it was real nice   well actually i play i play the violin in in a string quartet that often plays at weddings   um   so um i always think its a nice break from the traditional organ or piano   uhhuh   and it makes it makes it nice it makes you know you can say classy or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else   it does it really really does and it it has such a different sound to it anyway its almost i dont know the way it vibrates its kind of haunting you know on on some of the notes it its id i like it   oh   i dont know how else to explain but weve got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas theyre uh called Odessa its a husband and wife team that weve known for years and we try to make contact with them periodically to see whats going on and stuff too so weve had a lot of stuff you know friends and and things to do with music that constant and plus my husbands real big into music too so he doesnt play anything but   yeah   he just likes to listen and my dad and my kids are now well my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast and   oh now does does the school in in your in your city does it does it offer like band or some of the instruments   yeah well my my oldest is only nine so he he hasnt really gotten into um that yet they have choir that they go to you know music class that they go to but um   okay right   hes not old enough yet to get into the band yet   right uh right   so i think that starts in sixth grade   probably oh gosh   so but i dont know he he shows he the only thing hes really shown interest in wanting to play is the drums cause his my my brother plays and um i i dont i dont know if hes really serious about it yet or not you know its just one of those things im just going to wait and see if hes interested in something you know   yeah right right you got a little ways to go too  right   yeah just a little bit   great wow well my my oldest is eight and and shes weve started her on piano so uh   uh   but thats been its been fun i mean its a lot of work to see that shes  prepared but its been fun its its been fun i feel like ive learned a lot about the piano ive learned a lot about playing the piano   really   and uh it kind of makes me listen a little closer to to the piano when i hear it at other places or when i you know see some see and hear someone playing i sort of watch their technique too and and see if it corresponds up to what shes learning   yeah   so its been fun so   i dont know if any of mine will be interested in it or
