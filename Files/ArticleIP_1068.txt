                                 The Palestinian Authority            When two Palestinian suicidebombers killed  Jews in a Jerusalem market last week Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu blamed the president of the Palestinian Authority YasserArafat Netanyahu condemned Arafat as irresponsibly soft on terrorism withheldmillions of dollars Israel owed to Arafats government and ordered theblockading of the IsraeliPalestinian border The Israeli sanctions came thesame week that  of Arafats ministers tendered their resignations What isthe PA Why does everybody agree that it is in crisis What is the future ofthe peace talks that established the PA            The PAwas born out of the  Oslo Declaration of Principles  Israel promisedthe Palestine Liberation Organizationthe selfstyled Palestiniangovernmentinexilethat it would withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Stripterritories captured from Jordan and Egypt respectively in the  Six DayWar The Oslo accord also established a timetable for negotiations that wouldlead to Israels departure from the territories First on that timetable was aplan for Israel to leave Gaza City and Jericho the cities with the largestPalestinian populations then other major population centers then theremainder of the two territories Under the plan an interim governmentorganized by the PLO was established to assume control of internal security andcivil administrationeducation garbage collection etc The Oslo accordpredicated progress on the PLO holding democratic elections  May  isthe deadline for an agreement over Jerusalem a city that both parties claim astheir capital and which neither wants to share May  is also the deadlinefor negotiations over full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and WestBank as well as for what is ambiguously called the final status of securityand border arrangements            The first two stages of the withdrawal were completedbefore negotiations stalled in March after Israel broke ground for ahousing project in Arab East Jerusalem The PA controls the security and civilgovernment of nine cities in which about  percent of the  million Arabsin the West Bank and Gaza Strip live The PA has no jurisdiction over the morethan  Jewish settlers living throughout the two territories Theirfuture will probably be decided by the final status negotiations                           YasserArafats cult of personality guaranteed that nobody would challenge hisinitial unelected rule of the PA Following the Arab defeat in the  war acoalition of disparate guerrilla groups labor unions and political partiesgradually coalesced into a single opposition organization the PLO A trainedengineer and longtime guerrilla Arafat came to fame when he led a band ofPalestinians to victory over the Israeli army in a minor battle at alKaramahin  He rose to the helm of the organization later that year In  thePLO renounced its support of terrorism causing the Arab League a council ofthe governments of  Arabicspeaking countries to deem it the officialrepresentative of the Palestinians            In his selfimposed exile in Tunisia Arafatwas joined by thousands of Palestinians When he returned to Gaza and the WestBank in  these Tunisians received the most important appointmentswithin the new bureaucracy Wealthy enough to have had the means to flee Israelin  they began building villas and buying fancy cars upon their returnprovoking resentment among the thousands of Palestinians who have lived fordecades in UNrun refugee camps            Recentstudies corroborate widespread suspicions of PA corruption  In Marchthe PAs comptroller concluded that millions of PA dollars had been siphonedoff for private use by officials Several ministers have been blamed foregregious abuses leading the Palestinian Parliament to call for theresignation of the entire Cabinet Last week all but two ministers agreed tostep down though many say it is unlikely they will ever actually do soArafat notorious for his scruffiness has a reputation for eschewing wealthand he has not been accused of personal wrongdoing However his undemocraticattitude and predilection for political patronage are seen by many Palestiniansas the ultimate root of the malfeasance                           Oslo makes Arafat dependent on IsraelHe has much to gain from the peace process more power and land for hisgovernment for one Also under the accords Israel annually gives the PAnearly  million in taxes collected from Palestinians who work and buy goodsin Israel This is the money that Israel withheld last week and it accountsfor more than twothirds of the PAs budget The balance of the budget comes inthe form of donations from foreign governments Netanyahus government also issupporting several major publicworks projects in PA territory including theconstruction of an airport and seaport in Gaza These projects are crucial toan independent Palestinian economy Currently more than  Palestinianscommute daily to jobs in Israel            TheIsraelis intend to withhold funds in the hopes that the PA will crack down onthe Islamic militant terrorists Specifically the Israelis want Arafat toshut down Hamas  Arafats most powerful domestic opponent which ispurportedly responsible for the suicide bombing Hamas has a strongorganization It controls mosques schools and a political party all of whichpredate the organization of its terrorist arm in the late s MostPalestinians reject Islamic fundamentalism According to polls only about percent of Palestinians support Hamas but they and Arafat alike avoidcriticizing the groups political leaders as doing so would be consideredkowtowing to the Jews            Conditions are ripe for discontent ThePalestinian economy has deteriorated during the PAs reign Unemployment inthe West Bank and Gaza is at  percent up from  percent when Arafat tookover Palestinian per capita income has fallen to  per year onetenth ofIsraels These economic casualties are Arafats most vocal critics Theysupport the argument that the peace process is a failed experiment that shouldbe scrapped                           YetArafat remains popular he won  percent of the vote in last yearspresidential elections and recent polls estimate his publicapproval ratingsat about  percent He quashes opponents with brutal force arresting Islamicmilitants and leftwing secularists who oppose him and shuttering newspapersand television stations when they criticize him Humanrights organizationsroundly criticize the PA citing the  prisoners who have been tortured todeath in the last three years while in police custody            The Palestinian Authoritys massive securityapparatus more than  strongappears to be somewhat out of Arafatscontrol PA security has resisted Israeli demands that it take action againstHamas and refused on occasion to cooperate with the Israeli Defense ForcesWhen Israel began constructing apartment buildings in Arab East Jerusalem lastMarch PA security stopped relaying intelligence about the operations of Hamasterrorist wing This breakdown of PAIsraeli cooperation is the basis for theIsraeli complaint that Arafat is culpable for last weeks Jerusalem bombingLast week Israel also ordered the PA to arrest one of its highranking policeofficers for planning an attack on a Jewish settlement            Last year Arafat crackeddown on Hamas after a string of bombings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem arrestingmore than  suspected terrorists destroying Hamas safe houses andconfiscating its weapons caches Arafat is reluctant to reprise that policeaction observers say because he believes that the threat of terrorismis the only way to force Netanyahu to restart the peace talks MeanwhileIsraeli closure of the PAs borders further punishes the Palestinian economyAnd Israel has threatened to send troops into PAcontrolled cities and crackdown on Hamas itself Arafats aides say this would be akin to an act ofwar
