                            Gatzs statement At least half of the explanation for individual differences in        susceptibility to Alzheimer disease is genetic  is in my opinion incorrect As the        one who led the team debating Ashford and Mortimer whose  article  supports this        statement at the  conference on Alzheimer disease AD in Cincinnati Challenging        Views of Alzheimers Disease  I think that the evidence that dietary and lifestyle        factors explain the majority of the individual risk for AD in the US is very strong My        original paper in   found that total dietary fat and energy intake were the most        important dietary risk factors while fish and cereal intake were the most important risk        reduction factors These findings have been generally confirmed by Drs Luchsinger and        Morris and others The reason I did my study was that the Honolulu Heart Study reported        that Japanese American men in Hawaii had  times the risk of AD of native Japanese        AfricanAmericans have about four times the risk of AD of native Nigerians If genetics        were the primary risk factor those living in the US would have a risk of developing AD        very similar to that of individuals living in their ancestral home The reason this is not        the case is that the American diet provides too much food which is a particular problem        for those genetically predisposed to AD
