                                 Welfare Scare            You have a reasonably softheart You wouldnt feel comfortable seeing little kids begging in the streetsor stepping over the bodies of old folks gasping in the gutters Maybe you readthe Atlantic Monthly article by Peter Edelman a formerClintonadministration official who called the welfarereform law signed lastfall by his former boss terrible legislation Edelman says the result will bemore malnutrition and more crime increased infant mortality and increaseddrug and alcohol abuse You dont defend the previous welfare systemwhocouldbut you wonder Are the scaremongers right            Howworried should you be Heres a quick review of what isand isntlikely tobe truly troublesome as the great welfarereform experiment begins                            States that are too kind Somefolks worries are the opposite of Edelmans They fear that the welfare systemwont change enough            The new welfare law abolishesthe current federal welfareentitlement program Aid to Families With DependentChildren and replaces it with block grants to the states States have tocreate replacement programs that set limits five years on how long most fourout of five families can get welfare and ensure that half the families stillon the rolls in  have at least one part or fulltime working memberStates also have to contribute  percent of the money that they used to spendon AFDC to the new Temporary Assistance to Needy Families TANF programthesocalled Maintenance of Effort MOE requirement            Beyondthat and a bunch of other eyeglazing rules and exceptions to exceptions thatwill keep federal regulation writers off the dole states are basically freeto offer whatever combination of cash and services they think is best            So what are states likely to do One optionisnothing much If a state really wants to maintain the status quo it canprobably get away with it Welfare law has long been loaded with requirementsthat states must cut fraud on the rolls move recipients into jobs providenecessary service blah blah blah The requirements go unmet The governormakes a few calls to the White House or Capitol Hill Eyes are averted            Moreover the new law forall its seeming toughness allows states plenty of leeway if they want to begenerous And welfare consultants are already showing the way States are freefor example to redirect the money that they used to spend on matching federalAFDC grants about  percent of the total to provide help for families whohave lost their temporary assistance coverage The new law also provides anincentive for states to use their own money to continue grants to families thatexhaust their fiveyear eligibility            Not solong ago states like New York Massachusetts and California might havebrazened it out But times have changed Most states have already toughenedtheir welfare programs under waivers granted under the old prereform rulesSome of these waivers are for more generous programs but others are just astough as the new law                            States that are too mean So how nasty might statesget Some were pretty mean already People tend to forget that under the oldrules states got to set the key parameterthe benefit level AFDC paymentsranged from  percent of the official poverty line in Mississippi to about percent in New Yorks Suffolk County This doesnt count food stampsMedicaid the Earned Income Tax Credit and federal aid for housing homeheating child care and so forth which will still be available At least intheory Mississippi now could replace even its small cash contribution with theproverbial bus ticket North Not likely perhaps but worth watching outfor                            A shortage of money Under the old rules the federalgovernment would match the money states spent according to a formula that tookaccount of state need and benefit levels The new rules cap federal welfarepayments at the  level with some allowances for rising unemployment andother contingencies For now thats a windfall for all but a couple of statessince welfare caseloads have dropped by almost  percent nationally since But what if times get tough and caps start to pinch Well the Food Stampprogram has long been cappedsupposedlyyet Congress has never failed toprovide extra funds when governors needed them                            A lack of suitable jobs Welfare advocates arealready complaining that recipients will be pushed into deadend jobs Butsuccessful jobprogram operators have learned a key lesson since the last timewe had this argument back in Jimmy Carters day Most jobs in thiseconomy are dead end People who work hard and build a good record move on tobetter jobs And the labormarket success of millions of unskilled immigrantsin recent years makes it hard to sustain the case that only highly trained oreducated workers are in demandat least for the moment                            Incapable workers What about welfareparents who in practice just cannot hold jobs or perform other workactivities as the new law requires they do after two years on the rollsMaybe they have low mental or physical abilities Maybe they are drug oralcohol addicts or have multiple family or behavioral problemsor maybe theysimply have a bad attitude Nobody really knows how big a problem this is andthe extent will surely differ from area to area But we wont know till we pushthe limits            Many states are alreadyfinding that a simple shove can have surprising results Wisconsins ambitiousand relatively expensive welfare reform has cut its caseload by more thanhalf Massachusetts put in a tough program in November  and has seen itswelfare rolls drop to the lowest level in  years Oklahomas welfare rollshave dropped by  percent over the last year even though it has only talkedabout tougher rules            Healthyjob markets surely helped but the economy has boomed at other times withlittle effect on welfare State officials think many potential recipientssimply got the message that times have changed and found jobs on their ownMoreover credible studies have shown that many families have hidden income Arecent study from Californias Public Policy Institute for example found thatnine out of  teenage welfare mothers in the state have income sources otherthan AFDC Reporters across the country who have set out looking for earlyhorror stories have returned with articles that are on the whole remarkablyupbeat                            Not enough training and supportiveservices The new law is pretty tough on training Only shorttermjobreadiness or search assistance onthejob training or a maximum of months of vocational training count as work activitiesthough recipients whoare working part time can take other classes in their spare hours But trainingprograms have a dismal record Some have even been shown to impede movementinto jobs Los Angeles County for example was having no luck with itsbasiceducation GAIN Greater Avenues for Independence program until twoyears ago it shifted the focus to getting jobs The result a  percentincrease in job placements and big benefit savings            As forsupportive services in Massachusetts at least most of the special jobs setaside for welfare recipients have gone unfilled and there has been noincreased demand for medical help or childcare assistance                           Two things you really should be alarmedabout both of which President Clinton now proposes to remedy            People between the ages of and  who have no kids lose food stamps after six months if they arentworking or in training That might not sound so tough Streetlevel traffickingin food stamps has got out of hand and its time for another round of cleanupand streamlining And many of the people in question are realdeadbeatsdrunks addicts and the like But thats just the point Foodstamps are the last resort the pittance that a rich country doles out to evenits least deserving citizens Of course this new requirement like manyothers is waivable and many big cities have already gotor appliedfordispensation            Legal immigrants who are notyet naturalized unless they are refugees seeking asylum have worked here years or are veterans or in the military lose both food stamps and benefitsthey might be receiving from the Supplemental Security Income SSI program forthe aged and disabled Most immigrants are supposed to have sponsors who standready to make sure they do not become public dependents Yet the number on SSIespecially has soared Putting some teeth into sponsorship requirements forfuture entrants as the new law will do is reasonable But pulling the rug outfrom under people who may have no practical recourse is unfair And unlike thecutoff for childless food stampers this requirement cant be waivedaway
