                                 Glass Houses            According to the BusinessTimes of Singapore theres a bond dealer at the New York firm of RBL whokeeps a handheld urinal at his desk so he never misses a market turn Andaccording to both the Independent and the Sunday Times of Londonthe booming Monica Lewinsky novelty market includes  items such asMonicondoms designed for oral sex talking Lewinsky dolls and Monicabirthday cards Ill blow out your candle            Greatstories both falsecribbed from articles by Stephen Glass in the New               Republic  Glass was fired last week by TNR after a Forbesreporter alerted TNR editor Charles Lane that an article about ateenage computer hacker Hack Heaven May  was full of fabrications andLanes own investigation confirmed that Glass had made things up wholesale inmany New                Republic pieces The details are in ForbesDigital Tool            Checking the Web and LexisNexis for the people andorganizations mentioned in Glass articles you do not come up emptyhandedAlthough there are often no references before Glass published his fantasiesthere are often references afterward  These are generally in Britishpublicationsor publications in places to which Britain brought the benefitsof advanced civilization such as hack journalism            Betweenthe Web Nexis and the good old telephone it took little effort to discreditsuch apparent Glass inventions as the National Memorabilia ConventionMonicondoms or the investment firm RBL Other untraceable organizationspublications and individuals

the NewtOMeter the First Church of George Herbert WalkerChrist the Committee for the Former Presidents Integrity Steve Tellis theTellis Times  and the Commission to Restore the Presidency toGreatness            Listed here it all seems transparently bogusor at least deeply suspicious Yet Im embarrassed to confess that every Glassstory passed my stink test when first published in the New Republic Now plowing through the big Nexis dump my hindsight is golden Glass movedmonumental piles of bullshit past me a vain skeptic I shouldnt have believedhis story about the alleged sex orgy staged by of a bunch of potsmoking youngRepublicans at a DC convention Its just too good to be true And whywerent my suspicions aroused after three New Republic piecesdiscovering bizarre cults centered on implausible political figures First hedocumented the adoration of Paul Tsongas by Susan an yearold Chicagowidow with no last name Then he discovered the First Church of George HerbertWalker Christ Finally he stumbled upon an Alan Greenspan Shrine at aninvestment firm            I cantsay why the New Republic failed to catch Glass before Forbes didEditor Lane declined to answer my questions The magazines New York PRofficer called with the magazines regrets Glass could not be reached forcomment But I can speculate about my own failure to see what seems so clear inhindsight            One explanation is that factoids such as the bondsmansportable urinal which seem starkly implausible when presented alone are lessso when woven in with easiertobelieve fictions Glass skillfully eases you inby reporting that assistants serve bond dealers lunch at their desks and dotheir Christmas shopping for them Like the famous frog you would jump out ifdropped in boiling water but cook to death in water that heated upgradually            Anotherpartial explanation is that Glass built up credibility as each story waspublished and went unchallenged You figured that if RBL didnt have a bonddealer with a urinal on his desk someone from RBL would call the writersbluff What you didnt figure is that Glass would make up RBL itself Theprincipals in his stories didnt complain about the falsehoods for the simplereason that they often didnt exist            But the main reason Glass spoofed everybodysradar is that his stories were in the selfmocking journalists phrase toogood to check As a reader not his editor it was not my job to check themBut I didnt even bring my usual editors skepticism to reading them because Iwanted them to be true            TheGlassworks contain what editors cravestories with energy and imagination andoriginality The filigree of detail dazzles Some of his better pieces readlike textbook examples of New Journalism fusing the world of fact with theliterary power of narrative He doesnt just write about teenage hackers hetracks a pimply member of the species down to his Bethesda home where asoftware company is signing him to a contract He interviews the adoring momNo wonder George  the New York Times                Magazine  RollingStone  and Harpers failed to snoot out the stink factor andassigned pieces to him                   Slate                published a piece coauthored byGlass last year See Readme for the editors comment            Colleagues describe Glass as an extraordinarilyhardworking and personable yearold who gladly pulled allnighters toimprove his pieces whenever his editors asked him to He was completely open tocriticism He regularly entertained the staff at editorial meetings withpreviews of the dish to come in his next piece Its a testimony to his energythat when editors questioned his hacker piece he erected a Web site to provethe existence of a nonexistent software company A layabout would simply havewritten a true story When you like somebody you tend to trust him Let thisbe a lesson to us all            But wherewere the New                Republic s fact checkers TNR does have afact checking department It was established following New Republicstaffer Ruth Shalits serial plagiarisms The person in charge of setting itup Stephen Glass That is ironic of course but the joke is not on theNew                Republic  Its on the conceit of fact checking ingeneral            No publication is safe from a trusted reporterwho makes things up And hindsight is easy That said a publication can makescamming its readers more difficult than the New Republic made it forGlass Giving young reporters unimpeded access to anonymous quotations is likehanding a toddler a loaded gun Years ago a young freelancer submitted astory to me about IranContra that was filled with anonymous sources I askedfor their names Bob Woodward doesnt tell Ben Bradlee who his sources arethe writer objected Well youre not Bob Woodward and Im not Ben BradleeI responded As he coughed up his sources he sheared the sharper edges off hisstory I never used him again            The conventional wisdom inWashington this week is that young writers such as Glass who crack up deservesympathy because the system pressures them into becoming stars before they arejourneymen Please This explanation exonerates dishonest writers whileproviding protective cover for careless editors If theres any moral to betaken from this story it should be No more excuses            One final clue should havealerted usreaders and editorsto Glass deception Life is not so good thatit places reporters at the center of action as frequently as it did the youngGlass And he wrote so well Anyone can doubt a bad writer Its the good oneswho need watching
