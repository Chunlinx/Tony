                well got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone there   no i dont think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer uh   im afraid youre right   uh one evening i decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought oh well somethings happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house   oh my   and they had stopped a uh  a stolen car   oh boy   and caught one of the men in the hedge and then the other one was on the roof in the back   by your house   by on my house   oh my goodness ah aye aye     so im very much aware of uh crime in the cities and the and the concern about it     oh my thats thats got to be a frightening way to spend spend an evening   it was i uh i kept hearing noises and so i i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage so i got a gun my gun and walked to the you know through the house into the garage there was no one there but i wanted to be sure   oh boy     is Plano beginning to experience the the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan you know in the urban area   unfortunately yes yes   thats too bad   i think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get the hoods and the ruf riffraff and everybody else in there and i think u   umhum umhum   you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek but uh weve been weve lived here sixteen years and   umhum   now you you know you can tell the change for sure   well i was thinking if youve been there that long youve seen Plano grow from what was really a a small town to a city   yes well with all the uh Central Expressway uh with all the stores and the uh restaurants and the     umhum   uh convenience stores and all that kind of stuff its just prime pickings for people driving by you know and   yeah well i was appalled to read the other day about the uh uh shooting on the tollway   thats that couldnt be too far from you neither uh   uh well its further west of me   okay   i live over near White Rock Lake   oh yes okay   but uh uh it was really frightening to think that uh its not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth uh i never thought about someone robbing those but apparently they do   i dont know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but   yeah it just doesnt seem possible does it   its kind of kind of stupid isnt it   umhum   but i guess when people do those things they dont really give a thought of the consequences at the time its looks like easy pickings and away you go right   no yeah and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in um the theft and the the violence that we see   i think youre right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too   it it is convenient isnt it i didnt know what i was doing   right right right just like the old alcohol idea and   that kind of umhum   i think people uh i think when you have haves and have nots youre always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find its easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money   umhum well yes and i work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System and uh uh uh do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are   oh boy where do you work uh yes i think i do that uh is that Amelia Earhout Earhart School there   uh no this is over near Lincoln High School   okay   uh just not far off South Central Expressway   thats a pretty rough area there isnt it   it is a pretty rough area were over by Fair Park   um my goodness   and uh you know you watch the people there are marvelous BMWs and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns   huh   and the kids see that and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where uh you know running for uh drug dealers if   definitely that area that thats big time big time there sure is   umhum it surely is   i dont think id go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself in that area   well im careful   gee thats the worst neighborhood in the whole city area   yeah its uh a little scary sometimes and uh i manage the
