                so what movies have you seen   uh well i have uh seen Dances With Wolves which is probably the the best movie that i have seen lately uh i do not go out to films very often   uhhuh   so as far as out of the house so we do get a lot of videos that we bring in uh and i see some that way but uh i am not real current on films how about you     yeah i saw Dances With Wolves and uh Home Alone and   i hear thats really good but i havent seen it yet   yeah it is  about a little kid that that his parents go off to Paris   yeah uhhuh   and they they forget all about him       the oldest daughter they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of   oh cute   and he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble   oh dear   so she made him go sleep upstairs   uhhuh oh   and there is there is a couple of burglars uh breaking into the houses in the neighborhood   oh and he hears them or something and   and uh yeah and he sets up traps for them all over the house   who wins   uh he does   oh great great yeah i had heard people talk about it and they say it was really cute but i hadnt seen it   uhhuh   uh we usually wait and eventually eventually it comes out on video and then we get it and see it that way   right   and that is it movies are very expensive uh movie theatres here they are six dollars uh for evening performances and that is kind of steep   uhhuh   i think i dont know how much is it in Dallas   well it is six dollars and then but you get um matinee prices but   yeah you can do that but it is difficult if you if you work or you know   uhhuh   uh that is taking the middle of the afternoon and if i am looking for entertainment usually i i have more uh time in the evening than i do in the middle of the day to uh see things what do you think of movies in general as far as the as the trends   well i think they are a lot better than they used than they were well like um in the early eighties or the during the like the Smokey and the Bandit era   uhhuh   when it was they i dont think they were very good during that time at least there werent as many good ones   yeah did yeah the quality i think maybe has improved in that respect uh the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a   uhhuh     a tougher rating which suggests that that you know it will be more enticing to the to the public and a lot of times it is added for no real uh valid reason   uhhuh   uh which does not make and i think Smokey and the Bandit was a little bit like that   yeah   uh but Dances With Wolves did not seem to have anything added it was just all legitimate kind of uh film and that is where reason why i suppose it won so many Oscars uh because it really was good even though it is such a long movie you know they said oh people wont wont be interested in a three hour movie but it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone   and it was shocking at the end too so yeah   oh oh yeah absolutely uh but much more true to life and i think that is that is the point   yeah that is right   uh they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good i hate sequels too i hate these uh you know number one two three four   uhhuh uhhuh   usually if a movie is good once is enough   yeah especially Jaws   right that was on Prime Time Television here uh recently at seven thirty in the evening and uh it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie and children young children could see could have seen that movie   uhhuh   uh at that hour and i thought that you know that would not have been the sort of thing i would have wanted my children to see at that age uh i mean when they were young and here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the TV   right   uh which was a it was a good movie i mean it was well done but uh that is one reason why it was scary   uhhuh   so but i do not know that i have seen any of the uh sequels to that i think one is enough   yeah just more of the same   yes uhhuh that is what people say   in one of them they have a mother shark uh destroy a whole uh marina and aquarium   oh   which is kind of far fetched   yeah it just a touch   yeah     well the whole movie is kind of far fetched   uhhuh   but i mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched   they hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody   not not too often that has gotten to be a whole camp idea idea now though you know if you hear that music you know everybody knows what you are talking about   yeah   its funny well it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs   well uh every once in a while i go  but it it has to be like somebody that i like or   yeah   you know i did not i did not go see Field of Dreams when it was in the theatre because i did not know it was any good   uhhuh   and then when it was i i found out it was Kevin Costner when it was on um i guess ABC the other week then i   right yeah i saw it then too   yeah and then i really liked it   yeah it was good it was very good but uh um uh   uhhuh   see i have uh teenagers in my house and of course sometimes they rent movies and you know have friends over or something and sometimes movies are here that i did not i am not even aware that i could have seen you know because my family tells me that that that it had been actually in the house before   huh   but id missed it but i did see it on TV and i thought it was good   yeah it was really and then and then uh Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player i thought they made him up and then i found out you know after i saw the movie that they they started talking about that scandal and   oh really   yeah when the when the anniversary came up that was around the time of anniversary and   uhhuh    no kidding oh i did not realize that   then it was on the news   yeah uh you know the character that uh James Earle Jones played   uhhuh   uh uh i teach in school and we are doing a book called Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison   uhhuh   and i wondered if maybe he was patterned after him   yeah   uh i do not know i had not heard anybody talk about it but uh he certainly could have been uh which was kind of interesting   yeah   you know someone who uh who was a real activist but then took up the cause uh kind of gave up you know because he didnt think anything was happening and so uh it was kind of fun   yeah and i wondered who it was too   i do not know for sure but there are certain uh qualities that suggest it could be he because they were uh they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse that he had stopped writing and had stopped you know and that is true for Ellison he he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it   huh   and uh has pretty much dropped out of public life but he is still alive and that you know thats what makes it so interesting   uhhuh   and that book have you ever read that book      uh i dont   Invisible Man   what is that Invisible Man   Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison     uh no huhuh   it is an incredible book it uh really is very very interesting i highly recommend it   uh did they make the movies after that or   uh the yeah the movie the in Field Field of Dreams came out after uh that novel   uhhuh   so it it could easily have been patterned after him but the the movie did not have anything to do with with the story that i am talking about but i just thought the actor the uh author could have been patterned after that uh   right   i mean that that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him certainly   uhhuh   sort of interesting so well i guess we have talked probably our limit time limit havent we   oh yeah   okay very good it was nice talking to you     okay it was nice nice talking to you byebye   okay byebye
