                                 Stating His Case            Yesterdays All Clinton All the Time extravaganza leads all the majors TheNew York Timesand USAToday run banners focusing on President Clintons SOTU pitch to saveSocial Security by investing some of the budget surplus on its behalf in thestock market and also to use some of it to subsidize a new system of individualretirement accounts The Washington Post doesnt use a banner but instead runsseparate headlines over its Social Security lead andfirstdayofClintonsdefense impeachment offlead But the Los AngelesTimes uses a banner that says it all Clinton Sets Out Vision DefenseOpens The defense conducted by White House counsel Charles Ruff even thoughbasically footstomping and punctuated by a tooexquisitely timed chokeupevocation by Ruff of his late father on Omaha Beach gets good reviews            As all the papers report the Clinton address was eclectic including notonly the revelation that the federal government has decided to sue tobaccocompanies to recover cigaretterelated health care costs but also the intentto put  more teachers in classrooms and to boost defense spending Butthe capstone of the speech say the papers was Clintons proposal to apply thenext  years worth of budget surpluses to Social Security Medicare and individual retirement accountsThere is much mention of Republican enthusiasm for tax cuts instead but onlythe NYT flatly observes that Clinton never explained how he would payfor most of his new ideas and that some stand little chance of passage            The WP is good on the particular politics of Clintons SocialSecurity proposals saying that it is classically Clintonesque in that itpreserves the programs size but only by accepting something that was anathemato earlier Democratspartial privatization            The LAT focuses the most on the partisan response Clinton receivednoting along with the NYT  that impeachment trial judge Chief JusticeRehnquist didnt show up and that six House members and one senator allRepublicans also stayed away            The papers contain some interesting thoughts on how Clinton deployed theSOTU in the service of deflecting his impeachment predicament First offeverybody notices that he didnt mention the Iword at all The NYT saysthat for a month the White House had been leaking various SOTU proposals butheld back its Social Security plans and its new tobacco legal strategy toinsure that the meat of Clintons program rather than the mounting of hisdefense before Congress earlier in the day would drive the coverage Both theNYT and WP note that the amount of new and substantive policy inthe speech was designed to portray a president who intends to stick around            The LAT says that the speech was in its own way the ultimateimpeachment defense revealing Clinton to be a president focused on the issuespeople really care about and hence might help him maintain the strong pollratings that may be his ultimate lever with the senators sitting in judgment ofhim            The LAT fronts the International Monetary Funds publication of areport stating that the agency badly misgauged the Asian financial meltdownThe story is carried inside everywhere else The report admits that the IMF wasslow to see the extent of the banking overhaul required but also notes thatvery few others saw things more clearly But even though many have said thatthe IMFs bailout regime of imposing higher interest rates and slashinggovernment spending exacerbated the spinout in South Korea Thailand andIndonesia the report says that its tight money approach was basically right AWall Street Journal editorial isnt convincedpointing out that just three months ago the IMF led a  billion bailout ofBrazil now in deep crisis with a rapidly disintegrating currency            The NYT  WP and WSJ run inside stories reporting thatthe federal government decided yesterday that embryonic stem cell research is not ruled out by the ban onfederally funded embryo research because the cells arent embryos They donthave the capacity to develop into a human being            The WP fronts the news that for the second time in a week burglarshave broken into the Capitol Hill office of a polling firm working for theIsraeli Labor Party leader stealing sensitive campaign material A campaignadvisor is
