                                 Anarchy in the GOP                                             Editors note Click                here                for WilliamSaletans Frame Game on Thursday nights GOP debate                        DURHAM NHIt didnt take long for tonights Republican debate to devolveinto chaos The proximate cause was a decision by the moderator Tim Russertto focus most of the attention on the two serious candidates George W Bushand John McCain While as an exercise in news judgment this was eminentlyreasonable it was also unfair As soon as the litigious Alan Keyes and GaryBauer caught wind of what Russert was doing they staged a mutiny refusing toyield the floor to him or follow his orders The result was a kind of GOPultimate fighting contest in which the rules were suspended and each candidatefought according to his wits The way each behaved in this unexpectedlyHobbesian environment was somewhat revealing            Steve Forbes reverted to typenamely Piggy the thickgoggled victim inLord of the Flies  You knew it was going to be a bad night for Forbesfrom the first question put to him by John DiStaso of the ManchesterUnionLeader  the conservative paper that has actually endorsed himDiStasios question was basically Youve been running for four yearsyoure a rich dilettante and no one in New Hampshire likes you so why dontyou get the hell off the stage and out of the race Because the questionincluded the charge that Forbes was aloof Forbes responded with his versionof a joke Maybe you want me to give a hug to John he said            At that point McCainwho was standing next to Forbes and seemed to behaving the time of his lifesaid Id be glad to Steve and actuallystepped over and gave Forbes a squeeze while Forbes was trying to answer thequestion Forbes expression while McCain was hugging him recalled the scene inthe novel OK the movie where the savage boys requisition Piggys eyeglassesAs the situation grew even more disordered Forbes simply assumed the fetalposition going totally silent in hopes of being spared further indignities Hewas road kill by the end of the hour            To McCain it was more like a great dining hall food fight He threw themost rolls After a few serious minutes in which he defended himself fairlyeffectively against accusations of hypocrisy for leaning on the FCC on behalfof a contributor McCain seemed transported back to his days at the navalacademy when he made it his object to acquire as many demerits as possiblewithout actually being expelled After hugging Forbes he got into a Yes itdoes  No it doesnt tug of war with Bush over whether Bushs tax plan woulduse up the entire projected budget surplus McCain was right that yes it doesaccording to independent estimates of the cost of Bushs proposal to end whathe calls the death penalty But McCains best sport came when Keyes askedhim a lunatic question premised on Keyes not understanding that McCain wasjoking when he said he was a big fan of the thrash band Nine Inch Nails Keyesaccused McCain of aiding and abetting cultural murder for saying he likedsuch music            McCain rolled his eyes giggled and turned into a contestant on WhoWants to Be a Millionaire  Can I get a lifeline he asked Russert            Im a father and Im not laughing Keyes responded            I havent been able to entertain you very often in the past McCain shotback rolling his eyes and giggling some more            Keyes who was wearing the exploding lilac necktie that is often a harbingerof one of his episodes also took the mayhem as a prompt to express histruest self In other words he jumped on the nearest soapbox and startedranting to no one in particular about such evils as atheism homosexuality andTim Russert He lacked only a sandwich board proclaiming The End is NearBut Keyes has one great advantage in an upforgrabs situation which is thatyou literally cant interrupt him He comes up for air less often than adolphin            Hatch like Forbes seemed unequipped to deal with pandemonium Another ofthe New Hampshire journalists on the panel Alison King of New England CableNews asked Hatch a gobackwhereyoucamefrom question similar to the oneasked of Forbes Your campaign has been flat at best she commented            Dont count out Orrin Hatch Orrin Hatch answered Bob Dolestyle ButHatch was pretty much out of the rest of the debate bewildered by the carnagearound him and unsure how to respond to it Its gotten a lot more nasty heremarked at one point displaying a keen grasp of the obvious            Bauer by contrast was a shrewd and vicious opportunist As soon as herealized the power was out he began looting shops He brutally joined in theassault on the hapless Piggy accusing him of being antifamily for wanting totake away the mortgage interest deduction Then Bauer hit Bush for not adheringto conservative values being clandestinely proabortion and assorted othersins His most vicious moment came when Russert following up on Bushscontroversial Christ answer in the last debate pressed the Texas governor onwhether he was really a closet theocrat Russert asked Bush whether he wouldtake an expression like What Would Jesus Do into the Oval Office            I would take an expression in the Oval Office of Dear God Help Me Bush responded            So would we governor Bauer fired back apparently unable to resist theapercu             But though he was a constant target for almost everyone else Bush absorbedsuch shots goodnaturedly firing back when he had to but not getting hotunder the collar After answering one of Bauers attacks Bush actually winkedat the wily evangelical Bush seemed to recognize this kind of contained riotas a familiar situationa frat party gone slightly out of control He stuckclose to the keg smirked a lot and got through the evening without gettingpuked on            What do we learn from this In a Darwinian environment Bush McCain andBauer know how to survive
