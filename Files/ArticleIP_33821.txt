                                 Scouting for Boys            In Evelyn Waughs novelBrideshead Revisited  Lord Sebastian Flyte turns the pages of theNews of the World and sighs Another naughty Scoutmaster This was only a few years after the Boy Scouts had been created but they hadalready become a source of indelicate mirth            Now another scoutmaster I do not say naughty hasled to an important ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court James Dale is years old and has been in the Scouts since he was  He was happy in his workas a scoutmaster but Scout officials saw a newspaper photograph of him leadinga gay rights group at Rutgers University and they threw him out He sued andwon the court ruling that the Scouts may not discriminate on grounds of racecreed sexual preference or whatnot            Most good schoolmasters Waugh wrote arehomosexual by inclinationhow else could they endure their work He hadEnglish public schools in mind but might well have been thinking of any numberof other organizations where men instruct boys The Boy Scouts have longelicited private sniggers about the sort of men they attractgoing back infact to their founder that curious Englishman Robert Stephenson SmythBadenPowell            He created the Boy Scouts in  shortly afterreturning to England from a tour of duty as a cavalry officer in South AfricaDuring the Boer War he successfully commanded a vastly outnumbered force of men during the siege of Mafeking and he went home a national heroWithin just a few years the Scouts had spread throughout the British EmpireEurope and the United States and almost from the beginning there werescoutmasters who loved their little charges not wisely but too well Onenaughty leader after another trailed sadly through the courtrooms to thedelight of the dirty London tabloids            Although BadenPowellhimself never landed in court he was certainly a strange man He was obsessedwith boys and boyology The index of Tim Jeals excellent biographyBadenPowell speaks of his aesthetic and sexual interest in menpremarital celibacy dreams of young men and anxieties over sexualityHe got married at  to as Jeal put it a sporting girl whose interest inoutdoor comradeship seemed at least as great as her desire for sexualfulfillment and he even managed to beget three children But thereafter healways slept out on his balcony and this in the English climate rather thanin the marriage bed            BP as he was known throughout the Scoutmovement studiously recorded his dreams which were often about young men Inone he recalled a soldier snatched a whip away from him and asked whether hehad ever been disciplined And in his  manual Scouting for Boys which has a fair claim as one of the most influential books of the th century he focuses keenly on lust though he does not mentionhomosexuality outright BadenPowell considered sexual desire a transitoryphase in adolescence and he was obsessed with selfabuse He recommends that ayoung man beset by impure thoughts should drive them way by plunging hisracial organ into icy water            It seems unlikely that James Dale thus counseledhis own Scout troop though certainly any naughty scoutmaster who nowadayspassed on that advice from the founder of scouting would more likely findhimself in hot water rather than cold
