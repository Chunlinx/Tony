   you have any children    yes i have three   oh okay any college age   uh no well um the youngest just finished medical school   oh okay so you actually are probably pretty uh    and so i feel like im kind of home free now   uh great im on the uh the other end of the spectrum actually im uh uh four years into a doctoral program and i am working on my dissertation right now   oh well i envy you i wish i had the courage to go back and do that    it   but i have afraid i have trouble remembering my own name now much less trying to do a dissertation    oh yeah well it it its a rough road as im sure your son probably can can attest to as well   yes but its its very worthwhile when youre finished    yeah yeah thats  thats true   well what did you look for when you were getting ready to go to a college to a university   well to be honest with you im not im not sure that my my feelings back then are valid or are to be modeled because i was so young um i guess i guess if i had to look at it again i would probably want want to pick a school that uh number one had a good financial aid department uh the school ive been at does not i mean yeah its okay but   umhum its not great   well they they tend to lose things   oh well thats wonderful news   yeah uh they lost my transcripts about four times and    oh thats painful   yeah thats real frustrating um thats thats one aspect of it i think something thats really important is for the school to have a good library   yes oh i think that is of the utmost importance   yeah   uh my son chose to go to AM here he uh graduated valedictorian of his high school class so he had you know quite a choice but he wanted a good what he considered one of the best science departments   umhum great sure    and he wanted to practice in Texas so he chose AM and uh they were kind of pioneers   yeah uhhuh   in their science department in that you could choose the whichever professor you felt was the would be the most enlightening for what particular field you were going into   true umhum   and they listed them in a pamphlet that you received so uh   so you actually got some kind of feel for what the faculty   yes so that you could now you didnt have to report to i mean you didnt have just one professor professor that you had to be with if you were in engineering department you might want to go to Professor Smith   histories were right umhum   and if you were going to be a doctor an MD you might want to go to Professor Jones and then um   right   and amongst all those listings they had also classified which what doctors were the better ones   umhum   for each particular segment of that field like one might be better in organic chemistry and one might be better in electrical engineering so uh   sure right sounds similar to what most schools do in in on a graduate level   umhum   um where as it sounds like AM does it more or does it also on an undergraduate level   yes and they uh several of the other universities were using them as a model and going to try it because they felt that   so   students too often said well the reason i didnt do well on that test is my professors harder so basically they all gave the same test   right   and you could uh you were assigned to a particular place and time to take your test but that was the only time    umhum   now of course thats what i i marvel at some of these youngsters that i see talk about going off to college that have no selfdiscipline that   yeah   you know theyre never gonna make it   exactly   because no matter where you go you there isnt going to be uh mommy to get you up or anything else you know   yeah thats thats another thing i wanted to emphasize is that if and if and when i ever get to the point to where im looking for schools uh i think im gonna opt for a larger one   umhum   just because i i think it forces people forces students to be a little more independent i know that i myself went to two schools as an undergrad one was small one was not small and i really think i learned more at the one that was not small because so much of the things i had to do on my own and i learned a little bit more about the system in general and more about myself um being able to handle the situations that i came into   i would think that would be true you would also you know be totally on your own where you if you need help youre going to be the one to search it out   right umhum   it isnt gonna just be sitting there and life is something that you have to search out everything youre going to do   exactly its its an active state its not something that you can kind of you know be passively involved in and expect to do any good really i dont think   no i dont think so either now of course uh   yeah   uh i like i came from the midwest so im very partial   umhum
