                                 Love Bomb                           Part of a twopart article For Part  click here             Claus Schenk Graf vonStauffenberg who set off the bomb that nearly killed Adolf Hitler on July  was one of the most spectacularly odd figures to flash across the worldstage Under his military exterior he was a pure aesthete a devotee ofesoteric literature and musty medieval romanticism a kind of tacticalsymbolist If the German resistance to Hitler amounts to nothing more than amyth as the books I reviewed last week in Slate suggested Stauffenberg was aiming atmyth and nothing less He knew by July  that his conspiracy had littlechance of success but he drove ahead regardless He was determined to commitan act that might start a rumor of residual goodness in Germany Even more hewanted to save the old German myths from Hitlers corrupting touch It was anunreal crazy but terribly earnest mission            PeterHoffmann has written good general histories of the resistance but hisStauffenberg takes a new tack Decades of exhaustive research aretelescoped into a swift biographical narrative at times matteroffact and attimes unexpectedly passionate It is the first book to do justice to thestrangeness of Stauffenbergs world The family had lived in the southwestGerman province of Swabia for centuries and believed itself to be descendedfrom the Hohenstaufen dynasty whose lineage included the Holy Roman emperorsFrederick Barbarossa and Frederick II More recently the family had served theeccentric kings of Bavaria Claus older brothers Berthold and Alexander weretwins Claus too had a twin who died in infancy For a time he oftenbrought his mother flowers for his brothers grave Hoffmann writes in one ofhis surprising sentimental touches The Countess Stauffenberg moved in variousartistic circles befriending Rainer Maria Rilke among others it was throughher connections that her sons met the poet Stefan George            George who lived from  to  is ranked high amongGerman lyric poets for his elegant Symbolist visions The teenage Stauffenbergbrothers were the most ardent disciples of his last years The poet took themin first of all because he liked to have handsome youngsters around himEyebrowraising photographs in Hoffmanns book show boys posing in Georgeshome in medieval costumes But George was also fascinated by the Stauffenberglineage particularly the Hohenstaufen connection Frederick II thealternately splendid and frightening  th century monarch who earnedthe nickname stupor mundi  was for him the model of an enlightenedauthoritarian George thought the Empire lingered in modern times as a secretGermany the Stauffenberg brothers providentially appeared as a band of boyprinces who could take command Claus was told that the emperor himself mayhave awakened in him after centuries of sleep beneath a Swabian mountain            All thissmacks of Hitlerism of course George did share Hitlers contempt fordemocracy and devotion to German myth He also bandied about antiSemiticphrases despite the constant presence of Jews in his circle But his worldviewdeparted from Hitlers in several respects For one he was steeped in foreigninfluences He translated English Spanish and French poetry with the FrenchSymbolists his principal poetic model His love of the Romance languagesincited a highly subversive orthographic innovation the elimination of capitalletters on German nouns And for all his elitism and secretiveness George hada most unHitlerlike strain of gentleness Like Wagner and like Thomas Mann inhis conservative phase he saw authoritarian rulers ushering in a kingdom ofardor and love            George died too soon for his real attitudetoward the Nazis to become clear As Hoffmann notes disciples would laterspend much energy trying to expunge tentatively proHitler remarks from theGeorge oeuvre  Stauffenberg following the lead of the Master showedvague enthusiasm toward Nazism early on While training for a career as anofficer in the late s he displayed fashionable contempt for the WeimarRepublic In  he posed for a model of a massive stormtrooper monumentsculpted by his friend Frank Mehnert also a George disciple He refusedhowever to don a Nazi uniform and struck an attitude that was deemedinsufficiently fascist by the monument committee He criticized the vulgarityof the Nazi leadership but never exhibited any deeper opposition to its idealsHoffmann writes that some relatives expressed surprise after the coup attemptof  Many had thought of him as the only real National Socialist in thefamily            Whatcaused Stauffenberg to turn so suddenly against Hitler in  and Standard theories about German officers and their disillusionment with theregime seem inadequate As a member of Georges secret state Stauffenbergwent only so far in his devotion to the military he was not acting simply tosave the institution from Hitlers murderous ineptitude Perhaps what enticedhim was a sense that Georges ideals could flower in the ruins of HitlersGermany and that he himself might become the prophesied savior Stauffenbergwas a shadowHitler in some ways His youthful love of architecture music andstage design coincides precisely with Hitlers cherished dreams In a schoolessay Stauffenberg wrote of Speerlike architectural ambitions Everybuilding will so to speak represent a temple dedicated to the German nationand fatherland One observer noted in him a streak of demonic will to powerand a belief that he was born to take charge            Weighing against these authoritarian traits aredescriptions of the mans essential sensitivity to others His military careershows him repeatedly choosing human values over material gains His specialtylay in the supply of troops on the front and as the Russian invasion unfoldedhe grew horrified by Hitlers willingness to cut off entire divisions on awhim He was also angered by the armys policy toward Russian civilians At atime when Slavs were being massacred by the thousands he engaged in anideologically incorrect effort to assemble troops of Russian volunteers andgive them equal status with Germans When his division was pinned down by afighterbomber attack in Africa in  he sustained incredible woundstheloss of an eye a hand and two more fingersdirecting the evacuation            Moreproblematically Hoffmann presents Stauffenberg as one of the few Germans whocame to the defense of the Jews According to many witnesses the chiefconspirator repeatedly named the mass murder of Jews on the Eastern front asthe regimes ultimate crime But the question of his real feeling toward Jewsis shadowed by Berthold Stauffenbergs testimony at his treason trial in to the effect that the brothers subscribed generally to the Nazi racialprinciple and abhorred only the violence of its application Hoffmann soughtout Jewish schoolmates from Claus youth and asked if they had perceivedantiSemitic attitudes in him They remembered him as an unusually friendly andgenerous gentile The ambiguity of Stauffenbergs attitude toward Jews can besensed in this inscrutable sentence from a resistance manifesto We want a NewOrder which makes all Germans supporters of the state and guarantees them lawand justice but we scorn the lie of equality and we bow before the hierarchiesestablished by nature            Stauffenberg stormed into a small chaoticresistance movement and gave it at least the appearance of purpose He set upan intricate plan for military rebellion across the Reich and took it uponhimself to bring a bomb into Hitlers Wolfs Lair compound in East PrussiaDespite his injuries he also insisted on arming the bomb himself He wasinterrupted by a phone call and succeeded in activating only one of twopackages of explosives had he left the second package in the briefcase it toowould have exploded greatly increasing the force of the bomb and killingeveryone in the room He brought the weakened bomb into Hitlers briefing roomand nudged it as close to the target as he could then left on a mumbledexcuse drove off the compound and flew to Berlin He struggled for severalhours to keep the rebellion together but innumerable weak links were revealedin his improvised chain of command Since he had probably resigned himself tofailure from the beginning he kept up a confident exterior to the end As hefaced a firing squad at the end of the day he shouted out a phrase that wasvariously reported as Long live holy Germany or Long live hallowedGermany  heiliges or geheiligtes                Deutschland  OneGeorge scholar claims that the true message understandably misunderstood wassecret Germany  das geheime                Deutschland             Conventional history can donothing with
