                    Background        In plants and algae the reaction centers of photosystem        I and II are enclosed within core complexes that contain a        precisely defined set of proteins  essentially all encoded        in the chloroplast genome The primary cofactor for the        photochemical reactions in these complexes chlorophyll        Chl         a is also required for assembly of        these complexes The endproduct of the Chl biosynthetic        pathway in plants in the dark protochlorophyllide        Pchlide is unable to support the assembly processes        which suggests that the lightdependent reduction of the        double bond between C and C of Pchlide see legend to        Fig  has a profound effect on the properties of the        molecule Plants and green algae Chlorophyta contain in        addition Chl         b an accessory Chl found only in        peripheral lightharvesting complexes LHCs These        complexes usually contain three xanthophyll molecules two        luteins and one neoxanthin and nearly equal amounts of Chl                a and Chl         b  or  Chl         a and  or  Chl         b molecules for the major LHCII with        an         ab ratio of  bound to proteins        LHCPs that are encoded in the nuclear genome and imported        into the plastid after synthesis in the cytosol Chl         b less mutant plants are deficient        in Chl and although containing fully functional reaction        centers have a relatively low photosynthetic capacity and        greater sensitivity to highintensity light because of a        deficiency in LHCs     Algal species in the family        Chromophyta contain Chl         c Fig  instead of Chl         b which is also restricted to LHCs        and seems to serve the same function in these organisms        that Chl         b provides in the green plants            A large volume of data exists in the literature on these        Chl derivatives In this article we propose a mechanism for        the important auxiliary roles these Chls play in        photosynthesis                    Presentation of the hypothesis        Etioplasts the form of the plastid that develops in        darkgrown plants were unable to insert LHCPs into        membranes unless Chl was added     In these        experiments in which the Zn derivatives were used because        of their increased chemical stability over the        Mgcontaining molecules Znpheophytin         b was more effective in insertion        than Znpheophytin         a An important role of Chl         b was further revealed by experiments        in which newly synthesized LHCPs were detected by        pulselabeling in Chl         b less mutant plants but the        proteins were not recovered in chloroplasts isolated from        these plants     These Chl         b less plants did not accumulate        several of the LHCPs in particular Lhcb Lhcb and Lhca            Chl         b was not detected in plants exposed        to intermittent light cycles of  min of light and  min        of darkness which accumulated only small amounts of Chl         a and thylakoid membranes             Wildtype plants treated in this way accumulated only one        LHCP Lhcb while Chl         b less mutants exposed to        intermittent light lacked all LHCPs     In        complementary fashion Chl         b did not accumulate when synthesis        of LHCPs was inhibited     When bean plants exposed to        intermittent light were treated with chloramphenicol to        inhibit synthesis of proteins on chloroplast ribosomes Chl                b and LHCPs accumulated in parallel        with no increase in synthesis of total Chl     These        results indicate that photosystem I and II core complex        proteins which are synthesized in the chloroplast compete        effectively with LHCP for small amounts of Chl         a made under these conditions and        that Chl         b does not accumulate until        sufficient Chl         a is made to satisfy core        complexes        Experiments with the model alga         Chlamydomonas reinhardtii           showed that LHCPs were not detectably imported into the        chloroplast in the absence of Chl synthesis and instead        accumulated outside of the chloroplast in the cytosol and        in vacuoles     High concentrations of chloramphenicol        caused strong suppression of total Chl synthesis when        darkgrown algal cells were exposed to light possibly by        inhibition of Mgchelatase    in addition to        chloroplast protein synthesis Synthesis of LHCPs on        cytoplasmic ribosomes was not inhibited by chloramphenicol        and the proteins accumulated to the same level as in        untreated cells      However because of the low        rate of Chl synthesis only a small fraction of the        proteins were imported into the chloroplast and remained at        the initial site of integration As illustrated in Fig b        immunoelectron microscopy detected LHCPs along the        chloroplast envelope LHCPs were not detected in the        interior of the chloroplast although cell fractionation        recovered a substantial amount in a soluble form            In control cells the amount of Chl and thylakoid membranes        increased rapidly when cells were illuminated and LHCPs        were detected in thylakoid membranes throughout the        chloroplast Fig a This result obtained with cells        incubated at C was consistent with localization of        LHCPs on envelope membranes in cells immediately after        initiation of thylakoid biogenesis at C     At the        higher temperature not all the newly synthesized LHCPs        were incorporated into envelope membranes and the excess        accumulated in cytosolic vacuoles      This evidence        for the envelope as the site of initial interaction of        LHCPs with Chl was also supported by proliferation of        envelopederived vesicles in darkgrown         Chlamydomonas cells exposed to only a        few minutes of light    and the lack of thylakoids in a        mutant of         Arabidopsis deficient in a protein        apparently required for formation of vesicles from the        inner membrane of the envelope            These experiments with         in vivo systems demonstrated that Chl                b provides a function in LHC assembly        that is not served by Chl         a Association of Chl with proteins        occurs through coordination bonds between the Mg of Chl as        the Lewis acid and amino acid sidechains as Lewis bases        The availability of an unshared pair of electrons in the        Lewis base the ligand varies widely and is the primary        factor in the strength of the coordination bond The        chemical properties of the central Mg in Chl also influence        the strength of the resulting coordination bond        Biosynthetic modifications to the periphery of the        tetrapyrrole ring progressively cause withdrawal of        electrons from the pyrrole nitrogens thereby decreasing        their basicity      For example oxidation of the        methyl group in Chl         a to the electronegative aldehyde of        Chl         b reduces the pK of the pyrrole        nitrogens by  pH units Similarly oxidation of the        propionyl sidechain on Pchlide to the acrylate group in Chl                c brings its electronegative carboxyl        group into conjugation with the  system of the macrocycle        with the same effect     As a consequence the central        Mg atom of Chls         b and         c has a greater affinity for        exogenous electrons thus is a stronger Lewis acid These        considerations point to the possibility that proteins form        stronger coordination bonds with Chls         b and         c than with Chl         a which may be particularly critical        with ligands that are weak Lewis bases The lack of an        aldehyde group on the periphery of the macrocycle of Chl         c which replaces Chl         b in homologous complexes in        chromophytic algae indicates that the primary interaction        between Chls and the proteins does not involve such        substituents Whether phytylation of Chl is important for        binding to proteins is not clear because Chl         c is incorporated into Chl         ac protein complexes without        esterification                    Testing the hypothesis        Tamiaki et al    demonstrated that introduction of        an oxygen atom to the periphery of a Zntetrapyrrole        macrocycle as occurs in the conversion of Chl         a to Chl         b increased about twofold the        equilibrium constant for formation of the coordination        complex with pyridine in benzene Consistent with this        observation studies of detergentinduced dissociation of        LHCs suggested that Chl         b is held by the proteins        approximately twotimes more tightly than Chl         a     Tighter binding of Chl         b is apparently responsible for the        wellknown stability of lightharvesting complexes during        mildly denaturing gel electrophoresis The initial        accumulation of LHCPs in the chloroplast envelope implies        that Chl interacts with these proteins likely by binding        to the conserved motif in the first membranespanning        region helix     when transit through the        envelope is initiated Molecular modeling suggested that        this retention motif  ExxHxR in the first and ExxNxR in        the third membranespanning region  within all LHCPs and        related proteins provides two ligands for Chl an ionpair        between Glu E and Arg R and the sidechain of either His        H or Asn N Binding of Chl         a to a mer synthetic peptide was        reduced by onehalf when His within the motif sequence was        replaced with Ala     Replacement in addition of the        Glu or Arg with Ala eliminated binding to the synthetic        peptide Import of a mutant LHCP into isolated chloroplasts        was nearly abolished when His within the motif was        substituted with Ala     Association of Chl with this        motif therefore appears essential for continuation of the        proteins on the pathway of assembly of an LHC        An illustration of the effect of binding two molecules        of Chl with enhanced affinity to a retention motif is shown        in Fig  Assuming a relative equilibrium constant of         for Chl         a and  for Chl         b binding to a ligand in LHCP        numerals approximated from data obtained by Tamiaki et al            the increase in affinity of Chl         b with the protein leads to a nearly        threefold increase in stability of the complex over that        with Chl         a when two molecules are bound This        conclusion is derived from the equations R  Chl  RChl        RChl  Chl RChl           R  Chl  RChl           K         eq  RChl           R Chl  The additional        molecules of Chl         b in LHCII would further enhance this        effect by shifting the equilibria toward complex        formation        The most electronegative ligand in LHCPs is the        sidechain of His Less strong Lewis bases are the        chargecompensated Glu in an ionpair with Arg the amide        group of Gln and Asn and finally the carbonyl of the        peptide backbone as the weakest     The importance of        the ligand was demonstrated by substitution of His with the        weaker Lewis base Asn in the apoprotein of the bacterial        lightharvesting complex LH which eliminated assembly of        the complex         in vivo and reconstitution         in vitro     Formation of a        stable coordination bond with a weaker Lewis base is        expected to require a stronger Lewis acid Consistent with        this prediction a position in CP a minor LHCII was        preferentially filled during reconstitution by Chl         a when the amino acid residue was the        normal Glu in an ionpair with a bound Ca ion but        occupancy was shifted toward Chl         b when the ligand was a weaker base        the amide group of Gln     Although the onrate for        Chl         b may be slower than that for Chl         a because binding may be impeded by        a water molecule more strongly coordinated to the central        Mg atom of Chl         b the greater Lewis acid strength of        Chl         b allows more stable bonds with the        weaker ligands        Our hypothesis on the biological role of Chl         b should be reflected in the binding        sites of Chl in LHCII Resolution of the structure of        native LHCII at      revealed locations of        individual Chls but did not provide identification of the        Chl in each site or whether any site in the complex has        mixed occupancy The model developed from this work        suggested that binding sites in the core of the complex        near the central lutein molecules were occupied by Chl         a whereas Chl         b was more peripheral From        measurements of ultrafast energy transfer kinetics within        native LHCII Gradinaru et al    suggested that indeed        lutein transferred excitation energy entirely to Chl         a while neoxanthin a xanthophyll        bound near helix see Fig  transferred energy to Chl         b With similar techniques however        Croce et al    presented evidence for detectable        transfer of energy from lutein to Chl         b which suggested close contact of        Chl         b molecules with the central luteins        Several groups developed a more direct approach for        determining occupancy by analyzing effects on the        composition of the final complex after         in vitro reconstitution when amino        acid residues in LHCPs were replaced with substitutes that        are unable to serve as a ligand For example steric        hindrance caused by substitution of bulky Phe for Gly        residue numbers are given with reference to Lhcbl in the        position designated         a     prevented this peptide        carbonyl nonHbonded because of Pro one helical turn        further from serving as a ligand see Fig  This change        resulted in loss of one Chl         b after reconstitution     Gln                  b  and Glu  in an ionpair with        Arg          b  were also identified as ligands        to Chl         b        Remelli et al           found that substitution of ligand Gln          a  or His          b  with Leu or Val respectively        led to subintegral loss of Chl         a and Chl         b which indicated mixed occupancy in        each site Studies by Rogl and Khlbrandt     on the        other hand suggested that both sites were filled with Chl         a Assignments after         in vitro reconstitution may have a        degree of uncertainty because the composition of the final        complex varies as a function of the Chl         ab ratio in the reconstitution        mixture     Mixed sites even when Chl         a was present in excess in the        mixture     probably reflected a preference for        binding of Chl         b to the protein Based on ligand        strength and the likelihood that occupancy is unambiguous         in vivo     His may serve as        a ligand for Chl         a and Gln for Chl         b         Mutation of Glu          a  or Asn          a  each resulted in loss of one Chl                a and one Chl         b     Rogl and Khlbrandt           suggested that Glu in an ionpair with Arg may be a        ligand for Chl         b with another site occupied by Chl                a affected by loss of the        proteinbound Chl Chl         b in site         a would be consistent with the        biological necessity of association of Chl         b with helix for retention of the        protein in the chloroplast However based on similarity to        results from reconstitution of the more simple CP Lhcb            Remelli et al    suggested that Glu          a  and Asn          a  are occupied by Chl         a  Loss of the latter Chl apparently        resulted in loss of outlying Chl         b in site         b which is near         a  in the dimensional structure        These assignments thus account for the five Chl         b molecules in the complex Fig         Site         b  must consequently be filled with        a Chl         a molecule     The orientation        of the transition moments of Chl         b in sites         b  and         b     suggest that an        outlying Chl         a molecule could coordinate with the        formyl group of Chl         b a sterically more favorable        arrangement than coordination to the  carbonyl oxygen        because of the opposing orientations of the         carboxymethyl and propionyl group Fig  Although        coordination of an outlying Chl to a proteinbound Chl        would enhance Lewis acid strength of the latter the        distances between Chls     suggest that interaction        would require mediation by water molecules Alternatively        these Chls may coordinate with peptide carbonyl groups        Site         a  considered to be filled with Chl                b      may play a role in        retention of LHCPs in the chloroplast Lhcb a minor LHCP        contains Gly instead of Pro at the position analogous to         in Lhcb thus eliminating the peptide bond carbonyl of Gly        as a ligand but Lhcb has a potential ligand for Chl         b in Gln      These two LHCP        subspecies along with Lhca are most affected by the lack        of Chl         b in vivo     Lhcb apoprotein        of CP has Val instead of Pro at position  and the        absence of site         a  in Lhcb may contribute to its        drastic reduction in Chl         b less mutants      However        Lhcb Lhcb Lhca Lhca and Lhca contain the Gly        peptide carbonyl as a ligand each has Pro at position             but are reduced only slightly if any in amount        by the lack of Chl         b Site         a  may therefore not be essential to        accumulation of the protein but serve in concert with        initial involvement of Chl         b directly or indirectly with the        completely conserved retention motif Because interactions        that develop during import may be altered as the result of        conformational changes as the complex assembles in        particular as the retention motif loop    is stretched        into a helical structure the final occupancy in each site        in the final complex may not reflect the initial        associations Understanding the constraints on assembly of        the complex         in vivo  including retraction into        the cytosol when the amount of Chl is insufficient            and the order in which Chls are bound will require new        experimental design We expect that synthesis of Chl         b by Chlide         a oxidase    will be determined        by the local environment around specific Chl         a molecules created by the assembly        process It is interesting to note that the retention motif        in all LHCs that contain Chl         b is followed by a Trp residue which        may be involved in synthesis of Chl         b         A converse mutagenesis approach would provide a rigorous        test of the hypothesis A stable complex should be achieved        with only Chl         a in a Chl         b less plant or by         in vitro reconstitution when weak        ligands in LHCPs are replaced with stronger Lewis bases        Increased strength of the engineered coordination bonds        with Chl         a should compensate for the lack of        Chl         b In particular a stable complex        should accumulate after Gln Glu Asn and Gln        in Lhcb are replaced with His A stronger ligand could        also be introduced in the position of Gly which seems to        be the weakest ligand in the complex Substitution of these        amino acids in the sequence of Lhcb a major LHCP that can        not be detected in Chl         b less plants      would be        expected to restore accumulation of the protein with only        Chl         a This experiment provides a        positive         in vivo selection for validation of        the hypothesis in contrast to the dramatic decrease in        accumulation of the proteins when ligands are removed by        substitution with nonligand amino acids            Furthermore whereas stable complexes can be achieved by        reconstitution with wildtype Lhcb and only Chl         b but not only Chl         a      the hypothesis predicts        that stable complexes can be reconstituted with the mutant        protein containing these substitutions and Chl         a                     Implications of the hypothesis        An extensive amount of evidence in the literature        supports the hypothesis presented in this article on the        role of Chl         b It should be noted however that        several LHCPs accumulate in chloroplasts in the absence of        Chl         b      perhaps because they        integrate more easily into membranes which implies that        other features of the proteins are involved The work        already done has established that several LHCPs are        imported into the chloroplast at a substantial rate only        when sufficient Chl         b is available and they accumulate        initially in the envelope membrane Results from         in vivo experiments have shown that        interaction of Chl         b with the first membranespanning        region including the retention motif is critical for        progression of import of these proteins The initial steps        in assembly also require the abundant xanthophyll lutein            which has not been the focus of this article The        availability of Chl         b thus strongly regulates import of        LHCPs as well as assembly and eventual accumulation of        lightharvesting complexes The resulting dramatic        enhancement in the efficiency of light capture for        photosynthesis apparently provided a strong evolutionary        pressure for development of the ability of photosynthetic        organisms to synthesize Chl         b or Chl         c            The structure of LHCs has been extensively studied and        linkage of the complexes to reaction centers physically        and functionally is well understood Further understanding        of LHC assembly requires a better knowledge of the        characteristics of the reaction catalyzed by Chlide         a oxidase and whether Chl         b is restricted to these complexes        because LHCP serves as a specific effector of the oxidation        of Chlide         a or whether the protein simply        provides binding sites for Chl         b and prevents its conversion back to        Chl         a     The latter appears less        likely as a specific effect because similar ligands should        occur in other proteins In particular the earlylight        induced proteins are homologous to LHCPs but bind little if        any Chl         b     The mechanism of Chl         b synthesis an oxidation of the        methyl group at position      will be an area of        active research in the future now that the gene for        Chlide         a oxidase has been identified             Moreover it is not known whether a pool of free Chl         b exists in a local environment in        chloroplast membranes that is mimicked by the amount of Chl                b in reconstitution experiments        Attempts to understand assembly of the complex         in vivo will provide ample        opportunity for additional experimental work                    Abbreviations        Chl chlorophyll Chlide chlorophyllide Pchlide        protochlorophyllide LHC lightharvesting complex
