              so   so   what     uh how do you feel about capital punishment   uh tough question i mean it its i was actually kind of thinking about it the other day someone was talking about it how uh a person who takes someone elses life he was saying should should not deserve the right to have to keep their own life its kind of its its its a really you know its a moral dilemma i dont know um   huh   i think that i i forget what the law is in my state i mean my home state im from im from Maryland   yeah i have no idea what the law is anywhere ive ever lived i just   and i just     i dont know so i i personally uh even though i understand the principle behind capital punishment i dont agree with it ever applying applying capital punishment to anyone um because i sort of believe that if weve got a person arrested that sure we can uh we can say you know its a murderer hes done heinous crimes but we can keep him in jail for the rest of his life and not give him a terribly pleasant existence and uh theres just no reason to justify killing a person and you know there may be an economic reason but i dont think thats sufficient to justify uh killing someone if you believe that killing is wrong you you might as well apply that to you know even that stays stays true even if youre punishing someone i know thats how i feel   yeah i mean it kind of seems going back to uh eye for an eye hand for a hand kind of thing maybe   yeah   i dont know its like uh you kind of wonder do you want someone like Jeffrey Dahmer alive or not oh or or Charles Manson   well its just that i feel like they dont really pose a threat if theyre imprisoned you know sufficiently and   yeah   you know i i i guess it would be bad if the politics ever changes and they got out for some reason but   i dont see it happening   uh yeah   like i dont see Charles Manson i think hell never get out hes hes probably going to be up for parole in a year or so but hes not going to its not going to happen   oh yeah but the thing is you know when these guys get out it can be so quiet you may not notice i mean if the public doesnt hear about it       for some reason i mean the thing is Charles Manson was really publicly well know but if its somebody whos you know a serial killer but he never was really in the media a lot then when he gets out he still wont be in the media   this could be   yeah so i you know uh it could be bad if somebody got out i guess   yeah i i still i think even if they arent in the media i dont know if it would happen unless maybe it was uh bureaucracy that got pushed aside and someone said ah well let them out   uhhuh   i dont know someone i dont know i mean i guess theres are probably are small time serial killers that you dont hear about   uhhuh   something um   well there have to be because       uh uh i dont know theres like well i dont know the numbers but i mean theres at least dozens of capital punishments every year from what i thats what i think it is and you know you dont hear about all of those   i dont know um because i think i dont think they actually execute prisoners very too often because theres i mean theres death row theres a lot of time where uh prisoners are kept on death row for a long time i mean yeah there was uh Ted Bundy   uhhuh   there was uh i mean there was such an outcry to um to execute him because it i mean he was the the crimes he did were just so heinous um now i i think that theres its just such a controversial thing that it doesnt happen too often im not so i i dont at least at least i dont hear about it that often   right yeah i dont i dont know either so   um nah i dont think theres been an execution in my state in a long time that i know of   right        yeah   and i know that like um uh one of the one of the things that thats thats one of the things that the that Amnesty International is against in the United States is capital punishment yeah   theyre against capital punishment oh okay   of any of any kind so thats the one the one thing they have against the United States one of their gripes   well arent do a lot of countries countries not have capital punishment   uh i dont know there might be some that dont   thatd be interesting to find out who doesnt   yeah   yeah   tough to uh to um whats word im looking for uh to justify   right   i guess i kind of waver i guess sometimes its like someone like Jeffrey Dahmer you kind of want
