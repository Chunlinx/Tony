                                 Something Not to Like About Sara Lee            The virtualization of theAmerican corporation proceeds apace Inform the gods of reengineering andoutsourcing that another convert has been won Two weeks ago Sara Lee Corpthe venerable manufacturer of baked goods Jimmy Dean sausages Hanes TshirtsKiwi shoe polish Brylcreem and yes the Wonderbra announced that it would bedivesting itself of its manufacturing operations to become a company whose mainbusiness was the marketing of its brands Others could make the products SaraLee just wanted to make them popular            Investors reaction to the announcement was immediate and positiveunsurprising since the decision fit nicely with current thinking on theimportance of leanness and farming out production Underlying Sara Lee CEO JohnBryans avid embrace of what he called deverticalization was a confusedcombination of reasonable assumptions misplaced analogies and an overwhelmingdesire to cater to Wall Streets desiresall packaged with the obligatoryrhetorical appeal to the demands of the market            In thinking about deverticalization the most obviousrisk is succumbing to nostalgia for the days when companies actually madesomething When Henry Ford first constructed the mammoth River Rouge andHighland Park complexes where automobiles were essentially built from scratchthose factories seemed to many to be symbols of the exaltation of efficiencyover all other goals Now with the onset of outsourcing globalization andthe virtual corporation those old factories have acquired a patina of humanistauthenticity they could not have had in their own time Assemblyline workafter all was seen as replacing the real production of skilledlaborers            Nostalgiathough tends not to be very useful in understanding either the past or thepresent Bryans rhetorical questionWhat is a product and what makes aproductis a good one In Sara Lees case the product is not just thephysical snack cake or shoe polish The product is that cake with the Sara Leename attached or the shoe polish with Kiwi on the cover And if what Sara Leecan do best is make those products more desirable by making those names moredesirable its hard to argue that anyone would be better off with the companypursuing the Fordist dream The idea of comparative advantage applies tocompanies and individuals as well as to nations            For all that however theres a lot of smokebeing blown about Sara Lees restructuring in particular and about the supposedevils of vertical integration in general Press accounts invariably suggestedthat Sara Lees divestment of manufacturing operations would free cashcurrently tied up in lowmargin activities Slaughtering hogs and runningknitting machines are businesses of yesterday And they have low returnsBryan said of those operations But it only makes sense to speak of low returnsand low margins if youre making products to sell to others            Sara Leedoesnt run knitting machines to sell fabric to other companies It runs themto supply the fabric it uses in its own products And in theory it should beable to make that fabric for itself for less than it would cost to buy it froma third party because there will be no profit margin built into the price Themargins are higher not lower than they will be after the knitting machinesare sold That was one of the crucial appeals of vertical integration It cutout the middleman Its possible of course that a company that specializes inmaking fabric will be able to do it more efficiently so that even with themarkup Sara Lee will still come out ahead But Sara Lee is the thirdlargesttextile producer in the United States It seems safe to assume that by nowits figured out how to knit efficiently            Vertical integration does mean that you need to investheavily in fixed assets and then keep investing in upkeep and upgrades If youcan avoid those costs and still make the products you want at a reasonableprice youre ahead of the gamewhich is why Coke makes syrup and not bottlesand Nike contracts out all its manufacturing to hungry Third World workers Ifthe ethics of outsourcing abroad bother you read Slates In Praise of CheapLabor by Paul Krugman But vertical integration also offers majorbenefits It keeps you from having to haggle with suppliers over prices givesyou total supervision over quality and allows you to control production Oneof the key impetuses for General Motors push for vertical integration forexample was its perennial struggle with Fisher Body a major supplier who keptholding up GM for price increases Once GM acquired Fisher the problemsstopped            Today ofcourse its hard to find anyone who will defend vertical integration Butthats essentially the product of two factors neither of which has anything todo with vertical integration per se The first is American businesss newfoundassurance that competition is the necessary progenitor of efficiency Sincevertical integration replaces the market with the firmthat is the companymakes the product instead of allowing others to bid for the chance to makeitit must be a mistake for we know the markets decisions are always rightThe second more important factor is the experience of the US auto industryin the late s and early s Since the Big Three automakers move towardmore outsourcing and less inhouse parts production has coincided with theirreturn to profitability it has seemed logical to pronounce verticalintegration an idea whose time came and went            The problem with this logic is that the autoindustry abandoned vertical integration for one reason labor costs The BigThree didnt give up on it because of justintime manufacturing or Japanesebusiness models or a desire to focus on the brand They did it because theydidnt want to pay union wages when they didnt have to Outsourcing partsproduction means that instead of paying a United Auto Workers member  anhour in wages and benefits Chrysler can buy parts from a nonunion firm payingits workers  an hour Even with the suppliers profit built in Chryslersstill getting a bargain But its hard to see how this lesson applies toindustries or companieslike Sara Leethat arent dealing with the UAW or theUnited Steelworkers            Thereally disconcerting thing about Bryans decision though is that it seems soblatantly to be more about gaining the favor of Wall Street than aboutimproving the performance of the company Sara Lee has been a terrificbottomline company for the last three years but its stock price has not risenas sharply as its competitors In his postannouncement interviews Bryan wasblunt about how much this bothered him It is increasingly obvious he saidthat the investment community does not like assetintensive companies            What the investment community does like is shorttermmeasures designed to boost share prices So all the money from the sales of themanufacturing operations  billion is going to a share buyback programwhich is to say that instead of being used to create new wealth it will simplybe redistributed from the company to investors Thats not redeploying assetsto take advantage of what Sara Lee does best Its redeploying assets to boostthe stock price            At this point of coursethat kind of maneuver should come as no surprise since companies now seem tospend as much time looking at the stock ticker as at their production linesBut there is nonetheless something melancholic about it and this is wherethe lament about companies actually making products has real resonance To giveup on River Rouge in order to build your brand is one thing But to give up onRiver Rouge to buy back shares Thats something else entirely
