                                 Organ Meat            Some people clearly areitching to do it Consider this classified ad from Ruth Sparrow a yearoldwoman who was  short for a needed gallbladder operation which ran inthe May   St Petersburg Times under medical suppliesKIDNEYRuns good Taking offers obo            Someonemust have called the newspaper because it pulled the ad after three daysnoting that organ selling is against federal law That didnt stop John Curtisthough The yearold immigrant from England managed to slip this ad into thesame newspaper on May   BRITISH MADE Kidney shaped item will swap for motorsail boat When it came out that he was selling one of his kidneysthe newspaper pulled his ad too            Awful right Not at all some say Organ sellingclickfor more examplesis gaining a respectable fan club Recently the CatoInstitute posted an article on its Web site backing organ markets and formerDelaware Gov Pete du Pont policy chairman of the National Center for PolicyAnalysis has endorsed the idea Its most sophisticated defense however comesfrom University of Chicago law Professor Richard Epstein            Epstein ispursuing an honorable but difficult mission He wants to alleviate the enormousshortage of organs for transplantation He also wants to bring libertarianisminto medicine an arena in which few ideologues survive In his book MortalPeril and a recent Wall Street Journal oped he stakes a simpleclaim Even in health care people should be allowed to do what they wish withtheir own bodies as long as they dont hurt anyone else And that includesselling their body parts Its not just because he believes people have theright Its because he thinks giving people that freedom will save lives            Its harder to refute Epstein than you mightthink He is probably right about saving lives The transplant waiting listcurrently includes  patients and about four thousand of them will diewaiting Healthy people could conceivably sell their eyes some skin a fewbones a kidney a portion of their liver and even a lung and still surviveIf Epsteins organ market opened for business patients with the resourceswould certainly bid up prices enough to attract sellers Perhaps as he sayscharity will even raise money for patients who cant pay the going rate Ifyou could spare just a couple of dollars maam well have enough to buysomeone a beautiful cornea            Epsteinhas a ready response for the arguments Wont organ selling draw downandoutswith lower quality organs So what he says The market will reduce the pricefor their organs testing will weed out unacceptable risks and the risks willoutweigh the lives saved anyway What about the risk that some people will becoerced or will act impulsively He says that we can do careful screening andrequire waiting periods Arent people who sell their organs out of desperatefinancial need acting involuntarily No more so than when they stoop tocleaning bathrooms for minimum wage he says You might reply that this isntjust cleaning out toilet bowls But he says if youre really worried aboutexploiting the poor then we can require a minimum income for anyone who sellstheir organs            Well I am no philosopher and I remain unencumbered bylegal training but I still believe the whole idea is warped My oppositionstems from exposure to ordinary people as they make decisions about whether toundergo surgery to take their medicines and so on Libertarians have greatfaith that people nearly always make rational choices and that having morechoices cant be bad But any doctor can tell you thats not true In medicineyou come to recognize how unreliable the faculty of reasoning is and howsusceptible it is to subtle forms of exploitation            Consider acommon decision faced by patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis ablockage of the carotid artery These patients have about an  percent chanceof a stroke or death in five years Surgery to remove the blockage carries a percent risk of causing immediate stroke or death but the fiveyear risk isjust  percent Patients must decide whether the upfront risk of surgery isworth cutting their overall risk of having a stroke in half Its not an easytask Each individual must define whats most important in his or her lifethen calculate the best course to meet these goals I can tell you that a lotof people fail to reason through the options very well Even when theyunderstand their goals clearly they often pick a choice that runs againsttheir aims In academicians terms they fail to maximize theirselfinterest            Studies have shown that the brain hassystematic faults in reasoning especially when processing risk informationlike this For example the order in which a doctor presents options can easilysway people Also saying people are fine  percent of the time after surgerycan lead patients one way while saying people experience strokes  percent ofthe time can lead them in the other direction Yet there is no right way toframe the options Another quirk as gamblers and con artists know all toowell is that the brain is not good at weighing small chances of big gains orlosses against large chances of small losses or gains            When anorgan seller is trying to decide whether the terrible dangers from kidneyremoval or the certain loss of sight from surrendering an eye is worth a suddencash infusion his effort to identify his best interest will be confused by howthe question is framed by difficulties sorting out the statistical risks bythe vision of all that money and many other factors These vulnerabilities areeasily exploited But even when not taken advantage of plenty of people getserious decisions wrongenough that we should question libertarian beliefsthat people should do what they want and live with the consequences            Some options are so terrible and irrevocable so unlikelyto be in a persons selfinterest and so open to exploitation and flaweddecisionmaking that society outlaws them In human experimentation forexample researchers cannot pay volunteers so much that the poor could beexploited Rules limit how much blood you can donate or sell at one sittingAnd while we allow people to give a kidney to their child we do not allow themto donate their heart Likewise hawking an organ would be right for so few ifany that permitting the option makes no sense at all            Isnt thispaternalism Yes Even Epstein seems to recognize we need some when he acceptslaws stopping people from selling themselves into slavery or selling a vitalorgan such as their heart People will argue about where to draw the line Somethink seat belt laws for example go too far But few would discard lawsagainst organ selling            Iknow that I could find myself on thattransplant waiting list someday But Ill take my chances Its certainlybetter than living in a society that allows money to entice people to converttheir own health into a commodity People can be weak and money is all toooften the way to their heart
