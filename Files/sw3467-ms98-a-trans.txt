guess we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like and uh   right are they little   i have a seven year old and a ten year old   yeah theyre pretty young   and uh so we usually catch uh Full House and uh whats the one comes on after that its a new one um   i dont know my kids are older so i dont i dont know some of those shows now like i used to  yeah   three something uhhuh yeah yeah uh other than that uh oh gosh i watch Knots Landing on Thursday nights for pure entertainment nothing else yeah   right well i like i like the comedies theyre just light too i have to watch Murphy Brown i really like   oh now that is a good one that is a good one if im home on Mondays then i i definitely watch her   i make a point of that i love that and i really like Coach i think its when its good its just a scream   yeah yeah well hes such a good actor he really is good   uh well hes probably playing himself half the time you see these people on an interview show theyre they act just like they do in their parts  he i saw him on Johnny Carson once and he acted just about the same   yeah yeah oh gosh well he could very well be  so do you watch much TV or   yeah and uh well i watch more now because well i i had been going to school for years and have really been too busy   uhhuh   but this semester im only taking one course and so i see Murphy Brown and Coach and The Wonder Years i just make a point of seeing those   now i never see that oh ive got a friend that says that is just wonderful show   oh its fabulous really you should never miss that it they are just gems of shows i mean theyre really uh fabulous in every way   oh gosh what now what night is that on now   oh thats Wednesday at uh seven thirty   Wednesday at seven thirty oh okay yeah Wednesdays i i go to church choir so  thats my one night out and about so   oh yeah sure yeah well maybe your maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime just so you get the idea it wouldnt take much wouldnt take much to get hooked on those   yeah i should get him to do that because i know yeah yeah uhoh   so so i watch those and   are there any new ones this year that came out that you like or   well you know i havent oh yeah we started watching Northern Exposure well its not really new but its still kind of new and   uhhuh uhhuh hows that i havent seen that   i like it a lot its real different in fact they never thought it would be a hit   huh   i mean theyll have some things in there that almost almost you know like supernatural or something you know i mean somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does or i mean it sounds weird but its its a very very uh unique show and very well done excellent actors   ah huh ill have to watch for that one sometime   i i guess we just it came on after something we used to watch   uhhuh uhhuh   and i guess we just kept sitting there and then now we make a point of watching i cant take all these shows on because next semester im not going to be able to watch hardly any television   so gosh uhoh   well then it will be mostly reruns i guess  its uh by the end of February the way they do it nowadays   yeah yeah um gosh well we used to watch a lot of Designing Women but uh i havent seen that much lately since they got rid of uh Delta Burke and  brought on the new ones   but um yeah yeah ive seen that was she the was she the best one was she the best one on that old show   oh she was just funny she was really funny and her character was good i dont know that it was her in particular it was just the character so um   really right right yeah they had a big fight on that show didnt they they were all accusing each other of everything in the world   yeah yeah oh that was awful and who knows still what happened really happened you know   well i know you know gosh you never will probably   yeah yeah   well well i think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable i dont have cable   oh i know now i told was gonna no we dont have that station either so uh i havent been able to catch any of that but just what little we caught on the news   i mean its just as wild as any soap opera from what i hear on the news and i think hes guilty as the devil   oh i know it well i dont see how he couldnt be you know   i know whats in it for her is theres never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that because you know they tear you to shreds especially those rich high powered lawyers   yeah thats right oh and they said this lawyer is unbelievable but they said she held up so well yesterday   um i know everybody was saying that and then in the paper said it so it should be interesting   yeah oh gosh   well the National Enquirer says  i was reading that in the supermarket line i never have the nerve to buy the thing uh   oh shoot well do you watch any uh any sports or anything like that or   says he hum no i dont care anything about that   because i dont either i cant i cant watch it on TV so uh   um i like the ice skating you know occasionally some ice skating will come on on a Sunday or the during the Olympics i always watch that i think its so beautiful   uhhuh yeah i like to catch the gymnastics sometimes too   oh yeah thats good it might   just to
