                have you had that experience recently   recently i cant really say recently but i think about um about a year ago um i bought a product from some company down at uh in Atlanta Georgia i believe it was one of these um one of these um mixers these like these juice machines and uh   oh yeah   the um the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked you know perfectly okay but i found that um it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting um after even you know despite you know diligent washing it  it just it got rusty after about um three weeks of use and i dont think it was my fault because  you know i had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it but uh it was really um it was i had to send it back after like you know the third week because i realized it was like it was not something was very very wrong with the blade uh how about you   well i dont have so much trouble with products as service   umhum   i dont feel like thats as big a problem ive had a few answering machines over the last two years just because ive had a lot of trouble with them working correctly   umhum   and im not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent   umhum   um the one i have now is okay most of the time   umhum   but thats it but thats thats probably the worst my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her thats guaranteed uh James Avery i dont know if you have that up there but its its a very good company that sells sterling silver things and   umhum umhum   uh she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now   umhum   and the catch broke and she was sitting in school on a carpet and when she stood up it caught and broke and we took it back and they said oh this was just obviously yanked   umhum   this was yanked i mean they were so rude about it   right   and so we wanted a different kind of catch and she said well its not guaranteed and i said well put it on because apparently nothings guaranteed so do it anyway so we got the kind we wanted   umhum   and i was really disappointed with that i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable   umhum   and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and i called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice and i said my goodness i said youve been very nice whats your name and she told me and i said well i really appreciate it i said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store and it turned out she was the assistant manager so   well at least your talking to somebody who counts   right so i felt kind of good about that you know i didnt even know the persons name that had gaven me the hard time or anything but   umhum right   i just felt like well at least i did something maybe theyll fix it they might work on that you know   right right   but i find attitudes are more of a problem service is more of a problem   i find up here in the Northeast we have um well we we have these mail order companies like LL Bean and uh they are famous for i guess really having really top notch service theyve got um i mean ive ive   really   i i have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally ive heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half and even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some  bizarre reason you decide you dont want it anymore um theyll theyll actually do things like this i mean theyre really they they go they bend over backwards servicewise for you ive um   thats really great   ive found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call i guess  if you if you call the eight eight eight hundred number um if you you can call up eight eight eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get um the eight hundred number uh the customer service support line for a number of companies and um actually ive tried that out with a few companies lately and theyve most of them have been pretty good but i i was one reason why i like i buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that uh if you buy through Bean or though um i guess Beans one of Beans big competitors is Lands End out in uh i guess its Wisconsin somewhere they they are um theyre very good about um insuring like the customers always right and you know  no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding and uh they usually get you know they they make things very they make sure make sure things are set properly if youre in any way dissatisfied with their merchandise   thats really good it used to be like that but i dont think most places are like that anymore   umhum   yeah well i think i guess nowadays with the uh with the economy the way it is i guess there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are um you know things are getting rough out there theres a lot of you know the the morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn like you know of course makes you
