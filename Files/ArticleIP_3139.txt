                                 Requiem for the Mad Scientist            The National Institutes ofHealth happened to be hosting a genetherapy conference last month when themakers of the film Gattaca launched their ad campaign Gattaca spremise is the creation in the notsodistant future of a genetic elite whoseDNA has been rejiggered at the embryo stage to eliminate dispositions to suchtraits as premature baldness and attentiondeficit disorder while heighteningcheekbones and IQs The newspaper ads for the film featured a mock promotionfor a biotech company that offered prospective parents children made toorder At the NIH conference gene therapists reported that after seven yearsof trying to insert DNA into the cells of the genetically sick not a singlecure had been reported Considering the difficulty of such relatively simpleprocedures as these the world of Gattaca seems a distant nightmareTheres not a chance in hell said a conference participant geneticistHuntington Willard of Case Western Reserve University that you couldrecombine all those genes and get a desired effect            StillFrancis Collins the guru of the Human Genome Project at NIH which issequencing and identifying all human genes was intrigued enough to seeGattaca twice the second time leading a matinee field trip of  NIHscientists and staff Collins a Christian in the CS Lewis mold broods aboutthe ethical reverberations of genetics quite a bit these days What he worriesabout most is genetic redlining where claims adjusters use tests which he hashelped develop for heritable illnesses to deny Americans their healthinsurance What fascinates and horrifies artists on the other hand is theimpression that geneticists have more creative power than artists IanWillmut the Scotsman who cloned Dolly would seem to be a guy whose work hasreally come alive In Gattaca  as well as in lots of other recent filmsand books artists have dreamed up complex nightmares of genetic determinismwhere characters are mere puppets of their DNA scripts or of the scientists andprofit seekers who manipulate them            The wellspring of these works is HG Wells The Islandof Dr Moreau  In this  novel a vivisectionist attempts to transformanimals into men until the misshapen creatures revert and kill him the forcesof nature overcoming mans civilizing artifices From The Boys FromBrazil Auschwitz doctor Josef Mengele alive and well and cloning Hitlersat a secret lab in the Brazilian Amazon to Jurassic Park RichardAttenborough alive and well and cloning velociraptors Wells basic formulahas become familiar an island a Frankensteinian experiment a Faustianscientist something gone terribly terribly wrong            But something else has goneterribly wrong since HG Wells time In the new genetic thriller thescientist is no longer mad because he has no illusions of mastery Insteadhes a lone and often belated moralist eaten up with remorse and anxietypushed into unsavory experimentation less by runaway curiosity than byunscrupulous corporate overlords Genetic manipulation is a given The yuckything is the profit motive And the mistreatment of lab animals            InGattaca  the victim is Vincent Freeman played by Ethan Hawke a faithbirth whose parents didnt tamper with his embryonic DNA Because babyVincents instant genome readout indicated a weak heart and a life expectancyof  years he finds as an adult that nobody will hire him particularly notat the space agency The hero in a sense is the company doctor who helpsVincent realize his dreams of becoming an astronaut in order to spite thebiotechstate the doctors own eugenically planned son didnt turn out theway they promised            Or consider Robin Cooks thriller Chromosome  Molecular biologist Kevin Marshall works at a secret lab in Africashades of Moreau fiddling with the DNA of apes to render their organsimmunologically fit for transplanting into rich Americans One day Marshallnotices smoke rising from the island on which the organharvested apes arewarehoused Arriving to investigate he finds them standing around a campfirechatting It seems that he has inadvertently recreated the missing link            So whatdoes Kevin do Resign and register his ethical concerns with the NIH Write uphis results for publication in Nature  Order his broker to buy biotechIn the end his nostalgia for fuzzy critters results in an act of defianceagainst his corporate boss He throws biotech and science to the wind and helpsthe manapes flee into the wilderness            The misgivings of scientists are particularly shrill inFrameshift  by Canadian scifi writer Robert J Sawyer Its a purplepremise The Treblinka deathcamp guard Ivan the Terrible has adopted a newidentity in California as the chief actuary for a healthinsurance companyWhen a FrenchCanadian scientist working in the genome project at Berkeleystumbles onto a series of murders in which Ivan is implicated he thinks hesfound a neoNazi plot to eliminate the genetically challenged But it turns outIvans goals are more banal His company is bumping off clients whose geneticprofiles indicate big future medical bills            InGattaca and elsewhere genetic enhancement is harnessed to profitreflecting capitalisms relentless remaking of the world in search ofefficiency This can backfire alarmingly as in Nancy Kress  novelBeggars in Spain  In it genetic engineers adhering to an Ayn Randlikephilosophy called Yagaism create a race of people who dont need to sleepThe genetically altered kids are exceedingly bright ambitious and nerdy asif cloned from Bill Gates and grow up believing that a persons only value iswhat he or she produces Eventually this race of supergeeks becomes sothoroughly eugenicist that it turns on its makers            In Dr Moreau  its the monsters whoforce the moral issues Theyre sloppy imperfect products trying desperatelyto live up to an ideal of progress Are we not men they plaintively askTheir struggle underscores Moreaus spiritual poverty and capacity formischief To this day I have never troubled about the ethics he says of hiswork In the new genetic thrillers its the scientist who makes a lastditchstand against an irresponsible societyreflecting a role for scientists as thedefenders of ethical principles that were born at the Nazi doctor trials atNuremberg and endured through the Cold War            Treblinka and Nagasaki mayhave given scientists pause but the doubts they occasioned came too late Theydidnt stop the arms race or radiation experiments using human guinea pigs TheHuman Genome Project in fact was built using the infrastructure of thenuclearweapons program taking over unused labs at Los Alamos Berkeley andLivermore But unlike the Manhattan Projectin fact like no other Big Scienceproject in historythe Genome Project has equipped itself with a researchdivision to explore the social and ethical ramifications of genetics Itsfindings have armed Francis Collins in his crusade against genetic redliningAnd it was Ian Willmut whose work opened the door to human cloning who mostforcefully denounced that prospect at Senate hearings held last spring            Which brings to mind a linefrom Fay Weldons  novel The Cloning of Joanna May  These daysscientists talk a great deal more about God than does the rest of the worldshe writes What is that but an obeisance to the shadow of the God who ranoff the God they drove off when bold and young and frightened of nothing Butif God has taken flight in Gattaca and elsewhere at least a few of hisimitators are trying to save their souls
