                                 Republicans Democrats and China            Human rights used to be aDemocratic concern When Jimmy Carter tried to put the issue at the center ofhis foreign policy Republicans charged that he was being woolly minded andnaive Jeane J Kirkpatrick who rose to fame as a critic of Carters humanrights efforts argued that pestering friendly regimes about their politicalprisoners played into the hands of the Communists whose human rights recordswere invariably worse            Even theRepublican human rights concern about Communist regimes had one greatexception China Partly because of Chinas Cold War value as a rival of theSoviet Union partly because Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger started therapprochement partly because the American business establishment has embracedChina so enthusiastically and partly for reasons that remain mysterious theRepublican Party has had a soft spot for the worlds largest Communist regimefor almost three decades            These days though youre more likely to hear Republicanscomplaining about the neglect of human rights in China by a Democraticpresident Such objections first arose in  when the Clinton administrationmade a sudden aboutface declaring it would delink Chinese trade policy fromhuman rights In the last year conservatives including elements on theevangelical and protectionist right have gone so far as to make common causewith the trendy left on the issue When Chinese President Jiang Zemin visitedWashington last fall Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council was spottedpicketing alongside Bianca Jagger and Richard Gere            Conservative nagging about human rights has intensified lately In recent daysSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Majority Leader Dick Armey havesaid they may oppose Clintons latest effort to renew Chinas Most FavoredNation trade status again Doing their best to take advantage of the Chinesemoney scandal Republicans have called on Clinton to cancel his trip to Chinascheduled for later this month which will be the first US presidential visitsince the Tiananmen Square massacre in  We will reach the nadir of ourabandonment of human rights if Clinton appears at Tiananmen Square RepChristopher Cox the California Republican directing the House investigationinto the transfer of satellite technology was recently quoted as saying            Have the tables turned Yes but not for thefirst timeor even the second The Republican call to put human rights aheadof geopolitics in our relations with the Chinese is just the latest expressionof a bad habit that has existed in American politics since Nixon establishedties with them in  Those out of power love to accuse those in power ofbeing overly solicitous toward Beijing on human rights and other issues Butthe critique is disingenuous If and when they come to wield responsibilitythemselves these critics drop their objections and adopt the same policy Thevalue of maintaining a cordial relationship with an emerging superpowerinevitably takes precedence over other concerns            Nixonhimself set the pattern As a senator and presidential candidate Nixon was aleading China baiter In the  presidential debates he blasted John FKennedy for being ready to abandon Quemoy and Matsu two tiny Taiwaneseislands A decade or so later of course Nixon executed a daring flipflopinitiating diplomatic contact with China for the first time since  Carterfollowed essentially the same course Nixon did As a candidate in  hecriticized Gerald Ford for continuing Nixons policy of Realpolitik atthe expense of human rights But once ensconced in the White House Carterdowngraded our relations with Taiwan and restored formal diplomatic ties withthe Peoples Republic of China in  It was also Carter who granted MFNtrade status to China for the first time and invited Deng Xiaoping to visit theUnited States            Conservative Republicans such as Ronald Reagan oftencriticized Carter for selling out Taiwan in his pursuit of friendship with thePRC But once elected Reagan too went squishy on China In  heabandoned his plans to sell advanced fighter planes to Taiwan a move thatwould have offended the mainland Chinese More importantly Reagan neverswitched back to a preNixon twoChina policy as he had threatened In he visited China The trip was a warm bath of conciliation On the way home hesaid he didnt want to impose our system of government upon others            You mightthink that George Bush a lifelong Sinophile would be the exception to thisrule but he was not In the late s as he prepared to run against Reaganfor the Republican presidential nomination Bush opposed Carters move toestablish formal diplomatic relations with the PRC calling it an abjectAmerican retreat China needs us more than we need them he wrote in a article in the Washington Post  China  has now seen just how easilywe can be pushed around Bush blasted Carter for not obtaining strongerguarantees on the security of Taiwan In office of course Bush supported MFNrenewal even in the immediate aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre HisNational Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft made a secret visit to Beijing justfive weeks after the massacre to reassure Chinese leaders of Americasfriendship            This led Bill Clinton to denounce Bushs Chinapolicy during the  campaign In one speech Clinton charged Bush withcoddling aging rulers with undisguised contempt for democracy for humanrights In another speech Clinton said There is no more striking example ofMr Bushs indifference toward democracy than his policy toward China Clintonsaid that if elected hed withdraw all trade privileges from China as longas theyre locking people up Once elected he decided that using trade policyto leverage improvements in human rights was counterproductive In supportingMFN renewal in  Clinton announced a new policy of what has alternatelybeen called constructive engagement commercial engagement and pragmaticengagement Like its Republican predecessors the administration now contendsthat pushing for human rights improvements quietly and behind the scenes ismore effective            Some Republicans have triedto imply that the Chinese purchased the Clinton administrations favor withillegal campaign cash At this stage it is still far from proved that anyonein the Clinton administration knew that the Democratic Party was getting moneyfrom China or that money had an influence on its policies But if the Chinesedid try to buy favor with the Democrats it may have been because they alreadyowned the Republicans Not having seen a Democratic administration in a dozenyears they might well have been worried that the new one elected in  wouldactually follow through on its rhetoric about human rights and democracy Withthe Republicans they understood there would be no deviation from Nixonspolicy of accommodation            The Chinese need not haveworried Whether it is a process of being captured by the China hands at theState Department or the sobering effects of real power no American presidentsince Nixon has dared to lean hard on China In  Robert Dole a longtimesupporter of MFN renewal predictably accused Clinton of weakness andindecision doubletalk and incoherence in his approach to Beijing But hadDole won the election our policy would almost certainly have remained thesame This is worth bearing in mind during the presidents upcoming trip toChina In politics the yang predominates In power the yin reassertsitself
