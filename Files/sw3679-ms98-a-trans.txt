                which baseball teams your favorite   uh i dont really have a favorite baseball team but of course the Rangers play here   oh uhhuh   and and theyve made a whole team history of trading away players that become all stars later on so   oh have they like who are some of their who are some of their players that theyve traded away   uh several pitchers that Toby Harra and uh   oh   Doc Meddich a another pitcher and of course now theyve theyve sunk all their money into Nolan Ryan so   uhhuh oh oh   but they they they have they have Ruben Sierra and they have um uh Julio Franco   oh so theyve had some real good ones over the years   yeah and they they traded away um Incaviglia to Detroit i think and then he hit more home runs this year than hed ever hit before   umhum oh ah well thats good do they is is baseball for young kids there a big thing do they start them out early or where do they get all these good players from   uh no well they get them from you know Puerto Rico and Mexico and the minor leagues   oh oh   the baseball baseball has a big minor league system especially in a a few players come out of college and then uh more players um go straight to the minors   umhum oh   and that gives them time to see uh pitching at a higher speed you know and   umhum how do so do they have a a program at all for young kids there for baseball  or is soccer the biggest thing or     yeah they do its its mostly in the schools the i think the biggest thing here is soccer   thats thats what i thought that soccer is bigger it used to be around here anyway that um baseball was real big for the young boys but now it it soccer is   umhum   making a real quick catch up um i know they have the four and five year old kids start like with the tee ball   umhum   are you familiar with that at all   right yeah   the tee ball and i think they go until theyre seven then they have the pitching machine i think eight and nine and then and then just the regular pitching after that but   umhum   its not its not a big as program as it as it used to be and im im not really familiar around here we dont have any baseball teams i dont think that even in Salt Lake City there is a   no theres not Californias the nearest place   theres a right right so it its not theres no teams around here that i really follow and am close with have you ever played baseball   yeah uh no just in P E uh its its pretty big here in high school and theyve theyve had several players um picked in the draft you know they theyre picked in lower rounds   is it oh uhhuh   especially pitchers   oh   uh but mostly they just go on to college because because because they need the experience and the education so   right uhhuh right well thats i remember uh playing baseball when i was just in grade school but by the time you know we got to P E it it wasnt a real   umhum   a real big thing either but i enjoy baseball just for a fun pastime now with you know a group gets together a family reunion or whatever or or it  we we live in a real small community and they have uh like Fourth of July celebrations and peoplell get together and play softball and thats fun i really enjoy that i think its a fun game i think its funner to play than to watch myself   right yeah   so do you do you enjoy playing it at all or do you enjoy watching it even   yeah i i um i enjoy playing and it took always took me wed play you know during the spring semester always took me about six weeks before i could see the ball before i could hit the ball   uhhuh oh oh uhhuh   and uh   yeah its do you   and but i enjoy playing i enjoy uh watching the AllStar Game and the World Series was really good this year   right oh   the there were some spectacular catches and a lot of home runs and they had uh several double plays you know and   oh uhhuh was it in Candlestick Park again   uh no it was uh uh Minnesota Twins versus the Atlanta Braves   oh   and both the teams were in last place at one point in the season   this year   umhum   my word   then they fought their way back up to the top and then of course Minnesota won i think in the seventh game and ended up   oh wow  oh that would be exciting i i was   so it was really exciting   listened a little bit about it but i didnt know you know much about it oh so it had to go the full seven games   right   oh   and it looked for a while that like Atlanta was gonna the win you know before they went back to Minnesota  but it didnt happen you know they played     oh
