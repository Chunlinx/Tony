                                 Did Disney Censor iThe Insideri            Chatterbox thinks The Insider  the new Al Pacino film about JeffreyWigand and  Minutes  is a pretty good movie Much of the story isfictionalized of courseintentionally in most instances unintentionally in afew others like when a  Minutes associate producer played by DebiMazar makes a terrible hash of Milo Geyelin the name of a Wall StreetJournal reporter on the tobacco beat            Chatterbox is willing to believe that the deliberate changes made tothe tobacco story in The Insider were done in the interest of making ita better movie Whether fictional characters should be permitted to keep thenames of real people like Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt or realcorporations like CBS and Brown and Williamson is another matter but onethat has been amply discussed elsewhere Still theres one change tothe story that left Chatterbox wondering whether the pressures were morecorporate than dramatic  the omission of any mention of ABCsFebruary  Day One broadcast alleging that cigarettemanufacturers were spiking their products with additional nicotine the stuffthat makes cigarettes addictive            Three things ought to be remembered about the Day One broadcast                           ABC News producer Walt Bogdanich and reporter John Martin became the firstto break the important story that tobacco companies were manipulating thedegree to which cigarettes pumped nicotine into smokers bloodstreams Inaddition to making Big Tobacco look even more corrupt than was previouslybelieved this made it more difficult for Big Tobacco to say that it wasnt inthe drug businessa claim it was using to avoid regulation by the FDA               The term spiking turned out to be eversoslightly inaccurate becausethe nicotine put into the cigarettes had been taken out earlier in themanufacturing process the way tobacco companies were boosting the nicotine hitwas actually more complicated than that and involved the addition of ammoniaIf you want to know more click here toread the FDAs findings on the matter               Philip Morris filed a  billion libel suit the biggest libel suit inUS history against ABC over the broadcast Despite the essentialtriviality of Day One s error in  ABCpossibly under pressureconnected to its pending takeover by Disneychose to settle the libel suit fora reported  million and to issue an apology  This prompted widespreaddisgust among journalists who viewed ABCs move as a sellout Bogdanich whonever conceded that his broadcast was in error at all about spikingrefused to sign the apology                                       The Insider leaves viewers with the impression that it was Wigand whofirst told America that the tobacco industry was finetuning the way cigarettesdelivered nicotine to the body In fact it was Bogdanich and Martin  TheWall Street Journal s Alix Freedman subsequently published a fuller accountthat also predated Wigand In the scenes in which Don Hewitt and Mike Wallaceagonize over whether to cave in to corporate pressure not to broadcast theirWigand piece The Insider neglects to alert viewers to the likelihoodthat the ABC lawsuit is weighing heavily on their minds At CBS as at ABCthe pressure to surrender seemed linked to a pending sale of the network AndThe Insider never shows that Wigand himself became a consultant to ABCslawyers on the libel suit            Its certainly possible these omissions were made because including themwould have made the plot less tidy But The Insider is a movie that asksyou to think hard about how corporate interests affect what mediacompanies do As it happens The Insider was made by Touchstone whichis a subsidiary of  Disney Did Disney lawyers demand the film notinclude any material that might remind viewers of ABCs cheesy surrender toPhilip Morris                        Chatterbox posed the question to Lowell Bergman the  Minutesproducer played by Pacino in the film who fought CBSs initial decision notto air the Wigand interview for fear of being sued Bergman who nowworks for Frontline and teaches journalism at Berkeley was a paidconsultant to the film As far as I know there was no pressure from Disneyof any kind he told Chatterbox Bergman said that an early version of thescript did allude to the Day One broadcast but it was cut outIf you look closer in the credits Bergman said you will see there is a setof acknowledgements that includes all the Day One people Bergman sayshe was the one who urged the films director Michael Mann to include this tipof the hat to Bogdanich and Co            Clifford Douglas an attorney and antitobacco activist has latelypublished letters in the Christian Science Monitor and the New York Post toutingBogdanich not Bergmanas the real journalist who lit the fuseof public outrage over tobacco As it happens Bogdanich is now a producer for  Minutes  A few days after Douglas letters appeared apronouncement quite similar to Douglas emanated from Don Hewitt in ArmyArcherds column in Daily Variety click here to read the whole thing                                             The real heroreporter of the tobacco wars is not Lowell Bergman butit was Walt Bogdanich now of  Minutes  who did the tobacco warswork for ABC news  Bogdanich refused to apologizeand came to work for Minutes                                        What Hewitt neglected to point out of course is that apologizing for aperfectly good piece of journalism is not so great a sin as preventing thatpiece of journalism from coming to light in the first place But the questionof why Disneys movie eliminated Bogdanich from its narrative remains anintriguing one             Chatterbox was himself at the time a Wall Street Journal reporteron the tobacco beat and could gripe about how The Insider didnt eventrouble itself to mis pronounce his own name But the narrative doesntreally dwell on the tobacco rulemaking process at the                Food and Drug Administration                which was Chatterboxspiece of the story Chatterbox will simply observe that the great American filmepic derived from the FederalRegister s fine print has yet to be realized                         We now agree that we should not have reported that Philip Morris andReynolds which had also sued add significant amounts of nicotine fromoutside sources That was a mistake that was not deliberate on the part of ABCbut for which we accept responsibility and which requires correction Weapologize to our audience Philip Morris and Reynolds
