        okay i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute  well credit cards boy thats an easy topic isnt it   okay okay is it yes it is  its one we all hold dear and near im sure   oh yes yes i guess ive had some good experience and some bad experience with them   yeah most of mines been pretty good although im i guess im like a lot of other people now im trying to to pay off my credit cards and ive done pretty good at it   uhhuh well i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want       you now not need want   yeah uhhuh there is a big difference   theres a big difference there   yeah yeah   but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline   yeah oh yeah i i do that i do that but the rest like i said the rest of them ive been trying to to pay off and uh get back on a cash basis except for gas its too easy to to run into the gas station   uhhuh oh it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way at least thats for me   yeah what you uhhuh yeah yeah   yeah   so   but yeah ive ive talked to some whos really had some bad experience and kind of knock on wood i havent yet not bad you know i just im just shocked at the end of the month   yeah well     to see what damage i have did but   yeah yeah     i try to keep it pretty reasonable   well ive been pretty lucky in that respect i dont charge like i say ive i been trying to to not charge except for emergencies   uhhuh   so but i havent really had any bad problems with credit cards theres you know they have uh wonderful features theyre there when you need them you know like in emergencies or whatever   yeah huh and then they have bad drawbacks too i mean high interest its like paying twice   yeah they talk talks with thats true thats true   yes so but   i try to i did switch to one uh sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest   oh uhhuh   yeah compared to some of the other ones and you dont have an annual fee there and that helps   yeah yeah oh yes uh we used to have you know like several but right now were just more or less at American Express you know and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in   yeah uhhuh yeah thats one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well ill just pay on it this month and   yeah pay fifteen yeah yes i know yeah and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time   yeah takes a long time thats right and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax thats you know   it sure does uhhuh   of course its been going down for a number of years but this is the last year you can take anything so   but yeah uhhuh   so   yeah well ive enjoyed talking to you   well ive enjoyed talking to you   and maybe well get to talk again okay byebye   okay byebye
