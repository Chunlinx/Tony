                    Synopsis                  Introduction          In RA large numbers of CD memory T cells infiltrate          the inflamed synovium     The accumulated CD          memory T cells in the RA synovium appear to be          activated because they express cytokines and activation          markers       Expressed cytokines and          activation markers should play important roles in the          pathogenesis of RA However the frequency of cytokine          expression by RA synovial CD T cells has not been          analyzed accurately Recently the roles of chemokine and          chemokine receptor interactions in Tcell migration have          been intensively examined Interactions of chemokine and          chemokine receptors might therefore be important in the          accumulation of the CD T cells in the RA synovium          Accordingly correlation of cytokine and chemokine          receptor expression might be important in delineating the          function and potential means of accumulation of          individual CD memory T cells in the RA synovium          In the present study we analyzed cytokine IL IL          IL IL IL IFN  TNF  and LT           activation marker CD CD ligand and TRANCE  also          called receptor activator of nuclear factor  B ligand          RANKL or osteoclast differentiation factor ODF and          chemokine receptor expression by individual CD memory T          cells isolated from rheumatoid synovium and blood To          achieve this we employed a singlecell reverse          transcription RT polymerase chain reaction PCR          technique This technique made it possible to correlate          mRNAs expressed by individual CD memory T cells in the          synovium and blood                          Materials and method          Synovial tissues from three RA patients and peripheral          blood mononuclear cells from two RA patients and a normal          donor were analyzed          Cytokine IL IL IL IL IL IFN          TNF and LT  and activation marker CD and          TRANCE expression by individual CD CDRO T cells          from RA synovium or blood were analyzed using a          singlecell RTPCR In brief single CD CDRO T cells          was sorted into each well of a well PCR plate using a          flow cytometer cDNA from individual cells was prepared          and then the cDNA was nonspecifically amplified The          product was then amplified by PCR using genespecific          primers to analyze cytokine and activation marker          expression                          Results          Cytokine and activation marker expression by          individual CD CDRO T cells from RA synovial tissues          was analyzed using a singlecell RTPCR method          Expression of mRNAs was analyzed in  individual          synovial tissue CD CDRO T cells sorted from three RA          patients in which Tcell receptor TCR C mRNA was          detected Frequencies of CD memory T cells expressing          cytokine and activation marker mRNA in RA synovium are          shown in Table  IL IL and IL were not expressed          by the synovial tissue CD CDRO T cells whereas           of cells expressed the other cytokine mRNAs          Few correlations between cytokine and activation          marker mRNAs were observed Notably no cells contained          both IFN and LT mRNAs cytokines that are thought to          define the Thelper Th phenotype   However the          frequency of TRANCEpositive cells in ILpositive          cells was significantly higher than that in          ILnegative cells Table  Moreover the frequency          of TRANCEpositive cells in TNFpositive cells was also          significantly higher than that in TNFnegative          cells          Varying percentages of CD memory T cells expressed          CC and CXC chemokine receptors The frequency of          CCRpositive cells in IFNpositive cells was          significantly higher than that in IFNnegative cells          whereas the frequency of CCRpositive cells in          LTpositive cells was significantly higher than that in          LTnegative cells and the frequency of CCRpositive          cells in ILpositive cells was significantly higher          than that in ILnegative cells Furthermore the          frequency of CXCRpositive cells in TRANCEpositive          cells was significantly higher than that in          TRANCEnegative cells          Expression of cytokine and activation marker mRNAs was          also analyzed in  individual peripheral blood CD          CDRO T cells from two RA patients IL IL IL          and LT were not expressed by the peripheral CD CDRO          T cells whereas  of cells expressed the other          markers The most striking difference between synovial          tissue and peripheral blood CD memory T cells was the          presence of LT expression in the former but not in the          latter IFN and TNF were not expressed by normal          peripheral blood CD memory T cells although they were          expressed by RA peripheral blood CD memory T cells                          Discussion          The present study employed a singlecell PCR          technology to analyze cytokine expression by unstimulated          RA synovial tissue CD memory T cells immediately after          isolation without           in vitro manipulation The results          confirm the Th nature of rheumatoid inflammation It is          noteworthy that no individual synovial CD memory T          cells expressed both IFN and LT mRNAs even though          these are the prototypic Th cytokines   These          results imply that in the synovium regulation of IFN          and LT must vary in individual cells even though both          Th cytokines can be produced          The present data showed that CCR expression          correlated with IFN but not with LT expression by          synovial CD memory T cells It has been reported that          CCR expression is upregulated in RA synovial fluid and          synovial tissue T cells     and that CCR            deletion may have an influence on clinical manifestations          of RA   suggesting that CCR might play an important          role in RA Recently it has been claimed that CCR was          preferentially expressed by Th cell lines             However in the present study CCR was not expressed by          all IFNexpressing cells Moreover CCR expression did          not correlate with expression of LT by RA synovial CD          memory T cells Therefore it is unclear whether CCR is          a marker of Th cells in RA synovium          IL expression correlated with CCR expression by RA          synovial CD memory T cells Recently it was reported            that in the blood CCR CD memory T cells express          lymphnode homing receptors and lack immediate effector          function but efficiently stimulate dendritic cells          These cells may play a unique role in the synovium as          opposed to in the blood By producing IL they might          have an immunoregulatory function In addition IL          expression also correlated with expression of TRANCE          Although it is possible that IL produced by these          cells inhibited Tcell activation in the synovium TRANCE          expressed by these same cells might function to activate          dendritic cells and indirectly stimulate T cells          mediating inflammation in the synovium These results          imply that individual T cells in the synovium might have          different and sometimes opposite functional          activities          LT expression correlated with CCR expression by          synovial CD memory T cells It has been reported that          CCR is expressed by resting peripheral memory T cells            whereas LT expression is associated with the          presence of lymphocytic aggregates in synovial tissue            The correlation between the expression of these two          markers therefore suggests the possibility that CCR may          play a role in the development of aggregates of CD T          cells that are characteristically found in rheumatoid          synovium          TRANCE is known to be expressed by activated T cells          and can stimulate dendritic cells and osteoclasts            Of note TRANCEmediated activation of osteoclasts has          recently been shown   to play an important role in          the damage to bone that is found in experimental models          of inflammatory arthritis It is therefore of interest          that TRANCE was expressed by  of the RA synovial CD          memory T cells Of note  of TNFpositive cells          expressed TRANCE In concert TNF and TRANCE expressed          by this subset of CD memory T cells might make them          particularly important in mediating the bony erosions          that are characteristic of RA          Interestingly there was a correlation between          expression of IFN and IL in RA peripheral blood CD          memory T cells In RA peripheral blood CD expression          correlated with that of CXCR by CD memory T cells It          has been claimed   that CXCR is preferentially          expressed by           in vitro generated Th cells          However in the present study CXCR did not correlate          with IFN expression Although IFN and TNF mRNAs          were expressed           in vivo by peripheral blood CD T          cells from RA patients LT mRNA was not detected          whereas IFN  TNF  and LT were not detected in          samples from healthy donors These findings indicate that          RA peripheral blood CD memory T cells are stimulated           in vivo  although they do not          express LT mRNA The present studies indicate that the          frequencies of CD memory T cells that expressed IFN          in the blood and in the synovium are comparable These          results imply that activated CD memory T cells migrate          between blood and synovium although the direction of the          trafficking is unknown The presence of LT mRNA in          synovium but not in blood indicates that CD memory          cells are further activated in the synovium and that          these activated CD memory T cells are retained in the          synovium until LT mRNA decreases          In conclusion CD memory T cells are biased toward          Th cells in RA synovium and peripheral blood In the          synovium IFN and LT were produced by individual          cells whereas in the rheumatoid blood no LTproducing          cells were detected Furthermore there were modest          correlations between individual cells that expressed          particular cytokines such as IL and certain          chemokine receptor mRNAs                            Introduction        In RA large numbers of CD memory T cells infiltrate        the inflamed synovium     The accumulated CD        memory T cells in the RA synovium appear to be activated        because they express cytokines and activation markers              Expressed cytokines and activation markers        should play important roles in the pathogenesis of RA        However the frequency of cytokine expression by RA        synovial CD T cells has not been analyzed accurately        Recently the roles of chemokine and chemokine receptor        interactions in Tcell migration have been intensively        examined Interactions of chemokine and chemokine receptors        might therefore be important for the accumulation of the T        cells in the RA synovium Accordingly correlation of        cytokine and chemokine receptor expression might be        important in delineating the function and potential means        of accumulation of individual CD memory T cells in the RA        synovium        In order to analyze cytokine activation marker and        chemokine receptor expression by individual CD memory T        cells we used a singlecell RTPCR technique The method        made it possible to analyze cytokine and chemokine receptor        expression by individual RA synovial CD memory T cells        without         in vitro stimulation and to        correlate cytokine and chemokine receptor expression        Using this technique we analyzed cytokine IL IL        IL IL IL IFN TNF and LT activation        marker CD CD ligand and TRANCE  also called        receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand RANKL or        osteoclast differentiation factor ODF and chemokine        receptor expression by individual CD memory T cells        isolated from rheumatoid synovium and blood The results        indicate that CD memory T cells are biased toward Th        cells in RA synovium although individual cells produced        IFN or LT but not both A similar pattern of cytokine        production was observed with CD memory T cells from RA        blood with the exception that no cells expressing LT        were detected There were modest correlations between        individual cells that expressed particular cytokine and        chemokine receptor mRNAs                    Materials and method                  Specimens          Synovial tissues were obtained at surgery from three          RA patients The synovial tissue was minced and incubated          with  mgml

there were no differences between chemokine receptor          expressions by synovial tissue and peripheral blood CD          memory T cells In peripheral blood CD memory T cells          there was a significant correlation between IFN and          IL expressions and IFN and CCR expressions            P  Table  In addition          CD and CXCR expressions correlated            P  No other correlations          were detected data not shown                            Discussion        The present study employed singlecell PCR technology to        analyze cytokine mRNA expressions by

   inflammation These data showed that  of RA synovial        CD memory T cells produced IFN mRNA Previous studies            reported that  of RA synovial T cells        expressed IFN protein by immunohistologic analysis        Although there is some variation in the results obtained        with the different methodologies both results are        consistent with the conclusion that there is a Th bias in        RA    It is noteworthy that no individual synovial        CD memory T cells expressed both IFN and LT mRNA        even though these are the prototypic Th cytokines          These

not        correlate with expression of LT by RA synovial CD        memory T cells although it correlated with IFN         Therefore it is unclear whether CCR is a marker of Th        cells in RA synovium        Of RA synovial CD T cells  expressed IL and        the expression correlated with CCR expression It has been        reported that approximately  of synovial T cells        express IL by immunohistochemistry   and that  of        synovial CD T cells have the potential to express IL          Recently it was reported   that in the blood        CCR CD memory T cells express lymphnode homing        receptors and lack immediate effector function but        efficiently stimulate dendritic cells However because         of RA tissue CD memory T cells expressed CCR and there        was a correlation between IL production and CCR        expression these cells may play a unique role in the        synovium as opposed to in the blood By producing IL        they may exert an immunoregulatory function In addition        it is interesting to note that IL expression also        correlated with expression of TRANCE Although it is        possible that IL produced by these cells inhibited        Tcell activation in the synovium TRANCE expressed by        these same cells might function to activate dendritic cells        and indirectly stimulate T cells mediating inflammation in        the synovium These results imply that individual T cells        in the synovium might have different and sometimes        opposite functional activities        LT was expressed by  of the synovial CD memory        T cells and the expression correlated with CCR        expression which is expressed by  of the synovial CD        memory T cells However there were no LTexpressing CD        T cells that also produced IFN although synovial CD        memory T cells that produced each cytokine were found in        abundance It has been reported that CCR is expressed by        resting peripheral memory T cells   whereas LT        expression is associated with the presence of lymphocytic        aggregates in synovial tissue   The correlation between        the expression of these two markers therefore suggests the        possibility that CCR might play a role in the development        of aggregates of CD T cells that are characteristically        found in rheumatoid synovium        TRANCE is known to be expressed by activated T cells        and can stimulate dendritic cells and osteoclasts   Of        note TRANCEmediated activation of osteoclasts has        recently been shown   to play an important role in the        damage to bone found in experimental models of inflammatory        arthritis Recently the presence of TRANCE in rheumatoid        synovium was reported    It is therefore of        interest that TRANCE was expressed by  of the RA        synovial CD memory T cells Of note TRANCE expression        correlated with IL TNF and CXCR expressions        Especially noteworthy was that  of TNFpositive cells        expressed TRANCE In concert TNF and TRANCE expressed by        this subset of CD memory T cells might make them        particularly important in mediating the bony erosions that        are characteristic of RA        Interestingly there was a correlation between        expression of IFN and IL in RA peripheral blood CD        memory T cells Production of IL in humans differs from        that in the mouse in that IL production does not appear        to be restricted to Th cells   As noted here RA        peripheral CD T cells could express both IFN and IL        In RA peripheral blood CD expression correlated with        CXCR by CD memory T cells It has been claimed          that CXCR was preferentially expressed by         in vitro generated Th cells        However in the present study CXCR did not correlate with        IFN expression Although IFN and TNF mRNAs were        expressed         in vivo by peripheral blood CD T        cells from RA patients LT mRNA was not detected whereas        IFN TNF and LT were not detected from healthy        donors These findings indicate that RA peripheral blood        CD memory T cells are stimulated         in vivo  but that they do not        express LT mRNA Previous studies have documented the        presence of IFN and IL mRNA in circulating T cells of        RA patients    The present studies indicate that        the frequency of CD memory T cells that express IFN in        the blood and synovium is comparable although the        percentages that secrete IFN are not known These results        imply that activated CD memory T cells migrate between        blood and synovium although the direction of the        trafficking is unknown The presence of LT mRNA in        synovium but not in blood indicates that CD memory cells        are further activated in the synovium and that these        activated CD memory T cells are retained in the synovium        until LT mRNA decreases        In conclusion CD memory T cells are biased toward Th        cells in RA synovium and peripheral blood In the synovium        IFN and LT were produced by individual cells whereas        in the rheumatoid blood no LTproducing cells were        detected Furthermore there were modest correlations        between individual cells that expressed particular        cytokines and certain chemokine receptor mRNAs
