                                 Anticipation            When my friend Ralph Cohen announced that his wifewas pregnant I asked what path he hoped his child would follow It doesntmatter said Ralph If hes happy Ill be happy Then after a thoughtfulpause he added My personal preference is shortstop But anything he wants todo is fine with me Then after a longer pause As long as its in theinfield            Thats the difference between ordinary altruismwhere you care about other peoples happiness though perhaps not as urgentlyas you care about your own and what Ill call imperfect altruism where youreserve the right to care about how others achieve their happiness            We all feel altruistic toward our own futureselves Thats why we make current sacrifices for future rewards But whichkind of altruists are we Traditional economic theory says were the ordinarykindwe want to be happy in the future though perhaps not as urgently as wewant to be happy in the present David Laibson a professor of politicaleconomy at Harvard is one of a few iconoclasts who disagree Nobody doubtsthat we are imperfectly altruistic toward others Laibson argues that we can beimperfectly altruistic toward ourselves And just as imperfect altruism towardyour children can cause conflict in your family imperfect altruism toward yourfuture self can cause conflict in your soul            Heres an exampleEveryone knows that a taste for expensive pleasures can ruin your life But ataste for anticipating expensive pleasures can ruin your life in a farmore interesting way If your greatest joy in life is looking forward totomorrows extravagance youve got a problem Tomorrow is a moving target OnMonday you plan a lavish party for Tuesday when Tuesday arrives you indulgeyour preference for anticipation by postponing the party till Wednesday Thepostponements continue until you die and leave a large estate            The tragedy here is not that you never get to spend yourmoney The tragedy is that you never even get to anticipate spendingyour money because youre smart enough to foresee the whole sequence of eventseven before it unfolds If you love looking forward to parties and if you knowyou love looking forward to parties then you can never look forward to aparty Maybe this was what Bertolt Brecht meant when he said his life had beenruined by intelligence            The solution if you can manage it is to plan aparty that cant be postponed Pay the caterer well in advance and be sure tochoose one who will penalize you heavily for a lastminute cancellation            I suffer from a minor butaggravating form of this affliction I avoid reading really good books becauseit robs me of the pleasure of looking forward to them Of course knowing thisabout myself I never get to look forward to them either Air travel has beenmy salvation I force myself to read good books by trapping myself with them onairplanes If they ever upgrade those inflight magazines into a plausiblereading alternative Ill be ruined            My friend Ray Heitmann suffers from the equal and oppositeproblem Instead of looking forward to extravagance he likes to anticipate hisown future frugality He particularly enjoys believing that after a certainage he wont spend resources to prolong his own life But hes painfully awarethat the certain age keeps getting redefined so its always safely in thefuture Therefore hes looking for ways to limit his own future freedom ofchoice            If Ray cared only abouthis own future happiness or to put it another way if Ray were perfectlyaltruistic toward his future self then you could fairly accuse him ofinconsistency Limiting your choices cant make you happier But Ray cares alsoabout how he achieves his future happiness which makes him an imperfectaltruist but a consistent one If your altruism is imperfect you can wantyour future self to throw a party or to read a book or to forgo expensivemedical care or for that matter to save money or to quit smoking even thoughyou know your future self would prefer otherwise            When Dorothy Parker lamented that I hate writing but Ilove having written she was expressing the sort of routine tradeoff betweencurrent costs and future benefits that fits right into the traditional economicframework Laibsons imperfect altruists face a far subtler problemtheyrenot just weighing costs and benefits theyre engaged in games of strategyagainst their future selves            That suggests a newanswer to a question I raised in this space a few months ago namely  Mysuggestion then was that the lock resolves a conflict between you who believethat a hot fudge sundae is worth the calories and your mate or potential matewho believes otherwise According to Laibson the conflict is not between youand your mate but between youtoday and youtomorrow I dont know whichtheory is right but I do know that the door locks remain inexplicable unlessyou are in conflict with someone  If all you want for your future selfis happiness and if theres no third party involved there can be no goodreason to restrict your future options            Professors Per Krusell and Anthony Smith point out thatLaibsons theory makes some surprising predictions about the way people saveSuppose you want to be frugal in the future If youre a pessimist and donttrust your future self to be frugal then you might as well spend all yourmoney today so it doesnt fall into the hands of that future spendthrift Butif youre an optimist and expect to practice future selfcontrol youll beinclined to save your money and pass it along into your own future good handsEither behavior is selfreinforcing from one year to the next Socontrary towhat were told by orthodox economic theorytwo individuals with exactly thesame preferences and exactly the same opportunities can adopt dramaticallydifferent attitudes toward saving            If you enjoy contemplating your own futureextravagance as opposed to frugality then KrusellSmith reasoning suggestssomething even more bizarre The more you expect to be extravagant in thefuture the more youll save to finance that future extravagance But as soonas you realize youre a saver youll lose confidence in your futureextravagance and figure you might as well spend your money today At thatpoint you realize youre a spender and you go back to saving Yourexpectations about the future and the behavior that stems from them couldfluctuate wildly            Why would human beings have Laibsonstylepreferences in the first place Heres a wild speculation Laibsonstylepreferences lead to visible attempts at selfcontrol and visible attempts atselfcontrol are reassuring to potential mates hence favored by naturalselection If that speculation stands up to some reasonable tests say acomputer simulation of resource competition among individuals with evolvingpreferences it could tie the two refrigeratorlock theories together into asingle neat package
