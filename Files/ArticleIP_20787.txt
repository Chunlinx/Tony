                                 God Said quotUghquot            Andrew Kevin Walker thescreenwriter of Seven  and of the new snufffilm thrillerMM  must have grown up watching hundreds of hours of kinky detectiveshows My guess is that they left him aroused but essentially ungratifiedWalker has made his fortune by packing in all the maggoty sadistic detailsthat the creators of Hunter and The Commish left to theimagination and that even such coolly clinical cop series as The XFilesand Homicide have opted to leaven with reminders of the fundamentalbeneficence of humankind Walkers cleancut detective heroes Brad Pitt inSeven  Nicolas Cage in MM  embark on odysseys into the netherregion where they view atrocity after atrocity before arriving at the sourcean evil that is pure unrepentant and infectious You can lop off its headbut the skull goes on grinning serenely confident that it has passed on itsdisease to its slayer            David FinchersSeven thrust Walkers worldview into your viscera I can still recallthat films gun battle set in a long corridor with its slingshot angles andbullets that seemed to explode beside your head and the ghastly sight bothriveting and repellent of a partially flayed obese corpse its milky whiteblubber framing intestines that looked like blue balloons Joel Schumacher thedirector of MM  has none of Finchers graphic originality but thematerial still carries a lurid charge Cage plays Tom Welles an earnestprofessionally polite private investigator summoned to the manse of a recentlydeceased tycoon The elderly widow Myra Carter has discovered in a safe an millimeter film that appears to document the murder of a young woman Theappalled widow needs to know if the killing is real or simulated and handsWelles the financial resources he needs to ferret out the filmmakers and theirpossibly unfortunate leading lady            Leaving his harried wife Catherine Keener and infantdaughter in wintry Pennsylvania the detective travels from Cleveland to NorthCarolina to the subterranean SM parlors of Los Angeles to a production officein the meat market of New York City What he sees twists Cages hitherto pokerface into an increasingly Eastwoodesque grimace His eyes bulge His monotoneverges on the point of exploding into hundreds of hysterical semitones Hestops taking calls from his wife always clutching the baby on his cell phoneA wisecracking porn shop clerk Joaquin Phoenix whom Welles has hired as atour guide delivers the films thematic warning There are things that yousee that you cant unsee that get into your head  Before you know ityoure in it deep in it  Dance with the devil and the devil dont changethe devil changes you I wont spell out where MM leads but trust methere are no surprises As in Seven  there are devils and they dance andeveryone gets down And down And down            Schumacher  Batman Robin   a onetime costume designer and art director usuallyexhibits the aesthetic of an interior decorator his pictures boasting the mostcluttered mise en scnes Ive ever mise en seen Im impressedthat in MM he has managed to muzzle his fruitier impulses and work in achill strippeddown style reverting to form only in the black leather pornobasements and his characteristically semicoherent action scenes The ambienceisnt as clammy as Finchers in Seven  but its dank enough with eerieintimations of a demon lying in wait The score by Mychael Danna featuresfaraway muezzin wailscalls that could be emanating from the girl in theflickering movie whos about to be slain She stares doeeyed into the cameralike the naked waif in Edvard Munchs Puberty  who seems just at thatinstant to realize her true vulnerability            It gets to you this moviegets you titillated thenspooked then suffused with righteous fury Murderous fury Its only after thepicture ends that you realize that Welles hasnt really danced with thedevil at least not by the standards of vigilante movies He doesnt get asexual charge out of the brutality nor does he develop a penchant fortorturing innocents Apart from his stricken expressions and a couple of nastywounds theres nothing even to suggest that hes damned by taking justice intohis own hands If ever bad guys deserved to be executed its the bad guys inMM  They promise theyre going to torture and kill the heros wife andbaby daughter they cast aspersions on his masculinity they sneer at thenotion that anyone would care about their victims Its up to Welles to say Icare BLAM Whats to feel guilty about            Movies like MMmake me appreciate what Paul Schrader tried to do when he chose to bringRussell Banks novel Affliction to the screen Having written TaxiDriver  and Hardcore  and other vigilante pictures inwhich the underlying motives of the avenger are called into question Schraderembraced the story of a vigilante who turns out to be dead wrong driven mad byan increasing sense of his own impotence in a world that has left him behindSchumacher worked with similar themes in the poorly thought through FallingDown  in which Michael Douglas has a spell of road rage and doesntcool off Next to these films the moral contortions of MM seemespecially bogus a sadomasochistic peep show booth pretending to be aconfessional            The test of a piece of storytelling is whether its audiencecan forget that its listening to a historysomething in the past tenseandenter the living present That doesnt happen in God Said Ha JuliaSweeneys film of her own onewoman show The subject is cancerSweeneys latebrothers and then her own Sweeney stands in the middle of the stage and tellsthe offscreen but audible audience how her brother got sick and took upresidence in her small Hollywood house and how her parents moved down fromSpokane Wash and threw her life into an uproar She comes off as extremelysmart and likableand she looks better than she did on Saturday NightLive  with the soft face and sensuous blue eyes of Elizabeth McGovern Hermonologue has some funny dislocating observations the unsophisticated ways ofher folks juxtaposed against her newly acquired yuppie tastes her need tosneak around like a teenager when a boyfriend comes to stay and especiallyher dislocation when after taking her brother to the hospital forchemotherapy she finds herself suddenly playing his part as if she saysshes at a square dance            But God SaidHawhich has won praise for Sweeneys artistry and candoris the sortof work that gives oneperson shows their bad rap Few of the good bits flowtogether nothing builds Its mostly one thing after another I went herethen I went there then I went to a bookstore and cut a big fart and someone Ididnt remember from the Groundlings recognized me then I tossed a cigarette Iwasnt supposed to be smoking out the car window and then noticed that the backseat was on fire and then  Occasionally she turns to look intoanother cameraa move that unintentionally evokes the old Chevy Chase WeekendUpdate shtickbut the movie is otherwise static and the lines sound as ifshe has said them hundreds of times before            Sweeney tells instead of shows declining to haul out thebig gunsher immense comic giftsto put her characters across I have afeeling she must think it would be vulgar to get too showbizzy too gonzo tooSaturday Night Live ish with this material given that its about hushcancer But then why do it Whats the point of going out in front of anaudience with a tale of illness if shes not going to bring all her imaginativeresources to bear on itto transform it into something that transcends itsrelatively routine particulars and gives us something to hold onto when ourtime for tragedy comes            Julia Sweeney chose to take the story of herbrothers illness and hers to the stage and then the screen Pauline Kael madeno such decision which is why Rushmore director Wes Andersons NewYork Times account of visiting the retired New Yorker critic
