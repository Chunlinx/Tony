a new addition to the family so to speak we also have a fish   oh my   its a mud dog   i beg your pardon   its a mud dog its uh   oh   a cross between a catfish and uh i dont know what a salamander   well did you all catch it or uh   uhhuh we have a cat Stripper   uhhuh   oh the mud dog   no did no did you catch the fish   uh we had a friend give it to us   uhhuh and its all alone in that aquarium   yeah wed like to get him a friend but um uh we havent found one yet so how about you do you have any pets   well at the present time i have two dogs   oh really what kind   an English setter you know thats the white dog with the feathers and it has uh yellow spots on it   uhhuh   which they call i think uh liver spots   uhhuh   and thats a male and i have a wonderful female lab black lab   uhhuh how long have you had them   quite a long time uh probably five or six years and unfortunately the black lab thats a female it that its its the most wonderful animal weve ever had an i when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having problems uh problems limping and so forth and   uhhuh   she has hip dysplasia   oh no   and its in that breed   uhhuh   but now i think there are tests that can be conducted uh to tell whether or not the puppies have the have it   uhhuh   but i think i dont know apparently theyve been so in well i dont know inbred or what but   oh is that right   well no im not sure thats the situation but it um for those dogs that are registered and if if you should have one uh that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it uh   huh i had no idea i hadnt didnt even know that   uhhuh but shes wonderful   um our dog Joey has uh a back problem   um like have   uh he hes got a bad back but hes seven uh i guess hes about almost eight years old   what are the what are the symptoms   um he just uh he doesnt he uh you he rolls over he doesnt like to roll over   uhhuh   um even you just when you touch him a certain way on the back   yes   but otherwise he can jump uh you know just as long as he doesnt bend a certain way   um well uh i have had just wonderful luck with this lab uh when i uh lets see winter before last we would bring her in and uh when it was cold   uhhuh   and she wouldnt i you know the next morning you want to take them out and she wouldnt i couldnt get her up without picking picking her up and which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds   i bet   um until if i allowed her to not get up on her own itd be two oclock in the afternoon   uhhuh   anyway i uh met my sons uh college roommate is a vet   uhhuh   and he said um lets give her some race horse shots and you know in im im kind of glad to be able to tell people about this but you because you all the time you know run into people with problems   oh yeah   anyway thats when we lived in Oklahoma and uh so he gave this dog a series of  its they give it to race horses uh to get rid of uh cartilage   uhhuh   and its called  anyway its a series of six shots once a week and then i noticed after two shots she was   do you have to give those   well i could have but i cant give a shot   oh i believe me i understand   i took her from Enid Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six weeks   uh   and uh after the the second shot she was significantly better then i didnt notice any improvement till the after the sixth one   uhhuh   and ever since and he said uh a booster uh every year or two   uhhuh   i mean maybe every six months or or something like that and when i notice in the winter when its worse you know its cold weather and so forth then i have uh gotten a booster for her but not many people in this part of the country know anything about   um   ive had to get it from Oklahoma theyve heard about it but theyve really never used it   uhhuh yeah ive never heard anything about it either   so dogs that get down in the hips like i think German Shepherds do it and probably large dogs   uhhuh   and uh its just wonderful   does he get is he an inside dog also or does he just run out in the backyard is he fenced in   uh um um well were living now in an area where we we were in the woods and we take walks i just dont let them   oh yeah   uh uh go away from me but we take walks through the woods twice a day   uhhuh uhhuh oh thats nice   and uh i can over do it on her   oh yeah   but anyway at least she can go and shes not limping along and all that   uhhuh   tell me about your cat   oh Stripper well he started out being a little orphan and we we took him in and uh hes about two years old now and he loves his treats uh both uh Joey and uh Stripper get treats and uh lets see   and is um Stripper an inside cat or outside   o h well hes outside and uh   uhhuh   hes got a way to get in hes got free access of a window we like to keep open   yes   so he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to   well of course  thats nice they they     Joey on the other hand is a little different he has to go out whenever uh we ask him and when he when we ask him he uh he barks hell either bark for food or hell bark to go out and hell tell you which one he wants   well hes been   hes been through obedience school   well he has been trained and youve keep youve kept up it up havent you   oh definitely   yeah it is wonderful i i have some neighbors across the field and um they when we first moved here uh when the dogs and i didnt feed we have a very nice kennel and everything but but since i i didnt want to i was i just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while   uhhuh   so i kept watch and never let them get away but now every couple weeks they would one would slip away and my neighbor said to me oh i noticed those dogs dogs are so well trained anytime they hear your voice they come so that made me very proud   oh yeah   well have we been talking five minutes   im not for sure   im not either but   i think maybe we have but   yeah well um so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure   oh definitely have you ever done this before   yes   oh okay um i havent ever called ive put in the paper work i just never made the call   oh really uhhuh   yeah so i didnt know if they stop you when the time is up or   no they dont no i i glanced at the clock when um we started and i think its been probably about five and a half minutes or something but one day i was talking to a lady about gardening and im i love gardening and she did too an and after   uhhuh   after about twelve minutes or something the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape     oh  well at least you know you did your part   uhhuh but its been so much fun too uh talk     how did you get into this   well my best friend in Virginias daughter is a part of this project in Texas   oh i see   and so she knew that i had the time and would be would enjoy it   uhhuh thats true   um   i mean i   so but i have a hard time getting anybody because i guess do you work   um yes i do   yeah and probably just got home   uhhuh   so um

he yeah i need to ive got some applications i need to hand them out but uh this is a great project that theyre working on and its really going to lead the way uh for a lot of economics um applications and and   yes   development in the voice area   yes when i think so too and i havent helped them out on the men on men particularly but my husband had been made in fact hes been probably has made a few more calls than i have because i tend to not make them around dinner time i try to   uhhuh   you know make them do during the day but nobodys home   well this is the perfect time for me well maybe ill get you next time   well good yeah it so fun much fun to talk to you   all right have a good one   you too bye   bye
