absurd proportionsorganization with great power to affect well everyone  It issymptomatic of the decay of accountability and legitimacy in ostensiblydemocratic peoplecentered government            This is a major issue and its not going to getplay if a few loud activists dont make noise and force corporate media to atleast take note even as they reel out the tired Friedmanesque line that

    Date Wed Dec             Yes and no to both Gerald Earlys and DavidNicolsons reviews Yes the book as a whole is insufferably smug with CornelWest at the head of the smirking line and politically correct Yes itschoices are trendy and will date it badly and quickly In this it is very muchlike another Microsoft product the new Encarta Dictionary  Thedictionary and its style guide would make Mrs Grundy proud They cite asobjectionable three times as many words as any other dictionary damningevery word that any small political group anywhere has ever criticized Thestyle guide suggests not using homosexual although it gives no usablealternative it labels cancer patient as offensive and recommends patientwith cancer as the proper phrasing            However the personal criticism of Henry LouisGates is in my opinion overdone Gates wants to and has succeeded in hisprofession That isnt a bad thing He has done so by hard work by doing a lotof worthy editing and literary criticism He wants to read and know everythingmuch like Diderot to whom Early compares him Thats admirable not aweakness Sheath the claws            To reply clickhere                            SubjectPlagiarized Obits

the Washington Post and New YorkTimes obituaries of the same person containing an identical paragraphDoesnt that probably just mean that the paragraph came from a wire servicethat both papers subscribe to probably the Associated Press If so thatsnot plagiarismwhile I dont know this my guess is that agreements betweennewspapers and the AP or other wire services let the papers do pretty muchwhatever they want with the wire copy The episode involving a BaltimoreSun music critic on the other hand does sound more like plagiarism so Idont see that the cases are alike            To reply

size of that of an operating system            Ewww That is only true if you accept the Microsoftpremise that welding a graphical user interface GUI onto an operating systemleaves you with a bigger better operating system OSa proposal which isnot universally accepted by the computer programming community at largeA browsers source is small because it uses the functions of the GUI InUNIXLinux the OS isnt tightly bound to a GUI hence Linuxs greaterconfigurability for specific tasks as well as its potential for more than oneGUI This is the real problem with Windows Its much more than an operatingsystem its an OS DOS or NT inextricably meshed with a GUI MSWindowsMost of the size of the Windows basic installation software are details foraddon services to the OS many of which go unused            An OS is not a GUI and a GUI is not an OS evenwhen their coding is intertwined The size of the OS in the context of codesource or object is the size essential to execute files For Windows thatamounts to a DOS layer the minimum required for complete if not prettycontrol about k of object code on disk In Linux its a kernel withenough support to maintain a command console something around k RememberBoth of these OSs can boot from floppies            Browsers as mentioned dont have to be very bigeither if they have a rich set of GUI features to draw from Its the dressyWindows GUI that takes up all the space on your disk Yes you have it yes youinstalled it with the OSbut the GUI isnt the OS Even at Microsoft theGUI and the OS are coded by separate different teams of programmers
