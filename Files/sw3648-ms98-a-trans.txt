                 uh subject is gun control uh do you own any guns   yeah uh besides a a a BB gun no um a lot of my family owns a lot of guns and stuff and i i have a lot of friends that do also a lot of my friends are really into guns as far as knowing the specifications of every gun there is just about   yeah yeah i know the sort im not much into guns myself either i dont know i enjoy working with them from time to time but   yeah yeah   um personal opinion theres a whole lot of weapons available on the market that really shouldnt be available at all   yeah thats thats my opinion is that some of these high powered handguns need to go out the window because theyre obviously not for hunting   um yeah theyve got   and a handgun was never designed for hunting   well very few of them it they do make some for bird hunting but still those arent real high powered theyre just you know small caliber with a long barrel on them   yeah yeah   but uh no these and and these assault weapons with real short stock short barrels and   yeah these these the the nine millimeter the nine millimeter Glock to to top the charts   armor piercing ammunition   its a its a plastic automatic weapon that fires   yeah they sell them here at WalMart three different models of Glock yeah   WalMart wow wow   WalMart sporting goods department here in town carries carries the Glock   hm   they havent got the the latest version but uh theyve got them   yeah   something like seventeen rounds in a double wide clip   seventeen seventeen rounds of clip that fires by itself   craziness like that practically yeah   did did you hear about the the killing spree in Colleen over here in Texas   no no i didnt   we had a guy that went through a Lubys in Colleen and like killed twenty three people and injured a hundred plus others   Lubys   and then killed himself   whats a Lubys   uh its a cafeteria or restaurant   oh wait yeah uh uh thats been several months ago   yeah several several months ago yeah   okay yeah i did hear about that and they werent the least bit sure what happened what what set him off   thats thats what well nobody really knows what it was it was they determined that it was a a series of events over the years of some sort form of hatred of women and thats why he was mostly shooting women   oh see i hadnt heard anything about you know what the bulk of his victims were but   uh he was just a wacko   yeah   but that shows you what a a a Glock automatic weapon will do   thats what he was using   yeah he had that and uh one other gun which i dont recall what it was   was it a rifle or a pistol   but the Glock oh the other gun it was another handgun   no no the the other gun okay no i hadnt i i hadnt heard what it was he was carrying all i knew is hed been in there shooting i hadnt heard any about what he was carrying   yeah it was thats what it was he went around putting holes in anything he wanted to at whatever rate of speed he felt like     yeah i do know they have uh fast uh fast recovery   yeah   uh goodness well uh they   i i i also agree with the uh the seven day wait on handguns thats a   yeah probably ought to be longer than that really   yeah   seven is probably as long as you can expect the law to to require   yeah at at the moment they want seven days and thats you know thats the best thing we got to work with go for it   yeah seven day wait waiting period and the check through the FBI files and   yeah because i i really cant understand why these legislatures wanna fight it unless they just dont have anything better to do   yeah yeah       they ought to carry they ought anybody with a permit to carry a gun uh you ought to have a permit for any kind of gun you carry period   yeah   whether its pistol or rifle or it doesnt matter and the permit you ought a ought to be required to keep it in your billfold at all times whether you got your gun with you or not like a drivers license   yeah you should have a a a permit to use it and a uh be trained on how to use it   yeah uh its part of the problem with guns in general they got hundreds out there you know the only experience they got is the you know the last couple times they got about half looped and went out and the gun and went out in the woods and started blowing up bottles   yep   every hunting season scares the stew out of me even just to drive by a section of woods bothers me a little bit because i know theres maniacs out there the first couple of days   um yeah my my dad has borrowed a uh thirty thirty from uh his uh nephew and is supposed to go hunting and i im really really kind of nervous about it myself because i dont want him to   yeah   go out there and get hurt   hm later on in the season it gets to be less of a problem especially
