cool   but we watch it like every day but i like late night we dont watch uh what we do is we stay up until around one thirty and then they show the Twilight Zone at one thirty   uhhuh     and so we just stay and watch that   Twilight Zone rules man Twilight Zone rules   the what yeah   thats all   i used i used to live in the house that the guy owned   are you serious   yeah it was really it was really oh well it was all full with uh shelves everywhere and we didnt have enough books to fill it up but   thats psychedelic   but uh so what what do you like why do you like David Letterman   oh he

   and he goes do you want to dance i turn around and go what he goes do you want to dance i go no no he goes oh oh im sorry i go yeah you better be i go you better be so     thats hilarious     but okay so did wait do you watch Saturday Night Live yesterday   no it with the uh who was on the music people wasnt that Fishbone yeah i saw that it was awesome but i didnt see the rest of it   yeah no oh you missed Waynes World Waynes World was pretty cool   are you serious theyre awesome   so uh lets see what else uh see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the TV   oh really   because we dont want to do anything like study or anything so all the all we do is turn like like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the TV set you know   yeah that sucks really uh kind of annoying but thats cool   what   kind of annoying to like in front of TV like trying to do homework you know   yeah   trying to write an essay you start talking about you know like In Living Color or something i dont know     well i i like i i just i just bogused on all my homework so it really didnt matter   cool yeah BS thats the way to do it     yeah i know and i did that all through college and it worked too     cool yeah works for me     so uh lets see what else like the news we dont watch because theyre boring   no unless i watched through the war you know theres only one   yeah especially the war i mean it was like i havent i seen this episode before you know     i know i guess they think that people dont watch TV but i mean if you watch it like five minutes then it repeats the same thing over and over and over   yeah i know   its like oh man   and and in North Carolina see the the the thing is  like here they just they just give you like local news okay like a house burned down in this little town and were here and i go so what happened worldwide you know   yeah oh     its like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else theyre not going to tell you you know theyre going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard whos a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know       yeah   so but uh lets see what else oh we watch like for example uh okay do you watch Star Trek   uh i havent seen it in years but i used to   okay well i used to hate Star Trek   yeah   i thought i thought like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it   uhhuh   but then we started watching it and and like the new ones are pretty cool because because they got like uh like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind     really oh really thats cool   because what happened is  like they have this hologram right where you walk in and you can program and everything looks real and you can touch everything and stuff but its only a program and its really great because sometimes its like   uhhuh are you serious oh man   the hologram makes up all these things and uh i mean sometimes  sometimes its funny sometimes its not but uh you know its something to pass the time until we do and then and then we watch football   thats cool kind of like Pink Floyd or something uh yeah basketballs cool but football kind of after a while   which basketball   which basketball yeah i kind of like college better its more spirited   college or well we got we got two teams of the ACC going there   oh yeah   we got Duke and North Carolina   cool   but i mean the i mean theres nothing to do like for example yesterday   uhhuh   uh they go some some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right   uhhuh   i hear no were just you know its like we just woke up we had a hangover and everything you know and so we just woke up and uh were watching TV and i go no today were just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf     golf yeah   and bowling you know and everybody was like it was like oh God do you guys really watch that no you know i was like a whole golf tournament its like for example baseball i hate baseball i mean   oh me too   somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball and the actual play time that there is is five minutes   uhhuh     because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and its hit   yeah yeah   okay and that takes like you know five seconds for the whole play   thats true yeah thats true   and thats it it i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know but i mean its its like that i mean its was its just but when i went home thats all like they had on TV so i had to i watched entire games of baseball and theyre going oh my God and TV in Argentinas really bad   oh really   oh really so so why from Argentina whyd you come over here   uh because um i wanted to go to school here   oh thats cool how long did you
