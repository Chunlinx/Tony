        okay do you have any pets   yeah i have three cats and a dog   oh boy sounds like us yeah go ahead   um uh we just got the the dog less than a year ago so hes still a puppy   oh what kind is it   hes a mixed breed hes part Collie part Shepherd and part Chow   oh so hes got   more Collie and Shepherd than Chow the only Chow hes got is is his tongue   oh hes got a blue tongue oh   yeah hes got little spots on them   we have two Chows and  a miniature Schnauzer and recently added a guinea pig  which wasnt by my choice but       i was out ruled so  but the dogs are mine mainly mine and my husband but i just love them to death   was the guinea pig for your for your child   daughter yes  yes as if the dogs werent enough had to have  a guinea pig so       anyway shes she enjoys her though so thats thats what matters but um our Chows weve had them id say right around six maybe seven years and theyre um   really   registered and weve been breeding them shes had about four or five litters   oh my my husbands always wanted a Chow but im kind of concerned about um with having cats   oh uhhuh   and how how they socialize with cats um which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed um because we we thought they would socialize easier   right umhum   um my husband had originally wanted an Akita and his brother has an Akita and he so far hes bitten ten people   umhum um oh man   so   goodness   and the people that he got the Akita from used to have cats and they no longer have any other cats       so uh   its telling them yeah when we had um we had a cat when we first married no  yeah we had the cat first and then we got um the Chows and  bring them bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her and uh you would think you know that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and and paw at their face and theyd just play and they were never they never harmed her   umhum   so uh they got along great now i dont know how how it would be bringing in uh cat to a full full grown dog   yeah i i wouldnt want to bring a cat into a full grown dog but i i wouldnt feel   yeah   um hesitant about bringing a puppy in to adult cats i think they would socialize easier   right i think so too   um how how old is your child   five she   five so you had the dogs before you had the baby   right and i was  not really concerned about um them harming her uh i think i think a lot of that that that we hear all the time is how you bring them up   umhum   and ours are real friendly theyre protective but theyre very friendly and lovable i mean you think theyre lapdogs   uhhuh   you know theyll just come jump on your lap and want to be have their bellies rubbed and everything  and   what color are they   uh the females red and the male is black   oh i bet the black ones pretty   yeah he is hes a big old thing and um i was concerned about the female mainly and as luck had it uh she had puppies the same week my daughter was born so it was kind of like she had her babies and understood about   about your baby   you know yeah and and i think that really helped and um my daughter you know since since shes little has been playing with them and they let her tug their hair and and get on their back or whatever and shes shes grown up with them and loves them to death and they love her so   yeah i think its good for kids to grow up around pets as as long as they dont have any allergies to them or anything but i think it really helps them to   so i do too yeah   understand when when uh they go to other peoples houses and they have pets i see so many times kids just you know being mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings   yeah exactly that or or uh the other extreme theyre theyre terrified of them and i hate that and they shouldnt be i mean some maybe but but um   yeah yeah   like our miniature Schnauzer shes just shes just like um a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly and a lot of kids are scared of that and which i understand because she is you know a lot of movement and everything but when she calms down theyre so scared of her its it that bothers me because shes the friendliest thing she wouldnt hit you know harm them at all   um   and and and thats mainly people that have never had pets around their children so i think i think its a good idea to have them weve had a um in the past weve had birds too uh like cockatoos   uhhuh   and parrots and uh   now are the are the cockatoos are those the big ones   the big white   yeah   birds with the the orange crest on top   yeah   weve had those and those are neat theyre messy very messy yeah and loud oh a lot louder than a dog you know a dog you can  stop barking you know or whatever but the birds you its hard to keep them from squawking or whatever but   are they yeah   but they were neat enjoyable animals to have   well weve thought about getting an aquarium partly because partly for the cats i think the cats would really enjoy it um   umhum yeah with a lid   yeah yeah of course  um but so far we just uh and and starting up an aquarium an aquarium we were thinking about getting a saltwater and theyre so expensive to start up   oh yeah they yes yes they are and in your  the luck of keeping them alive through those first you know few days   yeah yeah but the the saltwater fish have so much more color and theyre so much more beautiful   i know they are   um the freshwater tanks just really to me they dont theres most of them really arent that pretty   no   i really dont i really dont care much for them   right i dont blame you there i think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than i dont know those fish fish are just beautiful just its like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something something rather than just little fish   yeah yeah   but i dont mind having  my daughter had a like a little goldfish   uhhuh   about a year or two ago and it finally died and that was neat but it and theyre you know she cant play with it you can just look at it and   yeah yeah   you know you cant roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat and   yeah i wouldnt i wouldnt dare have a a goldfish here because uh it it it would probably be in a small bowl and then my cats would knock it over i have to be real careful about     yeah umhum   where i put things if the cats will will jump up on things and knock things over all the time   oh no oh no   theyre always up where they dont where theyre not supposed to be     yes yeah and thats hard   i know thats thats just like kids you know you you they know that theyre not supposed to do it but theyre going to do it anyway because they know theyre not supposed to     thats right and theyre so independent i love having them for that reason   yeah yeah and until we got the dog um it was real easy to to go to town for three day three day weekend or whatever and now   sure     its like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while youre gone   umhum umhum   thats right that is hard   and i we knew it but we never even thought that about when we got the dog we just saw him oh hes so cute lets take him home  you know and then the first weekend we had him we had we were in a apartment in a two bedroom apartment   oh yes umhum   and my husband went out of town and left me with with the brand new puppy and i had to work twelve hours that day   oh fun oh no   and so i left the dog locked in the bedroom and i put paper all over the floor well when i came home i opened the door and there were chunks of carpet padding   oh oh oh no   everything all over the place and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door   oh no i guess you didnt get your deposit back did you   well i had the carpet fixed um i yeah i didnt even tell the apartment managers about it   oh good oh okay  oh no bless your heart   but that that was my first real experience with with with a puppy when when we had our family dog growing up i was eleven or twelve i think when we first got him and i wasnt really involved in the the the   umhum   paper training and you know teaching him commands and stuff so this was and to me a whole new experience  only it wasnt like cats at all   sure yeah yes it is no no i wish it was  i wish they were in that instinct but they dont our only problem with our Schnauzer shes an indoor dog  most of the time  and   so umhum   uh we finally shes right at a year and we finally got her you know house trained and everything uh her only problem is trash if you do not pick the trash up you know the container and put it on a table or chair or something shell knock it over i dont care how full full she is so its not like shes hungry its just she wants to get into trouble   umhum my cats do that it if i throw anything away thats any kind of meat or anything like that anything that   umhum   that they think is good theyll get into the trash and then it doesnt matter where you put it and where you hide it and how how tight you have the lid down on it theyll get into it     yeah yeah     ive come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor   oh i hate that   and the cats just looking at me like sorry   uh yeah  you shouldnt have left it there  i just hate that when she does that i just oh and she knows its wrong youll walk in the door and shell cower and go hide under the table   i couldnt help myself umhum   so you she knows she does wrong but she uh she continues continues to do it so   yeah and the problem that were having with our puppy right now hes not really hes actually not really a puppy anymore hes like sixteen months old   umhum   um but hes still chewing   oh is he   um the last thing he chewed up was uh when we
