                            Dr Gerberding outlines critical steps for arresting the HIVAIDS epidemic  She        suggests moving ahead with ABCs and with D for diagnosis and R for responsibility        These are good suggestionswith increased HIV testing and individuals taking responsibility        for their role in HIV spread the epidemic might be slowed We could continue to add        incrementally to the alphabet soup of public health But instead we could choose to        immediately implement the mainstays of public healthuniversal testing and contact tracing         Every sexually active individual and every individual at risk for HIV deserves to        know their HIV status Thus every HIVinfected individual must be called upon to be        accountable for preventing HIV transmission Contact tracing should be instituted for HIV        just as it is for other infectious diseases Those who have been exposed to HIV have a        right to know how to protect themselves and if they too are infected to be offered        treatment  HIV testing has too often focused on testing of women in a perinatal setting        rather than universal testing in routine clinical care Without universal voluntary HIV        testing and contact tracing we will see the continued tilt of the epidemic toward women        now at  of all HIV infections and in all likelihood at  in another  to  years         For too long the debate has been that contact tracing will result in physical abuse        of women Confining our definition of abuse of women to physical abuse alone is to have too        narrow an ethical focusHIV infection itself is an abuse of women or of anyone else        Universal HIV testing and contact tracing adds an essential comprehensive public health        approach to the epidemic that will be successful in reducing the everescalating numbers of        new infections
