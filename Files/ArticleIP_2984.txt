                                 Innocence Lost            Philip Roths AmericanPastoral arrived in the bookstores a few weeks ago and I have been hearingabout it ever since A friend regales me over lunch with Philip Roths inflamedpassion against American innocence Someone else telephones to discuss theradicalism of the s generational warfare and the intricacies ofblackJewish relations in industrial New Jersey as depicted by Philip Roth Amailman stops me in the streetIm not making this upto expound his owndeduction from Philip Roths tale of family calamity to wit that without aclear sense of God modern Americans are doomed to lose their bearings andsociety will go to hell The mailman its true has not yet read the novelonly the reviews and our lively conversation many skyward hand gesturesveers in theological directions alien to American Pastoral  But I citethe theological detour to show what is going on these days every time I pick upthe phone or loll about on the springtime sidewalk            The novelitself Roths fulmination against American innocence is mostly a portrait ofa single personage a New Jersey ladiesglove manufacturer named SeymourLevov the Swedea husband and father of exasperating conventionalityserene handsome athletic bland shallow a man who seems to have beenextracted as if by a blender from the onionandgarlic world of the immigrantJews until every last hint of taste and texture have finally disappeared Andon this perfectly nice and liberalminded businessman Roth in his maliciousrage has bestowed a monster of a daughter a stuttering leftwing bomb throwerand murderous lunatic destined to ruin her daddys family and his lifejust toshow what comes of so much cheer and postethnic American optimism            The Swede is a great character I cant say that I entirelyunderstand him his placidity and easy mannerbut then nobody understandshim Is he madto be so passive and smiley in our world of tragedy andforeboding Or merely stupid Not even the worldfamous novelist NathanZuckerman Roths narrator can figure it out About the Swede RothsZuckerman writes Something had turned him into a human platitude But themotive factor remains elusive All that rose to the surface was more surfaceIt was clever of Roth to come up with such a personality and to send himwandering around the New Jersey wilds But the peculiar virtue of thischaracterless character is that he requires Roth to write about him in anevershifting series of tones each more precise than the last in an effort todefine what cannot be defined            There arepassages where Roth describing the rural New Jersey landscape from within theSwedes benign imagination produces a fine sugary lyricism that is not morethan  percent ironica lyricism of white pasture fences and rolling hayfields and the Swede pretending to be Johnny Appleseed tossing his imaginaryseed Then again there are passages of dark furythe outraged indignation ofthe Swedes wisedup brother Jerry the Miami heart surgeon who cant standthe innocence any longer and whose drumbeat imprecations achieve a kind ofpoetry            Whatare you Do you know What you are is youre always trying to smooth thingsover What you are is always trying to be moderate What you are is nevertelling the truth if you think its going to hurt someones feelings  Theone who abides everything patiently The one with the ultimate decorum Decorum Decorum is what you spit in the face of Well your daughterspit in it for you didnt she            Or this even louder an ability to turn up the volume isone of Roths special strengths again in Jerrys voice            You think you know what aman is You have no idea what a man is You think you know what adaughter is You have no idea what a daughter is You think you knowwhat this country is You have no idea what this country is You have afalse image of everything  All you know is what a fucking glove is Thiscountry is frightening             I couldcite a dozen other tonesof pleading impatience of emotional exhaustion ofinveigling desperation and so forthevery possible reaction to the Swede andhis predicament I wonder if Roth himself appreciates how lively and persuasivethese tones are how vividly they conjure up the Swedes reality In any caseas if still unsatisfied around these tones Roth has orchestrated a stillvaster range of side topicsethnic sociology Jews blacks Irish WASPsintermarriage industrial history glovemaking craftsmanship and its declinerecounted at length political debate the crimes of Presidents Johnson andNixon the migraine rhetoric of Angela Davis and more some of it renderedwith exquisite precision which is fun to read            The details do pile up though until you begin to thinkabout the research that Roth must have undertaken which is always a bad signThen he compounds his error by investing these background details withportentous meanings about America and its history and he compounds thecompound by overheating the plot you will have to discover the details foryourself By the end he is delivering verdicts like this The outlaws areeverywhere Theyre inside the gates Or He tells us that the real subjectis one of wantonness and betrayal and deception of treachery and disunityamong neighbors and friends the subject of cruelty The mockery of humanintegrity every ethical obligation destroyed            So here is a novel that isnot only about the s but exudes a distinctly s fume of windy propheticcursehurling A good idea all puffed up which is a bad idea The result isfascinating without being exactly moving A terrific book halfway underminedBut I dont want to make too much of my complaints given that in my littlecircle of friends no error or misjudgment on Roths part appears to haveinhibited anyones desire to subject American Pastoral to analyticvivisection Mayhem family collapse the occasional terrorist bomb madgovernment policies human platitudesin this pleasant springtime of these as Roth renders them do seem to be everyones favorite topics ofconversation
