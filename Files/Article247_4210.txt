                                 The Old Old Things                        Dear David            I am skeptical of historical analogies even though Weimar Germany andpostCommunist Russia never completed their bourgeois revolutions that led tostability look how well Germany is doing today Nor is there an organizedRussian Fascism to step in and seize power I do not think we can do anythingin Chechnya ghastly as is the Russian behavior Whatever noises we make cannotbe backed up by effective actions so that any rhetoric in the end may make uslook even more foolish But this is not the place to deal with such complexissues Since I believe that normal Western politics is the politics ofplatitudes and looking at Russia perhaps we should not knock that I amgoing to pick up my theme of our democratic domestic rhetoric and come back toyour turf that of history in a reverse manner So             Yesterday I mentioned Tony Giddens as the house intellectual for Tony BlairIn thinking back every Democratic administration has had a resident inhouseintellectual John F Kennedy had Arthur M Schlesinger Jr Lyndon Johnson hadJohn P Roche a former president of the ADA Jimmy Carter had Pat Caddell theHarvard pollster and Bill Clinton has Sidney Blumenthal who is suigeneris  The Republicans do not seem to have had any such intellectualsperhaps because they distrust them But then who wrote Ronald Reagans flashcards            The function of the inhouse intellectual is to think up Big Ideas that areto be imprinted into the historical period of the time New Frontier GreatSociety or to stroke visiting journalists or to combat other intellectualsArthur Schlesinger propagated the idea that JFK would have taken us out ofVietnam if he had lived John Roche tried to pin Vietnam on JFK Pat Caddellfashioned Carters malaise speech blaming the people for the funk we were inrecalling the Brecht remark the people are against the government thegovernment has to change the people and now Sidney Blumenthal            The other week Godfrey Hodgson a British journalist wrote an essay inThe Guardian Weekly about an encounter in the White House                           President Clintons communications director Sidney Blumenthal was rhapsodicover dinner People in Europe do not understand he complained that the USwas creating a world society The new politics the new economics the newtechnology and the new immigration were coming together to change the tired oldrules of the game There was more in the same poetic vein                        Two days ago was the  th anniversary of the death of GeorgeWashington On the Jim Lehrer NewsHour  Richard Brookhiser who haswritten a book called Founding Father  said that what George Washingtonhad done was to create a new nation and a new people And in   yearsago Martin Lipset wrote a book about our founding called The First NewNation  So new is obviously a tattered tired old term Nunu            Two hundred years Is that a long time historically speaking In  Ibecame a staff writer on the New Leader  then a largeformat newspaperweekly The editor of the paper was a quiet courtly old man named William EBohn He wrote the editorials Victor Riesel and I wrote most of the paper Weused pseudonyms to fill up the pages I used John Donne until Hemingways bookcame out and then shifted to Andrew Marvell            After we had put the paper to bed on Thursday mornings we would sit andtalk about history Bill Bohn had been expelled as a teacher from theUniversity of Pennsylvania in  because he was a socialist He startled usonce by saying that his older brother had fought in the American Civil War andthat his grandfather had fought against Napoleon in  So that was threedegrees of separation Your young son Joseph will probably go to  so foralmost  years that will be six degrees of separation            But history was always a living presence I think of my late lamented friendBoris Shub son of the Menshevik historian David Shub who had set up RIAS theradio station in the American sector in Berlin in  a major cold warpropaganda asset When Boris was at De Witt Clinton High School in New York inthe s his history teacher once remarked that in February  AlexanderKerensky had made the Russian Revolution and was soon after overthrown byLenin Boris shot up his hand and said Kerensky did not make the Februaryrevolution That had been made by the Cadets Constitutional Democrats underPrince Lvov Lenin did not come to Russia until April in the sealed trainacross Germany Kerensky had refused to take a job in the first cabinet butdid in the second one when Muliukov became prime minister and Kerensky becameminister of war In the third reshuffle Kerensky became prime minister How doyou know all this asked the startled teacher Because Kerensky told me Borisreplied Kerensky lived until  and one could see him as I did walkingacross the Stanford campus where he was affiliated with the HooverInstitution History lives            What impresses me in fact is that with all the blather about the newthere is a hunger for history and for many people the old is more relevantthan the new I was struck by this a decade or so ago when I was in Praguethen still under Communist rule where I had been invited to give a fewlectures to some Party institutes about technology At least the theory ofit After the sessions my hosts eagerly escorted me around the city and tookme to the towering Hradcany Castle Kafkas Castle since he had once lived ina small hovel in the wall underneath What they wanted to talk about was notthe future but the past about the days of Rudolf II who had ruled the HolyRoman Empire in the  th century when Prague dominated Europebefore Vienna And to show me the famous window of the Defenestration ofPrague the glorious day in May  during the Thirty Years War when two royalCatholic officers had been hurled from the window by the Protestant members ofthe Bohemian Dietand being in Prague had landed on a haystack below            And I think earlier this year of Serbia where the bones of Prince Lazarthe martyr of the battle against the Turks in  have become hallowed inhistory and whose legends were written down by church scribes and canonized incycles of folk poetry In commemoration of the  th anniversary ofthe great battle in  Lazars bones were taken for a tour around Serbia andBosnia from monastery to monastery Today they lie in Ravinica and on Sundaysthe coffin is opened for the faithful and his brown and withered hands peekout from under the shroud Will Lenins embalmed body be around for years I know that these are alleged bones and emotional sentiments arewhipped up by the prayers of the priests and the nuns But peoplebelieve  or want to believe That is why icons have the power theyhave            But since this will be the last round before the end of the century shallwe conclude with a discussion of the Millenniumbut which one            LoveDad
