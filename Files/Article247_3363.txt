                                 The Final Word on Deep Throat So Far            Today is the th anniversary of Richard Nixons resignationspeech To watch Nixon saying Therefore I shall resign the presidencyeffective at noon tomorrow click here You can hear itover and over by clicking repeatedly Chatterbox decided to celebrate NixonResignation Day by phoning W Mark Felt the former FBI official whom RichardNixon and Nora Ephron and various other people believe to have been DeepThroat Chatterbox strongly influenced by a  James Mann piece in theAtlantic Monthly which is finally online click here to read it has himself been fairly proFelt lately andsubscribes to Manns thesis that if it wasnt Felt it was someone else at theFBI See Deep Throat The Game Is Afoot Another Bulletin From the Deep Throat Desk Deep Throat Revealed One Last Time and Deep Throat Revealed Again            Earlier today when Chatterbox first attempted to phone Felt now anoctogenarian living in California with his daughter Joan he got an answeringmachine If youd like to leave a message for Joan Rob Nick or DeepThroat it said you may do so after the beep Naturally Chatterbox got alittle excited when he heard this But when Chatterbox phoned back a littlelater Joan Felt said it was a gag message that she had put on her phone lastnight after having a bottle of wine with some friends and that this morningshed thought better of it and taken it off Joan said she really has no ideawhether her father is Deep Throat but that hes told her he isnt He hasntrevealed it to anybody if its true she said Hmm Chatterboxthought  A nondenial denial from the daughter                        Then Mark Felt came on the line Chatterbox schmoozed Felt a bit Does heget asked a lot by reporters whether hes Deep Throat            Yes A couple of times so far this week            Are you Deep Throat                                             The answer to that is yes and no Im the person that theyretalking about Chatterbox was initially tantalized by this but quicklyrealized Felt meant Im the Mark Felt who worked at the FBI in  Iwas involved very deeply in all that  went on But Im not guilty ofdisclosure leaking it to the press or anything like that                                       Did Felt arrange to leak to Woodward through an intermediary No DoesFelt agree with Mann that the leaker was someone from the FBI Felt hasnt readthe Mann piece but I dont think so Its just not logical  The nature ofthe information that the paper was printing would have to have come from morethan one source            Chatterbox trying not to plead asked Felt if there were any other reasonaside from Felts actually not being Deep Throat  that might impel himto deny he was Deep Throat            No Felt said There wasnt            The conversation seemed to be winding down Chatterbox asked Felt whether itwas annoying to be asked over and over again by various people whether he wasDeep Throat It gets to be very provoking he said Does he find itirritating  Yes            Chatterbox switched to the general topic of tension between the FBI and theWhite House at the time of J Edgar Hoovers death which occurred one monthbefore the Watergate breakin and according to Mann is why the FBI helpedWoodward nail Nixon I dont think there was any serious tension Felt saidDid he want the top job I certainly wouldnt have objected to getting theNo  position Felt said Was he disappointed when he didnt get it Icant say that I was Didnt the White House interfere with the FBIinvestigation of Watergate I dont have any recollection of any specificslike that he saidperhaps displaying an old mans poor memory the WhiteHouse interference is now a matter of public record or perhaps displaying aGeorge Smileylike implacability Felt is after all a former member of theGman elite            Well what about Nixons assertions on the White House tapes that Felt wasleaking What about Nixons antiSemitic comments about Felt Felt said hewasnt aware of either Chatterbox read Felt the exchange in which Nixon andHR Haldeman his chief of staff discussed their belief that Felt wasleaking and in which Nixon said regarding Felts high position at the FBIChrist put a Jew in there Click here and scroll down to the boldface type to read it Chatterbox askedFelt whether hed like to comment            No Felt indicated he was starting to lose his patience withChatterbox                                             In talking with you and in talking with various people on thepress and so forth its really very annoying                                       Lets just say you were Deep Throat Would that really be soterrible                                             It would be terrible This would completely undermine thereputation that you might have as a loyal logical employee of the FBI It justwouldnt fit at all                                       But a lot of people think Deep Throat is a hero for getting the truth outabout Nixon and Watergate                                             Thats not my view at all It would be contrary to myresponsibility as a loyal employee of the FBI to leakinformation                                       In other words there is a potential reason other than notbeing Deep Throat that might impel Felt to say he wasnt DeepThroat the perceived dishonor such a revelation might bring Felt as a loyalemployee of the FBI                           A Postscript  On Nov   Richard Nixon after avoidingtestifying in twenty other courtrooms over the last six years writes RobertSam Anson in Exile The Unquiet Oblivion of Richard M Nixon  was on thestand in a criminal case The defendants were W Mark Felt and Edward SMiller former chief of the FBIs intelligence division accused of conspiringto violate the civil rights of members of the Weather Underground when theyauthorized warrantless breakins of the radicals homes the Weatherfolk weresuspected of planting bombs in public buildings in  and             Nixon thought Felt was Deep Throat But Nixon was extremely eager to testifyon Felt and Millers behalf even though he hadnt been subpoenaed Havingsuccessfully and rather strenuously dodged prosecution himself Nixon hadvolunteered to walk into a courtroom and testify to help someone hebelieved had triggered his own downfall Felt and Millers lawyers had turnedNixon down because theyd worried that Nixons reputation would only hurt Feltand Miller with the largely black jury The prosecution however had beendelighted to have him Anson writes So Nixon appeared as a prosecutionwitness While Nixon took the oath Black Panthers and former antiwar activistsshouted Thief and Liar called him a war criminal and were expelled byfederal marshals from the courtroom This according to the third volume ofStephen Ambroses Nixon biography Nixon Ruin and Recovery             On the stand Nixon said that he thought the warrantless breakins wereperfectly legal Although he wasnt asked under oath whether hed known of orapproved them hed said earlier that he hadnt The president Nixon saidhad power to authorize such breakins and so did the FBI which was an arm ofthe executive branch Nixon said there had been hard evidence linking theWeather Underground to foreign governments Nixon said he himself had approvedsimilar breakins under the  Houston Plan which he said was also legalNixon gave an impromptu lecture about a presidents heavy burden duringwartime I hope that neither President Carter or Governor Reagan if he shouldbe president has to do what I had to do what Franklin Roosevelt had to dohere the judge interrupted and told the prosecutor to ask his next questionbut Nixon went on what President Truman had to do that is write letters topeople whose sons have been killed in war Possibly in part because of thejurys distaste for Nixon Felt and Miller were found guilty and sentenced topay  and  respectively After Ronald Reagan who was electedpresident a few days later assumed the presidency he pardoned the twomen            It is almost too irresistible to wonder Did Nixon serve up his sympathetictestimony because he knew it would alienate the jury and give DeepThroat what he Nixon deemed his just deserts We know that Nixon was arevenge buff who was capable of extraordinarily Machiavellian behavior We alsoknow that Nixon sincerely believed that warrantless breakins of the sort thatFelt and Miller and under different circumstances Nixon himself hadauthorized were a necessary line of defense against radicals and troublemakersmany of whom did indeed prove to be violent            Which Nixon testified at Felts trialthe Nixon wanting to give Deep Throata little payback or the Nixon who wanted to stand firm against The PunksPerhaps both
