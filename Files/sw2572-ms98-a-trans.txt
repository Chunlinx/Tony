                hi Jim the um well how do you get the most of your information   uh generally the most of my information ill get in the morning with my newspaper   uhhuh   periodically updated through the day i try to catch the news at least once before i go to work either on TV or on the radio most days its just catching it on the radio drive on the drive in to work   uhhuh do you enjoy mainly network news or like CNN   uh for world events ill take CNN any day   yeah any day yeah   but for local local coverage or statewide coverage ill take the local news   yeah   a lot more indepth   do you um do you do you get them do you feel like the newspapers are generally biased either liberal or conservative views   i extremely so   i thats how it is here too that one newspaper is very liberal one of them is very conservative   and theres no mid ground anywhere in it   uh doesnt seem to be um granted i i i read primarily the more controversial topics so im sure that its easier for them to uh be you know polarized more so on the topic on the the news items that interest me most but uh it doesnt seem like theres much middle ground in either of the papers   with what im involved with doing is kind of a controversial job anyway   really   i work with the uh state prison system so im always kind of interested i look at the what the liberal view is on the inmates need more rights and i hear the more conservative lines that we need to get back to making the punishment fit the crime but they never do go far enough   yeah   after four years with the system ive got an extreme almost an extremist view on get into the criminal justice system   uhhuh   because what they got now sure isnt working   well i think that its been proven since somewhere in the early nineteen hundreds that rehabilitation in the forms that we have been attempting it is not realistic um i cant remember the study but it was there was a quite a longterm study done in Europe that uh evaluated the incarceration systems that America has based their systems on and uh its been proven useless for rehabilitation uh which is what a lot of people tend to believe happens in a prison and um there are amount of reforms that could be helpful in that area are numerous and costly and would  require require a lot of task forces and et cetera and um there is a lot of people in our country that would go right off the roof  um are do you work with the inmates themselves   yes thats im a inside guard i also work in the segregation department for the ones that mess up   goodness yeah   so i get the real sweethearts but i get a aside aside from that i id almost say ive got extremist views on gun controls on personal crime convention uh personal crime prevention   to to which end   there was a thing recently in the paper there was a bill in front of the state legislature that was going to allow the average citizen to be able to pack his own weapon again   uhhuh   concealed or unconcealed im all for that   why is that do you think the average citizen has the the um uh the wherewithals in order to use it   i dont know if every citizen does or not but just you having lived in Houston you know what its like out there   its   when i go to a shopping mall if i i feel under dressed if im carrying less than two blades from the training i had in the military id rather take somebody with a blade at close range than i would with a pistol because i know theyre going to go down i know i can keep them down   uhhuh   but if the if the option came up to where i could pack a side arm in the open i i dont worry about carrying it concealed i want them to know im packing it   yeah uhhuh   and given the option of that i would definitely when i went shopping to the malls i would definitely be packing all kind of power firepower   yeah i uh i i lived in a part of Houston that was uh unpleasant i lived south down in uh the Montrose area   Wisdom City okay   yeah and it was it i was um keenly aware of the the the danger in my area um my roommate was attacked and she got away unharmed but scared to pieces and had had all of her clothing ripped off of her um and then i had another friend that was also approached and got away and this was in broad daylight both times so i was keenly aware of the danger in those areas but i didnt i guess i didnt feel like i was competent enough with any kind of weapon to to carry one or to feel like carrying one would be a benefit to me rather than just having them take it  you know i mean thats i thats thats truly how i felt i felt like if i were carrying something and if i actually pulled it on somebody that was trying to attack me that their chances of getting it from me would be higher than my chances of using it effectively on them   thats where the only stipulation id like to see tacked on to the legislation saying that there had to be some form of formal firearms instruction N R say NRA certified firearms instruction   uhhuh   you cant train somebody how to shoot in a combat situation until theyve been there ive seen it in Lebanon i was in in the Granada invasion in eighty three   uhhuh   i was an advisor down in Central America in eighty four im very accustomed to knowing when i pull a piece out whether its a full sized firearm or a handgun   uhhuh   when it clears leather shot the shots going to be fired you dont pull it out for show you pull it out to take care of business the same way with the blade it it comes out of my back pocket or it comes out of a sheath on my web gear its coming out and its going to draw blood you dont pull it trying to think is it uh in the Gurkha forces out of India had a legend that went along with their legendary side arm the Khukri which is their blade   uhhuh uhhuh   you never drew that thing out unless it was going to draw blood which is a good   huh   mental training aspect for it   uhhuh   that that or any side arm whether it be a blade or whether it be a handgun or whatever   uhhuh oh i feel that is certainly if youre going to carry one you need to be uh very comfortable with the piece and have enough uh knowledge and insight for your own self on whether or not youre going to use it in that situation and not pull it unless you intend to because i i feel like thats you know i mean im im im all for uh people having having firearms or having whatever form of protection they prefer because you know even though the odds is you know the criminal ends up getting the gun and shooting the people to begin with you know the people that had it in the beginning but if the if if youre talking about uh two people if youre talking about a criminal an assailant that is coming at you with a gun and you dont have a gun at all well the chances are a hundred percent theyre going to get you if you if you both of you have a firearm youve at least got that fifty percent chance that you may get them first and so i believe in that but i ive not ever felt comfortable in it i guess its  im glad i  im glad i um im that im married to someone who feels comfortable with them  you know its its one of those things um i was reared in Texas so   t heres also a moral aspect to it a lot of people have not either mentally sat down and gone over the moral aspect can i take human life even in a life threatening situation to myself or to a loved one   uhhuh   and when it actually comes down they dont have time to think about it   uhhuh   in that fraction of a succeed that theyre caught i dont know if i can do this theres a bullet already on the way to them or theres a blade already cutting them somewhere because they they had the time to react but they hesitated   uhhuh yeah   and thats impossible to in a classroom setting explain that to somebody theyve got to on their own have made that decision long before they ever decided to carry a weapon of any type whether it be a fighting staff   uhhuh   up to a forty four magnum any any of them in the correct hands theyre an absolutely fantastic weapon   uhhuh   but if you havent made that moral decision can i take a human life even under those situations where either my life or a life of a friend or a life of a family member is threatened   yeah   can you do you defeated the purpose of even having the gun   uh   or the or whatever the weapon is   uh i agree i agree that would be something that would have to be uh evaluated i feel prior to ownership the uh i think a lot of people hear only the sensation stories of this child being killed or
