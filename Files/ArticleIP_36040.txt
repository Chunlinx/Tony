                                 Double Trouble                            Note Life and Art is an occasional column that compares fiction invarious media with the reallife facts on which it is ostensiblybased                                          Boys  Boys                DontCry a justreleased dramatic film about a woman who was raped and murderedin a small Nebraska town for pretending to be a manhews fairly closely towhat really happened to yearold Brandon Teena nee Teena Brandon            In the filmas in lifeBrandon who never usedthe last name Teena he was called Brandon Teena only posthumously hadalready been wooing young women as a man in his hometown of Lincoln beforearriving in Falls City population  in late  He begins dating ayearold named Lana and quickly becomes part of her circle Lanas mother afew female friends and two excons named John Lotter and Tom Nissen John andTom werent old friends as the film makes them out to be They met only a monthbefore Brandons murder The marginalized group spends its time drinkingplaying cards and bumperskiing from the back of a moving pickup truck byholding a rope attached to the cab Brandon who has a history of forgery endsup in the womens section of jail Lana helps post his bail            Brandons acquaintancesbecome suspicious of his gender and John and Tom become hostile toward himIn real life John had been involved with Lana and Tom may have been brieflytoo but the film avoids this history The two men pull down Brandons pantsexposing his genitalia then later beat and rape him Though Brandon is warnedto keep quiet he reports the rape In the movie the sheriff sounds like ablamethevictim monster when he questions Brandon about the attack but thisaccount jibes with what happened in real life Sheriff Charles Laux who isnot named in the film wanted to know why Brandon was masquerading as a man andasked him if hed helped one of the rapists get an erection A few days afterthe rape Lotter and Nissen track down Brandon at a farmhouse and kill him            Brandon seduces women with his good looks and his greatkissing in the film but he charms them by just listening In  Brandonsgirlfriends told the Village Voice that Brandon was their best boyfriendever One woman who was engaged to Brandon for three months said he was a goodlover Did they know that their perfect boyfriend wasnt a boy Brandon passedas a man by securing his breasts with Ace bandages keeping his clothes onwhile snuggling with lovers and occasionally using a fake penis duringintercourse all of which is covered in Boys Dont Cry  But he also toldsome women that he was going to get a sexchange operation and others that hewas a hermaphrodite a fact that his mother denies            When did Lana discoverBrandons true gender Both the film and the record oscillate on this questionIn a telephone interview Boys Dont Cry director and cowriter KimberlyPeirce says that Lana told her that she knew Brandon was a girl the first timeshe met him But in subsequent conversations Lana claimed that she didntfind out until Brandon was jailed or until John and Tom had taken his pantsdown or until hed been raped            Although Lana knew Brandon for only a month before hismurder the filmmakers make their relationship seem longer and more seriousperhaps to give their affair epic status Indeed celluloid Lana played byChlo Sevigny and Brandon Hilary Swank almost escape the obstacles posed byher family and the hatred of the community by running away together            And at one improbablemoment they almost discover themselves as lesbians In a lovemaking scene thatoccurs after the rape Brandon finally takes off his shirt Lana says I dontknow if Im going to know how to do it Brandon responds Im sure youllfigure it out As best we know Brandon did not identify as a lesbian sayinghe was disgusted by the idea of loving a woman that way            One also supposes that the real Lana was a bit moreconfused and angered by the public revelation of Brandons gender than themovie suggests JoAnn Brandon Brandons mother not depicted in the movieasserted on Geraldo that Teena told her that she thought Lana had sether up for the rape This accusation however seems very much at odds withthe fact that Brandon and Lana spent time together after the attack            In the film Lana triesto prevent John and Tom from finding Brandon by asking them to go get a drinkInstead they drive her to the farmhouse where she then tries to stop themfrom killing both Brandon and their friend Candace Candace is fictionalThere were two victims besides Brandon a woman who had been involved withBrandon and a man who was visiting the area Tom takes aim at Lana but thebullet misses because John shoves him The men leave and Lana lies next toBrandons body and the movie ends a few minutes later with a music videoishsequence of Lana driving out of town Boys Dont Cry s postscriptexplains that she eventually returned to Falls City where is she currentlyraising a child            Nobody actually knows if Lana accompanied the two men tothe farmhouse Tom and John did swing by Lanas house before heading to thescene of the murder and John reportedly said to Lana and her sister who doesnot figure in the movie I feel like killing somebody Lanas mother LindaGutierres not her name in the film told them where they could findBrandon            Lana and her family havebeen criticized for not warning Brandon that trouble was on the way Itspossible that one of the reasons they didnt phone Brandon was that Lana wentwith Tom and John As Aphrodite Jones recounts in her book about the incidentAll She Wanted for which Diane Keaton has bought the movie rights Tomtold a police officer that Lana was in the car but didnt go into thefarmhouse She stayed in the car the whole time Later Tom testified againstJohn so as to avoid the electric chair John maintains his innocence fromdeath row Tom is serving a life sentence On the witness stand Tom said thathe and John were the only ones in the vehicle And as John Gregory Dunnereported in The New Yorker  Toms initial allegation was not vigorouslypursued in testimony            Susan Muska and Greta Olafsdottir who made the documentary The Brandon Teena Story  say Lana was adamant that shewasnt there Boys Dont Cry s Peirce struggled over whether or not toplace Lana at the murder scene Is Lana actually going to sit in her house andlet Brandon be murdered Peirce asks As to whether Lana would have sat in thecar Peirce admits that its possible but that it wouldnt have been asdramatic            Why did John and Tom feel as though they had to killBrandon They had to be worried about the rape allegation although as Dunnepoints out in The New Yorker it doesnt make sense to try to escape arape charge which is difficult to prosecute by committing murder But thesewere not especially bright exconvicts They tossed the murder weapons into ariver which was frozen at the time And Tom would later describe the murdersto a Playboy writer before his trial the writer was called as awitness            Both John and Tom were troubled Boys Town rejectedJohn for admission when he was a child and Tom had been abused and liked tomutilate himself They were no doubt enraged by Brandons deception and angeredby his identity as the film implies Perhaps they were also disturbed by themeaning of the rape In the documentary Toms girlfriend says someone told herTom was a faggot and a lawyer asks Tom After this sexual assault didnt your girlfriend tell you people were calling you a pervert  Youhad just had sexforcible sexwith a woman who was dressing as a man How didyou feel about that Tom replies I didnt feel very good about it atall
