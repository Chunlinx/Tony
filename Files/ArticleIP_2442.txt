                                 Skull Session            I was expecting  I dontknow what Maybe some old hatboxes labeled Confidential Vietnam languishingon a dusty shelf in a dusty closet Instead Paul Sledzik an earnest youngcurator at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington DCleads me into a large spotless storage room unlocks File Cabinet  andslides out the top drawer There they are six human skulls Keepsakes from thewar that refuses to go away quietly A cardboard divider no different fromwhats normally used to ship grapefruit keeps the skulls from banging togetherlike marbles            These two are myfavorites Sledzik says I kind of go back and forth about which is the mostinteresting            He pointsout two skulls that are indisputably the eyecatchers of the bunchInteresting is an understatement These are the Velvet Elvises of war bootyThe first skull inventory No  is slathered with graffiti Abovethe eye sockets someone scrawled Chu Lai trip skull The doodles include apeace sign and a marijuana pipe Pat Chuckie Frank and Rich areamong those who added their names as if they were giddy college teammatesautographing a football after a big homecoming win            The skull is that of a toyearold Asian male It hadbeen confiscated from two US servicemen at Da Nang airfield in the fall of They had inquired about the proper procedure for shipping their prizehome apparently oblivious to the fact that body parts arent consideredmilitary surplus If you read the case file notes Sledzik it sounds as ifthey thought there was nothing wrong with this            His otherfavorite skull No  came from a slightly older Asian maleAuthorities took it off the hands of a GI stationed at Pleiku in  Somebodyat the base was dabbling in morbid art therapy An

islocated on the grounds of Walter Reed Army Medical Center Its roots extendback to the Civil War Thus visitors can find on display a swatch of diseasedcolon removed from a Union soldier plagued by terminal diarrhea and pieces ofJohn Wilkes Booths vertebrae not to mention such miscellany as Siamese twinsin a jar and a Peruvian mummy However the oddest items in the oddballcollectionitems that the government doesnt quite know what to do witharekept in permanent storage Like the brain of Charles Guiteau the man whoassassinated President Garfield Like the Vietnam War skulls            Id visited the museumseveral times but learned about the skulls only recently from a friend Theyimmediately ruined several nights sleep prompting me to pay Sledzik a visitVietnam after all is my war And I have the draftlottery deferment to proveit The assumption says Sledzik is that American grunts picked up the skullsin their battlefield travels souvenirs to someday show the grandkids But nowthat the United States and Vietnam are busy reestablishing diplomaticrelations now that Hanoi may be in the running for the next TCBY yogurtfranchise why not give em back For the sake of symbolic closure For sappysentimental reasons By rights it seems to me a persons head ought to restin peace if not near his or her body then at least on the same continent            Showswhat I know            Trophies

headshrinking Sledzik walks across the storage room and fetches anotherrare museum piece a perfectly preserved head no larger than a tennis ballIts the handiwork of the Shuar a notoriously ferocious

behavior transcends geographic bounds In medieval England the severedheads of those who crossed the throne were regularly stuck on pikes and mountedin public places London Bridge being a choice site Oliver Cromwell wasdecapitated after death and his head left on a pole in Westminster Hall for years Across the world an  th century war shrine in the Japanesetown of Nara once contained the ears of  Koreans The Japanese reportedlymoved on to bigger things in World War II The archives of the College ofPhysicians of Philadelphia contain a note dictated by a fellow of the collegein  that reads Recently a Japanese officer sent  Chinese heads toJapan as trophies to be displayed This number was exceeded by another officerwho sent  heads            Vietnam was not the first time that USsoldiers indulged in noggin nabbing Marines amassed piles of heads during thePhilippine Insurrection of  Army records show that when the remainsof Japanese soldiers killed in the Mariana Islands were

not as good asMarilyn Monroes nipplesrumored to have been snipped off during her autopsyalong with some locks of hairwhich White estimates could bring well over            Another collector of shrunkenheads who requested anonymity has a Vietnam War photograph of a group ofAmerican soldiers posing by a crude altar fashioned from skulls and bonesreminiscent of the ghastly constructions of the Cambodian Khmer Rouge Theyreshowing the Angel of Death that theyre not afraid he explains            Desecration of the dead serves the dual purpose of steeling ones own courageand intimidating the enemy But the collector adds There is a differencebetween taking a trophy and a souvenir            The distinction seems irrelevant as I standinside the National Museum of Health and Medicine holding the bright blueskullcandle in cupped hands Part of me is worried about dropping the damnthing Part of me feels obliged to smash it against the wall I ask Sledzik ifthe Vietnamese Embassy in Washington might want custody of the skulls As faras I know theyve never been offered he replies We cant say for suretheyre even combatants            Hisassistant Lenore Barbian cautions against practicing

murderous imperatives of battle and thewanton bloodlust of barbarism Come Memorial Daywhen the country is absorbedin the annual rituals of war and remembrance when flags bloom likeredwhiteandblue

gimmicksare they employing these days to stave off the Angel of Death            Mostly though I will thinkabout six lives and six ignominious ends Something tells me those haplessVietnam skulls
