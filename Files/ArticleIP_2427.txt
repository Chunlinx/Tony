                                 Sheep Thrills            How DollyWas Designed            CloningNature and Nurture            The WeekTheClones                           Something slightlyoverlooked in the frenzy of speculation about Dolly the sheep cloned byScottish scientists last week are the details of the experiment that resultedin her creation We asked Andrew Berry a geneticist to explain how Dolly cameinto being and why from a biologists point of view she matters                        First we have to look atwhat we mean by cloning Weve been cloning genes for some  years now Inother words we can propagate small strips of DNA outside their parentorganisms We put a piece of say sheep DNA into a bacterial cell whichreproduces itself asexuallydoubling its genetic material and splittingandeach time it replicates our sheep gene Weve been cloning cells for longerCertain cells can be cultured reproducing themselves like bacteria in apetri dish Both forms of cloning constitute major technologicalaccomplishments but neither comes close to reconstituting an organism That isa much bigger problem            Not aninsurmountable one As every gardener knows you can regenerate entire plantsfrom the smallest cutting But animals are not so straightforward The onlykind of wholeorganism cloning weve been able to perform up till now hasinvolved DNA taken from early embryonic tissue In the s biologists wereable to generate entire frogs from DNA that came from embryos less than hours old Any older and no new frog developed That is because cells in veryearly tissue are what is known as undifferentiatednot yet committed to aparticular developmental path Whats revolutionary about Dolly is that the DNAthat created her was taken from a grownup differentiated cell            until now the conventional wisdom in biology has had itthat while early embryonic cells are totipotent capable of becoming any kindof tissue once cells have differentiated into a particular tissue type theymust remain that type PreDolly differentiation in animal tissue was regardedas an irreversible process If we cloned muscle cells we got more musclecells Muscle cells were not going to generate liver cells            How doesdifferentiation work We dont really know We do know that every cell containsan identical and complete set of genetic instructions the genome As cellsmature however they switch on some parts of those instructions and switchoff others The cells in your muscle tissue switch on muscle genes The cellsin your liver switch on liver genes But we cant explain this processwhysome cells express some genes and not others The process of development ordifferentiation is one of the least understood in biology At one end of theblack box you put in a simple cell the fertilized egg and out of the otheryou get a sheep an earthworm a humana mature animal of staggeringstructural complexity            Dolly is living proof that the process can gobackward Dolly is derived from a single mammary cell Conventional wisdomwould have dictated that mammary cells which are highly differentiated andspecialized could produce only more mammary cells But the mammary DNA thatgave rise to Dolly became dedifferentiated  capable of generating thefull range of different cell types that make up a sheep            Given thehightech world of modern biology the method by which the Scottish teammanaged to provoke this extraordinary dedifferentiation is almost oldfashionedin its simplicity In Dollys case they took a mammary cell and grew it on apetri dish in cell culture so that it produced more copies of itself They thenessentially starved the cells so that they shut down normal metabolic functionentering a quiescent state in which dedifferentiation apparently occurs TheDNA from one of these cells was then transferred into an unfertilized sheep eggcell from which they had carefully removed the DNA Unfertilized eggs containonly the mothers half of genes by adding the genes from an adult mammarycellwhich has both its mothers and fathers genesthe egg cell then had thefull amount of DNA found in adult sheep cells The egg cell was biochemicallypreprogrammed to commence development and that apparently was enough tojerk the mammarycell DNA out of its quiescent state The egg was put into asurrogate sheep mother and  weeks later we got Dolly            One question that inevitably comes up is whether there issomething peculiar about the way sheep mammary tissues differentiate A secondresult in the Scottish study that has been largely ignored by the mediabutwhich is in biological terms equally importantsuggests that the answer isno Biologist Ian Wilmuts team also cloned lambs out of DNA derived fromsheepfetus fibroblasts cells found in connective tissue Even in a fetus afibroblast is as highly specialized and fully differentiated as a mammary cellDolly is more of a media magnet than her unnamed fibroblastderived cousinsbecause she came from adult tissue Biologically though the two experimentsare comparable In both cases differentiated DNA became sufficientlydedifferentiated to generate a whole new sheep The result is therefore notmammaryspecific but more general            Dolly and herfibroblastderived cousins have changed forever the way we think about animaldevelopment Cells in mature animal tissues are not as we had thoughtirreversibly differentiated Understanding differentiation is the key tounderstanding development and Dolly embodies the extraordinary possibility ofmanipulating the processof doing experiments to identify the basicconstruction rules used in putting animals together
