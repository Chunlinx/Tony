                                 NAFTA Math            When the Clintonadministration releases its analysis of the impact of the North American FreeTrade Agreement this month NAFTA critics will seize on the data Theyll pointto the  American workers certified by the US Department of Labor ashaving lost their jobs because of the agreement as evidence of the treatysdangers They will be pointing in the wrong direction            A WallStreet Journal reporter recently examined some of these jobloss cases andfound that most had little or nothing to do with NAFTA Like the  unionizedworkers in the Pabst brewery that moved from Milwaukee to a nonunionized plantin La Crosse Wisc Or the unionized employees of a Memphis toilet tissue millthat sold out to a nonunion company which reopened the mill on the samespot            The Labor Department responds that it is not to blame forthe sloppy way in which Congress seeking to soften union opposition to NAFTAin  drafted the NAFTA monitoring rules The law for example does not saythat the closing of a brewery or other plant has to be directly attributableto NAFTAinduced trade in order for the displaced workers to be eligible for anextra year of unemployment benefits and other adjustment assistance Itrequires only that imports of beer or whatever from Canada or Mexicoincreased during the relevant period Nor does it matter whether as in thecase of a SmithCorona factory the employer had already planned to move theoperation to Mexico all that counts is that the move was made and that it costUS jobs at some time after NAFTA became law            Officialsalso point out that many of the certified NAFTA victims drew little or nobenefits Instead they retired found other jobsor applied for regular TradeAdjustment Assistance a larger older and also muchabused program Mostworkers who have traditionally been resistant to government efforts toadjust them prefer regular TAA to NAFTA aid because TAA rules which requireworkers to sign up for retraining in order to get cash are more laxlyenforced In fact the only advantage NAFTA benefits have is that they may beclaimed when jobs are lost to plant relocations whereas TAA is restricted tojob losses related to higher imports            As a result the NAFTA benefits program whilegrowing still costs less than  million a year But the Labor Departmentcautions the low usage level doesnt mean that harm hasnt occurred Manyworkers injured by trade are likely to be employed by small nonunionizedcompanies and either unaware of the trade benefits which unions activelypeddle to their laidoff members or in service jobs that are not coveredStill while these exclusions may bolster the jobloss claims of the NAFTAattackers they are hardly an advertisement for the equity of the adjustmentthey embrace            Even ifit were possible to find and help every worker directly or indirectly hurt bytrade pacts why should they have a larger claim for public help than thosewhose jobs are lost to technological change Or to shifts in consumer tastelousy management an overpriced dollar or domestic competition Government didnot create trade It created trade barriers When it removes them should itincur a special obligation to the formerly protected            In any case NAFTA foes can make no credible jobloss caseon the basis of Labor Department certifications They may find some comforthowever in the aggregate trade statistics Last year Canada ran a  billiontrade surplus with the United States Mexico once a net importer of USproducts chalked up a  billion export surplus with the United Stateswhile running a roughly equivalent trade deficit with Asia and Europe fromwhich it imports large quantities of machinery and partially processed goodsfor final manufacture in Mexico This year the numbers are projected to beroughly the same though Mexicos US surplus is expected to shrinksomewhat            But thenet US deficits are only a small part of a larger picture of growinghemispheric integration Since the pact the total volume of trade among theNAFTA countries has grown substantially with partially fabricated goods andparts moving back and forth across borders before reaching consumers Inaddition to efficiency gains these flows have helped Mexico recover from itsneardeath experience in early  when an orgy of import buying led to thecollapse of the peso and the flight of investor capital Since then austerityhas curbed Mexican buying of European luxuries and higher tariffs have helpedstem the influx of cheap Asian textiles and footwear that threatened itslowend industries However the primary engine of Mexican recovery asMexicos NAFTA minister in Washington Luis de la Calle stressesand the mainhope for spreading internal prosperity in which the United States has a largestakehas been export growth with the United States the principal buyer            Even for tradeworriers NAFTA must be rated asmallpotato concern The Canadian and Mexican trade surpluses are piddlingcompared to the nearly  billion total trade deficit the United States willlikely incur this year Or even compared to the  billion surplus projectedfor Japan which despite its poormouthing continues to enjoy much highergrowth and lower inflation and unemployment than the prideful United StatesStill more striking is that Chinawhich buys only onesixth as much fromAmerica as Japan doesis expected to ring up its own  billion trade surpluswith the US market The American consumer should of course be grateful forthe opportunity to buy all these fine goods on the credit thus extended Andtrust that our foreign creditors will remain willing to invest their surplusdollars in US securities and other assets and to reinvest the proceeds fromthose investments within our borders in a kindly fashion But should thatwillingness ever falter one thing is sure No worker adjustment program willbe able to measure the harm much less assuage it
