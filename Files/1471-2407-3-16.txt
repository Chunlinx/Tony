                    Background        Radiotherapy treatment planning is in broad terms the        process of planning the delivery of a prescribed dose to a        tumor or target volume while minimizing dose to the        surrounding critical structures Prior to the modern        radiotherapy treatment planning era the optimum plan was        decided upon using qualitative criteria or by estimating        the inhomogeneity of the dose in the target or in critical        regions With the advent of CTbased planning the planning        process could be done with increased precision as        dimensional structures representing the target and        critical structures could be defined more accurately and        reproducibly One of the most useful tools which emerged in        the dimensional planning era that could be used in        establishing the acceptability or unacceptability of a        treatment plan is the dosevolume histogram DVH                   The DVH is used ubiquitously and plots delivered dose on        the xaxis and percent volume of the structure of interest        on the yaxis The general shape and area under the DVH        curve is instrumental in determining adequate coverage and        homogeneity of dose in the target volume as well as in        determining acceptable dose to critical structures Indeed        the DVH has occupied a central role in modern treatment        planning               The DVH is not without its limitations however First        there is an inherent loss of spatial information with the        construction of a DVH plot Second the dose plotted on the        xaxis of a conventional DVH CDVH is conventional dose        which does not take into account many factors influencing        the effects of the dose on the given tissue Among them are        the  of the structure which can vary considerably for        early vs late reacting tissues and for early vs late        reactions within the same tissue time taken to deliver        treatment fraction size and length of treatment        interruptions For this reason the concept of        biologicaleffective dose BED was developed     and        has been studied extensively by the radiobiology community        Because the BED incorporates factors related to delivery of        treatment and tissue factors it is a better representation        of the dose delivered to a given tissue than conventional        dose              The application of BED has particular importance to        radiation treatment planning for prostate cancer The        prostate more so than any other disease site has been the        focus of advances in treatment delivery technique The        prostate has been the paradigm site for treatment planning        efforts related to conformal therapy       and        intensity modulated radiotherapy IMRTinverse planning             Also the prostate has been the leading disease        site for efforts related to improving daily setup           and incorporating organ motion into the delivery strategy            These above efforts have allowed for dose escalation        of the prostate while minimizing early and late treatment        toxicity                  In view of the lead role the prostate has taken in        understanding treatment planning patient setup and dose        escalation incorporation of treatmentrelated information        into the DVH  to further facilitate advances in reduction        of rectal or urinary toxicity  is highly appropriate The        purpose of the current investigation is to compare CDVHs        of the bladder and rectum in those patients who developed        late treatment toxicity versus those patients who did not        develop such toxicity and using the same groups of        patients to determine whether the biologicaleffective DVH        BEDDVH can potentially serve as a better tool for such        toxicity comparisons than the CDVH                    Methods        A generalized theoretical model for determination of        biological effective dose has been developed and reported        extensively       Recently our group has applied        this model for use with any combination of shortlived        interstitial brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy        for prostate cancer unpublishedsubmitted data  For        external beam radiotherapy the generalized BED model        reduces to the familiar equation        BED  nd  d  TTp         where n  number of treatments d  dose per fraction T         treatment time    Gyfor late effects and Tp        potential doubling time and  linear component of cell        killing were estimated from the published literature                  to be  days and Gy respectively The        first term in Equation  accounts for dose fractionation        and the second term accounts for repopulation The authors        recognize that there is considerable controversy in the        exact values used for   and Tp for prostate cancer in        the reported literature        The charts of  consecutive patients with T or T        prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy at        our institution between  were reviewed During        this period external beam radiotherapy was delivered using        field technique once daily  times a week using         cGy or  cGy fractions to a final dose of  cGy        minimum PTV dose The conformal techniques at our        institution have been previously reported     the        prostate seminal vesicles rectum and bladder were        outlined routinely on all patients and uniform guidelines        were adhered to in order to minimize interobserver        variability in the definition of these structures In        particular with regard to the rectum our institution        followed routine Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RTOG        guidelines for definition  from the anus at the level of        the ischial tuberosities lower border to the rectosigmoid        junction upper border     The bladder was contoured        from the apex to the dome again as outlined per RTOG        guidelines The planning target volume PTV was the        prostate  seminal vesicles   cm margin for the initial        phase after  cGy the PTV was the prostate   cm        margin Corresponding DVHs were computed for the PTV        entire rectum ie not the rectal wall or rectal        surface and entire bladder again not the bladder wall        or bladder surface The dosefractionation and total        treatment time for each patient were recorded to obtain        values for n d and T in Equation  above        No charts for those patients treated after  were        reviewed to ensure long minimum followup At each routine        followup the GI and GU complications using definitions        and grading as stated by the RTOG    were recorded        Thus the charts were reviewed to identify those patients        with significant RTOG grade  or grade  late GI large        bowel or GU bladder complications        Of the  patients  patients  were found to        have late grade  rectal toxicity and  patients         were found to have late grade  urinary toxicity No        patients were found to have grade  GI or GU toxicity A        matchedpair group of patients  GI and  GU with grade         toxicity having similar pretreatment age stage grade        and PSA and treatment technique and dose characteristics        were identified from the same patient database The        characteristics of the groups are shown in comparison with        the groups of patients demonstrating toxicity in Tables        and  The limitations and potential biases inherent to a        matchedpair comparison are wellunderstood by the authors        however as these tables demonstrate there is no        difference in the pretreatment and treatment        characteristics between the groups demonstrating and not        demonstrating GI Table  and GU Table  toxicity        The CDVHs were already constructed prior to        undertaking the current investigation for the patients in        each of the four groups grade   rectal grade          rectal grade   bladder grade   bladder  these are        the CDVHs that were approved by the attending radiation        oncologist prior to delivering the external beam treatment        Then these CDVHs derived from each of the individual        dose distributions were averaged over the six patients in        each of the four groups grade   rectal grade          rectal grade   bladder and grade   bladder to        produce average CDVHs        Using equation  the timedose fractionation        parameters were incorporated to transform the conventional        dose to BED at each conventional dose level This allowed        for the construction of the BEDDVHs for all of the        patients Then in a process similar to that for the        CDVHs the BEDDVHs derived from each of the individual        dose distributions were averaged over the six patients in        each of the four groups grade   rectal grade          rectal grade   bladder and grade   bladder to        produce average BEDDVHs The authors are aware of the        recent efforts regarding advanced modeling concepts for        evaluating the relationship between physical irradiation        and biological damage on normal structures  in particular        BED provides a measure of biological effect at a point at        which it is calculated  measuring the absolute biological        effect over a volume having a nonuniform dose distribution        formally requires the computation of the equivalent uniform        dose EUD     However this caveat does not apply        directly to the current task because the goal of the        current investigation is to use the DVH constructed using        either conventional dose or BED as a         relative measure of biological        response not as an absolute measure and in this context        constructing a DVH from BED computations and averaging the        DVHs both CDVHs and BEDDVHs over a patient        population was felt to be an appropriate methodology        After construction of the CDVHs and BEDDVHs it was        clear that the general shape of the two were slightly        different as would be expected by the nonlinear        transformation in Equation  above In order to perform        comparison of the individual matched pairs in an objective        reproducible and systematic manner the following measure        of normalized difference in the average DVH was        computed                Equation  represents an attempt to compress the DVH        difference information into a single quantity and was felt        to be a valid quantity as the DVHs did not cross  that        is the grade  DVHs were above and to the right of the        grade  DVHs at all dose or BED levels Furthermore        this approach was felt to be valid biologically as        integral dose to critical structures has been correlated by        many investigators with late treatment toxicity                  The authors are also aware of the special        problems related to applying the DVH for tubular and        surface structures such as the rectum and bladder             However because CDVHs of the whole organs were used        as the basis for the original clinical decision making on        the patient population under consideration ie those        treated before  it was felt that integral dose to the        entire rectum and entire bladder would be appropriate as        one measure for clinical comparison of the use of BEDDVHs        versus CDVHs        Equation  was applied to compute the          AUC s both for the CDVHs and for the        BEDDVHs for each of the six matchedpatient pairs in the        rectal toxicity category and to each of the six        matchedpatient pairs in the bladder toxicity category In        order to perform a statistical comparison between these        matchedpair          AUC s obtained using CDVHs and those        obtained using BEDDVHs the students ttest was        used        Although the treatment decisions were made with        knowledge of the integral dose delivered to the critical        structures the authors recognize that there is controversy        with regard to the classification of biological response of        the normal structures under study in the current        investigation In particular many recent reports eg            suggest that the bladder and rectum may be serial        rather than parallel structures with regard to their        biological response to radiation injury Thus an        alternative measure of merit was chosen to complement the        AUC analysis above Specifically the percent volume        receiving above a set high dose level in this study         Gy was analyzed The analogous expression to Equation         is the following                Equation  was applied in exactly the same manner as        above to compute          V s for the CDVHs and BEDDVHs for        both the bladder and rectum It should be noted that when        applying Equation  to the BEDDVHs the  Gy        conventional dose transforms using Equation  assuming        oncedaily  Gy fractions to approximately  Gy thus        V on the CDVHs corresponds to V on the BEDDVHs        The statistical comparison between the matchedpair          V s obtained between CDVHs and        BEDDVHs was performed using the students ttest                    Results        As expected the DVHs both CDVHs and BEDDVHs were        predictive of rectal and urinary toxicity  that is those        that developed late GI or GU toxicity had DVHs that        demonstrated more integral dose to the rectum or bladder        than those patients who did not develop such toxicity This        reinforces and validates the wellknown and widespread use        of DVHs in evaluating external beam                 and interstitial    treatment plans for prostate        cancer patients        Figure shows the comparison for the case of the        conventional DVHs of the rectum In this figure the        average CDVH of the rectum was computed for the  patients        in the grade  group as well as the  patients in the grade         group The average DVHs are displayed  as is        demonstrated the grade  curve is to the right of and        above the grade  curve Similar analyses were done for the        BEDDVHRectum as demonstrated in Figure  for the        CDVHBladder as demonstrated in Figure  and for the        BEDDVHBladder as demonstrated in Figure  It should be        noted that in all cases the average grade  DVHs         conventional or BED  were consistently above and to the        right of the corresponding grade  curve at each dose or        BED level from zero to maximum again validating the        uniform comparison approach summarized in Equations  and                Table shows the results of the detailed matchedpair        AUC analysis In this table the          AUC s obtained using the CDVHs and        BEDDVHs for each of the matchedpatient pairs is        displayed The students ttest was used to obtain a        pvalue for each of the rectal toxicity and bladder        toxicity categories As Table displays the          AUC analysis demonstrates a pvalue of         for the rectal toxicity comparison and a pvalue of         for the bladder toxicity comparison suggesting that        when using AUC as the measure of merit the BEDDVHs were        significantly bettercorrelated than the corresponding        CDVHs with rectal toxicity and marginally        bettercorrelated with bladder toxicity        Table displays the results of the matchedpair V        analysis In this table the          V s obtained using the CDVHs and        BEDDVHs for each of the matchedpatient pairs is        displayed This table demonstrates a pvalue of  for        the rectal toxicity comparison and a pvalue of  for        the bladder toxicity comparison suggesting that when        using V as the measure of merit the BEDDVHs were        significantly bettercorrelated than the corresponding        CDVHs with rectal toxicity and with bladder        toxicity                    Conclusions        The values for          AUC and          V are higher for the BEDDVHs of the        rectum and bladder than for the counterpart CDVHs        Because the AUC and V are dosimetric endpoints used        routinely for the evaluation of radiation treatment plans        this analysis suggests that BEDDVHs for the rectum and        bladder correlate better with late toxicity than CDVHs        and should be considered when attempting to minimize late        GI and GU toxicity after radiotherapy for prostate cancer        Because this analysis was performed with two independent        measures of merit of the DVHs  the AUC and the V the        early results reported herein appear promising for the use        of BEDDVHs        Because the patient population having late grade         toxicity which is a small population but was chosen as the        target population that is most likely to benefit from the        incorporation of BEDDVHs into the process of treatment        planning was the focus of this initial investigation the        number of patients in the current study is understandably        small Six cases of late grade  GI toxicity represent        approximately  of the study population  this low        incidence also applies to the six cases of late grade         GU toxicity Assuming that the same low rate of late        toxicity is maintained the number of cases of such late        complications will not increase significantly with a        significant increase in size of the study population Thus        while the results are encouraging for the correlation of        BEDDVHs to rectal toxicity the correlation to bladder        toxicity using the integral doseAUC endpoint did not reach        statistical significance likely due to the limitations in        sample size However because the integral doseAUC        analysis did reach significance for the rectum and because        the V analysis did reach statistical significance for        both the bladder and rectum the results of the current        investigation represent initial success with the        application of the BEDDVH concept        As one means of avoiding the statistical problems posed        by evaluating late toxicity analyzing early grade         toxicity which has a higher incidence may allow for        greater statistical power in validating the BEDDVH        concept However because the modeling for the Tp alpha        and alphabeta is altogether different for early vs late        structures and because the transformation between late to        early parameters in Equations  above are nonlinear        the results of the current analysis and corresponding        conclusions may be completely different from such an early        toxicity analysis For these reasons the use of BEDDVHs        for evaluating and predicting early GI and GU toxicity will        be the subject of a separate communication        The results of the current investigation are encouraging         the wellknown conventional DVH can be successfully        expanded to include treatment delivery tissue biology and        timefractionationrelated information that better        represents the true effect of the treatment on critical        structures Other investigators have expanded the CDVH to        include functional and spatial information              but         the current investigation is the first        report correlating a DVH which has been expanded to include        BED parameters with late treatment toxicity for prostate        cancer irradiation         Although the initial focus of this investigation was the        study of late radiation effects on the rectum and bladder        there is no conceptual limitation to the use of the        techniques described herein to study early effects of        treatment for acute toxicity assessment or to study        target structures for outcomesurvival analysis at any        anatomic site The results of the current investigation        while encouraging are preliminary and require validation        by other investigators  because of the low incidence of        late grade  complications such an analysis might be        better undertaken at a multiinstitutional level                    Competing interests        None Declared                    Authors contributions        ABJ designed and coordinated the
