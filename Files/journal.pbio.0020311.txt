                    Phytohormones What Are they        Plant growth and development involves the integration of many environmental and        endogenous signals that together with the intrinsic genetic program determine plant form        Fundamental to this process are several growth regulators collectively called the plant        hormones or phytohormones This group includes auxin cytokinin the gibberellins GAs        abscisic acid ABA ethylene the brassinosteroids BRs and jasmonic acid JA each of        which acts at low concentrations to regulate many aspects of plant growth and        development        With the notable exception of the steroidal hormones of the BR group plant hormones        bear little resemblance to their animal counterparts Figure  Rather they are        relatively simple small molecules such as ethylene gas and indoleacetic acid IAA the        primary auxin in the majority of plant species The concept of plant hormones originates        from a classical experiment on phototropism the bending of plants toward light carried        out by Charles Darwin and his son Francis in  The Darwins were able to demonstrate        that when oat seedlings were exposed to a lateral light source a transported signal        originating from the plant apex promoted differential cell elongation in the lower parts of        the seedling that resulted in it bending toward the light source This signal was        subsequently shown to be IAA the first known plant hormone                    What Do They Do        Virtually every aspect of plant growth and development is under hormonal control to some        degree A single hormone can regulate an amazingly diverse array of cellular and        developmental processes while at the same time multiple hormones often influence a single        process Wellstudied examples include the promotion of fruit ripening by ethylene        regulation of the cell cycle by auxin and cytokinin induction of seed germination and stem        elongation by GA and the maintenance of seed dormancy by ABA Historically the effects of        each hormone have been defined largely by the application of exogenous hormone More        recently the isolation of hormone biosynthetic and response mutants has provided powerful        new tools for painting a clearer picture of the roles of the various phytohormones in plant        growth and development                    How Do They Work        Plant biologists have been fascinated by the regulatory capacity of phytohormones since        the time of their discovery and the notion that hormone levels or responses could be        manipulated to improve desired plant traits has long been an area of intense interest        Perhaps the bestknown example of this is the isolation of dwarf varieties of wheat and        rice that led to the green revolution in the second half of the th century which is        credited with saving millions of people around the globe from starvation These dwarf        varieties have shorter stems than wildtype making these plants less susceptible to damage        by wind and rain The molecular isolation of these dwarfing genes has revealed that they        encode components of the GA biosynthesis and response pathways Peng et al  Sasaki et        al         To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying phytohormone action several        researchers have utilized the genetically facile model plant         Arabidopsis thaliana to isolate mutations that confer altered        response to applied hormone Molecular and biochemical analysis of the gene products        defined by these mutations coupled with expression studies aimed at identifying the        downstream target genes that mediate hormonal changes in growth and development has begun        to unlock some of the mysteries behind phytohormone action While no hormone transduction        pathway is completely understood we now have a rudimentary understanding of many of the        molecular events underlying hormone action Several reviews covering the individual hormone        pathways in greater detail have recently been published Turner et al  Gomi and        Matsuoka  Himmelbach et al  Kakimoto  Dharmasiri and Estelle  Guo and        Ecker  Wang and He                     Common Themes        Regulation by proteolysis has emerged as a resounding theme in plant hormone signaling        The ubiquitinmediated degradation of key regulatory proteins has been demonstrated or is        at least likely for all of the phytohormone response pathways Smalle and Vierstra         In the case of auxin the response pathway is normally subject to repression by a large        family of transcriptional regulators called the AuxIAA proteins Figure  These proteins        dimerize with members of the auxin response factor ARF family of transcription factors        thus preventing ARFs from activating auxinresponsive genes Tiwari et al  Upon an        auxin stimulus an SCF SKPCullinFbox protein ubiquitin ligase Deshaies         containing the TIR Fbox protein ubiquitinates the AuxIAA proteins marking them for        degradation by the S proteasome thereby derepressing the response pathway Gray et al         The hormone promotes the AuxIAATIR interaction however the molecular mechanisms        behind this regulation are unclear Most yeast and animal SCF substrates must be        posttranslationally modified usually by phosphorylation before they are recognized by        their cognate Fbox protein Despite numerous efforts to identify auxininduced        modification of AuxIAA proteins no such signal has been discovered raising the distinct        possibility that auxin uses a novel mechanism to regulate SCFsubstrate interactions        Ethylene and cytokinin are both perceived by receptors sharing similarity to bacterial        twocomponent regulators Common in prokaryotes but apparently restricted to plants and        fungi in eukaryotes these modular signaling systems involve a membranebound receptor        containing an intracellular histidine kinase HK domain Wolanin et al  Ligand        binding activates the kinase resulting in autophosphorylation and initiation of a series        of phosphotransfer reactions that culminates with the activation of a response regulator        protein that functions as the effector component of the pathway Cytokinin signaling        appears to largely follow this paradigm Kakimoto  Ethylene response however        appears more complex Guo and Ecker         Ethylene is perceived by a family of five receptors ETR and ERS contain a consensus        HK domain however the HK domains of ETR ERS and EIN are degenerate and lack elements        necessary for catalytic activity This fact together with studies of kinasedead mutants        of         ETR  suggests that HK activity is not required for ethylene response        Mutations that abolish ethylene binding in any of the five receptor genes are dominant and        confer ethylene insensitivity indicating that the receptors function as negative        regulators of the ethylene pathway        Genetic and molecular studies have positioned these receptors upstream of the Raflike        MAP kinase kinase kinase CTR which interacts with the receptors and also acts as a        negative regulator Figure  The integral membrane protein EIN and the transcription        factors EIN and EIL are positive regulators of ethylene signaling downstream of CTR        Current models propose that hormone binding inactivates the receptors thus resulting in        downregulation of CTR activity Since the identification of CTR biologists have        speculated that a MAP kinase cascade may be involved Only recently however have putative        MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase components of the ethylene pathway been identified Chang         Interestingly these kinases appear to positively regulate ethylene response        suggesting that CTR must inhibit their function If so this would represent a novel twist        on the traditional MAP kinase signaling paradigm Precisely how the ethylene signal is        transduced to the EIN and EIL transcription factors remains unclear However the recent        finding that ethylene stabilizes these transcription factors which are targeted for        degradation by an SCF complex in the absence of ethylene clearly indicates a role for the        ubiquitin pathway Guo and Ecker  Potuschak et al  One of the known targets for        EIN is the ERF transcription factor which activates several genes involved in a subset        of ethylene responses                    Signal Integration and Combinatorial Control        Long ago plant physiologists noted the apparent antagonistic interactions between some        of the phytohormones such as between auxin and cytokinin in the regulation of rootshoot        differentiation and between GA and ABA in germination Other processes are synergistically        regulated by multiple hormones While it has long been obvious that hormones do not        function in discrete pathways but rather exhibit extensive crosstalk and signal        integration with each other and with environmental and developmental signaling pathways        the molecular basis for such coordinated regulation has been unclear Several recent        findings have begun to elucidate the molecular details of some of these events        One example of such signal integration was recently described for the ethylene and JA        pathways Lorenzo et al  Genetic studies had previously implicated both hormones as        important regulators of pathogen defense responses as well as of the wounding response and        other stressrelated pathways Additionally microarray analysis has identified a large        number of genes that are responsive to both hormones The ERF transcription factor was        recently found to be an intersection point for these two signaling pathways Lorenzo et al         Like ethylene JA rapidly induces         ERF expression and treatment with both hormones synergistically        activates         ERF  Induction of         ERF by both hormones alone or in combination is dependent upon both        signaling pathways and constitutive overexpression of         ERF rescues the defenseresponse defects of both ethylene and        JAinsensitive mutants These findings suggest that         ERF represents one of the first signaling nodes identified in the        complex web of hormonal crosstalk        The auxin and BR pathways also appear to converge and mutually regulate some        developmental processes Both hormones promote cell expansion and microarray studies have        revealed that as many as  of all BRinduced genes are also upregulated by auxin Goda        et al  Nemhauser et al  BR is perceived by the cell surface receptor kinase        BRI Wang and He  The SHAGGYGSKtype kinase BIN acts as a negative regulator of        the pathway downstream of the receptor In the absence of a BR signal BIN phosphorylates        the transcription factors BES and BZR targeting them for proteolysis by the S        proteasome Upon a BR stimulus BIN is inactivated allowing BES and BZRto accumulate in        the nucleus where they are presumably involved in regulating BRresponsive genes        Using combined genetic physiological and genomic approaches Nemhauser and colleagues         were able to demonstrate that auxin and BR regulate         Arabidopsis hypocotyl embryonic stem elongation in a        synergistic and interdependent fashion Elevating endogenous auxin levels rendered plants        more sensitive to BR application in hypocotyl elongation assays and this response was        dependent upon both the auxin and BR signaling pathways Genetic studies suggest that the        convergence of these two pathways occurs at a late point in hormone signaling perhaps at        the promoters of the many genes responsive to both hormones In support of this notion        bioinformatic analysis identified distinct sequence elements that were enriched        specifically in the promoters of auxininduced BRinduced and auxinBRinduced genes                    Many Unanswered Questions        While great strides have been made in recent years in understanding the molecular basis        of phytohormone action many fundamental questions remain Receptors and other upstream        signaling components remain to be identified for the majority of the phytohormones Equally        important are the elucidation of hormonal networks and the integration of these networks        with the morphogenetic program such that our understanding of hormone action can be placed        in a developmental context
