          um do you have any elderly parents or grandparents that have ever had to go in a nursing home   uh yes my uh mother was in a nursing home for five years before she passed away in nineteen seventy seven   oh oh now was it how did you feel about that was it a good nursing home and you felt good about her being there or   it was a fair nursing home   a fair one   uh it it was a matter uh she reached the point where she couldnt stay by herself during the daytime she and my sister who never married lived together   umhum oh   and my sister couldnt retire at the time so my uh mothers physician recommended that uh she go into a nursing home   uhhuh uhhuh oh uhhuh   and fortunately my sister was able to go visit her twice a day   oh wow that is good   and uh   boy ill say that is good   she she just reached the point where she had to have professional care she was eighty two at the time   umhum my word so she couldnt take care of herself at all   yeah   did how did she feel about it did she how did your mother feel about it   well i dont think she ever really adjusted   didnt she   uh my mother was very very shy she never joined anything   oh oh   and uh she realized that it was something that had to be done   uhhuh   but she had begun to lose a great deal of of her memory capacity at the time   oh umhum   and finally about uh oh say about a year before she died my sister was the only person that she ever really recognized and could call by name   my word oh oh boy now what about the expense part of it was it an expensive one or did her did she have health insurance or Medicaid   uh no uh oh several years before well its a long thirty minute story but uh when my father died in nineteen fifty eight uh i uh transferred the title to my sister     umhum oh   uh which was an internal family deal i i knew that if something happened and my sister couldnt take care of her i would   uhhuh   oh uhhuh   but uh uh       we had fixed it for her uh oh many years before she went into the nursing home like about fifteen so that she had no assets so as it turned out Medicaid paid for all of it   uhhuh oh oh oh great   uh   well that helps because i know that it can take a persons whole life life savings i   yeah yeah yeah   um my parents are not quite that old yet but my grandmother um right now is in this situation where she cannot stay alone at home either and so um her she has four daughters and one son and the four daughters rotate and keep her for three months at a time and they are all in a position where they can do that right now and then my husbands grandmother about oh probably two years ago she fell and broke her hip   umhum umhum umhum   and of course she had to go into the nursing home there and and it was a fairly nice one in fact she got to where she enjoyed it there she knew the staff and knew the other people that were there and and in fact when she came home she was able to get better and come home she really missed the association with the people there   umhum   and i but i dont know i i whenever i go into a nursing home i uh for some reason it it makes me feel sad i because i a lot of people i know are there just because um you know their families want them there and and they dont they arent willing to take care of them and i i think thats a sad situation   yeah   um   my my uh other sister   umhum   uh who was married at the time and was still working   umhum   worked for several years in a nursing home and she said roughly half   oh uhhuh   of the people dont have anybody   oh no   and nobody ever comes to see them   my word that many of them   yeah thats too bad   oh boy i it is i i dont know a nursing home seems to be such a a non personal environment the ones that ive been to um i have been to one that seemed really you know warm and cozy but for the most part theyve seemed you know no carpet on the floors and just kind of cold and  i i   yeah i know and they all seem understaffed and the staffs overworked   right thats right yeah so   well lets face it there there for the most part well theres one exception that ill tell you about in a minute uh for the most part theyre profit centers   uhhuh thats right   uh but uh my my sister who looked after my mother   thats right   uh lets see she died in ninety so this would have been the first of the year in nineteen eighty nine she made   uhhuh uhhuh
