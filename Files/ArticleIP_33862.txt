                                 The Blues            One thing that separatesintuitive artists from hacks and players is their difficulty doing evenmediocre work when their cylinders arent firing In the absence of trueinspiration they cant fall back on a crafty understanding of what theaudience wants because they dont really know what the audience wants Theyfollow their instincts and pray that theyll connect When they dont theresult is something like The Muse  which left me more dispirited thanany movie in ages has Albert Brooks is my hero and I dont like the thoughtof people seeing this dud satire and concluding that he has lost his way Moreto the point I dont like the thought that he has lost his way            At least The Musetackles this subject head onthe loss of ones way in a culture as venal asHollywoods The protagonist Steven Phillips Brooks is a middleagedscreenwriter whose threepicture deal is terminated by a callow executive MarkFeuerstein who tells him he no longer has his edge When other studios showno interest Steven goes to cry on the shoulder of an old friend Jack WarrickJeff Bridges a vastly successful writerproducer Tanned and beaming after astring of recent triumphs Jack decides to introduce his old buddy to hismuse Sarah Sharon Stonea goddess of inspiration supposedly descendedfrom the ancient Greeks Sarah we learn played a part in the latest hits ofRob Reiner Martin Scorsese and James Cameron all of whom show up to payhomage and bring expensive gifts Although hes incredulous Steven cantafford to pass up a chance to get his edge back especially with a wifeAndie MacDowell and kids and a house in Pacific Palisades to maintain In notime Sarah orders him to put her up in a anight suite on a high floorof the Four Seasons shes an ultrasensitive sleeper provide a limousine andbe ready to work at whatever hour she feels the urge to inspire him            In the first halfhour The Muse plays a littleflatly but thats not too troublingartful flatness has always been acomponent of Brooks genius The camera stares unblinking at Steven inconversation with uncomprehending or contemptuous superiors The message isthat theres no escape from the ignominy not even through the often lameoneliners he employs to win them over When he goes for a meeting with MrSpielberg Steven is denied driveon privileges the camera holds on him ashe makes the long grueling hike through the studio compound and a passingtour bus driver draws attention to his lowly walkon status Then he findsthe meeting is with Stan Spielberg scragglyhaired Steven Wright whohasnt seen his famous cousin in a year and doesnt even know what hessupposed to be doing there This is familiar Brooksian territory impotenceprolonged and stylized until it turns into Theater of the Absurd The universeexists to humiliate Brooks protagonists to remind them of the precariousnessof everything that theyd smugly assumed was fixedthe steadiness of a jobthe permanence of a relationship the support of a mother the benign regard ofthe universe            In The Muse however the masochism feels a little too reflexive and the pictures flatnessgets flatter by the minute Brooks is baking with dead yeast As it turns outthe movie isnt about the mystery of creativity but rather the New Age idiocyof people whod accept the idea of a museor by extension of gurus or smartdrugs or the power of cabala For some reason Brooks and his cowriter MonicaJohnson have made their protagonist an unbelievably uninteresting manamopey scattershot hack Brooks might disagree He told Gavin Smith in FilmComment that Steven is a good screenwriter going through the exact periodthat tons of screenwriters are Ninetynine percent of writers write forhire  They all get scared when the executives become younger than theirchildren they get worried that theyre not going to get those jobs anymore sothey start writing things that maybe they dont love or theyre not close toBut Brooks hasnt provided any evidence that Steven was ever a decent writerHis screenplay ideas in the company of the muse are pathetically feeble andwhen she encourages themand when they find favor with Stevens agent and theexecutives whod previously spurned himthe point seems to be thateveryone in the film industry is a moron            Brooks who is often accused wrongly of playing himselfhas left himself too far out of The Muse  At least I hope he has Howelse to account for this bland pasty not terribly funny protagonist Theheroes of Real Life  Modern Romance  and Lost inAmerica  have their jerky sides emotionally squeamish viewers tendto find them repellent but they also have compensatory giftschiefly Brooksurgent babble in which pleas are made and then restated and then turned insideout in a way that brilliantly and hilariously distills neurotic thoughtprocesses His advertising executive in Lost in America has zero insightinto himself but hes still an idealist who boldly attempts to live out theescapist fantasies of his generation He hasas buffoons goenormous statureWith his next film Defending Your Life  Brooks tried to make hisalter ego more palatable to a mass audienceto seem vulnerable instead ofinsecure See my                   Slate                of Brooks  movie Mother forthe quotation The result was often charming but the upbeat goforit endingfelt simpleminded Brooks best scenes operate on an Xray level of honestyso that shortcuts formulas easy ways out of dramatic jamsstuff that slickerfilmmakers can get by withseem in his work embarrassingly exposed                           Lost in               America is a road movie that suggests the impossibility of travelperhaps Brooks conceived of The Muse as a movie about the creativespirit that would subversively suggest the impossibilityat least inHollywoodof creation That might have worked if his characters showed signsof having deeper yearnings the way they do in many of Paul Mazurskys LosAngelesset satires so that there would be some tension between what theythink they want and what they actually need But the characters in TheMuse are dullwitted materialists and limp encounter follows limpencounter until the movie seems populated by pod people A hint that somethingis off comes early when Steven receives a humanitarian award A nice touchIts presented by Cybill Shepherd who did some of the most attractive scenesof her career opposite Brooks in Taxi Driver   Steven gives awinning perhaps too selfdeprecating speech then holds his plaque high andcrows Im king of the room And no one laughsthe audience stares at himpuzzled Brooks has spent too much time by himself if he thinks people in LosAngeles wouldnt get that joke even the nonEnglishspeaking busboys would becackling            How is Sharon Stone at comedy Thats a trick questionbecause her best performance in Basic Instinct  was essentiallya comic turna lusty glitteryeyed sendup of film noir femmes fatales Here she starts promisingly looking odd and imposing in her caftanschildishly impervious to the absurdity of her demands But shesheavyspirited and it isnt long before she runs out of invention and startspulling goofy faceslike the one where she sucks a drink through a straw androlls her eyes skyward like a distracted yearold She isnt mercurial enoughto be funny Shes just a narcissistic dope and you come to feel contempt foranyone whod swallow her bull Stones scenes with MacDowellwhom she inspiresto bake cookiesare the deadest that Brooks has ever directed and his ownwith MacDowell are only marginally more lively If you want an actor to fleshout an underwritten character dont hire MacDowell who tends to sound as ifshe learns her lines phonetically Jeff Bridges does a relaxed and confidentturn but hes acting with his tan The only scene that completely works isbetween Brooks and an Italian guy Mario Opinato who doesnt understand a wordhe saysan exhilarating throwback to the radiocomedy days of Brooks dadHarry Einstein also known as Parkyakarcas            Since I saw The Muse  Ive been struggling tofigure out why it went so wrongwhy the muse deserted the movies maker HasBrooks like Steven lost his edge Maybe the reasons arent so dire Brooksobviously shares his protagonists insecurity about his position in theindustry in common with Steven he never knows if hell get the money to makeanother film but the two have little in common where it reallycountsartistically They barely overlap From the start Brooks impulseshave taken him to the source of his darkest anxieties As a standup comic hewas less interested in jokes than in the desperate needy impulse behind thejokes As a writer and director he has been less preoccupied with gags thanwith the fear and helplessness out of which they spring How could he possiblybe inspired by Steven Phillips who thinks of nothing but writing a summerblockbuster comedy set in a ramshackle aquarium and starring Jim Carrey Imnot saying that Brooks doesnt dream of being popular and having statusonlythat hed have to do it his way working outward from the bone Maybe itsreassuring that The Muse is so bad since a lot of other people couldhave made it and made it better Maybe Brooks muse is showing him whathappens when you satirize people who are so far beneath you
