                                 Hack Attacks            Hardly a week goes bywithout a report of some new virus or other security risk on the InternetMicrosofts Internet Explorer was a particularly fertile ground forbughunters as is explained  Depending on whom you talk to browsing theInternet is as safe as a walk in the park or as dangerous as a walk alone atnight in Central Park            Is yourdata being read by prying eyes Intercepted by third parties Altered orobliterated by crooks or pranksters How concerned should you be and whatexactly is at risk            Data can be compromised while it resides on your computeror during transmission from one place to another To see why transmission isso risky see this explanation of             The best way to secure yourdata from outsiders is via encryption  The goal here is to preventothers from accessing it or as a last resort preventing them from reading itor tampering with it if they do succeed in accessing it Encryptionworks on the principle of a lock and key The lock is the encrypted data thekey is a number The number cant be derived from the encrypted data so thelock cant be opened without the key            Thesimplest and most effective kind of encryption is singlekey encryption The author puts his data in a box locks it and sends it to an audience thatalready has a copy of the key Singlekey encryption works fine for broadcastsituations such as a military command sending orders to its units but not sowell for twoway interactions Publicprivatekey encryption provides anelegant solution to the problem Under publicprivatekey encryption everyonegets an individual lock with two keys One key locks it the other key unlocksit and you cant derive one from the other If Bill wants to send Joe mail helocks it with Joes public key which is available for all the world to seeNow it is locked and only Joe can unlock it with his private key so only heand Bill can know the contents Unfortunately there is currently no standardway for someone to get or publish a key which is one reason encrypted emailis not common today PGP Pretty Good Privacy is a free utility that lets you dopublicprivatekey encryption            Encryption comes in different strengthsdenoted by the size of the numeric key The bigger the key the harder it is tobreak the encryption pick the lock Since encryption inhibits the ability ofthe government to spy on private dialogues there are publicpolicy issuessurrounding encryption This is another reason encrypted email is uncommontoday a topic which David Plotz covered in an earlier The Gist in Slate SSLSecure Sockets Layer an Internet standard for encrypting data is built intorecent versions of Microsofts Internet Explorer and Netscapes Navigator Butbecause encrypting and decrypting data is fairly slow SSL tends to be usedonly where privacy really matterstypically electronic commerce            Sometimesits desirable to have data that are publicly available but untamperable Forinstance the government publishes a crop report that a commodity broker thenpasses on to a client How can the client know that the broker hasnt alteredthe report Digital signatures solve this problem Mathematics canreduce any document to a few unique numbersthe signature Changing theoriginal data in any way results in a different signature This signature isthen encrypted with a private key Using a public key anyone can confirm thatthe signature matches the document The document cant have changed because thesignature is the same and the signature cant be forged because only thecreator has access to the private key that encrypted it            What about protecting the data on your hard driveTypically this is done at the operatingsystem level by restricting access tocertain users Ideally users would carry around giant numeric keys to identifythemselves but computer marketers could never sell that solution In the endmost systems identify users by passwords Users enter their names andpasswords The name is public but the password is private The simplicity ofthe system is its power While an encrypted document gives a code breakersomething to analyze an empty password prompt is simply empty            Unfortunately computer users betray themselves Anecdotal evidence shows thatmost passwords are birth dates of family members maiden names favorite sportsteamsthings that are easy to guess Thats why the best passwords arent realwords but combinations of letters numbers and punctuation The best passwordcontains enough nonsense so that no one can guess it but not so much nonsensethat you cant remember it And therein lies the other problem with passwordsPeople forget them This is so common that for every network there is someonethe system administrator who has the power to retrieve or change yourpassword The worlds best password is useless if the system administratorspassword is easy to guess or if someone can get her drunk or blackmail herBut the alternative is frightening which is why we dont encrypt our harddrives with the password as our key If we lost the key that would bethat            The greatest perils to your precious data arethe programs youve installed on your computer Who hasnt accidentally told acomputer to delete the wrong file or stood by helplessly while the operatingsystem crashed and took all the files with it            Then there are programsdesigned to do damage The worst are Trojan horses  programs thatclaim to be one thing but are really another such as a program that issupposed to be a calendar but secretly erases your hard drive or copies itscontents somewhere else Then there are the legitimate programs that have beeninfected with subprograms called viruses  Viruses are crafty things thatare cleverly if perversely designed to replicate themselves whenever theirhost program is run Once replicated they might then do harm to your datajust like biological viruses can do harm to their hosts            Furtherperils to your data are programs like operating systems and browsers which aresupposed to protect you from harm Like a brick wall they resist any frontalattack But like a brick wall some of these programs have holes The mostinsidious kind of hole is a back door  put there with a benign purposelike letting in the dog that can be exploited for nefarious ends likeletting in a trained monkey to steal your wallet The recent Internet Explorerwas just that Some people feel that  found in most browsers are a securityhole but I strongly disagree            How can you be sure your programs are safe Either obtainyour programs from trustworthy sources or ensure that the programs behaveBoth have their tradeoffs If you were a photographer and had to hire childmodels for an important shoot you could hire from a reputable modeling agencythat guaranteed its clients or you could hire children off the street and alsohire an authoritarian nanny to watch them every second The agency cant reallyensure their clients behavior but you would know that it had done its verybest to choose only wellbehaved children The nanny by comparison can betrusted to control the children but her constant presence irritates thechildren and slows down the shoot Either way youre paying someone theagency or the nanny The best case of the agency is best everyone behaves andis happy but the worst case of the agency is worst overall all the childrengo into hysterics at once With the nanny you know what to expect Your shootwill never go as well as the best case of the agency but then neither will itever descend into chaos            Withsoftware the agency is an independent trusted body verifying that softwarecomes from where it claims A digital signature ensures it came straight fromthe manufacturer picking up no stray viruses along the way MicrosoftsInternet Explorer uses this method for its ActiveX controls which it callsAuthenticode TM  These controls are small programs with noartificial constraints on their behavior They allow for the highest possibleperformance and functionality but also the highest potential for damage Ifyou download a control that has not been signed by a trusted agency youreputting your data in danger            The nanny approach is the one taken by Javaa special programming language available in both Internet Explorer andNavigator that restricts the behavior of its programs Because the abilities ofthese programs are restricted they cant harm your data But because they arerestricted they are slower and can do less For example Java programs cannotread the files created by your personalfinance program Thats good forsafety but rotten for functionality if youre trying to write a program tohelp people analyze their personal finances Another Java advantage is thatbecause its programs do less they can run on almost any computer no matterwhat the operating system Windows  Mac OS OS Unix etc            Both approaches have meritfor different applications A highperformance video game cant afford theperformance penalty of Java but if you trust the manufacturer digitalsignatures that guarantee ActiveX give you the confidence to run it On theother hand a fillintheblanks tax application doesnt require breakneckperformance so a Java version that can run on almost any computer might bedesirable In fact a hybrid approach may yield the best results for exampleJava presentation software that uses machinespecific ActiveX controls forhighperformance animation and sound            Theconcern over Internet security is somewhat overblown There isnt a mob of datavillains waiting on the other side of the wire to steal your money read youremail and kidnap your dog There is no documented case of a creditcardnumber being stolen over the Internet Sure viruses do spread and data areoccasionally lost but the main reason you hear so much about security is thatits a great marketing tactic Dont buy their browser ours is safer OrViruses can kill Buy our antivirus software Microsoft Netscape andothers compete to make sure their products are as secure as possible So maybeparanoia is sometimes a good thing
