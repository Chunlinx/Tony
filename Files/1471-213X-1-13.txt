                    Background        Specification of cells at different times and places is        critical for generation of cellular diversity in the        vertebrate nervous system Distinct types of neurons and        glia develop at characteristic times and places   and        molecular signals that promote formation of different cell        types are regulated spatially and temporally   Thus        neural pattern formation requires coordination of signals        that provide spatial and temporal information        Lateral inhibition or lateral specification is one        process by which fine patterns of distinct cell types are        generated    Among cells that have the potential to        adopt the same fate lateral inhibition specifies some        cells for a primary or preferred fate and others for a        secondary or alternative fate Cell ablation experiments        are used to identify lateral inhibition when cells that        would normally adopt a primary fate are removed cells that        would otherwise acquire a secondary fate replace them For        example when neuroblasts of the grasshopper central        nervous system were ablated they were replaced by cells        normally fated to give rise to epidermis   Similar        demonstrations performed in other insects   leeches          nematodes   ascidians   and zebrafish neural        crest   indicate that lateral inhibition operates in        diverse developmental contexts throughout metazoan        development        The molecular mechanism of lateral inhibition is rooted        in interaction of the ligand Delta and its receptor        Notch   Various lines of evidence indicate that Delta        expressed by specified cells activates Notch in        neighboring cells directing them into alternative        developmental pathways The genetic demonstration that        DeltaNotch signaling regulates insect neuroblast formation        has been performed using         Drosophila melanogaster  embryos        lacking Delta or Notch function develop excess neural cells        at the expense of epidermis          In the nervous system of vertebrate embryos         Notch gene expression generally is        associated with proliferative zones of undifferentiated        cells           Scattered        cells within proliferative zones express         Delta              although in chick cells in Sphase of the cell cycle do        not express         Delta suggesting that expression is        limited to newly postmitotic cells     In frog        and zebrafish neural plate         Delta gene expression appears to        precede expression of early neuronal markers             However whether this indicates that proliferative        cells of anamniote nervous systems express         Delta genes is still an open        question        Newlyspecified neurons may use Delta to signal to        unspecified neighboring precursor cells via Notch Such        signaling could diversify neural cell fate by maintaining a        pool of precursor cells that respond to other instructive        signals or by promoting alternative developmental pathways        Gainoffunction experiments provide evidence for both        ideas For example overexpression of a constitutively        active form of Notch Nac in frog embryos led to an        increase in the amount of neural tissue even when cell        division was blocked   It was suggested that this        excess neural tissue arose from specification of excess        uncommitted precursor cells to a neural fate once levels of        the overexpressed Notch protein fell Frog retinal cells        forced to express Nac maintained a neuroepithelial        morphology rather than undergoing differentiation which        also suggests that Notch activation maintains cells in an        undifferentiated state   Similarly overexpression of        Delta proteins which presumably activate endogenous Notch        signaling prevented retinal cell differentiation in frog        and chick    and formation of the earliestborn        neurons in frog and zebrafish      Each of        these observations is consistent with the notion that Notch        activity maintains cells in a proliferative unspecified        state        More recently several reports have raised the        possibility that Notch activity promotes specification of        certain cell types particularly glial cells Forced        expression of Nac promoted formation of cells expressing        markers of Mller glia in rat and zebrafish retinae           As Mller glia are among the last retinal cell types        born these results are consistent with the idea that Notch        activity delays differentiation However Notch activity        did not promote expression of markers of other lateborn        cell types in rat   and appeared to inhibit rather        than promote cell proliferation in zebrafish          Additionally Nac expression in the mouse forebrain        promoted formation of radial glia the earliest specificied        cell type in forebrain   and either permitted   or        promoted gliogenesis in the peripheral nervous system                 By contrast disruption of Notch signaling results in        formation of excess earlyborn neurons Antisense Notch RNA        treatment or expression of a dominant negative form of        Notch in chick resulted in excess ganglion cells one of        the first retinal cell types to differentiate          Similarly expression of dominant negative Delta proteins        caused formation of excess earlyborn neurons in the retina        of frog   and chick   and in the neural plate of        frog   and zebrafish     concomitant with        decreased cell proliferation   and reduced numbers of        lateborn neurons   Mouse embryos homozygous for a        targeted mutation of         Notch or         RBPJ which encodes a downstream        component of the Notch signaling pathway had elevated        levels of expression of neuronal markers indicating        formation of excess neurons   Excess neurons also        developed in mouse embryos homozygous for targeted mutation        of         HES  a presumptive downstream        effector of Notch signaling   Recently a mutant        allele of the zebrafish         deltaA          dlA  gene was identified and shown        to cause formation of excess RohonBeard sensory neurons        and decreased trunk neural crest progenitor cells           and excess hair cells and decreased support cells in the        ear          To investigate further the role of Notchmediated        cellcell signaling in vertebrate neural development we        have tested neural pattern formation in zebrafish embryos        We show by ablating single identified primary motor        neurons that these cells normally inhibit nearby cells from        adopting the primary motor neuron fate Our experiments        lead us to conclude that in the absence of lateral        inhibition the time during which neighboring cells can        replace a missing cell is transient This suggests that the        temporal and spatial cues that specify neural cell fate are        tightly regulated We also show that in         dlA mutant embryos neural precursor        cells prematurely cease dividing and differentiate as        earlyborn neurons with identities appropriate for their        positions within the spinal cord and that mutant embryos        have reduced numbers of lateborn neurons and glia These        observations support the idea that DeltaNotch mediated        lateral inhibition coordinates transition of proliferative        neural precursors into specified neurons and glia of the        spinal cord                    Results                  DeltaNotch pathway genes are expressed in neural          precursor cells          As a step toward a fuller understanding of the role          that DeltaNotch signaling plays in patterning the          zebrafish neural tube we compared expression of several           delta and           notch genes to the distribution of          neural precursor cells and differentiating neurons We          use the term neural precursor cell to indicate          proliferative neuroepithelial cells that did not express          Hu proteins   we identified proliferative cells by          their incorporation of BrdU Conversely we categorized          those cells that expressed Hu proteins as postmitotic          differentiating neurons We examined the RNA expression          patterns of           delta and           notch genes using a sensitive          fluorescent detection method choosing as our timepoint           h hours of development at C   At this          stage primary neurons have differentiated and some          secondary neurons are postmitotic and have differentiated          while others remain in the cell cycle   The assays          described here do not discriminate between primary and          secondary neurons          We show here expression of three           notch genes           notcha            na            notchb            nb  and           notch            n     Cells throughout          the dorsoventral extent of the trunk neural tube          expressed each of these genes Both Hunegative and          Hupositive cells expressed           na Figure ABC whereas           nb and           n expression appeared to be          complementary to Hu localization Figure DEFGHI          indicating that neural precursors expressed           na and           nb but differentiating neurons did          not Particularly intense staining for each gene was          evident apically suggesting that transcripts were          concentrated where the neural tube lumen will form          We showed previously that postmitotic primary neurons          express           dlA transiently at the  somite          stage   Many neural plate cells in excess of known          postmitotic neurons expressed           dlA and           dlD  suggesting that these cells          include neural precursors     By contrast           dlB expression appeared to be          limited mostly to postmitotic neurons   At  h          cells throughout the trunk neural tube including          Hupositive cells expressed           dlA Figure JKL Both          Hupositive and Hunegative cells also expressed           dlB Figure MNO however          apparently fewer of each class expressed           dlB at high level than           dlA  Some Hupositive and many          Hunegative cells expressed           dlD Figure PQR Together          these observations suggest that a subset of neural          precursors and cells specified for neuronal development          express           dlA            dlB and           dlD           To examine directly whether proliferative cells of the          trunk neural tube express           delta and           notch genes we exposed embryos to          a brief pulse of BrdU at  h BrdUpositive cells          expressed each of the           notch data not shown and           delta genes we tested Figure          ABC However only a fraction of BrdUpositive cells          expressed           delta genes expressed           dlB  cells counted           expressed           dlA  cells counted and           expressed           dlD  cells counted Together          with the above data we conclude that at least a portion          of proliferative neural precursor cells express each of          these genes and that postmitotic neurons express           na            dlA            dlB and           dlD  We speculate that the subset          of BrdUpositive cells that express           delta genes are those fated to exit          the cell cycle following the next mitosis and we          interpret our failure to detect           nb            n dlB and           dlD RNA in all or some presumptive          neurons as evidence that transcription of these genes is          not maintained after cell cycle exit                          Lateral inhibition regulates primary motor neuron          number          Widespread neural expression of           delta and           notch genes is consistent with the          possiblity that cellcell signaling contributes to          pattern formation within the zebrafish nervous system To          examine this directly we performed experiments designed          to test whether lateral inhibition patterns primary motor          neurons Zebrafish primary motor neurons are distributed          with a striking periodicity    In previous          studies we found that           islet            isl  expression which marks          primary motor neurons was modified over time Initially          contiguous cells in a row close to floorplate expressed           isl  whereas later           isl expressing cells were          interspersed with cells that did not express           isl   Currently we cannot          distinguish between the possibilities that alternating          cells downregulate           isl expression or that cells that          do not express           isl move between those that do          Nevertheless to maintain this periodicity           isl negative cells must not          transcribe           isl  despite being equidistant          with           isl positive cells from notochord          and floorplate presumed sources of signals that induce          motor neuron development   To test whether newly          born primary motor neurons inhibit neighboring cells from          adopting similar fates we ablated identified CaP and VaP          motor neurons   and asked whether these cells were          replaced Normally CaP develops in every hemisegment          midway between adjacent somite boundaries VaP develops          in about one half the hemisegments when present it is          next to CaP Both cells express           isl whereas other primary motor          neurons do not   Previous experiments showed that          when CaP was removed from  somite stage embryos it was          never replaced   For this experiment we extirpated          CaP and when present VaP from the right side of spinal          hemisegment  R in  somite stage embryos  hour          earlier in developmental time than in previous          experiments   We let these embryos develop until the           somite stage and probed for expression of           isl  Of a total of  embryos in          which these ablations were performed  developed a CaP          or CaP and VaP in the ablated position indicating that          the ablated cells were replaced The remaining two          embryos showed no replacement Although we do not know          the normal fates of the cells that replaced ablated          primary motor neurons these observations are consistent          with the possibility that during normal development          primary motor neurons inhibit neighboring cells from          adopting a primary motor neuron fate                          deltaAmutant embryos have fewer neural precursor          cells and excess neurons          To further test the role of DeltaNotch mediated          lateral inhibition in zebrafish neurogenesis we examined          embryos homozygous for a missense mutation of           dlA            dlA dx  We previously described          the effect of this mutation on development of floorplate          notochord and hypochord   and dorsal spinal sensory          neurons and neural crest   To gauge the extent to          which Notch signaling is disrupted in           dlA dx mutant embryos we examined          expression of           ngn  a proneural gene negatively          regulated by Notch activity   Zebrafish neural plate          stage embryos express           ngn in three longitudinal domains          of the prospective trunk neural tube   Figure A          which correspond to regions that express elevated levels          of           dlA and in which the earliest          neurons are born   Cells within the longitudinal          domains of wildtype embryos do not express           ngn uniformly rather in situ RNA          hybridization revealed higher levels of           ngn transcripts in some cells than          in others   Figure A By contrast cells within          the longitudinal domains of           dlA dx mutant embryos expressed           ngn at uniformly high levels          Figure B Notably the mediolateral extent of each          domain appeared unchanged We conclude that the           dlA dx allele disrupts Notch          signaling within neurogenic regions of zebrafish embryos          but does not influence the formation of neurogenic          domains          In addition to elevated levels of           ngn expression           dlA dx mutant embryos have excess          RohonBeard spinal sensory neurons and reduced numbers of          trunk neural crest precursors    To investigate          the basis for these and other neural phenotypes in           dlA dx mutant embryos we compared          the balance of proliferative neural precursor cells and          postmitotic neurons in wildtype and           dlA dx mutant embryos When          treated with a pulse of BrdU at  h wildtype embryos          revealed BrdUpositive cells and a distinct          nonoverlapping set of basally located           huC positive neurons Figure A          By contrast  h           dlA dx mutant embryos had few          BrdUpositive cells and a large excess of           huC positive cells Figure B We          conclude that in           dlA dx mutant embryos most neural          precursor cells cease dividing and develop as neurons          Consequently the neural precursor pool is depleted in          mutant embryos and replaced by postmitotic neurons                          deltaAmutant embryos have excess earlyspecified          neurons and fewer latespecified neurons and glia          The above observations indicate that neural precursor          cells prematurely differentiate in           dlA dx mutant embryos We imagined          two possible consequences for neural cell fate          specification First all normally developing neural cell          types might be specified but some might arise ahead of          schedule Second the progenitors for cell types that          normally arise late might instead develop identities          appropriate for earlyborn cell types resulting in an          excess of some cell types and reduction of others We          previously showed that disruption of DeltaNotch          signaling by injection of RNA encoding a dominant          negative form of frog Delta protein into early cleavage          stage zebrafish embryos caused formation of excess          earlyspecified primary motor neurons and reduced numbers          of laterspecified secondary motor neurons   Our          observations of           dlA dx mutant embryos confirm and          extend those results           dlA dx mutant embryos had excess          presumptive primary motor neurons and RohonBeard neurons          Figure AB    By contrast the number of          secondary motor neurons in mutant embryos was greatly          reduced Figure CD Primary motor neurons can be          distinguished by cell body position axon projection and          gene expression    To learn how the           dlA dx mutation affected          specification of primary motor neuron identity we probed          embryos for expression of           isl  which serves as a marker for          CaP and VaP two of four identified primary motor neurons            h mutant embryos had excess           isl positive cells in the ventral          trunk neural tube Figure EF These cells appeared as          clusters of about  cells located midway between          adjacent somite borders consistent with the normal          position of CaP and VaP motor neurons This indicates          that disruption of DeltaNotch signaling causes          development of excess primary motor neurons which have          identities appropriate for their positions in the neural          tube Previously we showed that primary motor neuron          identity is dependent upon cell body position within the          ventral spinal cord    We conclude that          DeltaNotch signaling regulates specification of          appropriate numbers of primary motor neurons but does not          regulate specification of motor neuronal identity          We also investigated whether other cell types were          affected in mutant embryos by examining expression of          markers of various interneurons including           lim lim and Pax Spinal cord          cells begin to express           lim and           pax by about  h    and                    lim by  h   indicating that          these cells are born relatively early in neurogenesis          Excess numbers of cells expressed each of these markers          in           dlA dx mutant embryos Figure          GHIJKL Notably the dorsoventral position of          cells expressing each of these markers was similar in          mutant and wildtype embryos Finally           dlA dx mutant embryos had greatly          reduced numbers of presumptive radial glia cells labeled          by antibody zrf Figure MN Although we do not know          the time or place that these cells originate in the          neural tube we do not detect expression with this marker          until  h well after the onset of primary neuron          birth at about  h and secondary motor neuron birth at          about  h Together with the above BrdU results these          observations indicate that disruption of DeltaNotch          signaling causes excess neural precursors to be specified          for earlyborn neuronal fates at the expense of          laterborn neuronal and glial fates without interfering          with mechanisms that specify earlyborn neuronal identity          along the dorsoventral axis                            Discussion                  In zebrafish both neural precursors and neurons          express notchand deltagenes          Expression of activated Notch proteins can prevent          neural cell differentiation        In          vertebrate embryonic nervous systems proliferative          undifferentiated cells express           Notch genes                    thus Notch activity may maintain the          neural precursor state Notably some differentiated          neural cells such as Mller glia and radial glia          express           Notch genes    raising the          possibility that Notch signaling does more than simply          block differentiation By contrast only postmitotic          neural cells have been shown to express           Delta genes     This          pattern of expression is consistent with the idea that          specified postmitotic cells use Delta signaling to          prevent neighboring cells from differentiating However          it differs from the fly embryonic central nervous system          wherein all cells of the prospective neuroectoderm          express Delta with the exception of delaminated          neuroblasts   This indicates that in flies          precursors express Delta and that those specified for          neuroblast development downregulate its expression          Here we show that some zebrafish neural cells in S          phase of the cell cycle and postmitotic differentiating          neurons express           delta genes We interpret these          data to mean that a subset of proliferative neural          precursors upregulate           delta gene expression Upregulation          might engage a feedback loop mechanism in which Notch          activation in neighboring cells maintains them in a          proliferative unspecified state whereas those cells that          upregulate Delta expression and have decreased Notch          activity are driven to exit the cell cycle and to          differentiate                          Zebrafish primary motor neurons may inhibit primary          motor neuron fate in neighboring cells          Lateral inhibition was originally defined by          functional tests in which ablation of a cell of primary          fate allowed an adjacent cell to take that fate but          ablation of a cell of secondary fate had no effect            Ablation experiments performed on grasshoppers showed          that neuroblasts laterally inhibit neighboring cells from          also developing as neuroblasts   Genetic analyses of          fly development then led to the view that lateral          inhibition is mediated by interaction of Delta and Notch          proteins expressed on neighboring cells   Our          ablation studies coupled with our studies of Delta and          Notch expression and with analysis of a           dlA mutation provide evidence          consistent with the possibility that similar mechanisms          operate during specification of individual neural fates          in a vertebrate nervous system          Mutant and gene overexpression phenotypes in various          vertebrate model systems support the notion that          DeltaNotch signaling mediates lateral inhibition in the          central nervous system                    However to our knowledge until now direct evidence          for lateral inhibition in the vertebrate central nervous          system has not been reported Previously when primary          motor neurons were ablated in  somite stage embryos          approximately  hours after birth they were not replaced            Here we ablated primary motor neurons  hour          earlier in developmental time and found that in nearly          every case they were replaced Together our ablation          results reveal an important feature of vertebrate          neuronal specification that the mechanisms that specify          fate must be exquisitely timed We view the failure to          replace primary motor neurons ablated at  somite stage          as indicating that the time at which a cell can be          specified for that fate has passed either because          neighboring precursors have been specified for other          fates or because the signals that specify primary motor          neurons are no longer present Future experiments aimed          at learning the fates of cells neighboring primary motor          neurons may distinguish between these possibilities                          DeltaNotch signaling regulates cell proliferation          and diversifies neural cell fate          Here we took advantage of the fact that           dlA dx mutant zebrafish embryos          survive several days after onset of neuronal          differentiation to investigate how DeltaNotch signaling          influences neural cell fate We show that mutant embryos          have a significant reduction in proliferative neural          cells and a concomitant increase in neurons These          neurons have fates characteristic of the earliestborn          neurons in zebrafish Strikingly the molecular          identities of the excess earlyborn neurons in           dlA dx mutant embryos are          appropriate for their positions in the trunk neural tube          This is evident across the dorsoventral axis of the          neural tube as well as within localized areas of the          ventral neural tube occupied by distinct motor neurons          In other words earlyborn neurons are specified          appropriately in           dlA dx mutant embryos what these          embryos lack is the ability to regulate the number of          cells specified for any particular fate          We also showed that           dlA dx mutant embryos have reduced          numbers of laterborn cell types including secondary          motor neurons and radial glia One possible explanation          for this effect is that the premature exit of neural          precursor cells from the cell cycle depletes the          precursor pool In this view DeltaNotch signaling          diversifies neural cell fate by guiding the orderly and          prolonged transition from neural precursor cells to          specified cells Specification of a particular cellular          identity might depend entirely upon the influence of          instructive signals that change with time For example          zebrafish ventral neural precursors might be specified          differently by different lengths of exposure to Hedgehog          Hh signaling Those competent to respond to brief          exposure to Hh might be specified as primary motor          neurons whereas those subject to prolonged exposure prior          to differentiation might develop as secondary motor          neurons   Notch activity might be important for          specification of secondary motor neurons by holding them          in an unspecified state for long enough to receive          sufficient exposure to Hedgehog signaling Disruption of          Notch signaling would then allow an excess of precursor          cells to respond promptly to Hedgehog signaling          producing an excess of primary motor neurons and a          concomitant deficit of secondary motor neurons precisely          the phenotype of           dlA dx mutant embryos we show          here          A second possibility supported by recent          publications is that Notch activity specifies certain          cell fates in particular glial fates Notch activity          promotes gliogenesis in forebrain retina and cultured          neural crest      Our observation that           dlA dx mutant embryos lack radial          glia of the trunk neural tube also is consistent with          this possibility In fact Notch activity might both hold          neural precursor cells in an unspecified state and          subsequently promote a subset of them to develop as glia          Conditional misexpression of activated Notch in          individual precursor cells of the trunk neural tube might          provide a way to distinguish between these          possibilities                            Conclusions        In zebrafish at least three         notch genes are expressed by        proliferative neural precursors and at least three         delta genes are expressed by subsets        of proliferative precursors and postmitotic neurons Thus        precursors fated to exit the cell cycle and differentiate        may express elevated levels of         delta genes causing them to signal        to neighboring         notch expressing precursors        Signaling between neighboring cells appears to regulate        primary motor neuron specification when we removed primary        motor neurons soon after birth they were replaced        presumably by neighboring precursors Genetic disruption of        DeltaNotch signaling causes precursors to prematurely        terminate cell division and differentiate as earlyborn        neurons with identities appropriate to their cell body        positions at the expense of later born neurons and glia        We propose that in the zebrafish central nervous system        cellcell interactions mediated by DeltaNotch signaling        help coordinate transition of proliferative precursors to        specified neurons and glia                    Materials and methods                  Embryos          Embryos from the
