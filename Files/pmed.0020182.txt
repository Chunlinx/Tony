                    Introduction        More than  million HIVinfected people live in developing countries with significant        resource limitations Although  million people living in developing countries are in        urgent need of antiretroviral therapy only  currently receive effective treatment         Global treatment efforts including the World Health Organizations         by  Initiative aim to extend therapy to several million        people over the next few years  While the cost of antiretroviral medications has        dropped considerably other obstacles including the cost technical and operational        requirements of CD counts viral loads and other sophisticated diagnostic tests used to        initiate and monitor HIV treatment remain to be addressed        In particular measurements of CD         T lymphocytes are essential for staging HIVinfected patients        determining their need for antiretroviral medications and monitoring the course of their        infection  The CD countexpressed in adults as the absolute number        of CD cells per microliter of blood and in children as a percentage of total lymphocytes        or total T lymphocyteshas enormous prognostic and therapeutic        implications and forms the basis for most HIV treatment decisions         In developed countries CD counts are typically performed every        three to six months for each patient using the method of flow cytometry Flow cytometers        use lasers to excite fluorescent antibody probes specific for CD and other cell surface        markers to distinguish one type of lymphocyte from another Several        factorsincluding the cost of a flow cytometer which ranges from         to  technical and operational complexity the need for reliable        electricity and the high cost of reagentshave made these instruments        impractical andor difficult to sustain in resourcescarce settings The urgent need for        affordable and technically simple CD diagnostics is widely recognized                Several efforts have been made to develop alternative affordable CD counting methods        for resourcepoor settings Singlepurpose flow cytometers have been designed solely for        counting CD cells such as the Becton Dickinson FACSCount the Partec CyFlow and desktop        instruments from Guava and PointCare Technologies Although these newer versions make flow        cytometry more affordable in some settings reagent costs remain high and the instruments        remain expensive and in most cases technically complex  Lowcost        microbead separation of CD cells from other blood cells followed by standard manual cell        counting techniques using a light microscope offers significantly lower reagent costs than        flow cytometry These methods however are low throughput and extremely labor intensive        and appear to be less accurate than traditional flow cytometry thus they have not been        widely adopted         Less expensive CD counting methods that capitalize on lowcost microfabrication        efficient light sources and affordable microelectronics and digital imaging hardware have        been conceptualized but never realized  One of us JTM has previously reported        the development of a novel microchipbased detection system for measuring analytes such as        acids bases electrolytes and proteins in solution phase  This        electronic taste chip ETC system carries out chemical and immunological reactions on        microspheres positioned in the inverted pyramidal microchamber wells of a silicon or        plastic microchip which is housed in a miniature flow cell Microfluidic channels deliver        a series of smallvolume reagents and washes to the flow cell and hence to the chip and to        each one of the microspheres Optical signals generated by the reactions on the        microspheres are visualized and captured on a chargecoupled device CCD with the use of        transfer optics and a digital video chip Using the ETC system complex immunological        assays such as the ones developed to quantify cardiac risk factors in serum can be        performed with small sample volumes short analysis times and markedly reduced reagent        costs         Further development of the ETC system has shown that it could be adapted to the        detection of bacteria spores and living cells  We hypothesized that additional        modifications could be made to provide accurate lowcost CD counts to monitor HIV        infection in resourceconstrained settings We show that a microchipbased system can        perform CD counts from  l of whole blood rapidly simply and with a high        degree of accuracy compared to flow cytometry particularly for patients with CD counts        below  cellsl We suggest how this prototype system can be readily        developed as a lowcost portable device for use in resourcepoor settings                    Methods                  Flow Cell          The ETC system was originally designed for microspherebased assays           The modified version of the flow cell see Figure  is          enclosed within a threepiece metal casing with a flat platform permanently affixed to a          circular vertical support which is in turn connected to a screwon cap Within the metal          casing there are top and bottom plastic inserts made from PMMA Fluids are introduced to          and drained out of the flow cell through integrated stainless steel tubing within the          inserts The bottom PMMA insert also features a plastic screen disc that acts as a          support for a m Nuclepore polycarbonate tracketch filter Whatman          Florham Park New Jersey United States which serves as a lymphocyte capture and red          blood cell separation membrane A gasket between the membrane and the top insert prevents          leaks and ensures that the entire sample is delivered into the flow cell and filtered          through the membrane The top outlet is used with lateral flow for the removal of air          bubbles                          Fluid Delivery System          In initial studies we used a single peristaltic pump to deliver sample and washes to          the flow cell Subsequently a partially automated fluid delivery system was developed          This functional adaptation uses two miniature OEM peristaltic pumps each in conjunction          with a pinch valve and in mm silicone tubing capable of delivering flow          rates of  lmin to the flow cell Integrated          software LabVIEW National Instruments Austin Texas United States directs delivery          of whole blood samples and washes to the flow cell using the appropriate pumps and          valves Sample filtrate including red blood cells is captured in a waste reservoir                          Optical Station and Image Capture          The flow cell was positioned on the stage of a modified BX Olympus Tokyo Japan          compound microscope equipped with a  objective lens and a highpressure           W mercury burner arc lamp as a light source Focusing was maintained on a fixed plane          throughout the duration of the assay Visualization of AlexaFluorstained lymphocytes          was achieved using a Cy filter cube  nm excitation  nm longpass beam splitter          dichroic mirror and  nm emission while AlexaFluorstained lymphocytes were          visualized with a fluoroisothiocyanate FITC filter cube  nm excitation  nm          longpass beam splitter dichroic mirror and    nm emission For each          study participant images were obtained from each of five nonoverlapping regions of the          lymphocyte capture membrane in the flow cell using a bit CCD digital camera DVC          Austin Texas United States mounted on the microscope Each imaged region represented           l of whole blood so that for each assay cells were counted from a          total volume of  l of blood Each region was imaged serially with both          filter cubes The corresponding images were stored separately as monochromatic eightbit          images for subsequent digital image analysis and automated cell counting                          Image Analysis          Images were analyzed using a custom algorithm supported by ImagePro Plus Media          Cybernetics Silver Spring Maryland United States processing software An iterative          approach allowed for flexible analysis of data acquired under different conditions of          illumination focus and sampling For each iteration an upper and lower value defined a          range of green or red intensities that were then used to segment the image Pixels whose          intensity values fell within the defined range were reassigned values of one while all          others were set to zero The process yielded a binary version of the original eightbit          image A lymphocyte selection algorithm was then applied Objects ie lymphocytes          were defined as contiguous groups of pixels with values of one Object selection was          refined by a lymphocyte profile defined by size aspect ratio and uniformity objects          not fitting the profile were not counted The number of counted objects was recorded for          each iteration From one iteration to the next the upper and lower intensity limits used          to segment the image were both increased by a single intensity count The final cell          count per image was the maximum object count over  iterations upper intensity limits           for which the average object roundness fell below a threshold          value In this manner the software algorithm determined the optimal analysis parameters          for each image individually greatly relaxing the stringency of image capture          requirements Cell counts were recorded in a spreadsheet as numbers of CD           CD            CD           CD            CD           CD            CD           CD            CD           CD            CD           CD            and CD           CD           cells depending on the combination of antibodies used Absolute CD          counts were recorded as the summed number of CD           CD           cells counted over five images normalized per microliter of imaged          blood CDCD ratios were recoded as the ratio of CD           CD           cells to CD           CD           cells counted over five images Relative CD abundance as a          percentage of total T lymphocytes was recorded as  times the ratio of CD           CD           cells to total CD           cells with cells counted over five images                          Lymphocyte Staining and Delivery          Antibodies utilized in these studies were stored at  C and centrifuged to          remove precipitated material prior to use This process ensured removal of fluorescent          particulate matter that could be captured by the membrane and might interfere with          imaging For the initial dilution control studies CD cells were purified by          immunomagnetic separation from donor buffy coats CD cells labeled with          AlexaFluorconjugated antiCD antibodies A clone           Molecular Probes Eugene Oregon United States were          introduced to the flow cell in amounts ranging from zero to  cells and washed          with phosphate buffered saline PBS For whole blood studies  l of whole          blood collected by venipuncture was incubated at ambient temperature           C with  l of AlexaFluor and          AlexaFluorconjugated antibodies to CD and CD A clone           Molecular Probes respectively and allowed to react for           min Similarly for CD enumeration  l of whole blood with  l          of AlexaFluor and AlexaFluorconjugated antibodies to CD A clone           Molecular Probes and CD respectively was allowed to          react for  min at ambient temperature Stained blood samples were brought up to           l with PBS half of which was introduced directly into the flow cell          representing  l of the original sample of blood and then washed with           ml of PBS Because red blood cells are mechanically separated from white blood cells red          blood cell lysis is not necessary Images of labeled cells captured on the membrane were          obtained and analyzed as described above For SEM scanning electron microscopy a          fixative  paraformaldehyde glutaraldehyde was added into the flow cell and          rinsed with PBS The filter was removed from the flow cell fixed for  s with OsO           vapor and then dehydrated with EtOHHMDS The same SEM protocol was          applied to a drop of whole blood on a glass slide                          Study Participants and Comparison to Flow Cytometry          Blood was obtained from HIVuninfected control participants and HIVinfected          participants at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston Massachusetts United          States and from HIVinfected participants at the BotswanaHarvard          AIDS Institute HIV Reference Laboratory in Gaborone Botswana The Botswana samples          originated from a study of HIVinfected pregnant women attending          maternalchild health clinics in Gaborone or three nearby villages          Molepolole Mochudi and Lobatse Six infants were also included in the study Three          milliliters of venous whole blood was collected from each participant in EDTA          anticoagulant All samples were run on the microchip on the day of blood collection          Parallel samples were processed using standard fourcolor flow cytometry on a Becton          Dickinson FACSCalibur using the MultiTEST reagents and TruCOUNT beads and analyzed          using MultiSET software All samples were processed by flow cytometry according to          standard operating procedure in the HIV reference laboratory in Botswana The majority          were processed within  h of blood collection and all were processed and analyzed          within  h of blood collection A total of  participants were enrolled including           adults and six infants Three adults did not have flow cytometry results available          leaving  participants for analysis The study was approved by the institutional review          boards of the participating institutions For a preliminary assessment of assay          variability blood from a single study participant was assayed as described above           separate times over the course of a single afternoon by a single operator                          Statistical Methods          The accuracy of the microchipbased CD counting system was determined by comparing          results directly to parallel samples processed by flow cytometry using          PassingBablok regression analysis and the          BlandAltman methods comparisons approach  For assay          reproducibility a coefficient of variance was calculated from  replicates of a single          participant Data were analyzed and processed using AnalyseIt software AnalyseIt          Software Leeds United Kingdom                            Results        In initial experiments using the original ETC system         microspheres were coated with monoclonal antibodies to the lymphocyte surface markers CD        CD or CD followed by microfluidic delivery of fluorescently labeled lymphocytes from        whole blood obtained from nonHIVinfected participants Although lymphocytes were readily        captured precise quantification of cell numbers and CD cell counts were not possible        using the microsphere as a surface for lymphocyte capture data not shown We next        modified the flow cells with a disposable microporous membrane filter for lymphocyte        capture A single polycarbonate tracketch membrane with m pores was        immobilized and secured within the flow cell creating a lymphocyte capture surface with a        surface area of  mm          Whole blood samples were delivered to the flow cell from a sample        reservoir tube and the membrane within the flow cell was washed with PBS from a second        reservoir As in the original ETC system cells were imaged under fluorescence optics using        a mercury arc lamp light source and a CCD camera Figure         To confirm that cells could be adequately captured  l of unprocessed        whole blood from nonHIVinfected participants was incubated for  min with        fluorophoreconjugated antiCD antibodies and delivered by a peristaltic pump to the        modified microfluidics chip Red blood cells passed readily through the pores under        appropriate fluid flow conditions In contrast the majority of white blood cells were        captured onto a single imaging focal plane Figure  This mechanical separation of        autofluorescent red blood cells allows for the imaging and counting of white blood cells        from unprocessed whole blood without additional sample processing such as centrifugation        or red blood cell lysis Using the digital imaging system originally developed for        microspherebased capture in the ETC system fluorescently labeled white blood cells can        then be imaged directly on the chip and counted        To assess the analytical validity of the membranebased microchip system we first        performed a dilution control study to evaluate the correlation between total fluorescence        intensity and the absolute number of purified CD cells from nonHIVinfected participants        labeled with fluorophoreconjugated antiCD antibody captured in the microchamber The        results show a linear correlation between the number of cells in the sample and the        intensity of light emitted from the membrane filter         R           for a range of CD cell counts relevant to advanced HIV        disease  CD cellsl blood Figure  This        doseresponse study established proof of the concept that a modified        microfluidic flow cell and a digital image analysis system can accurately detect and        measure populations of whole blood lymphocytes labeled with fluorescent markers        We next quantified the percentages of CD CD and CD cells in whole blood samples        from healthy control participants using this system Prior to delivery to the flow cell we        labeled a l whole blood sample with  l of        fluorophoreconjugated antiCD and antiCD antibodies for  min off chip then diluted        the sample with  l of PBS and delivered  l of the resulting        sample containing  l of blood to the flow cell using a fluidics        controller Digital images from one region of the lymphocyte capture membrane were obtained        with two different emission filters one specific for the AlexaFluorconjugated        antibody used to stain CD         T lymphocytes green Figure A and the other specific for the        AlexaFluorconjugated antibody used to stain CD         T lymphocytes red Figure B Automated digital merging of the two        images and image processing allowed the system to distinguish the CD         CD         T lymphocytes of interest ie CD        cells which appear yellow from the CD         CD         monocytes green and the CD         CD         T lymphocytes red Figure C        We next developed a custom algorithm for translating these digital images into accurate        CD and CD T cell counts using pixel analysis with the aid of a commercial image        processing package Automated counting of the three subsets of cells was based on object        size aspect ratio and uniformity iterated across the range of color intensity levels As        shown in Figure D a binary mask first removes the unwanted cell types and residual        objects representing CD T cells are counted A similar protocol was applied to a second        aliquot of blood stained with AlexaFluorconjugated CDspecific antibody and        AlexaFluorconjugated CDspecific antibody to visualize and count CD         CD         T lymphocytes        In order to calculate an absolute CD count with standard flow cytometry one of two        measures must be undertaken to calculate a concentration in cells per microliter Either a        standardized reference reagent such as calibration beads at a known concentration can be        added to the assay singleplatform flow cytometry or an        absolute total lymphocyte count in cells per microliter can be obtained on a hematology        analyzer dualplatform flow cytometry The microchip        assay we describe here uses a direct volumetric method and functions as a singleplatform        approach By delivering a consistent volume of blood to the flow chamber         l of stained whole blood diluted to a total volume of  l of        PBS and calculating the unit volume of blood per digital image  l we        were able to count the total number of CD         CD         cells in  l of blood and determine the absolute CD        count per microliter        We next tested this rapid whole blood microchip assay in a series of samples acquired        in an HIV reference laboratory in Botswana Seventy consecutive HIVinfected participants        presenting to the HIV reference laboratory for standard CD counting as part of a vertical        transmission study were enrolled of whom  were adult women and six were infants        Parallel samples were processed by standard fourcolor flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson        FACSCalibur The time from blood collection to complete analysis and results reporting        using the chipbased assay was approximately  min per sample Three adult participants        did not have valid flow cytometry results available leaving  adults and six infants for        analysis        Representative processed data images from three participants two adult women and one        infant are shown in Figure  Figure A shows a yold woman with an absolute CD count        by flow cytometry of  cellsl While numerous CD         T cells red are present as well as scattered monocytes green her        low CD count is reflected in the few doublelabeled CD         CD         T cells yellow seen in the image Similar representative data images        from a young woman with a CD count of  cellsl by flow cytometry and a        moold infant with a CD percentage of T lymphocytes of  by flow cytometry are also        shown in Figure B and C respectively These images illustrate the dynamic range of the        membrane capture and digital image analysis system including the ability to quantify both        absolute CD counts and CD percentages        We compared results from our microchip assay with results available from flow cytometry        the latter obtained on a FACSCalibur through standard clinical laboratory operating        procedures The data for adult absolute CD counts are plotted in the        BlandAltman methods comparison plot shown in Figure  For  adult        participants with CD counts ranging from  to  cellsl mean         cellsl by flow cytometry results show a good correlation between absolute        CD counts measured by our microchip assay and those measured by flow cytometry        BlandAltman methods comparison analysis shows a bias of         cellsl  confidence interval         to  cellsl and good  limits of agreement Figure         Several of the results from participants at the higher end of absolute CD counts fall        outside the  limits For these participants individual lymphocytes may overlap in the        digital images as seen in Figure C which can interfere with the accuracy of the        lymphocyte counting algorithm In resourcelimited settings the primary use of CD counts        is as a trigger to initiate antiretroviral therapy which typically occurs at a CD count        of  cellsl Higher CD count thresholds of  and  cellsl        are also used to increase the intensity of monitoring For these values the sensitivity        and specificity of our method are CD   sensitivity   specificity          CD   sensitivity   specificity   and CD   sensitivity          specificity          One important application of our method is in pediatric HIV monitoring The wide range        of normal absolute CD counts in infants and children requires the use of CDCD ratios or        CD percentages in pediatric infection Results for CDCD ratios and CD percentages of T        lymphocytes for all  participants  adults and six infants are shown in Figure         Agreement bias and correlations between the microchip method and flow cytometry are        excellent for both CD percentages of T lymphocytes Figure A and B and CDCD ratios        Figure C and D BlandAltman plots for both CD percentages of T        lymphocytes and CDCD ratios show low proportional bias with tight  limits of        agreement Correlations are excellent for both CD percentages of T lymphocytes         r           p   and CDCD ratios         r           p   Overall the data show that all three approaches to        measuring CD cell counts can be accurately quantified using the microchip method and that        both adult and pediatric CD results can be obtained        To determine assay variability we examined  replicate samples of blood from a single        participant over the course of one day using the established basic protocol We determined        that the coefficient of variance was  data not shown which is similar to other        methods of CD counting  Although the assay described here introduced         l of blood into the system the actual volume of blood analyzed by digital        image analysis is only  l We have conducted preliminary studies that        suggest that we can accurately measure CD counts from less than  l of blood        obtained via fingerstick data not shown additional studies will be required to assess        the correlation between CD counts obtained by fingerstick and by venipuncture                    Discussion        Our results provide proof of principle that lowcost microfluidic structures combined        with fluorescence imaging and digital image analysis can be successfully applied to the        measurement of CD cell counts which are critical to the clinical management of HIV        infection The method described here can deliver both absolute CD counts for adult        monitoring and CD percentages or CDCD ratios for pediatric monitoring Most        importantly the rapid and accurate CD assessments obtained with this method together        with its anticipated low cost relative to flow cytometry may make this type of approach        ideal for resourcescarce settings As our results show this method may be less accurate        at the higher range of CD counts where cells may be more likely to overlap in our digital        images While this may limit its applicability our method is accurate at CD counts below         cellsl which represent the clinically relevant CD levels in        resourcepoor settings In addition both the bias in the method described here         cells and the accuracy at higher CD counts are likely to be        improved significantly by the further development of a disposable microfluidic cartridge        where the volume of distribution of the sample will be much smaller and more accurate        volumetric control will be possible        Our study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of our method against the gold standard        in a population of adults During enrollment a small number of pediatric samples were made        available to us by the staff at Princess Marina Hospital in Botswana We chose to include        these samples in the data presented here to provide proof of principle that pediatric CD        percentages can also be assessed with this method Although only six pediatric samples were        available limiting claims of statistical significance we believe the issue of pediatric        CD count monitoring to be of such importance that the data merited inclusion Excluding        the six pediatric samples does not affect the analysis        The results presented here were obtained with a stationary tabletop monitoring system        using a standard epifluorescence microscope and commercial image processing software While        the methods we described provide the basis for a highly portable and flexible miniaturized        CD counting system it should be emphasized that a number of additional developments are        required to enable the widespread use of this approach in resourcelimited settings With        additional engineering of optics electronics and mechanical components along with        advancements in integrated microfluidic systems it should be possible to develop a        pointofcare instrument that is batterypowered uses simple light emitting diodes LEDs        and secures analyzable digital images with affordable video imaging chips When combined        with an embedded microprocessor and disposable assay cartridges for both adult and        pediatric monitoring manufactured from injectionmolded plastic it should be possible to        create a functional CD counting device that can be used at the point of care Further        trials in a larger more diverse cohort of patients including adult men and children will        be necessary to confirm the accuracy of the method including an assessment of assay bias        and reproducibility Such a device is currently in commercial development and may be        available by early  While it is too early to provide an accurate cost estimate for a        portable instrument and disposable plastic CD assay we expect the equipment cost would be        substantially lower than for flow cytometry and the assay cost would be similar to assays        using existing methods Table         Although several CD counting systems are now used in resourcelimited settings they        remain suboptimal to meet the needs of HIV care and treatment scaleup None can truly be        used at the point of care beyond a district hospital or similar facility and either the        capital and operating costs remain high or throughput is low or both Table  Pediatric        monitoring using CD percentages also remains largely unavailable The method we describe        here addresses several of the limitations of performing diagnostic assays in        resourcelimited settings First sample volumes are minimal so that tests can be        performed on fingerstick samples of blood circumventing the need for venipuncture and        minimizing both medical waste and operator exposure to biohazardous material Second        reagent use is minimized in the microchip system reducing reagent costs by as much as         Third labor and equipmentintensive sample preparation is eliminated Fourth the        microchip CD assay is extremely rapid CD results in the prototype system described here        are available in less than  min from the time of blood collection In a mature        microfluidic device with pushbutton operation results should be available in less than         min and thus can be used to make realtime clinical decisions at the point of care Fifth        the assay is technically simple analogous to a portable glucometer and ultimately will be        useable by a healthcare worker in remote settings with minimal training extending the        reach of CD assays to district hospitals and remote clinics and reducing labor costs        Sixth both adult and pediatric monitoring are possible        We believe that the future of lowcost diagnostics for use in the developing world lies        in the development of new labonachip technologies that integrate sample preparation and        sample measurement systems into miniaturized devices with minimal power requirements        Preliminary cost estimates for the instrumentation here described suggest at a minimum a        fold reduction in the cost for the associated measurement system Further reagent        consumption for the microchip system can be reduced by a similar factor relative to flow        cytometry while sample storage and shipping costs are expected to be reduced dramatically        by virtue of the pointofcare capabilities of this new labonachip structure The        importance of microtechnologies to the realities of laboratory infrastructure worldwide has        been recognized previously  Although CD counting represents the        most urgent need in HIV diagnostics for resourcepoor settings the microchip platform is        adaptable to other important assays Through the interface of the lymphocyte capture        membrane described here with the previously reported microchip arrays cellular assays like        CD counts can be multiplexed with other molecular biomarker measurements ie proteins        and nucleic acids on a single miniaturized chip The rapid extension of the chipbased CD        counting method described here to HIV RNA measurements diagnostics for opportunistic        infections liver enzymes and other biochemical markers of interest in infectious disease        is feasible
