        well Wayne ive never done any uh auto repairs myself at all i mean i may have screwed in a little  screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something but uh i personally havent done anything maybe   umhum   ive uh changed wiper wiper blades or something but i have noticed since uh i got married that my husband he hates to do auto repairs but he would rather do them himself than than to pay someone else i guess he cant make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows he knows how to do it and to do it so he he hates the time that he takes but he has changed um the brakes and he has done all of the tuneups and the things like that  and recently he changed the steering mechanism in our car   umhum   i was really impressed with that  we had to have it to get the car inspected it wouldnt pass inspection and and so he priced around and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it so he thought well i can get one in a junkyard  for like fifty dollars which he did and then he did it and i so i guess uh hes been pretty good about keeping our cars up what uh whats your experience been like   well i uh i have a long experience with cars i uh when i was younger uh my brother had a Corvette and i bought a Corvette when you have a Corvette you more or less do all the work and ive done everything from build the motor from the uh you know the bare block on up and i im the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car i hate to go pay somebody good money you know i hate to pay somebody twenty five dollars an hour for something i can do myself it just to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that  in fact i um just this past weekend put new plugs in both uh my car an my wifes car   umhum right umhum   and so i uh i pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything i can do myself but ive ive gotten to the point in my life um you know i just crept over forty years old where i dont want to crawl underneath the car anymore  i mean its uh   that makes sense   i dont know whether ive ive just reached a point you know its its real rough in the winter time   huh yes   and uh and so i try to make sure that uh by the time fall runs around because we actually have winters here on the east coast um  that uh i have you know the cars in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter   right   and uh then spring time i usually end up giving them uh a uh tuneup and make sure that theyre running well and uh yeah its like i had the muffler go out on my on my car shortly before it was required to go in Maryland they have uh emission tests   umhum   and youre required to get your car to go through the emission test well my muffler of course starting going bad right before i was supposed to go to the emission test so you know i had to do that job and of course that was back in December when its nice and cold outside   yes im sure it was   but the thing was that i could do the job myself i mean the parts cost me oh roughly a hundred dollars um if id taken it someplace to have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty five   umhum right   now like whos got that extra two and a quarter  i know i dont so   yeah well thats exactly the way he feels is that he really hates to spend the time it takes a lot of time if he if he thinks its going to be two hours its four if you know whatever it always takes him twice as long but then when hes finished hes he always says well now you owe me three hundred dollars  and then he thinks that he has the money that that he can spend on something and he hasnt given it to someone else so he gets some satisfaction out of that although     yeah   generally i think he he does not look forward to or anticipate theres some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars theres a lot of people and he just isnt one of them   yeah i uh i dont mind it um there was a time when i had my Corvette i mean of course i loved it um but ive you know ive got other interests now and theres a lot other more important things i think i should be doing with my time   umhum   and i have the same problem i mean you can tell him from me but it doesnt matter i mean ive ive had greasy fingernails for years  and it still takes me twice as long as i think its going to take to do the job     yeah   so but think i think the difference is that uh when you own the car you take more care in what youre doing   umhum   and you want to make sure that its done right and put back together right and you know ive ive in the past ive had brake jobs done by someone that when i went back and and looked at it some months later id find something drastically wrong with it   right   you know like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident you know those kind of things and when you have a vehicle thats being used by you know other members of your family you know you dont want   right   that kind of a situation to come up   no   and its very very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust i only have one guy that i know that i trust to work on my car and uh hes about uh sixty miles from here   umhum   and so it and if i have something thats really major that i cant handle or feel i dont have the time to handle ill take it to him to do it   right you know that its uh really has a bad reputation is to feel that that people in general feel and have have rightly so i think been cheated many times and um   uhhuh yes   and well i know once when we had a we usually round inspection time we find out theres something wrong with our car but um once the muffler needed to be changed and uh he had looked at it himself and but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change he said thats really really good so he went in and uh but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something anyway but the car that the muffler people had um my at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further you know they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever and so since then i dont think hes ever even seriously considered a you know any kind of job he thought he could do himself   uhhuh   but i know from his childhood he says his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment i guess  and um so Kelly growing up he   uhhuh   he felt like that that was a good way on Saturdays that he developed a good relationship with his father   uhhuh   and so he used they used car repairs kind of as a way to have uh you know something that they did together   yeah   and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand and be functional now and it helped him to have a close relationship so thats one one way he looked at it   yeah thats probably uh uh something that uh is is you know is good for both of them i know that uh my older son i could never get him interested in cars and i couldnt you know i just like you know you sure youre a boy i mean your not interested in cars  i mean he he just       would not have anything to do with them and uh later on and uh like when he you know grew up got out of the house and got his own car um he didnt know how to do anything to it i mean absolutely nothing i mean he couldnt even check the oil i mean thats thats how uninformed he was and disinterested   umhum   and i guess there are some people out there like that um you know i always thought maybe you know if he took more of an interest and you know what i was doing and maybe we could have communicated better   umhum   but uh yeah i i think thats great   yeah it didnt always work well i felt um i feel like i could myself do some things but that i have enough responsibility  that if i have someone like my father when i was living at home and my husband thats willing to do it i go ahead and let them do it i dont feel the need to um you know be a feminist on that issue and say i can take care of my own things im im happy to let them run run the cars because i have so many other responsibilities that um so i havent tried to do a lot myself   uh i i trained my uh my wife in the house in in doing things in fact uh when i uh first transferred down to uh Texas Instruments back in nineteen eighty seven um   umhum   uh when i left here uh she had to change a set of plugs in the car  because she was up here for a month or so after i was   uhhuh   and uh it was an interesting experience for her i mean shed always assisted me and done some other things but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was uh it was something a little different   hum its a good experience it helps you feel i think comfortable with your car and feel like its not so scary if um youre driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might you think well ive ive been under that hood and i know whats going on but   uh yeah yeah i think its important that everyone know you know basically how how the darn engine works it helps you figure out whats wrong with it you know ive ive been out with my sister before when   umhum umhum   you know her car died on the highway and i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all
