                                 The Perfect Tax            The expansion of governmentis limited by the consent of the governed Once upon a time that consent washarder to come by In  American colonists took up arms against agovernment far less oppressive than the one that now spends  percent of ourincomes Were more docile now but the threat of revolutionor at least massdissatisfactionremains an important force for good We can harness that forceby designing laws and institutions that require each new government burden tobe widely shared Politicians are less likely to risk annoying  percent ofthe electorate than  percent            Thatwisdom underlies the takings clause in the Fifth Amendment to theConstitution which says in effect that the government cant take your frontlawn and turn it into a park without paying you for it The takings clauseforces taxpayers to share in the cost of any taking and so ensures thatfrivolous takings will meet broad opposition Inspired by the same logic Ipropose a constitutional amendment capping everyones tax bill at say fivetimes the average Thus if the average American pays  in taxes someyear no American could be required to pay more than  that year Thatwould force many taxpayers to share the cost of any new government spendingand so ensure broad opposition to the growth of government            Its traditional to evaluate tax proposals according to thetwin standards of equity and efficiency Before I subject my own proposalto those standards lets talk a bit about the standards themselves            A tax system is inefficientwhen it discourages beneficial economic activities By discouraging workingsaving and investment the United States tax codelike any tax systemmeetsthat standard with ease The only completely efficient tax would be one thatdoes not depend on anything the taxpayer can controlsuch as a head tax of per year If your behavior cant affect your tax bill your tax billwont affect your behavior            That kindof head tax is interesting not as a realistic policy proposal but as abenchmark for comparison Economists like to say that a head tax has theadvantage of being perfectly efficient it does not discourage any economicactivity but the disadvantage of being perfectly inequitable the rich andthe poor pay equal amounts But those economists are wrong on both counts            Lets talk first about equity It is an act ofviolence against the English language to describe as inequitable a tax thatcharges everyone an equal amount In the rhetoric of tax policy the wordinequitable almost never means inequitable rather it means something likeless redistributionist than the speaker would prefer            But Idont want to dismiss a substantive concern just because people frequentlychoose the wrong word to describe it Instead let me make a substantiveresponse Even if you believe that the tax system should be used to iron outincome differentials its still perfectly easy to devise a head tax that isconsistent with your redistributionist philosophy The key is to make taxesdependent on variables that are good predictors of income but entirelyoutside the taxpayers control For example whites on average earn more thanblacks do A direct tax on income might discourage work But taxing whitenesswould not discourage anything while still redistributing income on averagefrom the relatively rich to the relatively poor A tax of  per year ifyoure white and  per year if youre black is a perfectly             On similar grounds we could tax people for being male ortall or beautiful all these traits are positively correlated with income Inthe case of beauty though wed have to be careful to tax only natural beautyOtherwise wed discourage expenditure on shampoo cosmetics and dentistryIn fact if we enjoy having beautiful neighbors we might want tosubsidize beauty rather than tax it you cant always pursue twogoalsin this case income redistribution and an attractivepopulationsimultaneously Regardless of what you mean by equitytherefore you can always adjust the headtax system to conform to yourphilosophy Thus inequity or more accurately insufficient redistributivepower is not a good             But just as the allegedinequity of head taxes is no vice so may their vaunted efficiency be novirtue The problem with an efficient tax system is that it provides nobuiltin brake on the governments avarice A government that takes from everybody this year could decide to take  or  next yearThat is much less likely under an inefficient tax system The income tax forexample is gloriously inefficient The higher the tax rate the less peoplework If the government raised the incometax rate to  percent wed allstop working and tax revenue would be zero To convince us to earn an incomeworth taxing the government is forced to let us             The challenge is to maketaxes more efficient without making them too easy to raise This bringsme back to my proposed constitutional amendment capping individual taxes andtying the cap to the average tax bill Adding a cap to the current system wouldimprove efficiency there would be no disincentive to earn income beyond acertain level while maintaining the natural safeguards against confiscatorygovernment that are built into the income tax In fact those safeguards wouldbe strengthened by the fact that any tax increase would have to be quitebroadbased As a bonus a cap would bring the income tax closer to beingequitable in the true sense of the word The offsetting disadvantages Noneas far as I can see
