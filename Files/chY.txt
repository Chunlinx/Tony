Yard ShrinesThe creation of yard displays as shrines or ofrendas offerings or nacimientos nativity scenes during Christmas is an important way to commemorate many holidays such as Halloween Da de los Muertos Day of the Dead Cinco de Mayo Fifth of May and even the Fourth of July A yard shrine may be a permanent display in the form of a small chapel a nicho niche or a gruta grotto or shrine set up in the front yard of a home It may contain one or more holy images of saints or the Virgin Mary especially La Virgen de Guadalupe flowers or potted plants colorful garlands and votive candles These shrines are often just called nichos and the word shrine is not even mentioned During special holidays such as Christmas or on a saints feast day a shrine may be lighted up for the community to share It is a common practice to make the sign of the cross or recite a short prayer when walking past a religious yard shrineIn many families the shrine is erected as the result of a promesa or manda promise or vow made to a particular saint or in memory of a family member who has died A yard shrine whether called a nicho or a gruta can be decorated in various ways There are always plants and flowers sometimes seashells decorate the outside if it is constructed of cement and the decorations will reflect the holiday season of the year At Christmas there may be lights tinsel and poinsettias During Lent there may be lilies and pastel paper chains Yard shrines demonstrate that religion is integrated into the life of a family and they are considered to be sacred sites for prayer and devotion There is no division between the public life and the religious and devotional life of a Chicano family A yard shrine is a public exhibition of a familys religion and their devotion to a particular saint as well as a display of an artistic sensibility that emerges unconsciously from the familys beliefsA related form of yard folk art not necessarily religious is the yard asamblea assemblage A wellknown man in Los Angeles referred to as El Hombre de las Banderas The Man of the Flags created spectacular scenes up until his death in  Art created in the yard of ones home serves to draw in the community and make it a participant These yard sculptures are created from bits and pieces of contemporary life and popular culture drawn from many different sourcesSee also Folk Art

families favor the term yard while referring to their gardens pronouncing it in Spanish as yarda Although yarda appears to be a pochismo Chicano slang it can be found in Cassells Spanish Dictionary The layout and organizational aesthetics of Chicano yardas are unique enough that folklorists and cultural geographers have written about them Many yardas can aesthetically constitute yard art even though it does not appear that this is the intent of the creator Besides planting shrubs flowers and sometimes grass the gardener will bring into play the creativity that goes into decorating a yard unconsciously with the result being a folk art display Invariably a yard will contain many potted flowers arranged in a patterned manner The central focus of many yards is often a devotional shrine set up in memory of a family member with a nicho housing a saint or Madonna and the design of the yards plants and flowers is laid out in reference to the shrine Some yardas may not have planted grass but instead hardpacked dirt that is kept free of weeds swept frequently and kept prepared for family gatherings But trees preferably fruit trees abound to make shade for family gatherings and outdoor cookingA common practice among many workingclass Mexican Americans is to recycle as much as possible although the concept that recycling is an environmentally correct thing to do is not always known Common recycled objects that can be found in yards are tables kitchen pots painted tin cans and car tires used as planters Tires are cut across the width making two containers opened up and cut with a scalloped design around the edges After being painted and filled with flowers and plants these plant containers do not even resemble their original form Recycled tire planters can line a driveway or establish the boundaries of a large yard The practice of reusing objects that have lost their original purpose such as kitchen pitchers and pots is a means of keeping something familiar something associated with a memory alive and finding a new use for it This practice probably originates from poverty but the historical result has been that it creates its own aesthetic in adding adornment to ones home and life These yardscapes as theyve come to be called are composed of bits and pieces of ones personal life and as such can add visual charm and historical value to a home A familys religious and cultural values as well as the special identity of being Mexican American can be found in yardasSee also Folk Art Nichos Yard ShrinesReferences Kitchener  Ramos Yo Soy Joaquin See I Am
