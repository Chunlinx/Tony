                    Background        On the basis of sequence homo logy and similarity of        threedimensional structures phosphoprotein phosphatases        PPases have been classified into three families        designated PPP PPM and PTP reviewed in       The        PPP and PPM families are comprised of phosphoserine and        phosphothreoninespecific enzymes whereas the PTP family        consists of phosphotyrosinespecific and dualspecificity        enzymes     The major members of the PPP family are        PP PPA and PPB calcineurin class of phosphatases        Protein phosphatase  PP a newer member of the PPP        family differs from the other SerThr phosphatases in that        it contains regulatory and subcellular targeting        functions within a single polypeptide       While its        catalytic core exhibits strong similarity to those of the        other members of this family its Nterminus consists of        three tetratricopeptide repeats TPRs that are unique to        the PP class TPR domains consist of a series of        antiparallel amphipathic  helices that bundle together        through hydrophobic interactions to form a cradleshaped        groove postulated to be involved in binding a number of        proteins of regulatory importance such as heat shock        protein  a major cellular chaperone              The         Apicomplexan family of parasites        exemplified by         Plasmodia are major disease agents        of humans As the causative agent of malaria         Plasmodia sp alone infects about         million people globally and results in an annual death toll        of nearly  million             Plasmodium falciparum Pf is the        most virulent of all and causes fatal cerebral malaria        Because of the continual emergence of drugresistant        parasites throughout the world a need for a fundamental        knowledge of the signaling pathways of the parasite has        been recognized In the recent past this has led to the        identification of a number of         Plasmodium protein phosphatases some        putative      others experimentally demonstrated        eg       Most of these phosphatases resembled        the classical mammalian PP PPA PPB and PPC enzymes              and some were potentially novel SerThr        phosphatases              In this report we describe the cloning and        characterization of a novel PP phosphatase from Pf PfPP        that contains an unusually long Nterminal extension that        contained four putative TPR motifs and played an important        role in fatty acidmediated activation of the enzyme The        structural and biochemical properties of PfPP described        herein are hallmarks of the PP class and thus establish        PfPP as a likely player in parasitic signal transduction        and hence a potential target for antimalarial drug        design                    Results                  Identification of PfPP cDNA and gene          To identify new SerThr phosphatases of Pf we have          recently undertaken a PCRbased approach At first we          made degenerate deoxyoligonuclotide primers corresponding          to the conserved peptide sequences GDXHGQ and GDXVDRG of          PPs     An approximately  bp PCR product          obtained by using these primers with the Pf D genomic          DNA as template was cloned in the pGEMT vector          Promega using the TA cloning strategy Sequencing of          individual clones revealed a variety of potential PPP          sequences in Pf one of which was an exact match with a          putative open reading frame ORF on Pf chromosome  in          the sequence database of the Sanger Center Accession No          AL Comparison of the predicted primary structure          of the protein clearly revealed its similarity with known          members of the PP family including the presence of          multiple TPR domains Fig and  Specific primers were          then made against this ORF and the  base pair gene          was cloned and confirmed by sequencing The same set of          primers were then used to amplify the PfPP cDNA sequence          from a polyAenriched mRNA population of Pf strain Dd          This sequence fully matched the genomic Sanger sequence          suggesting the lack of introns in the PfPP gene                          Recombinant expression of PfPP          To express the putative PfPP protein we subcloned it          in the bacterial expression vector pETb and introduced          the plasmids into           E coli BLDE As shown in Fig           when induced with IPTG the pETbPfPP clone          produced a polypeptide of approximate Mr  k lane           which is in excellent agreement with the calculated MW of           considering that pETb adds a His            tag about  kDa to the Nterminus          of the recombinant protein The presence of the His            tag could be confirmed by antiHis          antibody in immunoblot data not shown The Histagged          PfPP was subsequently purified through standard          nickelchelation chromatography Fig  lane  Using          Plabeled histone as substrate under standard assay          conditions in absence of any activator the specific          activity of the recombinant PfPP was measured to be             nmoles of Pminmg enzyme          The deletion mutant TPRPfPP was similarly cloned          by PCR using a primer corresponding to the internal          sequence and purified by nickel chelation affinity          chromatography The deletion mutant starts with Met          as described in Fig                           Identification of native parasitic PP          To identify whether PfPP is actually expressed in the          parasite cellfree extracts of the asynchronous          erythrocytic stage parasites were subjected to standard          chromatographic procedures that had been previously          optimized for human PP     Studies of mammalian PP          have revealed that the TPR domain might act as an          autoinhibitory domain of the phosphatase activity and          that tryptic digestion of PP causes loss of the TPRs and          concomitant stimulation of activity       As          described under Materials and Methods the purification          was in fact monitored by assaying for a trypsinactivated          phosphatase with the assumption that PfPP may behave          like mammalian PP in this regard       As          mentioned the activity peaks always coincided with a           kDa band in parallel Western analyses of the          chromatographic fractions In SDSPAGE the partially          purified fraction contained a major polypeptide of the          expected size  kDa Fig  lane  In Western blot          the rabbit antibody raised against the purified          recombinant protein also specifically reacted with the          native polypeptide Fig  lanes   A similar          fraction prepared from uninfected erythrocytes contained          very little protein Fig  lane  and did not react          with the antibody lane  A preimmune serum served as          a negative control Fig  lane  As expected the          native Pf protein was about  kDa smaller than the          Histagged recombinant compare the native band in lanes            and  with the recombinant in lanes  and  Using          phosphohistone as substrate the native Pf enzyme          exhibited a specific activity of    nmoles of P          per minute per mg enzyme which is comparable to that of          the recombinant enzyme Together these results          demonstrated the equivalence of the native and          recombinant proteins and in turn confirmed the          authenticity of the cDNA sequence                          Primary structure of PfPP          When the predicted primary structure of PfPP was          aligned with known PP sequences Fig  the following          features were obvious First PfPP contained the          catalytic core found in all SerThr phosphatases of the          PPP family including the signature motifs such as          GDXHGQ GDFVDRG RGNHE HGLL and SAPNYCD to name a few               Sitedirected mutagenesis and structural          studies in PP  and PP have previously established the          roles of specific amino acid residues in these domains in          the various aspects of catalysis such as metal ion          binding phosphate recognition and coordination of          water molecules                While the catalytic core is generally necessary and          sufficient for the phosphohydrolase activity of PPP          enzymes the residues outside the core play critical          roles in binding accessory proteins or small molecules          that modulate the catalytic activity                  Specifically in the PP class the Nterminus has been          shown to contain three TPR motifs        the          threedimensional structure of which is now also          available     Interestingly the Nterminal sequence          of PfPP was the longest of all and seemed to contain          four TPR motifs instead of three Fig  Thus in          comparing the full sequences of the PPs only three of          the four PfPP TPRs were aligned with the others and the          second TPR of PfPP was left out A detailed sequence          analysis of all the PfPP TPRs is offered below          The TPR motif is a degenerate amino acid repeat          that is often found in tandem arrays sometimes separated          by spacer sequences     We propose such a residue          spacer between the first two TPRs of PfPP Fig           Although no single amino acid is absolutely invariant in          all TPRs they do contain a largely conserved pattern of          amino acid similarity in terms of size hydrophobicity          and spacing      Eight amino acid residues are          critically placed on the same face of their respective          helices   and  on the first helix and   and           on the second      As shown in Fig  residues          that are identical or have similar hydrophobicity are          found in all four proposed TPRs of PfPP in the correct          relative spacing Moreover secondary structure          prediction suggested that each PfPP TPR also has the          potential to form the two conserved helices A and B as          marked in Fig  Thus all the TPRs of PfPP may satisfy          the structural requirements of a TPR motif          An approximately residue stretch following the last          TPR of PP Fig  shows weak similarity to a TPR motif          However alphahelix prediction and structure          determination have shown that it is a single long helix          that extends out of the TPR domain     Thus this          region may not represent a typical TPR and therefore is          simply marked as helix in Fig                           Autoinhibitory role of PfPP TPR activation by          polyunsaturated fatty acids          The biochemical properties further confirmed the          PPlike nature of the Pf enzyme First of all members          of the PP class are distinguished by their profound          stimulation by polyunsaturated fatty acids                 As shown in Fig  the phosphatase activity of PfPP          increased with increasing concentrations of arachidonic          acid and oleic acid At its highest the fattyacid          stimulated activity was about  times the basal activity          and was exhibited at approximately  and  M of          arachinodic and oleic acids respectively In contrast          stearic acid a saturated fatty acid did not appreciably          stimulate PfPP activity          To test the role of TPR region in this activation a          TPR deletion mutant of PP TPRPfPP starting at the          Met was expressed with an Nterminal His            tag The recombinant protein was          expressed from pETb clone and purified by Nichelation          chromatography Fig  lane  In SDSPAGE analysis          TPRPfPP exhibited a Mr of approximately  k as          expected predicted size of  for the PP part plus          about  for the His            tag Interestingly the specific          activity of the TPRPfPP enzyme was about times that          of the fulllength PfPP without arachidonic acid             nmoles of P per minute per mg enzyme Fig           Moreover unlike the fulllength enzyme TPRPfPP was          not activated by arachidonic acid suggesting that the          TPR region is required for the activation          These results are reminiscent of similar studies done          in other PP enzymes in which mutational inactivation of          the TPR domain resulted in an elevated basal activity and          concomitant reduced response to unsaturated fatty acids              Such studies led to the proposal that TPR domains          regulate the PP catalytic region in a negative manner          and that the interaction of arachidonic acid with TPR          relieves this autoinhibition This was further supported          by the demonstration that trypsin cleaved PP in the          hinge sequence connecting the TPR region and catalytic          domain and that such cleavage produced a highly active          enzyme which was refractory to further activation by          fatty acids       To test whether this is also          true of PfPP we digested recombinant PfPP with          trypsin which resulted in the production of a          trypsinresistant fragment that was very similar in size          to TPRPfPP Fig  lane  When assayed for          phosphatase activity           in vitro the trypsindigested          PfPP indeed behaved like TPRPfPP in that it was about          fold more active than the fulllength enzyme and was          not activated by arachidonic acid any further Fig           Together these results suggest a role of PfPP TPR in          autoinhibition and in fatty acidmediated          activation                          Okadaic acid sensitivity of PfPP          The differential sensitivity of the members of the PPP          family to biological toxins has been exploited as a          diagnostic tool in studying these phosphatases The          marine toxin okadaic acid OA in particular inhibits          the PPA class of phosphatases at subnanomolar          concentrations IC   nM and the PP class in the          low nanomolar range IC   nM The SAPNYC motif of          PPP enzymes is essential for OAbinding and is found in          all OAsensitive phosphatases including PP PPA and          PP        and references therein This motif          is also present in PfPP Fig  Phosphatases lacking          this motif include the PPB and PPC classes which are          thus highly resistant to OA PPA contains an additional          Cys residue two amino acids downstream underlined in          SAPNYCYRCG believed to be important for the profound          sensitivity of this class to OA     and this Cys is          absent in PfPP and other PP enzymes Fig  As shown          in Fig  OA inhibited PfPP in a dosedependent manner          with an IC            of    nM This moderate          OAsensitivity further establishes the identity of PfPP          since other PP enzymes also exhibit an IC            value for OA in the  nM range              The TPR mutant exhibited an essentially identical          IC            not shown supporting the notion          that the TPR domains do not play a direct role in the          interaction with OA                          PfPP binds Pf heat shock protein  hsp          Hsp is a highly conserved molecular chaperone          necessary for viability and for proper folding          processing and function of proteins involved in several          signal transduction pathways      Interestingly          mammalian hsp has been shown to specifically interact          with PP and this interaction may have important          consequences in PP structure and function      An          hsp ortholog has been described in Pf     but its          function is currently unknown It was therefore logical          for us to ask whether an interaction between PP and          hsp also occurs in Pf To initiate these studies we          performed a coimmunoprecipitation analysis of Pf          extracts in which complexes containing PP were first          precipitated with antiPP antibody and the precipitate          then probed with antihsp antibody in Western blot          Results Fig  show that Pfhsp is indeed found in          complex with PfPP suggesting a potential role of this          interaction in the mutual regulation of these two          important proteins The control nonimmune serum did          not react with either protein lane  and did not          precipitate hsp lane                             Discussion        We provide biochemical and molecular evidence for a PP        protein SerThr phosphatase of         P falciparum that has the catalytic        core of the PPP superfamily and four tetratricopeptide        residue repeat TPR domains Fig   We have        therefore tentatively named this enzyme PfPP To our        knowledge PfPP is the only TPRcontaining         Plasmodium protein reported at this        time These domains and the associated properties such as        activation by unsaturated fatty acids are by far the most        noteworthy features of PfPP        Recently a PP phosphatase was identified in         Trypanosoma    that contained the        prototype PP primary structure including three TPR        domains at the Nterminus While mammalian PP is activated         fold by arachidonic acid the         Trypanosoma PP like its         Plasmodium counterpart Fig  was        also activated only modestly about fold Although the        reason behind the lower activation potential is unknown at        least in PfPP it correlates with a similar fold activation        following loss of the TPR domains through either        mutagenesis or proteolytic cleavage Fig   Thus it        appears that the TPR domains of the primitive parasitic PP        may be less autoinhibitory that those of their higher        eukaryotic counterparts Recent mutational analysis of        recombinant PP has identified sequences important in        autoinhibition     Mutation of Glu underlined in        the human PP in Fig  whose side chain projects away        from the TPR groove resulted in a fold elevation of        basal activity and this Glu is conserved in both Pf and         Trypanosoma PP Fig  A role of        the Cterminal end in autoinhibition was conjectured based        on the finding that mutation of Gln underlined in Fig         elevated basal activity by fold     This residue        is also found in Pf Gln although it is not conserved        in a number of other PP sequences Fig  Clearly        detailed mutational analysis of these domains should shed        light on the mechanism of PfPP autoinhibition and the role        of polyunsaturated fatty acids in preventing it        The TPR motif was originally identified as a protein        interaction module in the cell division cycle CDC        proteins in yeast     but has since been shown to        occur in proteins with diverse functions in a variety of        species     The number of the TPR domains the spacing        between them and their placement in the primary structure        of the protein appear variable and the relative        contribution of the individual TPRs in a given protein has        not been studied At least four major kinds of        macromolecular complexes have been identified that involve        TPR domains These include complexes involved in anaphase        promotion transcription repression protein import and        molecular chaperoning      Yeast twohybrid analysis        and         in vitro interaction studies have        shown that the TPR domain of PP interacts with the TPR        domains of CDC and CDC which may be important in        recruiting PP to the anaphase promoting complex APC and        to the mitotic spindles during cell division         Interaction of PP with heat shock protein  a chaperone        has received special attention because of its potential to        regulate a variety of pathways For example PP is a major        component of mature glucocorticoid receptor complexes of        higher eukaryotes and appears to regulate glucocorticoid        receptor function         in vivo     and references        therein Such observations suggest that PP may act as a        cochaperone for hsp and raise the possibility that        protein dephosphorylation may play an important regulatory        role in protein folding      Interestingly recent        studies have identified a few residues of mammalian PP        critically important for its interaction with hsp            As marked on the human PP TPR underlined in Fig  the        corresponding residues are Lys Lys and Arg It        is notable that the corresponding residues are also        conserved in PfPP TPR The availability of fulllength and        TPRdeleted recombinant PfPP clones will now allow us to        further investigate the exact nature of the PfPPPfhsp        complexes and map the interacting PfPP residues through        sitedirected mutagenesis Clearly the discovery of PfPP        and its interaction with homologous hsp will open up new        directions in parasitic protein gene regulation and        signaling and may lead to specific drug targets                    Conclusions        PfPP represents the first TPRcontaining protein        discovered in the         Apicomplexan parasites In view of        the essential role of TPR domains in proteinprotein        interaction further studies of PfPP and its TPR domain        will shed new light on phosphatase regulation and the role        of PP in these clinically important parasites As with        mammalian PP PfPP may also play an important role in        cell division through its interaction with parasitic CDC        proteins Interaction between the         Plasmodium PP and heat shock protein         may reflect a mutual relationship between protein        phosphorylation and protein folding in this parasite The        role of TPR in this interaction can be addressed through        structurefunction analysis of the recombinant        proteins                    Materials and methods                  PCR and other procedures          The following oligodeoxynucleotide primers were          designed against the putative PfPP sequence found on          chromosome  AL           Plasmodium          falciparum chr          ATGTTACACAACCATGATGTAGAAGAAGTAAATGTTTTGATACAAATTATGAGC          These primers were used to amplify the PfPP gene or the          cDNA using the PfD genomic DNA or Dd total RNA as          template with PCR and RTPCR respectively The RT          reaction was performed using AMV reverse transcriptase          and all PCRs were performed with a  mixture of          TaqPfu polymerase The products were cloned into pGEMT          and confirmed by sequencing The genomic and cDNA          sequences were identical This sequence was then          subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of the pETb          vector by designing similar primers but containing the          respective restriction sites The TPR deletion mutant          starting at Glu bold in Fig  was also amplified          in a similar manner using specific primers and then          cloned Introduction of the plasmids into           E coli BLDE cells containing          the compatible RIG plasmid     induction of the          proteins with IPTG and purification through Nichelation          chromatography were performed using the HisBind kit          reagents and procedure Novagen          Antibodies against PP and hsp were raised in rabbit          and mouse respectively using standard procedures              Fatty acids were purchased from Sigma St Louis MO          SDSPAGE and Western blot using chemiluminescencebased          detection were performed essentially as described              Immunoprecipitation of PfPP complexes followed by          immunoblot analysis of the precipitate were carried out          essentially as described                              Growth of Plasmodiumand purification of          PfPP                    P falciparum D or Dd was          grown in human Apositive erythrocytes and infected cells          were harvested at about  parasitemia and lysed by the          saponin method essentially as described      PfPP          was partially purified using published procedures              In brief the parasites were resuspended in buffer A           mM TrisCl pH   glycerol  mM DTT plus           mM NaCl  Triton X leupeptin  gml and          aprotinin  gml at an approximate protein          concentration of  mg per ml The suspension was          sonicated and the lysate centrifuged at   g for           min The supernatant called total extract was          subjected to  ammonium sulfate fractionation The          pellet was resuspended in  ml of buffer B  mM HEPES          pH   mM EDTA  mM DTT desalted on a Sephadex G          column equilibrated with buffer B then subjected to          sequential chromatography on a  ml HiTrap heparin column          Pharmacia and then a  ml HiTrap Q column Pharmacia          PP activity was followed during the purification by          assaying trypsinstimulated pNPPase activity The          fractions were further confirmed by Western blot using          antiPfPP antibody Parasite culture was synchronized          essentially as described earlier                              Phosphatase assay          Phosphatase activity against pNPP or phosphohistone          substrates was determined essentially as described          previously Standard assays were performed in buffer A          containing  mM EDTA and additional activators or          inhibitors were added only where mentioned Reactions          were incubated at C Plabeled phosphohistone was          made as described       When using          phosphohistone as substrate reactions were carried out          in  l followed by quantification of the liberated Pi          by phosphomolybdate extraction assay                Reactions were followed with time and results were          corrected by subtraction of the corresponding values from          an enzymefree reaction When           p nitrophenylphosphate was used as          substrate at  mM the reaction was scaled up to           l and the liberated           p nitrophenol was quantitated by          measurement of absorbance at  nm               Phosphatase reactions were routinely initiated with the          addition of substrate Dephosphorylation was kept to less          than   of the total phosphorylated substrate and the          reaction was linear with respect to enzyme concentration          and time When using potential activators eg fatty          acids or inhibitors eg okadaic acid they were          added to the enzyme mixture  minutes prior to          initiating the reaction with the addition of substrate
