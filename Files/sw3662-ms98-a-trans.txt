        what do you think     well  uh this is this is about drug testing right   right   well uh im  im certainly under the uh uh the influence of the idea that that the government needs to have less control on what uh what the citizens do although i do see this as uh uh something that definitely needs to be taken care of whether that whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or in the government or the hands of hands of the government is a you know a a different question i think as far as im concerned uh in a in other words i am favor in favor of drug control or or or drug testing um i was drug tested when i came to my job here at TI yet but but at the same time i dont think uh that should be governed by by the government uh per se i think it should be by more by the private institution   umhum   how about you   yeah i think they the corporations should uh do all that they should uh have drug screening before they hire an employee   umhum   and uh anytime that an employee like if theyre coming to late work all the time and uh and if they if theyre especially if theres not on the line or any kind of sensitive job where   uhhuh   you know if they can if they made a mistake it would cost a lot of money or or peoples lives then they need to be watched carefully so   yeah sure uhhuh yeah i i agree with you i you know i would even think that um uh i could in theory take that alone a you know a step further and say anybody in any job you know if the corporation felt like uh  and and this is why i mean uh drugs are the biggest problem i think to face America today i mean  its what drives crime its what drives   umhum   um uh any sort of of uh uh pain and discomfort in the world  or in America i think its somewhat its somewhat um driven by drugs and i think that uh were corporations and uh private industry to take um take command in this situation that maybe maybe we might have some some control over that we you know if you cant work then you cant  be a little bit harder to take take the drugs or whatever i dont know   right   course that might up crime you know and uh people go in and steal your television and steal and sell it just because they cant they cant work anymore you know   yeah yeah but you got to have a a safe work place thats all there is to it   definitely youre youre youre definitely right that  you cant you cant have it any other way   umhum   uh yeah you know whether  whether in in the case that you brought up you know whether  uh you know whether if its a policeman and hes working with uh the public and he has a and has a gun in his holster or or even you know if its a guy at McDonalds cooking a burger i think theyre dangerous in either situation   umhum   um i dont what what do you think um what percentage of of corporations and uh private industry do you think use uh drug testing   i think its its more frequent now its probably like forty fifty percent   oh really uhhuh   yeah because uh all the jobs that ive applied for have uh mentioned some type of drug screening yeah   right yeah what kind of work are you in   uh i work at Sears and i just do warehouse work   uhhuh uhhuh and did they give you drug testing   uh not they hired me in nineteen eighty four so yeah but now they they uh they issued a statement about that about  three months ago   oh okay uhhuh oh so are they going to uh begin spontaneous uh drug testing   uh not that i know of it was more about uh all the peoples problems like theyve been laying off a lot of people and uh and uh   uhhuh oh yeah   they sent out uh employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem family problems you know it kind of covered everything   sure uhhuh uhhuh   but i know they have a lot of drug problems so   yeah  what do you think about um you know  something that kind of concerns me is uh you you know you and i are tested for for whatever work we happen to do do you think there should be drug testing for political officials   yes i do because because a lot of them are you know theyre hypocritical they they talk against drugs and then they get caught you know   yeah i do too yeah uhhuh   in stings in Washington whether its drugs or any other kind of uh like the the money laundering scams all that was drug related so   yeah oh yeah   and that cost us the country you know billions of dollars   sure sure yeah i would agree with you i i cant see i cant see how we can expect the you know uh uh   so   people working in the in in America to um uh to put any trust into our political officials if they dont you know  uh it just doesnt make sense to have them  it it to to worry about legislation unless theyre doing that themselves
