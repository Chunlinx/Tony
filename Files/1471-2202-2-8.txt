                    Background        Axonal regeneration is limited in the central nervous        system CNS following injury   This regeneration        failure appears not to be due to intrinsic limitations of        mature neurons to grow axons but rather to nonpermissive        properties of the CNS environment   One theory is that        white matter contains putative inhibitors of axonal growth        associated with myelin                       However extensive axonal growth occurs         in vivo from neurons transplanted        into white matter providing that disruption of tissue        organization and glial scarring are minimized    In        contrast when tissue disruption was significant and        accompanied by glial scarring including astrogliosis and        the upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans        CSPGs axonal growth stopped in areas of CSPG expression        These studies have questioned the role of myelinassociated        inhibitors in preventing axonal regeneration and together        with         in vitro studies showing inhibition        of neurite growth by CSPGs     implicate the        expression of CSPGs at injury sites in causing regeneration        failure        However these transplantation studies involved survival        periods of over two days so that the contributions of glial        scarring and disruption of the organization of cells and        molecules that were present prior to injury disrupted        geometry cannot be evaluated separately This limitation        can be overcome by culturing neurons on cryostat sections        where both the success and orientation of neurite growth on        white matter have been shown to depend on the geometry of        the underlying fiber tract   Neurites on white matter        are restricted to a parallel orientation consistent with        successful axonal growth         in vivo from neuronal transplants                 Given the dependence of        neurite growth on tissue geometry we sought to determine        whether disruption of this geometry is sufficient to        inhibit neurite growth in the absence of glial        scarring        Adult rat spinal cord or sciatic nerve was crushed with        forceps         ex vivo and immediately frozen to        prevent additional changes within the tissue such as glial        scarring Wallerian degeneration and formation of bands of        Bngner Neurite growth on the uncrushed portions of spinal        cord white matter or nerve was extensive and mostly        parallel to the tract but significantly inhibited by        crushed white matter or nerve In contrast neurites were        unimpeded by crushed gray matter These data suggest that        disruption of CNS white matter and peripheral nerve        geometry is sufficient to prevent axonal regeneration The        disrupted tissue elements involved in white matter may be        oligodendrocytes andor myelin since neurites were not        inhibited by crushed gray matter Therefore regeneration        failure in CNS white matter may be partly due to the        persistence of disrupted myelin In peripheral nerves        acute injury may also prevent regeneration but successful        regeneration may occur following chronic changes involving        clearance of putative inhibitors                    Results                  Histology of crushed tissue          Crushed portions of spinal cord white matter Fig A          and sciatic nerves Fig D were characterized by          increased optical density compared with uncrushed tissue          when viewed with phasecontrast optics This is similar          to the appearance of fiber tracts sectioned transversely            No increase in optical density was evident within          crushed gray matter Fig A GFAP Fig B and myelin          Fig C which are normally aligned mostly in parallel          with the fiber tracts appeared to be disrupted within          crushed white matter Patches of increased GFAP          immunoreactivity could occasionally be seen within          crushed tissue Fig B but not to the extent or          morphology normally seen in glial scars             Moreover no increase in CSPG immunoreactivity was          present within crushed white matter data not shown A          line of complete tissue disruption could often be seen          midway through crushed segments of spinal cord white          matter Fig ABC                          Neurite growth on sections of crushed spinal          cord          The distribution of neurons was heterogeneous on          uncrushed spinal cord white matter but the behavior of          neurites was independent of cell density Therefore for          purposes of demonstration the photomicrographs shown are          generally of cases from higher density cultures Neurite          growth on uncrushed spinal cord white matter was          extensive and mostly constrained to an orientation          parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tract Fig          AC These neurites however were generally inhibited          from extending onto crushed white matter In some cases          neurites terminated abruptly at the border of crushed          white matter Fig AC In other cases the neurites          became increasingly disoriented as they approached the          border of the crush and were closely associated with          other neurites appearing to use each other as a          substrate Fig E similar to neurites that          occasionally extend over crosssections of white matter            Neurites that extended from neurons attached          directly to crushed white matter often grew in          nonparallel orientations and frequently appeared to use          each other as a substrate Fig C In other cases          neurons on crush sites showed minimal neurite outgrowth          Fig E Interestingly neurites were generally          unaffected by crushed gray matter Fig E G          The numbers of neurons that attached to CNS white          matter were limited and large segments of uncrushed white          matter often contained no neurons at all even with the          improved culture conditions utilizing Neurobasal medium          Furthermore while neurites generally appeared to be          inhibited by crushed white matter this inhibition was          not absolute as neurites occasionally crossed onto          crushed tissue To determine more precisely if crushed          white matter is less permissive for neurite growth          quantitative comparisons were made of neurite lengths          from neurons attached directly to crush sites and neurons          attached to uncrushed regions Since it is difficult to          follow a single neurite from soma to growth cone in the          case of high neuronal densities the quantitative          comparisons were derived from measurements of neurites          from neurons that attached in lower densities The mean          length of neurites on crushed spinal cord white matter          was significantly reduced compared with that of neurites          on uncrushed white matter Fig A           p   indicating that          regions of disrupted white matter geometry are inhibitory          to neurite growth To determine the effect of disrupted          geometry on neurite orientation quantitative comparisons          were made of the orientations of these same neurites The          mean angular deviation of neurites from an orientation          parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fiber tract on          crush sites was significantly greater than that of          neurites on uncrushed spinal cord white matter Fig B           p   Moreover the          variance of this deviation on crushed white matter was          significantly greater than that of neurites on uncrushed          white matter F             p   This is consistent          with the interpretation that neurites extend in a wider          range of orientations on crushed white matter                          Neurite growth on sections of crushed sciatic          nerve          The density of neurons and neurites was considerably          greater on sections of sciatic nerve compared with that          seen on spinal cord white matter Similar to that on          spinal cord white matter neurite growth on uncrushed          segments of sciatic nerve was extensive and oriented in          parallel with the longitudinal axis of the nerve Fig          AE However as in the case of crushed spinal cord          white matter neurites rarely extended onto crushed          sciatic nerve Fig ACEG As neurites approached the          crushed tissue they often appeared to deviate from a          parallel orientation and also appeared shorter in length          Fig CG          Neurite density was quantified in relation to the          crushed tissue by assessing the average total          fluorescence at a range of spatial positions along the          longitudinal axis and subtracting the fluorescence due to          neuronal cell bodies Differences in total plating          density between culture experiments culture dishes and          sections were normalized by dividing each value by the          maximum fluorescence value within the same field Using          this quantification technique a statistically          significant reduction            p   comparing positions           m on either side of crush edge in neurite density          was detected on crushed sciatic nerve tissue Fig A          suggesting that acutely crushed sciatic nerve tissue is          inhibitory to neurite growth          A similar quantification of neuronal density in          relation to the crushed sciatic nerve showed that          neuronal attachment was also significantly reduced            p   on crushed sciatic          nerve tissue Fig B Since it is possible that the          reduced neurite density on crushed sciatic nerve is a          direct consequence of there being fewer neurons a          separate analysis was made comparing the lengths of          neurites from neurons attached directly on crushed          sciatic nerve with those attached on uncrushed sciatic          nerve Fig A Neurite length was significantly reduced          on crushed sciatic nerve            p   To determine if the          orientation of neurites is altered by crushed sciatic          nerve tissue the orientations of these neurites were          also compared Fig B The mean angular deviation of          neurites from an orientation parallel to the longitudinal          axis on crushed sciatic nerve was significantly greater          than that of neurites on uncrushed sciatic nerve            p   Moreover the          variance of the deviation on crushed nerve was          significantly greater than that on uncrushed nerve          F             p   indicating a wider          range of orientations on crushed tissue                            Discussion                  Central nervous system regeneration          Spinal cord injury disrupts the anatomical          organization geometry of the cells and molecules that          compose fiber tracts including myelin and elicits glial          scarring including astrogliosis and increased expression          of CSPGs   These latter factors inhibit neurite          growth           in vitro     The success          of axonal growth from neurons transplanted into white          matter appears to depend on avoiding significant          disruption of this geometry and the upregulation of CSPGs             When avoided extensive parallel axonal growth          can occur When disrupted the pattern of CSPG expression          is coincident with abortive axonal growth These          observations have supported the argument that CSPGs are          the primary cause of axonal regeneration failure          However the relative contributions to abortive          regeneration of CSPG upregulation and the disruption of          the organization of cells and biochemical factors such          as for example myelinassociated inhibitors that were          present prior to injury disrupted geometry cannot be          easily assessed           in vivo  By the time axons          initiate a growth response to the injury the tissue has          undergone considerable change including CSPG          upregulation Disrupted tissue geometry may contribute to          blocking axonal regeneration independently of glial          scarring and CSPG upregulation          Most previous attempts to establish an organotypic          culture model of axonal growth on CNS white matter have          failed because it was not possible to obtain attachment          of neurons to white matter without enzymatically altering          the substrate   or treating with neurotrophins             or conditioned medium   It was recently shown          that sympathetic neurons can attach to longitudinal          sections of CNS white matter provided that they are grown          under optimal conditions and plated in large numbers          Culture in Neurobasal medium   has been shown to          optimize the survival of embryonic chick sympathetic          neurons           in vitro   and provides the          necessary numbers Consistent with the available data          from both           in vivo and           in vitro studies these neurons          extend neurites in parallel on white matter and are          inhibited from extending onto white matter from gray          matter indicating that these neurons are sensitive to          the relevant inhibitory and growthorienting cues found          in white matter          A limitation of tissue section culture is that it          accounts for only two of the three dimensions normally          present           in vivo  However the intent of          this study was to examine the role of the parallel array          of tissue elements in regulating axonal growth and the          twodimensional sections are longitudinal cuts through          this threedimensional parallel geometry The behavior of          growth cones on the sections cannot be assumed to be the          same as that normally occurring in the more complex          threedimensional structure of the tissue in vivo          Nevertheless the striking similarity to the parallel          axonal growth within white matter observed from          transplanted neurons           in vivo                    makes it unlikely that the pattern of neurite          growth in tissue section culture is due to a limitation          in the available degrees of freedom In fact the          correspondence between the orientation of neurite growth          in this assay and that observed           in vivo suggests that tissue          section culture models at least some of the relevant          tissue properties and geometry This same technique          provides a unique opportunity to assess the response of          neurites to injured tissue without glial scarring Spinal          cord was removed bilaterally crushed and immediately          frozen to prevent additional injuryinduced changes          Longitudinal sections were then used as substrata for          neuronal cultures          It was evident from phasecontrast optics GFAP          immunoreactivity and myelin staining that the crush          manipulations disrupted the organization of spinal cord          white matter However as assessed by GFAP          immunohistochemistry there was no indication of the          dense astrogliotic matrix characteristic of glial scars             Although patches of increased GFAP          immunoreactivity appeared in the crushed tissue these          were likely due to increased accessibility and density of          GFAP caused by crushing The short period of time between          crushing the tissue and freezing less than  minutes          would have prevented astrogliosis Moreover CSPG          immunohistochemistry showed no increase in CSPG          expression          On uncrushed white matter neurites extended in          parallel with the fiber tracts as previously reported            However crushed white matter appeared to be          relatively nonpermissive for neurite growth Like those          on crosssections of white matter   neurons attached          directly on crushed white matter often extended          nonparallel neurites or little neurite outgrowth at all          Moreover neurites originating on uncrushed white matter          were inhibited by crushed white matter This is most like          the situation           in vivo when regenerating axons          approach an injury site These neurites often terminated          abruptly as they approached crushed white matter often          turning in nonparallel directions and appeared to use          each other as a substrate A zone of complete tissue          disruption was often present within the injury site but          neurites rarely extended far enough onto the crushed          tissue to encounter this zone          Earlier studies using tissue section culture in which          virtually no neurons attached on white matter concluded          that white matter is nonpermissive for neurite growth                 This conclusion was premature in          light of recent studies demonstrating that although white          matter is less permissive for neuronal attachment than          gray matter it is highly permissive for neurite growth          from those neurons that do attach providing that this          growth occurs in parallel with the fiber tract            This parallel constraint on neurite growth may be          mediated by myelin Pettigrew and Crutcher companion          paper httpwwwbiomedcentralcom and          possibly its neuritegrowth inhibitory activity                     Because myelin is          organized in parallel with the fiber tract it may          normally permit parallel neurite growth while inhibiting          nonparallel growth          This same inhibitory activity might also contribute to          the nonpermissive properties of crushed white matter An          injury to a myelinated tract may disrupt the parallel          organization of myelin thereby contributing to a          relatively nonpermissive environment for axonal          regeneration Consistent with this hypothesis neurites          were unimpeded by crushed gray matter exhibiting          essentially random growth as seen on uncrushed gray          matter Injury may also unmask inhibitors that are          normally inaccessible to growing axons One inhibitor          myelinassociated glycoprotein MAG is reportedly          expressed within but not on outer surfaces of myelin          sheaths   An injury to white matter could presumably          expose these factors by disrupting the sheaths As a          result axons approaching injured white matter would          encounter disorganized myelin debris containing          inhibitors In combination with disruption of the          permissive substrates upon which axons normally grow          disrupted white matter could become a nonpermissive          environment due to exposure of inhibitors Although          factors other than myelinassociated inhibitors likely          play a role in preventing axonal regeneration   these          data suggest that disrupted geometry may contribute to          the nonpermissive properties of the injured tissue                          Peripheral nervous system regeneration          Neurites also extended on uncrushed segments of          sciatic nerve In fact consistent with previous reports             neuronal attachment and neurite density were          greater on sciatic nerve sections than on CNS white          matter The parallel orientation of neurite growth on          peripheral nerve has been reported     but          little mention has been made of this phenomenon Such          growth might be due to nonpermissive factors aligned in          parallel with the nerve that constrain neurites to this          orientation In fact neurite inhibitors such as MAG            and CSPGs   are normally distributed in parallel          within nerves It is possible that disrupting the          geometry of these inhibitors creates an obstacle to          growing neurites On the other hand strong          neuritepromoters such as laminin are also present in          peripheral nerves In fact laminin has been shown to          override the inhibition of neurite growth caused by MAG            Therefore it is possible that the combination of          inhibitory and stimulatory factors ultimately determines          the permissiveness of the substrate One of the          limitations of the in vitro approach used here is that          alterations in the proportion of such factors might not          reflect the actual conditions obtained in vivo Other          changes in the tissue such as haptotactic changes or          lipid blebbing could conceivably contribute to the          nonpermissive substrate properties obtained after crush          injury and tissue section culture          Whatever changes are ultimately responsible neurites          extending on uncrushed portions of sciatic nerve like          those on spinal cord white matter abruptly terminated          upon reaching crushed portions of the tissue Moreover          both neuronal attachment and neurite density on crushed          sciatic nerve were significantly reduced compared with          uncrushed nerve The reduced neurite density cannot be          attributed solely to reduced neuronal attachment Direct          comparisons of neurite growth on crushed and uncrushed          sciatic nerve were made independently of differences in          neuronal density Consistent with the hypothesis that          crushed sciatic nerve is less permissive for neurite          growth neurites were significantly shorter on crushed          sciatic nerve than on uncrushed sciatic nerve Neurites          extending on crushed nerve were also significantly less          parallel          That crushed sciatic nerve is relatively          nonpermissive to growing neurites may seem surprising          since axonal regeneration normally occurs in peripheral          nerves However regenerating axons do not encounter          regions of acute injury in vivo During the lag between          injury and robust growth extensive changes occur within          the injury site including clearance of degeneration          debris In fact these data are consistent with studies          of mutant Ola mice in which Wallerian degeneration is          delayed and peripheral nerve regeneration is impaired             Axonal regeneration although normally          successful in peripheral nerves may be nevertheless          dependent on degeneration of the distal nerve segment and          subsequent reconstruction of the normal tissue          geometry                            Conclusions        These results support a surprising hypothesis Both        white matter and peripheral nerves may contain inhibitory        factors whose normal role is to constrain axons to a        parallel orientation by preventing collateral sprouting In        both situations disruption of tissue geometry would result        in a substrate that is less navigable by growing axons        However whereas in peripheral nerves the appropriate        geometry is reconstructed in white matter such        reconstruction apparently fails or does not succeed in        sufficient time to permit regeneration In addition glial        scarring has long been suspected to contribute to the        nonpermissive environment encountered by regenerating        axons in the CNS        What may then distinguish white matter and peripheral        nerves with regard to regenerative potential is the rate of        degeneration andor reconstruction of the peritraumatic        region and distal stump Wallerian degeneration normally        occurs much faster in peripheral nerves than in white        matter     Although myelin clearance within the        peritraumatic region of central fiber tracts begins soon        after injury this clearance proceeds slowly Myelin debris        have been reported within peritraumatic regions of white        matter as late as  to  days following injury           Even if myelin debris are ultimately cleared from the        peritraumatic region this may not be sufficient to permit        axonal regeneration Although neurons appear to possess the        intrinsic capacity to regenerate their axons this capacity        may not be retained indefinitely following injury In the        mutant Ola mouse Wallerian degeneration is significantly        delayed following injury to peripheral nerves but        nevertheless occurs However nerve regeneration in these        mutants never reaches the capacity observed in injured        nerves of wildtype mice   If a similar        timeconstraint exists in white matter then degeneration of        the distal stump must occur sufficiently within a critical        time period to allow regeneration The slow rate of        Wallerian degeneration and reduced restoration of white        matter geometry following injury compared with that in        peripheral nerves may be a key reason why axonal        regeneration in the CNS is impaired                    Materials and Methods                  Preparation of substrata          SpragueDawley Rats maintained in the University of          Cincinnati

thick          horizontal sections of spinal cord or sciatic nerve          through the crush injury were subsequently prepared using          a cryostat and thawmounted onto uncoated  mm plastic          culture dishes Fisher Scientific Cincinnati OH          Substrata were kept at C until plating  hours          later                          Tissue culture          Lumbar sympathetic chain ganglia were dissected from          embryonic day  Leghorn chicken embryos Spafas Inc          Boston MA in Hams F medium Sigma St Louis MO          The chain ganglia were incubated with  trypsin          Sigma for  minutes at C Trypsinization was          subsequently blocked by exposure to  heatinactivated          fetal bovine serum Harlan Bioproducts for Science          Indianapolis IN for  minutes and washed  times with          Hams F medium The tissue was then dissociated by          gentle trituration using flamed Pasteur pipets Fisher          Cat No A and the cell suspension was seeded          onto the prepared tissue sections All cultures were          grown in serumfree Neurobasal medium  ml per dish          supplemented with B Gibco BRL Grand Island NY           vv  mM Lglutamine Sigma and  unitsml          penicillinstreptomycin Gibco Cat No  in a          humidified environment at C and  to  CO                                      Evaluation of neurite growth          After  days in culture all media were removed and          replaced with Hams F medium Neurons and neurite          growth were labelled by incubating each dish with           ngml of carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl          ester vital dye Molecular Probes Eugene OR for  to           minutes at C Subsequently all media were removed          and replaced with fresh Hams F medium The cultures          were then visualized using a Nikon Diaphot fluorescent          microscope with a fluorescein filter and a x or x          objective Substrate histology was visualized using          phasecontrast optics Photomicrographs were captured          with a Nikon  mm camera In other cases digital images          were captured to a Power Macintosh microcomputer with a          Data Translation framegrabber card and electronically          enhanced to increase contrast                          Quantification of the spatial distribution          density of neurons and neurites          The relative distribution of neurons and neurites over          a longitudinal distance spanning the crushed and          uncrushed portions in sciatic nerve sections was assessed          using a customized macro program written for NIH Image           software The orientations of the longitudinal axes          and the spatial extent of the crushed portions of the          sciatic nerve sections used as substrata were assessed          using phasecontrast digital images showing the anatomy          of the section but not the neurons and neurites within          the field Each field consisted of the adjacent uncrushed          segments of nerve on either side of a crushed segment          which could be identified by its greater optical density          eg Fig BF The orientation of the fiber tract was          measured by drawing a line parallel to its edges and          measuring the angle of this line using NIH Image           software A rectangular contour was then drawn selecting          the uncrushed segment of the nerve section to the left of          the crushed segment using the NIH Image rectangle tool          This contour was drawn to fit within the limits of the          tissue section while selecting a maximum area of the          section to the left of the crush The right edge of the          rectangle was drawn to coincide with the left edge of the          crush The procedure was then repeated for the uncrushed          segment of nerve section to the right of the crush in          this case the left edge of the drawn rectangle coincided          with the right edge of the crush The traced          longitudinal axis as well as both rectangular regions          drawn over the uncrushed segments were recorded by the          macro program          A fluorescence image of the same field showing only          neurons and neurites labelled with vital dye was then          opened and automatically rotated using a macro function          so that the longitudinal axis of the nerve was          horizontal The image was then thresholded to optimize          the signal the neurites and neuronstonoise ratio A          macro function then automatically measured the average          gray value at each position along the longitudinal axis          of the nerve including the crush This value is          proportional to the number of fluorescentlylabelled          neurons and neurites at each position The procedure was          then repeated after adjusting the threshold so that only          the neuronal cell bodies were shown          The following data were then computed automatically by          the macro The average gray values for both total          fluorescence cell bodies  neurites and cell bodies          only were computed for each  pixelwide bin along the          longitudinal axis The macro automatically assessed the          position of the crush given the rectangular boxes drawn          by the observer and onedimensional longitudinal          coordinates for each of the bins were assigned Each edge          of the crush was defined as an origin x   Spatial          locations within the crush were defined using          negativevalued coordinates and spatial locations on          uncrushed segments were defined using positivevalued          coordinates The magnitude of the coordinates defined the          distance in pixels into the crush or away from the          crush respectively The macro also reported the maximum          average gray value over all positions within each field          for both the total fluorescence cell bodies  neurites          and cell bodies without neurites          The final data were generated using Statview           Abacus Concepts A measure of neurites excluding cell          bodies was computed for each bin by subtracting the cell          bodiesonly values from the total fluorescence values          The final measures of neurite and neuron density were          normalized by dividing by their respective maximums in          each field providing for each bin a percentage of the          maximum number of neurites or neurons found in the field          For example if in a given optical field on a given          tissue section the maximum fluorescence value was found          to be at a position  m distal to the border of the          crushed tissue then all fluorescence values measured          within this field were divided by the fluorescence value          measured at the  m position This was intended to          control for variability in plating density from culture          to culture and section to section The spatial          coordinates for each bin were converted to micrometers          using a standard All statistical comparisons were made          using onetailed unpaired Students ttests                          Quantification of neurite length and          orientation          The orientations of the longitudinal axes and the          spatial extent of the crushed regions were assessed using          phase contrast optics The orientation of the fiber tract          was measured by drawing a line parallel to its edges and          measuring the angle of this line using NIH Image           software A contour was then traced around the perimeter          of the crushed region as assessed by its increased          optical density using the polygon tool provided by NIH          Image Both the orientation of the longitudinal axis and          the spatial extent of the crush were recorded by a          customized NIH Image macro          This image was then closed and replaced by an image of          the same field showing the neurons and their neurites but          not the anatomy of the section Neurite length and          orientation were then assessed A neuron was included for          analysis if its neurite did not form fascicles with other          neurites and if it was possible to visually follow the          entire length of the neurite Neurite length was assessed          by tracing the neurite using the straightline tool in          NIH Image The net length ie the straightline          distance between the cell body and growth cone was          measured in pixels and then converted to micrometers          using a known standard From vector arithmetic we know          that this distance is the weighted by segment length          average of the orientations of each of the segments along          the total length of the neurite The macro program          automatically determined whether the neuronal cell body          was located within the polygondelimited spatial extent          of the crush and classified each neuron as being attached          to either the crushed portion of the section or an          uncrushed portion Neurite orientation was recorded by          the macro by measuring the angle of the line traced over          the neuriteThe final measure of orientation for each          neurite the deviation from an orientation parallel to          the longitudinal axis of the tract is the acute angle          between the neurite and the longitudinal axis of the          tract without regard to the polarity of either This          value ranged from  to  where  indicated a neurite          growing in parallel with the longitudinal axis of the          underlying tract and  indicated a neurite oriented          perpendicular to the tract All statistical comparisons          were made using onetailed unpaired Students          ttests                          GFAP immunohistochemistry          Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein GFAP was labelled in          the same spinal cord sections on which neurons had been          cultured The sections were incubated with a          Cyconjugated monoclonal antibody raised against porcine          GFAP Sigma Product No C diluted in Hams F

fluorescent microscope with a rhodamine          filter and a x or x objective Photomicrographs were          captured with a Nikon  mm camera                          CSPG immunohistochemistry
