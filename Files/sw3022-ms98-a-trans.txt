                  um i i personally have a lot of feelings about the way our judicial system is run but um yeah   really   i do not know i just uh  i i do not know i have you ever been for called for jury duty   no i havent have you   no i havent  and oh is that you   i am still here   oh okay uh  a friend of mine was just called before and uh its amazing the that they have to go through about four hundred people to get a a jury for this  one case   good grief   because um there was everybody seemed to have some sort of bias you know uh very hard to find um you know extremely um um yeah impartial people but anyway i think it would be interesting but um   yeah impartial   how do you what do you think about the way its run   well well the you know on the suggested topic was to talk about whether uh verdicts had to be unanimous decisions     right   and i thought that was that really got me to thinking you know and i think we really need them to be unanimous   umhum   because id hate to think that that you know if if i was charged with something that i was not guilty of that i got convicted on a you know seven to five verdict   yeah  thats true thats a good point um arent they supposed to be unanimous though now isnt that the way it is okay   you know yeah they are i think they need to stay that way   yes i agree i do although i do not know i think the judge should be involved i really at this point i am not sure how it works but lets say that a jury decides somebody is guilty   yeah   and the judge disagrees it its not the judges final decision right its the jurys   right its absolutely up to the jury   see and and my feeling is this judge knows a whole i do not know i mean thats his job you know that and it seems like all he is is a mediator mediator of the whole thing   i know it but then if if you give him too much power you know that who knows i mean we got crooked cops   well thats true yep youre right theres crooked everybody     i know it   its really scary because you know you see i do not know if you ever watch saw the movie Presumed Innocent did you see that oh my God its fabulous if you ever can rent it or something   so no i didnt is it ive been trying to and its never there yes   really its just great and it its scary because its just about that there are crooked cops and the whole case points to this one guy and you know he is innocent and um   that that kind of stuff ought to scar us to death i mean   yeah it does and then you watch this guy go to jail for um i should not be telling you because you are going to want to see it   well i knot that he goes it it for the murder right   yeah and he goes to jail um   i just   and oh its really scary   that would be awful   yeah but but then i also see um oh i do not know this one case here in Rochester where um we had a serial killer and they finally caught him and it  here he the guy had basically admitted to killing twelve girls yeah unbelievable and um   good grief   yet it was it was almost a type of thing where he almost wasnt guilty because they had this little flaw one piece of evidence   thats thats what bothers me the technicalities and thats where i think the judge maybe ought to have more say you know   uh  ah yeah right i agree   because i cant believe that that we can let the people off that we are letting off because you did not tell them this one statement before you took them to jail you know  like   umhum right oh right or the whole the Marion Berry thing you know the the governor uh how they determined that he was um oh i do not know it was set up or something   yeah its just   i mean  this guy is dealing drugs its not set up he was just doing it yeah you know   im sorry he was doing it entrapment im sorry you know   uhhuh i would love to be on a jury because i i do think its fascinating i i i think it its its hard system i mean you are never going to get a right and a wrong you know its just   theres no blacks and whites its shades of gray   that thats right yep   and i think i am like you i think it would be really fascinating i do not think i would want to be on a highly publicized case though i do not think i would like that  at all   me either because it is tense for the jurors that were on this serial killing uh they couldnt read the newspaper they couldnt watch TV they couldnt talk about it and this went on for like six months   im sure well you know they had uh a big drug trial in Roanoke Virginia a couple of years ago and my my husband was called for jury duty on that and he said that they had guards armed   umhum huh really   you know guards posted everywhere and he was really glad that he wasnt called because he said that this would have been too much   wow yeah   so i wouldnt like that at all   oh my goodness i like Judge Wapner type of thing   yeah a real simple uncomplicated thing you know      right like uh my dog bit the neighbor or something   we could start out small and work our way up   yeah exactly   so   but its just its scary because um there theres just so much that can go wrong that could let an innocent person be convicted or a guilty person have them let go   absolutely that the nuances   and yeah and um i do not know i guess its it i do not know a lot about the terms but a hung jury is that when the its not completely unanimous   that yeah you know it would be split one way or another and and that ends in a mistrial   oh so what happens nothing   so they have to retry them they have to bring in a whole new jury they have to absolutely start over again   oh oh my God   so and i do not know how many times you can have a hung jury i do not know if they the i dont guess they have to go back to   umhum     trial i guess you know they could drop the charges if they didnt think theyd ever convict him   umhum did you see Sixty Minutes by any chance on um i guess it was this past Sunday night they showed a guy who um hes a lawyer and what hes like known for now is getting men um   no i didnt uhhum   off of charges of killing their wives or their exwives yeah isnt that lovely so theres this guy um i forget what his name is and he is a lawyer someplace and hes gotten so far about four or five   oh thats nice   men um free of the charge one guy went in stabbed his exwife to death because she was sleeping with another guy i mean exwife you know were talking and   oh my gosh yeah well   and um he got them off on the basis that he went temporarily insane   yeah ill bet he did   right temporally insane that she provoked this in him because he was so madly in love with her that seeing you know this other man with her just drove him crazy   oh and it was her fault that he killed her   yeah exactly it was her fault her uh they interviewed her parents it was crazy so now he has to serve like six months in a rehab center and   sure and get psychiatric treatment   exactly
