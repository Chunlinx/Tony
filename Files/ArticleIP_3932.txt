Bill and Hillary is harmful to the child Its notnecessarily the public disclosure of the adultery it is the fact of theadultery itself            Hey Seth adultery isgenerally a good sign that all is not well in the homestead ergo the fact ofadultery tells us the family is suffering Therefore the child is probablysuffering yes even one  miles away at Stanford            Yourvaluefree ramblings

Innocent Romance which isanother blow struck for sanity in this war against Starrs sinister attempt tomanipulate our emotions These are potentially dangerous times This countryneeds all the sanity it

noticed the use of theterm bonk to refer to the act of sexual intercourse especially in referenceto the president I am impressed by                   Slate               s attempt to use hiplanguage but Im afraid someone has been lax in his cataloging of the latestterminology As a college student familiar with all the latest urban lingo Ibelieve the proper term to be used in these contexts is boink Not only doesthe word itself sound more fluid but I also think the connotation it has ismore appropriate to the meaning                   Slate                intends

back fond memories of The Report of thePresidential Commission on Pornography  a peculiar publication that is nowlikely to be emulated            Back during the Nixonadministration Supreme Court decisions permitted some obscene materials tobe distributed only if they were combined with other matters that hadredeeming social value The publication of a government document calledThe Report of the Presidential Commission on Pornography  or somethinglike that presented an opportunity to sell the smut under an appropriatecover The illustrated edition included the full government report and gardenvariety beaver shots etc It came out around  I believe and I may nothave the precisely correct title            I recall that its technicalquality was poor with a mimeographed text and low quality photographicreproductions as well which didnt match the text very closely With moderntechnology so much more can be done The video of the presidents testimonywill also lend itself to interstitial illustration            Sadly mycopy of the illustrated edition was lost in a college dorm long ago and faraway Perhaps one could be found at the Library of Congress

that people will tend to slant their views and responsesto questions so as to better agree with what they perceive to be the majorityopinion The perpetual quoting of Clintons high job approval ratings helpsensure that his job approval remains high This phenomenon could unravel in asimilar way to that described in the article As the polls drop a little thepressure to agree with the majority decreases and the numbers have thepotential to drop precipitously It would be difficult to determine which ofthese phenomena is at work without careful study ie without doing more thanjust watching the polls and guessing             MikeHarkavy Richmond Calif                           Government Gaming                        I think Steve Chapmansarticle ViceIs Nice misses the point Legal gambling is a good idea sincepeople will gamble in any case The state should regulate gambling as itregulates other businesses seeing that the odds are posted that the gamesarent rigged and that the promised jackpots are paidand then leaving thosewho want to do so free to waste their money gambling if they please Butlegal gambling is not what we have            What we have isstatesponsored gambling The government either runs the games as inlotteries or sponsors them and takes a large cut of the take as in casinogambling By running the games the state endorses the dubious value ofsomething for nothing Worse still it deceives the people Instead ofemphasizing the truth of the businessthe long long oddsit emphasizes theunrealistic chance of winning big The ads for every state lottery prove thatpoint The state treats people not as citizens it serves and protects but assuckers it will swindle            If the states were not thepartners of the gambling interests they would apply the same consumerprotection standards to legal gambling that they do to other businesses As itis they connive in the deception of the public because they share thetake            I wouldlike to know if Chapman would favor privatizing gambling so that anyonewho put up proof of the ability to pay off the pot could run a lottery casinoor whatever That would take the government out of the gambling businessboth ways And I am sure that in that case the government would makesure not only that the games are honest but also that the people knew how longthe odds are             Brian AbelRagen St Louis                           SteveChapman replies                                       I dontdisagree with Mr Ragen on the wisdom of getting the government out of thelottery business repealing special gambling taxes and leaving the wholebusiness to the free market But I would not let the best be the enemy of thegood I think statesponsored gambling is preferable to none at alljust asstateowned liquor stores are a lot better than Prohibition                                       TheTravelers New Clothes                        Anne Hollanderwho wroteTravelWithout Clothesmight be interested to know that traditional Japaneseinns today provide clothes to travelers All patrons are offered light cottonrobes which can be worn around the hotel and in the surrounding neighborhoodHeavier robes are provided in winter Traditionally the wearer would wear hisown traveling clothes to the inn The clothes would be given over to becleaned and the traveler would use the inns clothes during his stay When thetraveler left he would again wear his own traveling clothes which have beencleaned In this way people could make weekslong journeys on muddy footpathswith just one set of clothes which would be washed regularly            I doubtthat hotels are interested in having customers walk off with their clothes asHollander suggests However its conceivable that hotels could provide thecustomer with a set of clothes while hes staying at the hotel For example abusiness traveler could arrive at the hotel wearing a suit The hotel wouldprovide casual clothes and also underwear socks dress shirts undershirtsties etc The business traveler would wear his own suit to business eventsperhaps paired with the hotels shirts socks and ties At the end of thetrip the traveler would receive his own clothes back now laundered for thetrip home or to the next destination Admittedly providing womens clotheswhich are more complex presents a slightly greater challenge But this methodwould make it possible to travel indefinitely carrying nothing more than apaperback and a credit card The hotel which is assured of getting its ownclothes back can offer more than just jeans and Tshirts from the GapWouldnt it be nice to have a closet full of Armani to go with youranight hotel room             NathanLewis Tokyo                           A PubicMistake
