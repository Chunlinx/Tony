                well how would you rate it   uh well im kind of in the middle i lived in the Ozarks for a long time where a lot of people do a lot of hunting and uh   umhum   now i live in Dallas where theres a lot of crime and im all for uh the average Joe being able to have a gun but then again im not you know as far as this seven day law and all this stuff for two weeks or whatever im all for that too i dont think anybody needs to be able to go buy a gun right away   yeah   if you want a gun for a legitimate purpose you should be willing to wait long enough for someone to verify that youre not a   yeah thats true yeah that thats true im im kind of like you you know i dont im kind of in between but i id rather not rate it at all because i think its very site specific   a potential criminal yeah and i i dont think you know i think its one of the constitutional rights that is important and you know we we should be allowed to have guns   yeah   i dont think they should turn around and say you know the government says you cant have a gun because that just i dont know   right it doesnt make sense if if you can govern yourself   any any any country where theyve ever revolted you know it takes guns to revolt and sure we dont need to but uh never know there might come a time so   yeah well i think you know its like youre saying is you know were in in places in communities where hunting is common yeah you cant ban guns there its not its kind of impossible its a way of life for people but uh in in cities i think there there may be a possibility for certain law restricting firearms in certain areas maybe not the ownership of such but its restricting the you know the the uh presence of of hand guns in certain areas   well they do that now i mean youre not supposed to have a hand guns well maybe youre allowed to have them say in the city but youre not allowed to use them in the city limits and things   no thats what im saying like not have one in the city like you can have one but you cant have one in your apartment if its you know cause youre in the city like you may have it at a summer home or somewhere else yeah just because you live in the city doesnt mean you cant have it but you just cant have it in the city   well what does that do to people that uh use it for protection like you know i personally i dont have a gun but i wouldnt mind having one i live in a neighborhood where the crime rate is going up somebody breaks in my house i wouldnt mind having a gun you know in selfdefense but uh   well yeah well you know i see i dont know the statistics for that for you know how if if by having a gun how much that really helps so i dont really know thats why i think that maybe if not maybe not just having one will be better thats thats why i i wouldnt know because im not from the city so i dont i dont see the very high crime rate   you on the other hand may have a different opinion   yeah yeah well ive never had it had to have one in the city you know when i was in the country we used them and out there was a necessity i mean you dont kill a copperhead with a rock   right right   you shoot them   exactly as you know as im im from uh you know rural   yeah   so i i go hunting a lot   i think there need to be stronger gun control laws that can be that can uh that uh what am i trying to say in in cities in urban areas   uhhuh   but uh i dont think guns should be banned i just think it should be harder for for a criminal to get hold of them and of course the black market anyone can get one if they want one   no yeah the bad things is that you know when you try to make it harder for criminals to get them how do you know if youre selling to a criminal or not   well that i guess thats the whole point of some of this legislation theyre theyre trying to make   yeah yeah i mean you cant you cant ever really determine that i mean you can sell it to a straight person and and then he becomes a truant yeah yeah thats like shit   he turns around and yeah turns passes it on yeah theres no perfect answer but i guess im im more for im more for no im actually more for less control because i think its its a right that that i would hate to see us lose   more for some kind of control huh yeah well i dont want to see it   and the more the more you give gun control the little bit the little bit of time before long you dont have anything i mean im sure when they started out with taxes they didnt plan on taking thirty percent of your income but uh   but it sounds good to them   they just start with a little bit you know   yeah well i think you know maybe some kind of condition some kind i think they should ban uh automatic weapons for you know only only and restrict them to uh gun clubs only i dont know if theyve theyve completed that action or not   yeah i dont know what the deal is on that i know you cant buy them any more you cant cant buy imported ones anyway   right and well uh i mean that doesnt really matter imported or or you know domestic machine guns they still do the same damage   or is it the other way around right right   i dont see i dont see what the difference is myself you know getting shot by   i dont see any reason for anybody to have one unless theyre fighting a war you know   i mean in a gun club or something you know in a gun club or or have the wrong reason in mind those two are the   right right   thats why i think that maybe you know you if you say you cant have an automatic weapon thats thats also saying that you cant have a gun so if you say you can have it but you have to be a member of gun club that that restricts it even further doesnt doesnt take away your right it just puts a restriction on your right   right   but i dont you know i think i think restrictions are going to be needed but no no bans or anything like that its kind of hard though because in different regions different regions like you were saying is uh is different like there where youre at you wouldnt mind having a gun so you youre really   yeah i wouldnt need an Uzi though   you know yeah   or a UB forty i mean a a pistol would be fine its more for a scare tactic than anything else   right   i dont really want to shoot somebody but i guess if uh it was me or him i would have to yeah   its a good deterrent   course youve got people that are pulling them out on the highways down here its like you cut them off and boom blow you away       so you have to draw the line i guess   yeah   i dont know so if were supposed to pick a number id guess id pick oh what no gun control was was ten   well total ban is one and uh no ban at all is ten   i guess id have to pick about an eight something down there toward the low end   yeah i think i think well around seven or eight restricting certain kinds and and leaving others out with restrictions but i dont know what that you know like you were saying the uh the seven day restriction or seven day wait period or something like that   well supposedly in seven days theyre going theyre going to look through y our background and make sure you are not an excon or dont have   what does that mean that that really doesnt you know its just because it gives them time to look you up doesnt mean i mean it it it may be well intended but i dont know how effective it is   yeah i dont either it might stop some people but some people with a history of something but uh you know i guess theres a lot of information out there on everybody whether we we believe it or not they know everything youve done for the last ever since you got a social security number really   yeah thats true   so uh i guess theyve got some time to make sure you havent been in prison or dont have a history of you know i dont know   so then its its uh up to the the individual dealer   i dont know i really dont know what the the actual on how how they work that out i imagine with the the way everything is computerized now it wont take much you know a perspective buyer comes in and they throw in your social security number on some nationally network system and it based on whatever criteria its got it says yes or no this guy can get a gun or he cant and whoever decides those criterias you know thats something the legislatures do   yeah but what does does the uh does the retailer have the opportunity to you know disregard that information that he receives   i really dont know i dont know what the you know what the status of those laws are   because you know if if its if its not against the law for the retailer to disregard that information that kind of defeats the whole purpose of the seven day wait period   yeah       i would think if theyre going to make a law it would have to be something uh   national   itd be a crime to uh not enforce it   right   and   oh well man i guess thats about five minutes   all right uh   all right nice talking to you Ralph Ralph bye   take care yeah bye
