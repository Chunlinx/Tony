DearPrudence                                                      The twit who inquired about dissing the offspring of the discarded relatives needsperhaps something more along the lines of a swift kick in the rear If theseare older children as is suggested by requests for letters of recommendationand invites to graduations then these are more or less formed people whodeserve to be accepted or rejected on their own meritsnot for any slighttheir parents may or may not have committed Anything less is the moralequivalent of presentday Jews not buying a new VW Beetle because its made bya German company a sort of inherited grudge if not racism                                       In England theythink people are important or not based on their birth This is America andwe hold that people

        Dear Mike            Though Prudie doubts theestranged relative will be swayed by your opinion Prudie agrees with you andhopes that your thoughts might make a difference in someone elsesthinking            Prudie agreeably                                             DearPrudie                                                      We have closefriends who have us to their home for dinner almost every week The wifedoesnt want to go out or come to our house When were there however shespends a large part of the evening on the phone or on the computer Her husbandsays she actually spends less time on either because were there Should we behonored or insulted                                       Insulted and Ignored                        Dear Ig            I dont know what her problem is but I bet itshard to pronounce The mistake that is commonly made about neurotics is tosuppose that they are interesting It is not interesting to be engrossed withoneself and socially idiosyncratic Or rude            It sounds to Prudie asthough there is a genuine friendship amongst the four of you though given thewifes peculiarities it may be that the man is the primary friend If this hasbeen going on for a long time which is what Prudie infers go along with theprogram without being honored or insulted The womans behavior has little todo with you For whatever reason she is glued to her house and not interestedin social intercourse Prudie hopes by the way that the hospitalityfreehostess is a good cook            Prudie understandingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      As you no doubt know living with roommates isno longer just a college thing Many single adults live with other nonrelatedadults to defray the high cost of city rents I currently share a fourbedroomhouse with three other people Heres the problem Three of us dont like thefourth and are unsure of how to get rid of him                                       Whats wrong with Roommate No  Well thatsdifficult to put a name to He does his chores pays rent on time isnt noisyat night and isnt messy The problem is hes a knowitall with somethingnegative to say about everything What makes the situation difficult is thattheres no obvious reason to ask him to leave and he seems intent on stayingIts to the point where at least two of us bristle when we hear him comethrough the door He is oblivious                                       We arentcomfortable saying We just dont like you Please leave Is there a politeway to tell him This just isnt working out Is that even legal Im theonly original leasesigner still living in the house and we now rentmonthtomonth Hes lived here a little over two years Your assistance isappreciated                                       Sincerely                                       Have a Nice Life Somewhere Else                        Dear Have            Prudie has met people like the roommate youdescribe She calls them The Worlds Greatest Experts because they knoweverything But to answer your question There is nothing legally tricky inyour situation though you might have to give him a months notice Onmonthtomonth tenancies tenant or landlord has to give notice usuallyequivalent to the period of rent payments This may not apply to nonsignatoryroommates but it seems the decent thing            There is nothing wrongwith saying This isnt working well or Sometimes its just time for achange Prudie would say simply because she couldnt resist We dont knowhow to tell you this but the three of us are seeing someone else            Prudie puckishly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Am I obliged toreturn a voice mail that is garbled  where the name of the person and mostof the message is garbled because the caller is slurring but the number isthe only understandable part of the message                                       Slurred Off in Melbourne Australia                        Dear Slur            This all depends on the mood youre in Unclearmessages are annoying and you have every right to ignore them If the numberhowever is clear and youre feeling charitable you might call back and sayThis is Slurred Off I have no idea what you said in your message but I amreturning your call            If the number isfamiliar to you this may help to decide which way youre going to play it Andjust FYI if people think its important to reach you they will keep tryingAnd keep in mind that we are dealing with machinery Slurred messages are notalways signs of Jim Beam or careless callers They may in fact be courtesy offaulty microchips            Prudie clearly                           Dear Prudie                                       In re In Need of Help in Ohio  I think I am half of this othercouple who invited us to be their guests at a minor league baseball game Ithink Ill call and let them

just proves that virtual realityis its own reward            Prudie ecstatically
