                start   what kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett   um the well right now theyve got a kind of a central location off of the main highway and theyve got some great big bins there for newspaper um plastic um i think three bins for glass white green and whatever whatever other combination there is and and i think theyve got a comp uh some kind of container for aluminum     Planos doing real good on that they have uh they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans   uhhuh   which were supposed to put all our weeks garbage into it and of course it doesnt fit right now but now we start in May breaking it down and theyre picking it all up   yeah um   so theyre going to by and we have to separate our papers and our glass and then uh they have one day for like um oh everything you picked up from your yard and we put that in disposable bags and they pick that up on Monday   uhhuh um   so its really great i im really going head you know completely for it i think its marvelous   well thats good well Rowlett had sent sent out a survey not too long ago um in terms in how many people were interested in having a a pick up i guess on the days they do trash or something like that And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably favorably because theyre going to do it i dont know how how soon theyre going to do it or how organized its going to be but theyre theyre supposed to initiate that some sometime in the next couple of months   well does your uh where you work do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that   um ive never noticed that we dont have a a whole lot because were in a hospital setting so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria um   well down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your you know pop cans and things like that   um no theres theres only one pop machine and its not accessible to the cafeteria now so uh mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea     so you dont have much choice there   no  not not really   well i work at uh JC Penny and last week they brought they have a sign up that says for one full week   uhhuh   you bring in your old wire hangers and they are going to recycle them   um   so its getting people clean out their closets and such and then like the week before that they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good bring it in and they brought it down to the shelters   uhhuh   and they have one two they have three i think that i know of for cans for people have pop and they put them right near where they have the time cards and it works great and they have one in the room where the  snack machines are too   umhum yeah thats good   so theyre really going at it and i think its marvelous because   yeah i i guess Rowletts done a lot for the size town it is and i think theyre trying to to make some changes i i noticed at the library or someplace this past uh month month and a half ago they were having a speaker um talk about   well   and i think theyre trying to to make some changes i i noticed at the library or someplace this past uh month month and a half ago they were having a speaker um talk about doing lawn work and how how important it is to to cut your lawn without a bag just kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of all all the the grass thats being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff   uhhuh   and its uh i guess a lot more ecological ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil   well did you watch the program the other night on um was it Save America it was good   i saw part of that   the only thing i guess thought um that i havent been trying is when i you know go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my plants which i had never thought about before   umhum uhhuh   but ive already gone to oh i started years ago i guess not years ago but yeah i would say five years ago turning off my fountain i mean my water faucet in the sink when i brush my teeth   uhhuh   but i didnt realize that was the biggest waste of water that was surprising to me   yeah um   i missed that question totally i mean really bad im trying to think i didnt miss too many i cant remember what my score was but i did exceeding well i was surprised but i didnt realize that our garbage isnt being decomposed that was a shocker to me   yeah well there are a lot of things that arent im thats uh one of the things i wonder about uh one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else i i wonder about some of the products products that they dont take like some of the plastics and things that they dont take uh why why they couldnt do more recycling with those   well i was in uh Bizmart the other day and what i dont understand is there is recycled paper in there and it cost more than regular paper than regular paper   hum   and it was only i think uh forty cents more you know fifty cents more but   yeah   it upseted me to realize that hey the recycling that theyre going through the expense of recycling but people arent buying it so the cost of it is higher   true yeah i noticed that about things like i seen i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and lawn additives and that type of thing but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy so in in terms of that its you know   uhhuh   for the environment it its there is good reason to do it the cost is kind of prohibited   now see thats recycling you know companies that do at least go into it id like to see subsidy by the government or something or taxwise or something heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular   uhhuh   so that people would use this stuff reuse over again   yeah its a good idea   its like when he was saying uh which one was recyclable which was reusable and the recycle ones are better to use but lots of times you dont even see the signs on the bottles   uhhuh yeah true   and if were going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it i had to put my bifocals on to see it   um   thats hard when youre in a grocery store and youre short anyway  you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf you havent got enough nerve to say well put it back its not recyclable   yeah i id heard something stranger talk about bottles the other day on uh on the radio station i think its K L T Y they were talking about the i think its in Canada theyre using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs   uhhuh   as a a reinforcement for roads for road repairs   oh really   and apparently they they dont break down very easily and   oh   they dont expand or or contract when the weather changes and  this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing   well you know theyre along that same line they said they were using um what is oh i know it was toilets smashing the m up because theyre that stuff there is great for in road work   uhhuh huh   and i thought well thats good and then i saw recycling on tires between uh well hoses were being used   uhhuh   and uh uh soaker hoses made out of old tires what else something else was made out of old tires i was trying to remember what it was   yeah   oh i cant think of it now but i was i was trying to get my uh kids you know to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes   uhhuh   and just anything to you know recycle rather than keep throwing it away but my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the store buy the bags to bring them back and then i forget to bring them in the store   yeah   im forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out i wish theyd really push this recycling bit because i never realized i really didnt realize how much stuff i actually throw away   well i think the the more people are aware of it the the more theyll do i think thats just the biggest problem is keeping it in in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that   you know what id like to see a little more i dont have any little tiny kids but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now   uhhuh yeah   in five years when they get bigger itll work a little bit more too   true   because its weve all got to do it right now i just i really amazed to find out that what is it eighty per cent are filled now in in garbage fills in five years were supposed to be at max   uhhuh   i dont think i can keep my own garbage i mean i might not have that much but i would
