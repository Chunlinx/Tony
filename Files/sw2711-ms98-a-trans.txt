wow   to the top the of the peak sure   oh thats tough i dont i dont think i could do that   oh its not bad at all its its a beautiful drive   oh   now i admit up there the altitude is kind of interesting   yeah yeah   you know you get a little lightheaded and giddy but its fun you know take along a picnic lunch and   sure is pretty up there   oh we love it   you have mountains all around you   uh no theyre only to the east uh i mean to the west of us   where you live uhhuh   here in the Springs you know its right there at the very foot of the Rockies you know and once a week we drive up into the mountains usually you know usually once a week once every other week   wow thats neat im jealous  theres hills in Texas   yeah well i enjoy hills in Texas too ive been in Sherman   have you ever been out of the United States for uh vacation   no i havent you   or business   uh once to Mexico City but just a little day thing on business   uh uhhuh i went to uh the Bahamas last year on a cruise for my honeymoon   uh thats nice   it was really neat i had never been out of really out of Texas or Indiana much out of the United States im from Indiana so   did you enjoy it   what   did you enjoy it   yeah it was great   uhhuh   it was really pretty down there   uh uh got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture and   uhhuh yeah really did there in fact one uh family that sat at our table every meal was from London and they had never been to the United States so they were really enjoying it and they were telling us about all their trips   oh huh   they had been to Disneyland and it was neat to meet different people   so the place that i went that weve gone on vacation that i think i enjoyed the most   uhhuh   was Seattle   oh really ive heard its really pretty up there   well we uh was two years ago   uhhuh   we went during the drought im sorry three years ago it had been dry for a whole week   oh oh wow   it didnt rain for a whole week   yeah  that would have been nice that would have been best time to go   yeah somehow we picked the right time and uh walked down on the wharf and i think we ate seafood every meal for well not quite every meal but most meals for a week   uhhuh   uh it was wonderful uh the Pacific Science Museum the little girl really enjoyed its very interesting   Pacific Sites   yeah   really   yes it was it was super and uh went to the Seattle Aquarium   uhhuh   and its right down there on the right there on the ocean and down there on the wharf by the piers and all and you walk down in a dome a glass dome   uhhuh   and the bay is circulating over your head and you   oh wow   you can watch the fish swim by and sharks oh its   oh neat   yeah and then theres walrus and sea lion and porpoises and oh its its amazing     thats the vacation you recommend huh   oh absolutely   yeah   without a doubt Seattle is beautiful and the mountains the mountains to the east of Seattle   yeah ive heard it is uhhuh   are just incredible   really   i rode a ferry for the first time in my life   oh wow   you know up there you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry   uhhuh   instead of by bridge and you drive your car on you park your car you set your brake you walk upstairs and you have a beer   oh   or coffee or whatever depending on the time of day   uhhuh   its amazing   and your car is on a ferry and it goes across with you   yes yes   thats really neat   yeah yeah and there are people literally that everyday take the ferry you know and drive on to it yeah   to work   live on an island off off shore from Seattle   huh thats really wild   and you uh everyday they drive on the ferry they go upstairs and have their morning coffee   huh   take for the twenty to hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and you know depending on where it is   hour and ten minutes   well in some places you know in some areas you know depends on how far they are commuting   yeah thats really interesting   oh it its strict im im a West Texan   uhhuh   out there in the land of no water   yeah   and and to think that people live on the water daily is kind of odd to me you know its its a different life style than we are used to   yeah it is ive been wanting to go to the West Texas and see different parts of Texas because i havent lived here very long and i havent really seen much so what are some good things in Texas to go visit   oh Galveston   Galveston   yes i liked Galveston real well uh theres uh one of the areas down there close to Galveston is i forget the name of the island but its a bird sanctuary   uhhuh   with all kinds of wild birds whooping and sand hill cranes and ducks and pelicans and its very pretty uh i like the Rio Grande Valley   uhhuh   real well of course you havent lived until you have been to San Antone to the uh to the Alamo   yeah Boardwalk and all that   yeah the river walk oh its   yeah   and you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there oh its just simply beautiful   ive heard its really pretty   and of course always when i lived in West Texas had to annually go down to San Antone just   really   yeah and go to uh Lone Star and uh you know make my annual pilgrimage to the Lone Star Brewery and   yeah     uh uh El Paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way you know go across the border and all uh the Davis Mountains are interesting   uhhuh   out there in West Texas   down by Big Bend whats that   yeah yeah uh now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter   okay   because theres a beauty to the desert that it can most be it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up   yeah   you know whenever youve been kind of cold where you are at its most enjoyable to get you know to get warm   um uhhuh   thats nice uh down there in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf thats interesting i love the Texas Hill Country   yeah   and uh and uh Austin is neat for for an occasional visit   ive heard to go to Austin too a lot people say to go down there   yeah yeah its a fun few days uh   whats there to see in Austin   oh UT is real pretty   uhhuh   uh theres a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area Marble Falls and all thats real pretty uh i would say definitely go see that part and uh id say go to uh Midland once just for the heck of it       i dont know why exactly       but uh you know find out when they are holding the petroleum fair uh
