        here we go   okay um now were supposed to talk about social activities right   well the changes thats occurred like it how was it maybe ten twenty thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today   uhhuh   how were living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period from ten twenty or whatever you remember it to be   i think um well i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation i think your generation is um what do i say uh uh theyre theyre theyre polite they have more respect for other people just in in general i think and just just towards people and property and um i i guess they would would be more conservative some of them i guess   yeah we are uh somewhat conservative but as far as the uh socially our crime rate has increased and although its more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like   uhhuh   violent crime is on the increase from what ive seen and um our prison population has significantly increased i would say um our economy too is really its just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what ive read and   uhhuh   uh even the well it started spiraling down i suppose in the seventies and uh our recovery uh economically has not been like it used to be to me also our nuclear family is is not the same because more people are living together that arent married uh   uhhuh uhhuh   i dont i dont know if uh cant make any judgments of that nature but uh i dont really want to either  because i have no problems about it either way     uhhuh   and um kids are i i suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to   yes i agree with   women are more on the rise too so far as getting their careers established and uh they dont no longer feel dependent upon men   uhhuh well well do you think that that maybe i mean uh ive heard different you know like um like i know my mom and like other ladies they complain because they think that um the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really dont have time for their kids   thats probably true i mean they they are a lot of them that have to put their kids into day care or having more with baby sitters and especially if they dont have boy friends or husbands and uh i guess thats why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected   uhhuh yeah   uh in fact uh there was one lady in this area she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day   oh my gosh just a baby   not a baby uh she was old enough to uh i would say she was five to eight years old somewhere along that range but thats just an extreme example i would imagine you know the situations are out there   oh my gosh uhhuh yeah   um   well as um well i think the education like our education has um increased dramatically but then i think also that were forgetting like basic things like we should know   i agree there   like i i think well um in the morals and values of like my generation for the most for most people are totally different from the morals and valleys um values of like per se your generation but i think as we get older it gets to your you know what i mean i think the kids now are are i would say louder now until after they reach like twenty five and then i think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things   yeah um i could agree with that because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age   uhhuh yeah because i think were given more now whereas you had to work for everything and kids nowadays are just given so much that they really dont have to work and you know and they they dont have any intent to go working until they have to   uhhuh thats an agreeable topic there       um what else considering beside family economics um our transportation system has changed for us i mean we can it we can now travel around the world in no time its just a hop skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast and um   uhhuh   well i i think whats happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and theres so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day   uhhuh   and to keep abreast of the knowledge out there we got to constantly read go to school uh TV watching has sure hasnt gone too much out the door because TV is still well the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular TV programming and watch a lot of other a variety of programs out there as well as use of the VCR   uhhuh   so that i dont know if it really hampers or it helps our education system   i dont know because i know i dont watch while im up here at school i dont watch hardly any TV like Thursday night i like to sit down and watch a few shows but other than that   do you watch LA Law   no i dont watch that  i used to but i dont any more   i like that   but all i mean there are even though theres a few up here we call them couch potatoes they love to sit in front of the TV i i said but for the for the most part i will i will well i live in an all girls dorm but for the most part were all between the ages of eighteen and like twenty one   uhhuh   and there isnt really a lot of TV watching   well thats good at least youre hitting the books right   yeah well theyre either hitting the books or something else i dont know what but i know oh well i guess they have their crowds like during the soap operas you know like in between classes or something   uhhuh   but i cant say that theres really that many people that like sit in front of the TV all day   well thats a change then oh of course going to school too its different from the home environment   uhhuh but then um like i know this girl shes doing her student teaching or shes just working like within the school and um yesterday she was at the kindergarten and theres this little boy he like didnt want to do anything and he said im not doing this i dont like it and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand and pretend like hes playing Nintendo   um   you know so uh i dont know how i mean i never really watched that a lot of TV when i was younger but my parents really didnt allow us to watch that much TV so i dont know   i agree with your parents         because uh TV kind of ruined me because thats thats all that we had   uhhuh   well not really but i mean its uh for the top medium of entertainment   yeah well we watch a lot of i guess we watched a lot of TV in the winter time but in the summer like right now my mom well like she doesnt let us watch TV until like eight oclock at night you know are like   it was even at your age   well like my younger brothers and sisters at home like when it starts getting nice outside in the summer and everything shell she makes us go outside even now when i go home for the summer she makes us go outside and were allowed to come in and watch TV until its dark because she doesnt like the TV herself   uhhuh uhhuh i see   and if it was up to her we wouldnt have one so you know she feels that kids are too dependent on it also   uhhuh oh is there anything else   um   um   what about in our work ethics   work ethics oh  right now its getting its maybe getting better   i i   um a little of course were were were having to weather through the savings and loans and   uhhuh   all the other scandalous items that well the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties   uhhuh   and uh i think i think its going to have to have its patchwork put on us   um   because we have so much to pay for now its going to be really passed on to your generation and maybe a few others   yeah   including whats left of ours   well i really cant think of anything else   well it was nice talking to you   uhhuh it was nice talking to you too   and uh what are majoring in
