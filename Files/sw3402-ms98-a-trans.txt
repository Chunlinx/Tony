        all right i guess tonights subject is to discuss current events and how we keep up on current events and if were     right   satisfied with with the uh coverage that we receive   thats right   um thinking about it some of the ways i try and keep up on current events is uh i enjoy reading the newspaper but uh quite often dont have time to read all of the newspaper and so uh i enjoy watching some of the TV highlights and also um some of the news periodicals uh weekly magazines and uh at work i also have uh management summary reports that uh give basically a lot of the current events uh how about yourself   well unlike you i dont i dont i like to read the paper but i basically dont do it every day       and i um i usually watch uh either Good Morning America or the Today Show every morning while im you know whatever im doing and i watch that i usually watch the news either at   uhhuh   you know early evening or at ten oclock so i get it from TV a lot i get Time magazine i read Time magazine um thats one i read pretty regularly and uh   right right oh yes okay you think that thats uh pretty adequate coverage and you get   the thing about it you know now that ive found found is that we get such good coverage on TV or at least such i dont know attempted thoroughness of coverage by the time you get the Time Magazine Magazine theres nothing in it you dont know   uhhuh its historic events huh   yeah if if you know then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something because really i thought lately theres nothing new in the Time Magazine   oh okay   you know its its basically youve heard everything   yes   and uh you might you might get a little more thorough uh account of something but really um i dont know i so i get most of mine from television   yes   i would say   um i found out too that uh quite often if i see something on television that i want more in depth uh understanding or or get want to know more about it that the the newspaper or uh i read Newsweek can give you a better and more a thorough coverage of what ive heard on TV but uh um i found out that also on on TV that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on CNN and and like you said the the news shows that are that are happening and you can read some more about it if you want to um i found out though that or i feel that a lot of the stuff on TV and the newspapers is negative theres an awful lot of  negative news or bad news or or bad news and uh itd be refreshing once in a while to hear to hear some good news   right and i i think theres an attempt to do that uh you know i think people theres a mild attempt for that but i think basically we basically associate news with bad news   and uh   yes we do   or or or catastrophes or problems or crises or uh you know i think our concept of news isnt isnt necessarily events that happen its more negative like you said   true true   but i i think people try to on the on TV i think they try to throw in good stuff but it doesnt uh it doesnt sway the vote   umhum ive heard an interesting interesting comment also that uh with budget cuts and uh expenses the way they are that its affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a indepth analysis or uh investigative reporting on certain topics and issues but that takes time that takes a lawful lot of money and commitment and and quite often its a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing and go after it you know its quite easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer   umhum   and uh find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things so i dont know i guess the economy is is effecting also the news media   umhum   and we have to pay that price but um i dont know i dont know its its interesting and i think that now a days with communications the way they are also that we can see global events happening as as they occur all over the world like the   right  you know the war last winter was certainly a good example of that because we saw every single thing practically   exactly we saw yes it you know twenty years ago thirty years ago we wouldnt have been able to have that privilege or or luxury to to view that   i mean you know i remember well just the things that are covered i remember watching the World Series during the earthquake and just seeing that happen i mean you know that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake   so   oh yeah uhhuh   and the and the announcers you know grabbing i mean its like that was just something because that was like live and real     oh yeah yeah   like you said and then of course one thing i think too is with television
