                                 The Crime of Wine            As Internet companies spin into the financialstratosphere Wall Street and the business press speak with awe of therevolutionary implications of the Web Issue after issue of Forbes Fortune  and Business Week detail in awestruck tones thehundreds of millions sometimes even billions  raised by Net companiesA new staple is the interview with the Internet expert call him the IguruThe editors will ask meekly Dr Chopra what industries do you think will beaffected by the Internet To which the Iguru sighs pauses and explainsThe real question Charlie is what industries will not be affectedFrankly I cant think of a single one            Well I canwine The booze business might wellend up being one of the few areas of American life undisturbed by the greatInternet revolution The buying and selling of wine across state borders isstill illegal in  states including New York where I live Its a pitybecause the wine business is perfectly suited to ecommerce No store couldpossibly stock even  percent of the odd wines produced by Americas wineries not to mention the vineyards of France Italy and AustraliaIt would be a godsend if wine buyers could do a Web search for bottles of sayCloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc a hardtofind  worldclass white wine from NewZealand In my minds eye I see myself using a search engine similar to theAdvanced Book Exchangewhich allows readers to track down secondhand books at hundreds of shops acrossNorth America I can just see myself clicking the mouse to comparison shop andthen score a bottle from a San Francisco store four from a Texas shop and from a New York outlet            Id settle for beingable to buy wine from mainstream Internet merchants such as WINESHOP or Winecomwhich used to be Virtual Vineyards Alas only  statesmost of them in theWesthave completely legalized such acts of capitalism between consentingadults The laws regulating direct wine sales were rarely enforced untilrecently but a new zeal is in the air Buying a single bottle of wine fromoutofstate is a thirddegree felony in Kentucky Georgia and Florida and ispunishable with fines of up to  and jail time And Orrin Hatch seniorsenator from the parched state of Utah has introduced a bill that would allowfederal courts to prosecute offenders Indeed Hatch was moved to federalizethis crime precisely because new technologies like the Internet make it easierto buy wine nationally horrors Rep Joe Scarborough RFla introduced asimilar bill in the Housewhich passed by a hefty margin            At the risk of making a oneway trip to Rikers Island Imust take the Fifth about my wine purchases senator I spent a couple ofweeks this summer surfing the Web for vino Some wine stores keep their listsonline but none of New York Citys big operationsSherry Lehamn Zachys andMorrellsdo Many of the Web wine lists I browsed were so outdated that percent of the wine I wanted to order was out of stock One major Californiawine merchant I spoke to said that the Internet isnt having much effect on hisbusiness because people from most big states cant use it to order wines IfInternet wine buying was uniformly decriminalized and there was a genuinenationwide market on the other hand the system would be more creative andefficient            I had better luck ordering from two shops outsideNew York the Corkscrew in Springfield Ill and KL Wine Merchants a widelyknown and wellregarded place of San Francisco as well as Winecom anonlineonly store in Napa The sites are pretty well run but again theysimply dont compare with those selling books CDs clothes and baby waresThe wines were shipped to a friend in Washington state one of the enlightenedplaces where ewines are legal Precisely how I obtained the wines is a matterof dont ask dont tell            I deliberately chosewines that could travel badlydelicate white Bordeaux Champagne PinotGrigioand also some hardertofind wines such as Californian Italian winesSangioveses The wines were received in Seattle within a week of orderingThey were all very well packed in special thermacol wine molds As a resultalmost miraculously most of the wines held up even though they were shipped in degree weather The Champagne BillecartSalmons special KL bottling went slightly off losing fruit and gaining acidity the cheaper whiteBordeaux Pont de Brion Blanc  was a decent steely Sauvignon Blancthat stood up to the trip nicely The more expensive Chateau SmithHautLafite was superb delicate flowery and yet crisp But in an hour or two itbegan fading signs of jet lag The Sangioveses were the most pleasantsurpriseShaffer  and a Virtual Vineyards special bottling  Bothwere delicious with the pointed flavors of Italian Chianti and the ripeness ofCalifornias clime mixed together American Chiantistyle wines are going to bethe next trend in Californian winemaking            Back to the puritans Why do the new prohibitionists opposeInternet wine They claim two concerns First like most new legislation inAmerica it has been passed for the benefit of the children States need toensure that minors are not provided with unfettered access to alcohol Hatchexplained He trots out the usual anecdote masquerading as evidenceayearold boy once ordered beer off the Internet In fact there is littledanger that teenagers are going to order unusual wines from distant winerieswait days for them to arrive arrange to have their parents out of the housewhen they do and then  what Throw a Claret keg party Californias StateBureau of Alcohol has received exactly one complaint of an Internet sale to aminor in recent years            Second its for theConstitution The  st Amendment which repealed prohibition allowsstates to regulate the transportation of intoxicating liquors IndeedHatchs bill is titled The  st Amendment Enforcement Act But theprotections of the  st Amendment are actually quite thin Thelanguage of most state laws would seem to violate the Constitutions interstatecommerce clause which facilitated the creation of a national economy Judgesare increasingly coming to this view At the very least it means that therestrictions do not have the halo of constitutional protection            The  st Amendments intent was to give thestates the power to prosecute the Mafias involvement in the liquor trade Butbecause much of the Mafias interest in booze died with the repeal ofprohibition what keeps these laws alive is politics Liquor regulation is acase study in the manipulation of politics by powerful lobbies The regulationsin force are maintained and strengthened because distributors wholesalers andlarge wineries benefit from them and they are organized and politicallypowerful Over the years their lobbies have been effective at working withlocal cranks to regulate the minutiae of the wine business In  states inAmerica grocery stores cant sell wine In Colorado halfbottles of wine areillegal but in Florida oversized bottles are illegal And so on The singlemost bizarre law which banned giving wine to dogs in Chicago has recentlybeen repealed            Those who lose out are small and upandcomingwineries specialty producers and of course consumers who would have morechoice and lower prices The entire setup has an anticompetitiveantientrepreneurial flavor that rewards political lobbying rather than goodbusiness practices Sen Hatch seems to recognize this when he says If thereis a problem with the system we need to fix the system not break the lawsFor the moment however the fix is in for the consumer
