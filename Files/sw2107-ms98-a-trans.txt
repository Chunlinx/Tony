oldest one quite nine years ive had him probably five years yeah   oh okay  get so attached to them   oh yes i love my cats i lost one one time uh the first one i got he jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment and hed never been outside like you know by himself outside   oh oh no uhhuh   and it started raining and i was hysterical i was i mean you would have thought a child had died i called everyone i knew i had every friend i knew in the apartment searching for this cat and they laughed at me they thought that was so hysterical   yeah umhum yes i understand oh no i understand we have uh weve gone through the same thing with ours weve cut you know theyve been ill i mean i take off work to take care of my cats you know the my boss thinks im absolutely crazy   oh yeah     and then we had a baby and its like all right who comes first the cat or the baby   right the cat was here first so  i know its hard   and and then when we go to sleep at night you know its like uh my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us its like all right whose corners is this one   oh how funny thats sweet i have the two the other two cats i have are outdoor cats   oh uhhuh   and they didnt used to be actually but they got kind of wild and werent doing very well inside so i put them outside once i got a house and theyre doing great out there they love it but the other one the first one i got he doesnt want anything to do with outside unless youre there   oh uhhuh   other than that he gets scared to death if you shut that door he goes into hiding   oh no   i think its from the time he jumped off the balcony and lord knows what happened to him   yes uhhuh thats it     but hes probably been through all kinds of nightmares   right traumatized for life here   probably   oh yeah weve all four of ours are house cats we started out with two with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he didnt like cats and shot one of them   are they oh no   oh well he lived through it oh i couldnt believe it we went through like twenty two hundred dollars worth of vet bills the the cat almost died and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat oh he loves life now   oh my gosh uh i imagine   and hes like oh thank you so much   i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened   i know we wondered about that but uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too   oh oh i can imagine what did he shoot him with   uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip   oh oh my gosh   oh yes it was absolutely nuts uh but uh luckily enough you know we found the cat in time and uh rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks   people are crazy oh Lord   of in and out of the vet and surgery and today i mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him   oh man     but oh they hes been a wonderful cat   i imagine they usually are after something like that happens to them it just seems to mellow them or something   oh yes but uh we wouldnt have we wouldnt have them i mean i dont see us without pets without cats theres just uh theres this they just fill this void   no oh yeah i kept i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i dont i cant take care of them as well because theyre outside and it worries me that one day one of them wont come back and   uhhuh yes   i feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things but i cant give them up i just i go hysterical when they dont come home  oh just   oh no right and you worry about oh whos taking care of them you know   oh yeah and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat and you go crazy thinking it might be yours   uhhuh uh right well i didnt realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until i brought one home one night we we i had one that had we had we had to put to sleep he got so sick and uh well i fell in love with this uh its a Chinchilla Persian and uh brought him home and   uhhuh ooh   oh my husband just died  it was like we cant take it back youve got weve got to keep it now   really well its here now we have to keep it yeah my my first one that i got i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment and it took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely  so i found this one     uhhuh umhum yes   in a actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drivethru that said free kittens and i thought well thats interesting ill call them and he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure shed gotten all her kittens   oh uhhuh uh right oh uhhuh   and he was the last one she carried across you know the whole big sad story so of course i had to take him i felt so sorry for him after that and he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because hell nurse on your ears and your fingers   oh right right oh no   yeah he i asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed so but he is the lovingest cat everybody people who dont even like cats like him   yeah oh   he never meows he he doesnt have any front claws i had him declawed but he doesnt bite anybody hes just hes just kind of there real friendly and docile   oh uhhuh oh thats good oh we just uh just love them they uh you know get to feeling so lovey and dovey and theyll come up and just start kneading in our chest and its like oh your claws need trimming   oh yeah yeah we do we call that doing biscuits  it looks like their kneading bread     oh yes yes oh it just drives us nuts   oh i just love cats i like dogs theyre okay i had i had a dog when i lived at home but theyre a lot more trouble than cats actually   um yeah they really are the cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog   oh yeah oh yeah they do   and but oh theyre so much fun to watch them play its just just hysterical   oh they are i love it its so funny to get more than one cat together because it brings out their personalities and they just act so funny   yes oh weve got uh well the two that were outside theyre like brothers i mean ive never seen two cats so close and uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house and it is hysterical i mean and then the other two cats w ill follow in suit  its like this train i understand   really uhhuh a train of cats running around
