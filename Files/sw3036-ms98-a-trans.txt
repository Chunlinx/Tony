        well uh if you had to pick a a type of music that you like would you be able to   well i could pick country music   country music i   as ive gotten older ive started listening more to the words of music and to the softer melodies   uh uh are you from Texas   not originally   not originally where you from   Georgia   Georgia okay well see im im from Chicago so uh im kind of in a different category here uh   if you had to pick one what would you choose   uh i would probably go with its tough uh i think i would just stick with the classics only because uh i like music just for musics sake and uh you know im from the era where you know we had all the rock and roll im forty so im you know part of that whole deal and uh that was a real interesting time and you know the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound uh but i think id stick back with my Beethoven and my Bach and my Mozart i mean because its just it will always be there its classic and i dont have to worry about you know whats current and whats not because i havent been current with music for a long time but you know same um and as far as country music is ive never really uh listened to it i mean because thats just it was it wasnt part of what i knew so there you go   well i understand what youre saying i think if you would listen to it a little you would discover that it has a lot of roots       from the both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that that we both lived through   right yeah i its its a different perspective on everything too i i know well whenever they talk about uh   uh   country music its about it seems sad to me its always about some guy losing some girl and then you know playing the guitar and singing about it   well theres some joy in it also       but mostly it it just tells a story about life   yeah well i must say though uh i listen to Amy Grant do you consider her country   i dont know im not all that familiar with her work   uh uh lets see well name some people that are country that i should listen to that would be good   well i kind of like uh i like groups like the Statler Brothers   okay   and the Judds certainly   oh okay i i must admit thats yeah theyre fantastic so uh   Reba McIntire is a little   uh   too country for me   shes something though shes got so much energy   the thats true     lets see well i guess i i have listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that i do like some of that uh Dolly Parton shes kind of is she kind of country   oh yes thats certainly where her roots are   kind of right down there       um uh how about the Oak Ridge Boys   very much so   very much okay well i like them too so i guess ive had a smattering and i just uh you know picked ive picked up a little bit along the way that i probably wouldnt have if id stayed up north you know   thats true   you know so well i think theres music all around anyway i mean i think life is just music so you know you can hear it wherever you want and uh and ive ive kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because i just dont understand it but maybe twenty years from now theyll look at it as classic rock and roll which i really like so   well its just difficult for me to believe that anybodys ever going to make a a record of the rap songs of the eighties   yeah the greatest hits right yeah   yeah   yeah so i mean it it itll if it stands the test of time well see   thats true   and uh then itll if it survives then itll just probably be one or two songs that sort of hey listen what we listened to can you believe this sort of thing but   yeah   uh you know i i think of i get real tickled when i listen to some of the old Beatle uh music you know the orchestration of it and that its so popular still and and uh you know all these rocks rock stations call it classic soft rock you know  but we used to listen to it full blast   right of course   yeah so its kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff but i dont know well you got any more   well the big key is that i think youve already stated that all music is rooted in the classics and it has grown from there   well thats   well listen i have to run i hate to cut this short   okeydoke well it was great yeah and well uh  listen to some more music and uh ill look at some country   all right you bet     okay byebye   byebye
