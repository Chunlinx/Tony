                                 War Crimes            Last week NATO declared waron war criminals in the former Yugoslavia In the process of arresting twoSerb officials indicted by a UNadministered warcrimes tribunal on thecharge of operating concentration camps the NATO peacekeepers killed one in agun battle Also charged with war crimes are former Bosnian Serb PresidentRadovan Karadzic and Gen Ratko Mladic A similar ad hoc UN tribunal istrying war criminals in Rwanda And there is talk that Canada will soon try PolPot for orchestrating the murder of  million Cambodians in the s What isa war crime Where does the United Nations derive its authority to arrest andtry accused war criminals from Why has the United States resisted theestablishment of a permanent warcrimes tribunal            Theconcept of a war crime dates at least as far back as biblical times In theBook of Joshua soldiers were executed for transgressing certain implicitrules of warfare  like looting conquered cities St Augustine was among the first to study the ethics of war hoping to reconcilethe Roman Empires militarism with the ideal of loving thy neighbor Killingcould be morally justified as long as it was Romans attacking barbarians Buthe added war must be only a last resort efforts must be made to avoid hurtingnoncombatants and the reasons for fighting must be just Ideas about theethics of warfare have also been absorbed into secular doctrines of warfarelike the medieval code of chivalry Similarly in Japan the unwritten martialcode Bushido required warriors to treat their enemies with honor evenproviding prisoners of war with medical care Modern militarytechnologiestrench warfare machine guns and chemical weaponsshattered oldideas about the honor of battle During prolonged mid th centuryconflagrations like the American Civil War and the Crimean War battlefieldcasualties were unprecedentedly high and civilian casualties were increasinglyconsidered inevitable In response to the new brutality some declared all warunjust Pacifism  once adhered to by only a few small Christian sectsbecame popular among clergy and intellectuals such as the philosopher BertrandRussell who was sent to prison for his opposition to World War I            Following World War I s slaughter European leaderssought to end all war or at least make warfare more humane through newinternational laws and organizations The British and French armies establishedad hoc military courts to try Kaiser Wilhelm II and more than  othertop German officials for unjustly instigating the war The allies neverarrested Wilhelm and convicted only  German soldiers giving them lightsentences The newly created League of Nations debated but failed topass treaties prohibiting the torture of prisoners and attacks on civiliansOnly after World War II did the United Nations oversee the creation of theGeneva Conventions  and the Genocide Conventiontreaties ratified by nearly every country in the world The formeroutlawed all intentional attacks on civilian populations and created newrules to protect prisoners of war The latter declared it a crime to killmembers of a racial religious or national group of people when the intentionwas to eliminate the group            Theconventions are vague on enforcement If a country is unable to mete outjustice it is expected to extradite suspects to countries that can Stringentlaws in Canada and Germany punish foreigners who violate the conventions TheUnited States has no such laws but its military courts punish servicemen whoviolate the Geneva Conventions Lt William L Calley was convicted of warcrimes for ordering the  My Lai massacre of unarmed civilians duringthe Vietnam War            Since World War II many have clamored for apermanent international warcrimes tribunal to enforce the conventionsPrior to the Clinton administration the United States consistently opposed theidea because it worried that the countrys leaders would be tried for thebombing of Hiroshima and its  attacks on civilian targets in TripoliLibya            The model for aninternational warcrimes tribunal is the Nuremberg trials  establishedby Allied victors in Germany to try the  highestranking Nazis  Theircrimes included the deliberate instigation of aggressive wars theextermination of racial and religious groups and the murder and mistreatmentof prisoners of war Three were acquitted two committed suicide before thetrials began  were hanged and the rest received prison terms ranging fromten years to life In separate proceedings  other Germans were put ontrial including the heads of concentration camps organizers of medicalexperiments on concentration camp prisoners and industrialists who usedprisoners for slave labor Ordinary citizens complicit in war crimes were nottried to avoid stigmatizing the country permanently Since Nuremberg themost prominent trials of alleged Nazi war criminals have been held outsideGermany In  Adolph Eichmann was tried by a special Israeli tribunalunder Israeli laws that prohibit crimes against humanity And in  aFrench court sentenced Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie to life in prison forviolating similar French laws            Complaints abound that Nuremberg was a kangaroo court  Sen Robert Taftcalled the trials victors justice that unfairly applied new lawsretroactively The postWorld War II trials in Tokyo  organized by GenDouglas MacArthur tried  Japanese leaders on charges of mistreating Alliedsoldiers and instigating unjustified aggression Many historians also deemthese trials unjust            Soon after war broke out in the former Yugoslavia in the United Nations used a previously obscure section of its charter to convenethe first international warcrimes tribunal since Nuremberg and Tokyo Thecourt has indicted  people mostly Serbs accused of participating in themassacres of Muslims Only  are in custody in the Hague and only one hasbeen tried so far a Bosnian Serb foot soldier who was found guilty ofmurdering two Muslims and sentenced to serve  years in prison Meanwhile thealleged architects of ethnic cleansingRadovan Karadzic and RatkoMladicare still free            In the UN Security Council set up a tribunal in Arusha Tanzania to investigatethe mass murders in Rwanda  This tribunal has indicted important figuresthanks to the cooperation of Hutu and Tutsi leaders who have turned in theirown accused tribesmen            After a band of guerrillas capturedexCambodian dictator Pol Pot one month ago many Cambodians began demandingthat he be tried for the murder of the millions killed by his regimeInitially the United States hoped that Cambodia would use the authority of theGenocide Convention to extradite Pol Pot to Canada for trial there ButCanada has been reluctant to involve itself and the United Nations isconsidering creating yet another ad hoc tribunal            Humanrights groups arguethat the current tribunals having no police force to back them up are tooweak to be effective Rightwing groups say the United Nations has used theopportunity to extend its power Never before has a UN court been able topunish the actions of individuals  Both right and leftwingers worrythat the new UN tribunals will reprise the flaws of the Nuremberg and Tokyotrials attempting to make political points and failing to adequately protectthe rights of the accused
