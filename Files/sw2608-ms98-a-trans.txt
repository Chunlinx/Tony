                okay   do you want to go first   you can go first or i will   well you go ahead   okay well im going to tell you what id have       down in the South we have a lot of shrimp   oh yeah   okay and i have uh shrimp that is steamed in beer that i cook   oh yeah uhhuh   and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook garlic bread green salad tea and wed have a lemon pie for dessert   oh it sounds fantastic   yes and whats really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your uh like your rice steamer your rice cooker   oh yeah uhhuh   and um you place the shrimp in the in the rice steamer and you put a bay leaf and put some uh red pepper over it   uhhuh   now you can either use you know the kind that comes in the little can or you can just get some you know regular red peppers   is it cayenne pepper you mean   cayenne uhhuh   yes uhhuh   and you put a little bit of that over it now if you use the dried kind   yes   then you would only use two of them and you put that in there and then you pour two bottles of beer over it   and how much shrimp would you use   two pounds   two pounds okay   thats the jumbo shrimp in the shells leave the shells on them so they wont just roll up   oh yeah uhhuh   and you pour the beer over the top of it and you cover it and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil   uhhuh okay   and the shrimp turn pink then you remove it and you put it on a platter and then you serve it with melted butter and uh   uhhuh   i usually put garlic powder in mine   oh yeah   and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it   sure   but uh then the microwave uh the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave and what you do is you just uh wash it and you core it   uhhuh uhhuh   and in a like a oh what do you call it like Pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave   uhhuh a glass dish uhhuh   uhhuh but its got to have one that has a cover on it   okay uhhuh   and you uh put about two tablespoons of uh water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt   yeah uhhuh   and then you just set your cauliflower in there and then you cook it for seven minutes on high and you rotate it one time   and its are you cooking the whole head at one time okay   uhhuh you uh when you core it you be real careful so you wont knock your flowers off   i see   and uh you just set it in there and you microwave it on high for seven minutes and you turn it one time and while thats cooking i take mayonnaise about a cup of mayonnaise   uhhuh   and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder and i mix it all together and i shred up some just regular white cheese   uhhuh   and after thats cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that and you cook it for another three minutes on high   uhhuh   you know just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it and its done   yeah oh that sounds fantastic   it is good but it it looks i mean what you can do then see is like what i usually do is ill like sit the cauliflower in the middle and then i put the uh shrimp around the outside of it you know on my platter     um um uhhuh   and then i have a green salad that i put around the outside of that and you know you have all the different seasonings and stuff and then i just fix little individual cups for them and they have the garlic bread and it makes it a real nice looking   sure and its not much work   you know huhuh huhuh but it looks like it you know  you look like you went to a whole bunch   that sounds yeah really i bet it tastes good too   right and uh usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it you know and ill lay those on top of my salad you know to make it look nice and things like that   oh yeah sure now how many could you serve   okay uh it usually serves six   yeah okay okay i figured about that   yeah   oh thats good see out here we have so many uh ethnic people we have Italians and we have Portuguese and we have Russians and Polish and it depends out here like the type of people youre going to entertain you know so its hard uh you you just have to pick something for the the group that youre going to entertain for that particular time   uhhuh yeah   and uh theyre big on finger food here too you know chicken wings and uh ribs and that kind of stuff uh barbecue   yeah   and uh cooking out in the yard it yard you know when its nice barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff   yeah have you ever had crawfish   uh no but i have had shrimp   oh you ought to try some crawfish they are good but see thats one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over you know even if its like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking   oh of course thats   you know they want it from down here   yeah   because just like now especially crawfish it is starting to move out you know and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is   really is it like shrimp   but uh its similar uhhuh   its similar   yeah its not exactly i mean its got a taste of its own you know but it is it is similar to because you only eat the tails of it     oh it does does it look like a lobster   um it looks more like a crab   oh it looks more like a crab oh   uhhuh but   are they thin long   no   or wide   um let me think of i cant even think of what you i guess if it uh it looks like more like a cross between uh a crab and uh and a lobster because its small like that and its got the pinchers like a crab but   uhhuh uhhuh   but you know its its similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a lobster would   oh yeah yep   and we call them mud bugs   oh   but i mean theyre fantastic tasting they are so good everybody its its the season for them right now   and and where did you say you were from   Louisiana   Louisiana oh well do you do cajun cooking   uhhuh oh yeah   oh i love uh blackened you know uh the the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff oh we have a few places up here that do that   uhhuh yeah   and if ever i see it on the menu i always get it   yes   it is so good   yeah you know     now how do they do the blackened   you buy it you buy it as a seasoning   but uh do you have to have a certain skillet or something   huhuh huhuh i cook mine well do you have a uh like a black iron skillet   no i did have i dont have it now but i have mostly Teflon   oh okay well i guess you could cook it in in that too but i dont know you know i never have i use uh uh the black iron skillet to cook mine   you now but uh does does it have to get extremely hot   uhhuh but it really its not it it it doesnt burn or anything like that the blackening is really the seasoning   yeah uhhuh oh oh i see   i mean there is its its a blackening seasoning   yeah   you know i mean that is a seasoning thats really its not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it   oh i see   because its called uh what its called is Blackening Magic and it it comes in a bottle and uh   oh   well im trying to see its got a a picture of Dom De Luise on it   oh oh really   uhhuh   oh now would you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time is that what youre saying   right uhhuh   oh uhhuh   but   because i could have the uh chicken on the skewers with uh uh blackened seasoning   uhhuh   and oh that is so good delicious   yeah but you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it i mean your pan it does have to be really hot you know when you put it in but its not like its burned and it what it what blackens it is the seasoning   uhhuh oh   and it is so good oh   it is i i love it i i in fact i was in Texas for a little while and i liked uh the barbecues and the Mexican food     yeah uhhuh uhhuh   i have a passion for all that type of different tastes because i have been brought up mostly Italian American food because my uh parents are Italian and Portuguese so we cook a lot of pasta and uh gravies and pizzas and you know roasts and that kind of thing thats why i enjoy going to restaurants and have you know trying different things   uhhuh well have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana you know to visit   i would love to   yeah you ought to come down um you dont even have to go all the way to New Orleans you know if you want to really get some good food   i really   i mean you dont have to go that far south   uhhuh   but uh of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as im concerned and fact is were going to take a vacation this year were going to go to New Orleans again and uh   is
