                    Background        Infection with human immunodeficiency vims HIV elicits        an acute retroviral syndrome characterized by fever        pharyngitis lymphadenopathy myalgia rash and headache            Sexual transmission of HIV infection occurs        mostly via the intestinal or vaginal mucosa but HIVI is        also effectively transmitted by the intravenous route                     Recent studies have shown that the HIVI or SIV virus        rapidly penetrates vaginal rectal or oral mucosa        attaching to and infecting primarily CD Tcells where it        replicates and consequently spreads to lymphoid tissue and        systemic organs               Accumulating evidence has implicated virusspecific CTL        in containing primary HIVSIV infection and        HIVISIVspecific CD CTL have been documented during the        early weeks following infection before a neutralizing Ab        response is demonstrable       Despite the        rapid dissemination of HIVI by mucosal routes productive        mucosal transmission appears to be relatively inefficient        and is estimated to occur once in  or more highrisk        exposures   Cellmediated immunity and direct killing        by cytotoxic lymphocytes from the vagina and colon lamina        propria may be an important factor in containing viral        infection at the site of primary infection                    Mucosal T lymphocytes appear to be functionally distinct        from those present in the peripheral circulation While        activated Tcells reenter lymphoid tissues and        preferentially accumulate at the site of the initial        activation memory Tcells migrate continuously and        randomly similar to naive Tcells     The        implication in terms of HIV infection is that in the        initial phase of an immune response once primed        Agspecific memory Tcells randomly enter and leave various        lymphoid compartments but preferentially are retained in        the lymphoid compartment where the antigen was presented at        first            In humans it is unfeasible to evaluate the        immunological events that occur shortly after infection in        the mucosal compartments However in the SIV         mac macaque model some of these        issues can be addressed SIV         mac establishes persistent infection        in rhesus macaques and causes an immunodeficiency syndrome        closely resembling human AIDS       As in        humans the clinical course of SIV         mac infection varies considerably        among macaques Recent evidence from our lab suggests that        macaques that express the major histocompatibility class I        MamuA molecule restrict SIV         mac replication following intrarectal        exposure as reported for HIVIinfected individuals that        express the HLA B   further validating this        animal model of HIVI infection In this model virus        strain dose and especially route of infection can be        defined and hostvirus interactions under different        conditions can be assessed Here we used genetically        defined MamuA rhesus macaques to study the extent of        virusspecific CD Tcell response and the trafficking of        lymphocytes to the gut during the first  days of        intrarectal or intravenous transmission of the same stock        of SIV         mac                     Materials                  Animals and procedure          Two female MamuApositive macaques were involved          in this study animal  that was infected by undiluted          SIV           mac stock virus R Pal           et al unpublished data by the          intrarectal route and animal  by the intravenous route          with a  dilution of the same viral stock Blood was          drawn before infection and at days   and  after          inoculation with the virus Animals were sacrificed at          day  postinfection The spleens and hilar axillary          mesenteric iliac and inguinal lymph nodes as well as          ileums jejunums and colons were collected in RPMI          medium containing  FCS penicillinstreptomycin                          Isolation of tissue lymphocytes          Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood          PBMC lymph nodes spleens and intestines Mononuclear          cells from spleens and lymph nodes were isolated by          mechanical dissociation of the tissue and consecutive          Ficoll gradient centrifugation Tissues from ileums          jejunums and colons were treated with  mM DTT ICN          Biomedicals Aurora OH for  minutes followed by          incubation in calciummagnesiumfree HBSS with EDTA Life          Technologies Baltimore MD  times  hour with stirring          at room temperature to remove the epithelial layer At          this stage pieces of tissue were fixed in  neutral          formalin and embedded in paraffin and sections were cut          and stained with HE Microscopic examination was          performed to ensure that all of the epithelium was          removed and the lamina propria was intact          Further tissues were cut into smaller pieces and          incubated at C in Isocoves medium supplemented with           fetal calf serum and penicillinstreptomycin          containing  Uml Collagenase D Boerrhinghem           Mannheim GmbH Mannheim Germany and  Uml DNAse          Worthington Biochemical Lakewood NJ for  hours          The mononuclear cells were isolated from the supernatant          containing dissociated cells by Percoll gradient          centrifugation                          Flow cytometry          Fresh mononuclear cells were directly stained with          PEconjugated tetrameric complexes for Gag  Env           and Tat  PerCPconjugated antiCDe Pharmingen San          Diego CA and FITCconjugated antiCD Becton          Dickinson San Jose CA were used in conjunction with          the tetrameric complexes In addition cells were stained          with a combination of antiCD PerCP antiCD FITC and          anti CD PE Becton Dickinson San Jose CA  To assess          their proliferative ability and to confirm the          specificity of tetramer staining of           ex vivo CD CD Tcells          lymphocytes were cultured at a concentration of             ml in RPMI enriched with  human serum with addition          of  gml of the appropriate peptide and  Uml of          IL for  days Staining with tetrameric complexes was          done afterward as described above          Briefly   l lymphocytes isolated by Ficoll          diatrizoate or Percoll gradient centrifugation were          incubated with tetrameric complexes as previously          described   andor selected Ab for  minutes at room          temperature After washing the cells twice in Dulbeccos          phosphate buffered saline supplemented with  FCS and          fixation in  paraformaldehyde Ph   samples were          analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScalibur Becton          Dickinson San Jose CA instrument                          Viral load NASBA          SIV           mac viral RNA copies in plasma was          quantified by nucleicacidsequencebased amplification            Briefly RNA extracted from plasma was subjected to          isothermal amplification with SIV           mac specific primers A portion of          the SIV wild type Gag gene was used to generate internal          control NASBA amplification products were detected by          using chemiluminescencebased probe hybridization system          The assay can measure accurately tenfold changes and is          functional over a dynamic range spanning at least            copies                            Results                  Kinetics of viral appearance and CD Tcell          decrease in the blood          Since the knowledge of the MamuArestricted          epitopes    allows for a quantitation of the CD          Tcell response using the tetramer technology            MamuA macaques were chosen for this study Following          exposure to the same viral stock of SIV           mac of macaque  by the          intrarectal route and macaque  by the intravenous          route the kinetics of viral RNA appearance in the plasma          was assessed by NASBA Plasma viral RNA was detected as          early as day  in animal  exposed by the intravenous          route and was highest at time of euthanasia day  as          demonstrated in Fig C In contrast in animal           exposed by the intrarectal route the appearance of          plasma virus was delayed to day  postinfection Fig          A and at that time plasma viral RNA was  logs lower in          animal  than in animal  Figs Aand C The          absolute number of CD Tcellsmm blood decreased by           in both macaques by day  Figs Aand C However          the absolute number of CD Tcells and CD Tcells          decreased as well indicating that the apparent depletion          of CD Tcells may be due to redistribution rather than          loss of CD Tcells at this stage of infection          Since animal  received three thousandfold more          virus than animal  these data suggest that the          kinetics of viral appearance in the blood in primary SIV           mac infection may depend on the          route of challenge rather than dose                          Virusspecific CD Tcell response in the          blood          Virusspecific CD Tcells were quantitated in the          blood of both animals at days   and  postinfection          using  tetrameric MamuA molecules complexed with the          SIV           mac Gag  Env  and Tat           peptides TM Alien           et al submitted          In the blood virusspecific tetramerbinding CD          CD Tcells appeared earlier in macaque  exposed to          SIV           mac by the intrarectal route than          in  for all the  antigens studied Figs Band D          Overall the size of the virusspecific CD Tcell          response in the blood was higher in animal  and          interestingly a large population of Tatspecific CD          Tcells appeared in the blood as early as day  whereas          in the same animal CD Tcells specific to Gag  and          Env  peaked later Fig  These data are consistent          with previous observations on the kinetics of appearance          of virusspecific CD Tcells that recognize the Tat           epitope and underscore the importance of the immune          response to this early SIV           mac protein                              Absence of CD Tcell depletion in the GALT of          MamuA macaques          Both macaques were euthanized at day  and the          relative percentages of CD and CD Tcells was          assessed in various compartments In contrast to previous          reports     depletion of CD Tcells was not          observed in any tissues including the GALT of either          animal Fig  It is possible that both animals could          have controlled viral replication or that the tissues          were examined too early and that depletion would have          occurred at a latter stage of the infection Preservation          of CD Tcell depletion in the GALT during primary          infection may be a key event in delaying disease          progression                          Quantitation of ex vivoCD Tcell response in          tissues          Virusspecific Gag  CD Tcell response in the          blood of macaques exposed intravenously to SIV           mac appears to peak within the          first weeks following intravenous exposure            Therefore both macaques were euthanized at day  and          lymphocytes were harvested from several systemic tissues          as well as the GALT Quantitation of the           ex vivo CD Tcell population          specific for Gag Tat and Env in the systemic tissues of          both animals revealed that in contrast to the blood the          highest virusspecific CD Tcell response was found in          most tissues of animal  challenged by the intravenous          route Figs and and Table In the same animal the          percentage of CD Tcells specific for Tat  was as          high as   and  in the axillary and iliac lymph          nodes and the spleen respectively Fig Aand Table          The number of CD Tcells with different specificities          was also higher in animal  than  in the GALT and          particularly in the jejunum and ileum lamina propria          Figs ABC while the size of these virusspecific          responses in the remaining tissues of both animals did          not differ significantly Table These data indicate          that both the Gag  and Tat  responses are codominant          and suggest that the overall higher CD Tcell response          in animal  may be related to an ongoing higher viral          replication in the tissues of this animal as reflected          by the higher level of plasma viremia present at the time          of euthanasia                          Differential proliferative ability of          tetramerbinding CD cells in tissues of animals  and                    Blood lymph nodes and lamina propria lymphocytes          were cultured           in vitro in the presence of IL          and the virusspecific Gag  Tat  and Env           peptides to assess the ability of the tetramerpositive          CD Tcell population to expand upon antigen          stimulation In our experimental conditions expansion of          CD Tcells specific for Tat Env and Gag occurred to a          comparable extent in most tissues and was highest in the          blood of animal  Fig B In animal  the ability          of virusspecific CD Tcells to proliferate was highest          in the jejunum and was higher than that observed in the          same compartment in animal  Fig A The finding          that the highest level of CD Tcells with proliferative          ability was in the lamina propria of the jejunum of          animal  challenged intrarectally is suggestive of a          qualitative difference of CD Tcells present at the          site of induction and of heterogeneity in the          virusspecific CD response                            Discussion        The impact that the route of viral entry of HIVSIV may        have on the virusspecific immune response and control of        viral replication to it is not yet fully understood Here        we conducted a small pilot study using genetically defined        MamuA macaques to study the vimsspecific immune        response following parenteral or rectal exposure to SIV         mac This study was designed to begin        to investigate the specificity of the immune response and        its kinetics as well as the kinetics of viral replication        according to the site of primary exposure and viral        entry        Within the limitation of the small number of animals        used here the mucosal barrier delayed the appearance of        virus in the plasma whereas the decrease in the absolute        CD Tcell counts was equivalent In addition in contrast        to other reports     depletion of CD Tcells in        the GALT at day  postinfection was not observed in either        animal regardless of the route of challenge It is unclear        what is the reason for this finding It is possible that        both animals could have controlled the infection or that        the tissues were examined too early and that depletion        would have occurred at a latter stage of the infection        The finding of a higher percentage of tetramerpositive        CD Tcells in tissues of macaque  infected        intravenously than in animal  infected intrarectally        may reflect a higher rate of viral replication in tissues        of this animal at the time of sacrifice Of interest the        intrarectal route of infection resulted in faster kinetics        of appearance of virusspecific CD Tcells particularly        in the Tat epitope in the blood indicating the importance        of this immune response early in infection In the same        animal a higher number of tetramerspecific CD Tcells        able to proliferate in response to all epitopes tested Gag         Tat  and Env  was found in jejunum lamina        propria than in other tissues Unfortunately at present        it is not possible to assess whether the differences in the        proliferative ability of these cells reflect functional        status andor differentiation differences effector versus        memory or others in part because markers to define        accurately these cells in rhesus macaques are not        available                    Conclusions        In conclusion this study within the limitation of the        small number of animals used appears to suggest that        exposure by the mucosal site a natural barrier to        pathogens delays viral appearance in the blood The        differences in the relative percentage of homing markers        may not necessarily reflect a true qualitative difference        in the overall lymphocyte trafficking related to the mode        of viral encounter and may depend on the time of analysis        since the kinetic of viral replication was delayed in the        macaque exposed intrarectally Nevertheless these data        demonstrate that a short window of opportunity to contain        viral infection following mucosal exposure exists and that        potentiating the effectiveness of the mucosal natural        barrier by local immunization may further limit or halt        viral replication In fact in a previous study we have        observed that it appears to be easier to protect vaccinated        macaques by intrarectal exposure than intravenous exposure        to SIV            In particular since a CD        Tcell response to Tat appears to be the earliest this        protein may be a key component of a preventive vaccine as        suggested by other                         List of abbreviations        HIV human immunodeficiency virus        HEV high endothelial
