                    Background        The eukaryotic protein kinase EPK family is one of the        largest protein families represented in the human genome        The human genome has been estimated to contain between         and  EPK genes    EPKs play key roles in many        intercellular and intracellular signaling pathways by        transducing amplifying or integrating upstream signals             Upstream signaling events modulate the        activity of EPKs through a variety of means that often        involve alterations in the phosphorylation of key EPK        residues or changes in the physical association of        regulatory proteins with the EPK Signals are typically        relayed downstream by the EPK through the covalent transfer        of the terminal phosphate group from ATP or GTP to serine        threonine or tyrosine residues of substrate proteins          Phosphorylation of the substrate protein then alters its        ability to physically interact with other molecules in the        cell           The key feature that distinguishes EPK family members        from other proteins is the sequence of a contiguous stretch        of approximately  amino acids that constitutes the        catalytic domain     Although no residue in this        region is absolutely conserved in all family members the        presence of most of the signature EPK residues can be used        to determine that a particular sequence belongs in the        family The pattern of residue conservation seen within        this core of  amino acids is thought to be due to        selective evolutionary pressure to preserve the major        function of this gene family catalysis of phosphate        transfer from ATP to a protein substrate The solution of        crystal structures for several EPKs some of which include        bound ATP and protein substrate has clarified the        functional role of particular conserved residues in binding        different portions of ATP and protein substrate molecules        and in regulating these binding events              Interestingly family members exist that no longer        retain the characteristic catalytic activity even though        they retain most of the conserved sequence features of the        kinase catalytic domain In these latter cases the role of        the conserved residues in protein function is not        known        In addition to orthodox EPKs there are several other        proteins that have demonstrated protein kinase activity but        share little or no recognizable sequence similarity with        the EPK family Examples include A kinases   a number        of lipid kinase family members   aminoglycoside        phosphotransferases   pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase        family members   DNAdependent protein kinase          ATM   ATR   BCR    a transient receptor        potential channel   and actinfragmin kinases          Although some of these nonEPK protein kinases share a        similar overall fold with each other and with orthodox EPKs          the low sequence similarity between these proteins        and EPKs confounds attempts to align the sequences in a        single alignment or to perform comparative sequence        analysis        Regulation of EPK function can occur at many levels        including control of synthesis posttranslational        modification binding of regulatory proteins and        subcellular localization One frequently reported mechanism        for regulating EPK activity involves phosphorylation of key        residues of the EPK catalytic domain by other upstream EPKs                      In vitro purified EPKs often display        broad protein substrate specificity   and it is thought        that in many cases         in vivo substrate specificity is        limited by a requirement for substrate to associate not        only with its cognate EPK but also with other components        of an EPKcontaining protein assembly     These        protein complexes can consist of signaling proteins        involved in several parallel inputs or several consecutive        steps in a signaling cascade   EPKs frequently contain        one or more noncatalytic domains some of which are        thought to serve for docking EPKs to various constituents        of these complexes        The presence of multiple potential proteindocking sites        in some EPKs allows them to serve as scaffolding molecules        around which a protein complex can assemble     The        assembly and activity of the complex can be controlled by        altering the ability of these docking sites to be bound        Some well characterized physiologically important EPKs        such as ErbB   seem to have lost their enzymatic        activity altogether and are thought to function solely as        scaffolding proteins        Appreciation of the central role of EPKs in virtually        every signaling pathway involved in normal development and        disease   has stimulated much work on individual family        members as well as interesting subsets of the entire        family Progress toward sequencing the genome and        transcripts of several organisms has allowed the        identification of most of the EPK genes present in         Saccharomyces cerevisiae           Caenorhabditis elegans    and         Drosophila melanogaster   A        description of the tyrosine kinase subset of human EPKs has        been published   and at least one partial list of        human EPKs is available on the web   In our study        this progress is extended to include almost all the EPK        genes in the human genome Publicly available sequence data        were searched for sequences potentially encoding human EPK        family members For the purposes of this study the family        was defined to include proteins that share a particular        previously described pattern of aminoacid sequence        conservation     As discussed above this        definition includes family members that lack protein kinase        activity but may still have important cellular functions        that are dependent on retention of a proteinkinaselike        structure Conversely this definition excludes proteins        that have protein kinase activity but lack substantial        sequence similarity to the rest of the family A        conservative mining approach was used to minimize        overcounting because of inclusion of splice variants        pseudogenes and sequencing artifacts In total  known        and novel human EPK loci were identified and        crossreferenced to publicly available sequence records        Information on nomenclature and genetic mapping was        extracted from the sequence records and summarized The        protein sequences of the EPK catalytic domains of the        family members were aligned and the alignment was used to        construct a phenogram that illustrates the sequence        relatedness between family members This work represents a        nearly comprehensive census and an early bioinformatics        overview of this large gene family in         Homo sapiens                     Results and discussion                  Searching sequence databases          A previously published alignment of EPK catalytic          domains   which is available on the web            includes approximately  sequences from a variety of          organisms along with links to the corresponding GenBank          records The protein sequences from this alignment were          used as bait for BLAST   searches of GenBank            nucleotide and protein sequence datasets Human and          nonhuman sequences from the alignment were used as bait          to reduce the probability of missing human members of          subfamilies that are poorly represented in humans Hits          identified using different bait sequences were          consolidated and duplicate records including those          representing splice and allelic variants were removed          see Materials and methods          Each hit was manually evaluated for the presence of          conserved residues known to be distinctive for the EPK          family     and approved human hits were added          to the EPK collection Nonhuman sequences were added to          the collection only if the corresponding protein sequence          was less than  identical to any other protein sequence          represented in the collection The sequencesearching          process was repeated five times with the augmented EPK          collection resulting from one iteration being used as          bait for the next iteration After removal of probable          pseudogenes and sequencing artifacts see below the          final EPK collection contained sequences representing           distinct putative human loci  of which are thought to          encode proteins that contain two separate EPK domains          Several distantly related sequences which often lack          some residues thought to be critical for EPK enzymatic          activity were included in the collection including          members of the ABC RIO CFW ILK and guanylate          cyclase subfamilies The hit set was also found to          contain a number of sequences with even more remote          similarity to EPKs such as lipid kinases and          antibioticresistance genes To simplify subsequent          analysis members of these more distantly related          families were not added to the EPK collection                          Removing pseudogenes and sequencing          artifacts          The presence of pseudogene sequences and poorquality          sequences in target data sets tends to cause          overprediction of the number of EPKs present in the          genome Poorquality sequences often present as novel          singleton hits that closely resemble known genes but          encode potential proteins that are missing key residues          or contain apparent stop codons or frameshift mutations          within functionally important regions Removing hits with          these features carries with it the risk of filtering          poorquality singleton sequences that represent real          novel EPKs In cases involving poorquality singletons          and other questionable sequences we implemented          consistent curation rules to help discriminate between          sequences that probably represent novel functional family          members and sequences that probably represent          pseudogenes and poorquality sequences of known          genes          Sequences that appeared to be of very poor quality          three or more internal stop codons or frameshifts          observed in any aminoacid stretch were rejected          because these sequences either are derived from          pseudogenes or if they represent functional loci novel          sequence information is obscured by the high levels of          noise present in the sequences In addition any          sequences which were found to contain polyA tracts          within the genomic sequence were filtered out because          such sequences almost certainly represent processed          pseudogenes   Processed pseudogenes are thought to          arise when mRNA molecules are reverse transcribed and          reintegrated into the genome This mechanism results in          the creation of pseudogenes that lack introns and often          contain a polyA tail in the genomic sequence The          potential significance of pseudogene contamination within          the hit set is highlighted by a study of pseudogenes on          chromosomes  and    which showed that          approximately  of identifiable potential          proteincoding regions represent pseudogenes This same          study determined that about half of all pseudogenes are          processed pseudogenes          The presence of internal stop codons or frameshift          mutations was used to identify pseudogenes but only if          the feature could be verified in a sequence derived from          a different cloning library The nucleotide sequence of          each hit that contained unverifiable stop codons or          frameshift mutations was further analyzed by comparing          the nucleotide sequence of the hit to the nucleotide          sequence of closely related known EPKs Comparisons that          showed a pattern of nucleotide mismatches between the hit          and the known EPK that suggested an absence of selective          evolutionary pressure on the encoded protein sequence of          the hit were used to filter suspect hits For          proteincoding portions of a nucleotide sequence natural          selection usually imposes greater constraints on the          encoded protein sequence than on the underlying          nucleotide sequence As a result comparing two          functional genes that belong to the same family usually          shows bias in the pattern of observed nucleotide identity          between the genes For example a greater fraction of          nucleotide mismatches in the third position of codons          the wobble position will be detected than would be          expected from a random distribution of nucleotide          mismatches   This preference for wobble position and          other synonymous codon preserving nucleotide          mismatches results in levels of aminoacid identity that          are greater than would be expected given the degree of          identity between nucleotide sequences and an assumption          of randomness in the pattern of nucleotide mismatches            The degree of this bias will depend on the protein          family and the corresponding functional constraints on          the aminoacid sequence          By contrast comparison of a functional gene with a          closely related processed pseudogene will often show no          evidence of this codonpreserving bias in the pattern of          nucleotide mismatches   This is true for processed          pseudogenes which are usually nonfunctional from their          inception and older unprocessed pseudogenes because          most of the evolution of the nucleotide sequence of these          pseudogenes was not constrained by natural selection on          the encoded protein sequence Other pseudogenes may have          been inactivated relatively recently in evolutionary          history and may show substantial codonpreserving bias          accumulated over the evolutionary period during which the          gene was functional These young nonprocessed          pseudogenes are not readily identifiable on the basis of          nucleotide sequence comparisons with known family          members and may pass through this filtering process          In poorquality sequences sequencing artifacts occur          more or less at random and not in a manner that respects          the integrity of the encoded protein sequence As a          result comparisons of poorquality sequences of known          genes with the reference sequences for these genes should          show no preference for synonymous nucleotide mismatches          and such hits should also be readily identifiable on the          basis of the sort of comparison described here By          contrast poorquality sequences of novel functional          genes are expected to present an intermediate picture in          which nucleotide mismatches that are due to sequencing          artifacts show no preference for synonymous substitution          whereas mismatches that are due to evolution will show a          preference for synonymous substitution The degree of          codonpreserving bias in these cases will depend on the          relative impact of these two processes on the nucleotide          sequence          The degree of codonpreserving bias present in a hit          was estimated by comparing the percent nucleotide          identity between the hit and the most similar EPK with          the percent aminoacid identity seen over the same          region We empirically determined cutoff scores for          these comparisons that lead to rejection of most          independently verified pseudogenes and simulated          poorquality sequences while retaining all known EPK          genes and verifiable novel EPK sequences data not          shown Comparison conditions were chosen that would lead          to retention of borderline sequences in order to reduce          the probability of rejecting poorquality singletons that          represent novel EPK family members                          Aligning the catalytic domains          The sequences of the catalytic domains of all the          human EPKs in the collection were manually aligned          Alignment of this family is difficult because only a          small number of residues are recognizably conserved          across all family members As a result the full manual          alignment contains small blocks of residues that are well          aligned throughout the EPK family punctuated by blocks          of residues that are aligned within particular          subfamilies but not throughout the rest of the EPK          family Although the alignment can be forced in these          latter regions length heterogeneity and poor residue          conservation often make several alignments seem equally          reasonable and it is difficult to ascertain criteria for          objectively choosing one over the others To avoid          effects stemming from arbitrary decisions on how to          handle these difficult portions of the alignment the          full alignment was trimmed to contain only those regions          that are relatively straightforward to align The          resulting partial alignment see Additional data files          which more clearly delineates the key residues that          support inclusion of a particular sequence in the EPK          family was used for subsequent phenogram          construction          The partial alignment shows that even the best          conserved aminoacid positions in the EPK catalytic          domain are found to vary in some family members Table           To understand better how different residues can be          accommodated at these key locations available structural          data were searched for examples of proteins with          noncanonical residues in these positions Structures and          sequences were examined for a representative member of          each of the  kinase families listed in the Structural          Classification of Proteins SCOP database   In          these kinases  out of  of the critical residues given          in Table are completely conserved Previously conserved          residues and their structural roles have been discussed          within the context of subdomains of the canonical kinase          catalytic domain    Here this discussion is          expanded on the basis of the known structures of the           kinase families and the variations in sequence noted in          the entire human protein kinase family Consensus          sequence motifs are specified rather than completely          conserved residues Subdomain I comprises the GXGXGXV          motif   F Y singleletter aminoacid code that          forms a  hairpin to enclose one side of the triphosphate          group of ATP Among the known structures only G varies          G is preferred because of close steric contacts with an          adjacent  strand A small conformational change permits          the A or S side chains to extend into the binding cavity          behind the triphosphate S hydrogen bonds to the          phosphate There is less space near G and G which          are directly in contact with ribose and the phosphate          respectively Nevertheless there is also considerable          sequence variation at these two positions Subdomain II          contains a conserved K that contacts the phosphate          whereas subdomain III has a conserved E that forms a salt          bridge to the K to stabilize its conformation Subdomain          VIB has the motif HRDLKPXN in SerThr kinases and          HRDLXARN in Tyr kinases Both the D and the downstream          basic residue K R are directly involved in the          catalytic phosphorylation of substrate Differences in          the binding pocket for the phosphateaccepting residue          permit the changes in the position in the sequence and in          the nature of the basic residue the N atoms of the K          and R residues interact with the acceptor OH and occupy          the same position in space Subdomain VII has the DFG          motif The D residue ligates Mg which in turn binds the           and phosphates of ATP Among the known structures          titin has a D  E modification Unfortunately only the          apotitin structure has been determined so there is no          structure to define how the D  E change is accommodated          in binding ATP Subdomain VIII contains the TXXYXAPE          motif in SerThr kinases and PXXWXAPE in Tyr kinases as          noted previously   This motif is critical in          stabilizing distinct conformations of the activation loop          to form a platform for binding to the protein substrate          The first residue T P lies directly underneath the          acceptor residue SerThr Tyr In Tyr kinases the P          residue forces the loop to swing out to properly position          the accepting Tyr residue The last residue E forms a          conserved salt bridge with an R in subdomain XI Casein          kinase  has an E  N variant and is missing the salt          bridge The D residue of subdomain IX hydrogen bonds to          backbone NHs to stabilize the conformation of the          catalytic loop of subdomain VIB          Of the highly conserved residues Table  the Gs of          subdomain I show the most variability Apparently other          amino acids with small side chains can replace the          glycines while maintaining the hairpin conformation of          the phosphatebinding loop and avoiding steric          interference with ATP binding Residues in subdomains VIB          and VII are directly involved in catalysis and only the          most conservative substitutions would be consistent with          enzymatic activity In the entire human protein kinase          family these residues are approximately  conserved          many of the variants at these positions may lack          enzymatic activity In principle more variability would          be permitted for residues in subdomains III VIII and IX          which play a structural role but are not in direct          contact with either ATP or the protein substrate          Nevertheless these residues are also approximately           conserved Their role in forming linking salt bridges and          hydrogen bonds seems to be nearly as critical as that of          residues directly involved in catalysis                          Building the phenogram          The sequence relationship between different EPKs was          analyzed by estimating the phenetic distance between each          possible pair of sequences and building a phenogram to          portray the results graphically A distance matrix          representing the sequence similarity between each pair of          sequences in the partial alignment was calculated using          the JukesCantor distance correction method   A          phenogram see Additional data files was then built from          this matrix using the neighborjoining algorithm                     A dendrogram Figure  that summarizes the results          seen in the phenogram see Additional data files was          constructed by collapsing branches that were relatively          well separated from the rest of the tree and naming the          collapsed branch guided by previously proposed subfamily          nomenclature     This earlier work suggests          that EPKs can be classified into five families PTK AGC          CMGC CaMK and OPK which in turn can be split into a          total of  subfamilies Our work largely corroborates          the validity of this classical naming scheme but adds          several names for branches representing sequences that do          not fit into any of the previously described subfamilies          or that fall into one of the catchall subfamilies such          as OPKOther whose members do not form a well defined          sequence cluster in the phenogram Sequences that do not          cleanly fall into a cluster singletons are indicated in          blue in Figure  The granularity of the classical          subfamily naming scheme is much finer for some families          particularly PTK than for others particularly CaMK          In an attempt to provide greater resolution of clusters          evident in the phenogram some of the larger subfamilies          were split into sets of smaller individually named          branches To facilitate translation between the branch          names and the classical subfamily nomenclature each          human EPK is listed in the EPK data table see Additional          data files along with the name used to identify its          parent branch in Figure  and the classical subfamily          name most appropriate for that EPK No branch names are          supplied for singletons or partial sequences and          classical names are not assigned to sequences that do not          clearly fall into any of the classical subfamilies          Nearly all previously recognized EPK subfamilies are          represented in the human genome No representatives were          found for four of the classical subfamilies and one of          the subfamilies is represented in humans by a single          member Human members of the AGC V budding yeast          AGCrelated protein kinases subfamily were not          identified but human EPKs assigned to the AKT and SGK          branches are approximately  identical to yeast AGC V          family members The AGC VIII flowering plant PVPK          protein kinase homology subfamily was also not          represented in humans although the DBFDBF branch          contains members that are approximately  identical to          plant AGC VIII subfamily members Obvious human members          of the OPK XIII PKN prokaryotic protein kinases          subfamily were not found although AJEPK may          represent a distant family member and human members of          the ULK branch are approximately  identical to          bacterial OPK XIII family members The PTK XXII nematode          kin related kinases subfamily was not identified in          the human genome although members of the PDGFR and FGFR          branches are about  identical to known nematode PTK          XXII subfamily members In addition to these          unrepresented families only one member Ros of the PTK          XVIII Rossevenless family subfamily was detected Each          of the other  classical subfamilies was represented by          two or more human sequences          The distance calculations described above were carried          out using only those sequences that extend across at          least  of the alignment As the presence of sequence          fragments in an alignment is known to skew trees built          from the alignment fragment removal before distance          calculation was essential Unfortunately this process          had the undesired effect of excluding a sizable fraction          of family members from tree construction To provide some          information on the subfamily membership of these partial          sequences fragments excluded from the initial          construction of each tree were added back into the tree          based on BLASTP similarity to the more complete sequences          that were used to construct the tree see Materials and          methods These partial sequences appear in the phenogram          see Additional data files in parentheses next to the          more complete sequence with which they share the greatest          degree of sequence identity This scheme indicates which          branch of the tree the fragmentary sequence probably          belongs in without attempting to assign a branch length          from the fragment to the rest of the tree          The overall accuracy of the phenogram is suggested by          the clustering of similarly named proteins the          relatively good agreement with previously published          categorization schemes     and the high level          of congruence with the previously published tree of human          tyrosine kinases   In addition alternative          phenograms were constructed using different portions of          the alignment and different algorithms data not shown          In general these alternative trees are similar to the          main phenogram in their gross topology although they          often differ in their details Most discrepancies involve          partial sequences poorquality sequences or sequences          representing outlying members of the family The          phenogram presented here was chosen because we believe it          to have the greatest overall accuracy even though a few          outliers notably BUB and BUBB are not correctly          clustered          The groupings suggested by the phenogram are based on          sequence similarity across the entire alignment which          may suggest categories different from those suggested by          considerations of much smaller stretches of residues          known to be important for the characteristic functional          features of a particular subfamily Similarly some EPKs          have traditionally been categorized on the basis of          residue segments that are important for the distinctive          function of the subfamily but lie completely outside the          catalytic domain For instance PRKCM and PRKCN have          traditionally been included in the protein kinase C PKC          subfamily largely because of the presence of a          characteristic diacylglycerolbinding cysteinerich          zincfingerlike domain   This domain which lies          outside the EPK catalytic domain of certain members of          the PKC subfamily mediates the modulatory effects of          diacylglycerol and phorbol esters on the function of          sensitive PKCs The trees presented here show that          consideration of the EPK catalytic domain sequence alone          does not lead to tight association of PRKCM and PRKCN          with the rest of the PKC subfamily                          Crossreferencing to GenBank records          GenBank records were associated with each EPK record          in order to provide supporting data for the existence          sequence and transcriptional status of each locus          Readers may also find these records useful for retrieving          supplementary information such as links to available          literature genetic mapping and nomenclature for a          particular EPK Crossreferences are provided to GenBank          protein transcript and genomic sequence records because          these data sources tend to contain mutually complementary          information For instance information about exonintron          organization noncoding control elements and genetic          mapping information are best obtained from genomic          records whereas transcript records can suggest that the          gene is transcriptionally active confirm the predicted          splicing pattern and provide information about the          tissue distribution of the gene product          BLAST was used to identify GenBank records that were           identical in a residue stretch to EPK sequences          in the collection Matching GenBank records were placed          into the most appropriate of three sequence categories          protein transcript or genomic Although sequence records          in all three categories were found for most EPK family          members occasionally representative sequence records for          only one or two sequence categories could be identified          The finding that many EPKs were only represented in          genomic or transcript data but not both suggests that          each of these datasets is incomplete or that mining one          can give rise to artifacts not found in the other When          more than one representative sequence for an EPK was          found within a particular category one of the sequences          was chosen as the primary crossreference for that          category If a RefSeq   sequence was among the          choices it was chosen as the primary crossreference          otherwise the sequence with the greatest degree of          overlap with the EPK reference sequence was chosen For          each EPK primary crossreferences for each sequence          category are provided in the EPK data table see          Additional data files                          Retrieving data on chromosomal mapping          The extensive annotation present in many GenBank          records frequently includes chromosomal mapping          information This information was extracted and is listed          in the EPK data table see Additional data files Often          when multiple genomic sequence records were associated          with a particular EPK these records contained          inconsistent mapping information This occurred more          frequently if the associated records were derived from          the HTG portion of the GenBank sequence database These          discrepancies between different records were resolved as          described in the Materials and methods                          EPK nomenclature          GenBank records often contain a list of names that          have been used to identify the corresponding locus in the          literature have been chosen by a nomenclature committee          or have been suggested by the record submitter This          information was gathered and reconciled see Materials          and methods If no accepted name could be found in any          associated GenBank records the EPK was given an interim          name that was based on the accession string of associated          GenBank records Permanent names could have been          assigned this task is however best left to scientists          engaged in more detailed characterization of these novel          sequences The names arrived at through this process          served as identifiers in the alignments and trees and          are listed in the EPK data table see Additional data          files          Estimating the number of novel EPKs in the collection          is complicated by the incremental nature of gene          characterization and imprecision in the definition of the          term novel Because nomenclature and characterization          often go handinhand evaluating the state of          nomenclature can provide a rough estimate of the extent          to which members of the collection have been previously          characterized Four hundred EPKs could be associated with          a Human Genome Organization HUGO Gene Nomenclature          Committee HGNC   name such as MAPgK RAF or          PRKCM or description that implies previous knowledge          about the potential function or subfamily membership of          the sequence In addition  EPKs were associated with          nondescriptive names such as FLJ LOC or          KIAA that give little information regarding          potential function or family ties but indicate that the          submitter believed that the sequence encoded a protein          For  EPKs no name could be found for the corresponding          gene or gene product and an interim name was assigned          This method for estimating the novelty within the          collection ignores the occasional unnamed family member          whose GenBank annotation suggests probable membership in          the EPK family and the exceptional named family member          RNasel whose GenBank annotation overlooks similarity to          the EPK family The level of previous characterization          for each EPK sequence is summarized in the status          column of the EPK data table see Additional data files          The  relatively well characterized sequences described          above were assigned a status of  The  somewhat less          well characterized sequences were assigned a status of           and the  least well characterized sequences

covalent modification of cellular proteins is involved in        the regulation of virtually all cellular functions Most        enzymes that mediate protein phosphorylation are members of        a large and diverse evolutionarily conserved gene family        Further evaluation of similarities and differences in the        sequences encoding protein kinases will provide significant        scientific insights These include information relevant to        structurefunction relationships specificity of        therapeutic agents targeting protein kinases and potential        function of uncharacterized family members The work        described here constitutes a summary and classification of        the sequences in         H sapiens encoding these enzymes        This census of protein kinases in the human genome provides        a tool and framework for further investigation of this        important gene family                    Materials and methods                  Sequence comparisons          Throughout this study pairs of sequences were          compared to determine whether or not the loci they          represent were similar or identical to one another This          was done by performing searches with BLASTP for protein          comparisons and for searching protein datasets with          protein queries or BLASTN for nucleotide comparisons          or TBLASTN for searching nucleotide datasets with          protein query sequences using one sequence as bait          against a BLASTformatted database containing the other          sequence NCBI BLAST   implemented on a variety of          UNIX platforms Sun SGI Compaq was used to carry out          all the BLAST comparisons used in this study BLAST          parameters were set to retain lowscoring hits in the          output retain  top hits with           E values up to  Perl          scripts were used to parse sequence alignments from the          BLAST output and identify the residue section of each          alignment that contained the maximum percentage identity          obtainable in a window of that size for that alignment          The percentage identity between the two sequences within          this optimal window was used to score the similarity          between sequences for the purposes of creating the query          set used for database searching database searching          itself duplicatesplice variant filtering assigning          partial sequences to positions within the phenogram and          database crossreferencing                          Searching public sequence data          An initial set of EPK aminoacid sequences was          downloaded from Hankss and Quinns alignment of EPK          catalytic domains    This alignment includes          approximately  sequences from a variety of organisms          along with links to GenBank   records representing          each sequence The links were used to retrieve the          corresponding GenBank records The GenBank records were          parsed in order to obtain the protein sequence taxonomic          information and additional accessions that were used to          retrieve the corresponding GenBank nucleotide records          This collection of EPK data was used to create a query          protein set that contained EPK catalytic domain sequences          that are less than  identical to each other within any          window  amino acids long          Each protein sequence in this query set was used to          search the NT NR EST HTG GSS and STS divisions of          GenBank   release  using BLASTP for NR or          TBLASTN for the remainder of the GenBank divisions          Hits produced by different query sequences were combined          and duplicate records which were identified on the basis          of accession were removed Taxonomic information for          each hit was retrieved from the corresponding complete          GenBank record Additional duplicates along with splice          variants were identified by comparing all the sequences          in the hit set to each other and looking for sequences          that were  identical in a residue stretch          Sequences meeting this criterion were selectively removed          so as to leave only the longest representative from each          set of duplicates and splice variants          The resulting filtered hit set was manually reviewed          by aligning the protein sequence of each hit with the          catalytic domains of known EPKs and looking for the          presence of a loose pattern of conserved residues known          to be distinctive for the family     Approved          hits were added back to the EPK collection and the          expanded collection was used for additional rounds of          searches Nonhuman sequences were included in the EPK          query set if the corresponding protein sequence was less          than  identical in any residue window to any other          protein sequence in the collection                          Identifying pseudogenes and sequencing          artifacts          Probable pseudogenes were identified on the basis of          the presence of a polyA tail at the  end of          corresponding genomic sequences the presence of internal          stop codons or the presence of frameshift mutations          within the catalytic domain The presence of internal          stop codons and frameshift mutations was used to classify          a sequence as a pseudogene only if the feature could be          confirmed in another sequence derived from an independent          cDNA or genomic library or if the original sequence          contained three or more such features in any          aminoacid stretch          Comparison of the levels of synonymous aminoacid          preserving and nonsynonymous aminoacid altering          nucleotide mismatches between hits containing          unverifiable stop codons or frameshift mutations and the          most similar registered EPK was used to identify          additional probable pseudogenes and sequencing artifacts          This was done by comparing the percentage identity of          corresponding regions between the BLASTN nucleotide          versus nucleotide and TBLASTX virtual translation          versus virtual translation alignments If the BLASTN          alignment spanned at least  nucleotides and the          percentage identity in the BLASTN comparison exceeded          that for the corresponding segment of the TBLASTX          comparison by more than  this was taken as evidence          that the protein potentially encoded by the novel          sequence was under less selective pressure than is seen          for known EPK family members and is therefore probably a          pseudogene or sequencing artifact The length and          percentage cutoffs used were determined empirically so          as not to eliminate any well supported EPKs from the          collection                          Aligning catalytic domains and phenogram          construction          The EPK catalytic domains of all the human aminoacid          sequences in the collection were handaligned using the          Wisconsin Package Version    SeqLab alignment          editor Phenograms were constructed from these alignments          on the basis of distance calculations performed by the          Wisconsin Package implementation of the Distances          program The JukesCantor method was used to correct the          distance calculation for possible multiple substitutions          at a single site The resulting distance matrix was used          to construct a phenogram using the neighborjoining          method as implemented by the Wisconsin Package GrowTree          program Only sequences spanning at least  of the          partial alignment were included in the construction of          the tree The Nexus format tree file output by the          GrowTree program was converted into Newick format using          the Tree View program   The Newick format tree file          was then imported into TreeExplorer   which was used          to build the summary dendrogram Figure  by manually          collapsing branches that represented sequence clusters          evident in the phenogram see Additional data files                          Placing partial sequences in the trees          Sequences that were excluded from phenogram          construction because of their short length or high gap          content were added back into the tree guided by          comparison of the partial sequence with the more complete          sequences utilized to construct the tree The fragmentary          sequences appear in the phenogram see Additional data          files in parentheses next to the more complete sequence          to which they share the greatest degree of protein          sequence identity in a residue window This          convention marks the inferred approximate location of the          fragment within the tree but does not assign a branch          length from the sequence fragment to the rest of the          tree                          Crossreferencing to GenBank records          Representative records in GenBank which correspond to          each human EPK were identified by using EPK protein          sequences or virtual translations for BLASTP searches          against the NR division of GenBank and EPK nucleotide          sequences were used for BLASTN search against the NT EST          and HTG divisions of GenBank The BLAST output was          automatically searched for hits that showed  identity          in a residue window Hits meeting this criterion were          associated with the query EPK sequence and placed into          one of three sequence categories protein transcript or          genomic sequence Hits discovered in NR were categorized          protein EST hits were categorized as transcript and HTG          hits were categorized as genomic Whether a particular NT          hit should be categorized as a transcript or genomic          sequence was determined by examining the annotation of          the corresponding GenBank record                          Nomenclature          Names for the EPKs were derived from the FEATURES          table   of GenBank records associated with each EPK          Values associated with the gene qualifiers of the          gene and CDS entries were parsed If no information          could be found in these fields values associated with          the note qualifiers of the gene and CDS entries          were examined for possible names If multiple identifiers          were found associated with the note qualifier the          first one listed was given the highest priority When          naming information was present in multiple records data          were derived from records according to the following          precedence RefSeq NM RefSeq NP other nonXP protein          RefSeq XP nonEST transcripts and finally dbEST          records Nomenclature information was not derived from          genomic sequence records          If no name could be identified for a particular novel          EPK an interim name was assigned on the basis of one of          the associated GenBank accession strings If a reference          transcript record had been associated with the EPK the          accession minus the version number of the reference          transcript was chosen as the interim name for the EPK If          no transcript records were associated with the EPK but a          protein record existed for the EPK the accession of the          protein record was used as the interim name If no          GenBank transcript or protein records were associated          with the sequence the interim name was formed by taking          the accession of the reference genomic record and          appending the suffix EPK This latter convention was          adopted because a genomic record may contain more than          one protein kinase gene or gene fragment in which case          the name of the gene closest to the  end of the          published sequence would bear the suffix EPK the          next would end in EPK and so on In practice it was          never necessary to assign a suffix beyond EPK          Alternative names for the EPKs were retrieved from          LocusLink   and OMIM   records referred to from          GenBank records that had been associated with the EPK          collection

 the source entry of the FEATURES table of each          associated record were retrieved If mapping information          was found in multiple records source precedence was          assigned in the following descending order RefSeq          nucleotide records RefSeq protein records NR protein          records NT mRNA records NT genomic records and HTG          genomic records If multiple records
