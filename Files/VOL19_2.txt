                              Frailty Thy Name Is Bevilacqua            Consider America   Christopher Columbus hadbeen islandhopping in the Caribbean since and had touched foot on the New World mainlandin   But he had set out for Asia and nothingwould convince him that Asia was not where hehad landed  Amerigo Vespucci meanwhile alsolooking for new routes to Asia ran ashore in Brazilin  and realized that something was not rightReturning to Brazil in  he convinced himselfthat Columbus and he had in fact stumbled ontosome continenta New World he called itcompletely unknown to Europeans  He apparentlyinvented a  voyage to make sure he and notColumbus got the credit and started writing lettersannouncing his discovery  Columbus died in still adamant he had been to Asia  But Vespuccisletters hugely impressed others including Germancartographer Martin Waldseemuller who in published the first map to label a depiction of VespuccisNew World America in his honor            Historians have argued for generations aboutwhether Vespuccis  trip was a fib  But they donot seem to have spent much time arguing aboutwhether people should have followed Waldseemullerslead in dubbing the new continent America That may be simply because the name stuck andthere did not seem to be much point  But I think itis also because America sounds so nice because thepure music of Amerigo Vespucci makes up for anylies he might have told  People were lulled by thatmusic into neglecting to notice that in Italian Amerigois simply Henry in English            Think of the power of that peculiarly Italian euphonyHow much patriotism could we instill by requiringour schoolchildren to chant I pledge allegianceto the flag of the United States of HenryWould Walt Whitman have made the canon if he hadwritten I hear Henry singing  And how muchworse would our trade deficit be if General Motorstried to attach the Japanese with a slogan like Itsthe heartbeat of Henry its todays ChevroletStill we should be grateful that Waldseemulleropted for Vespuccis first name for disguising thedull Henry in the voluptuous Amerigo is nothingcompared to what Italians have done over thecenturies when giving each other surnames            Like other Europeans Italians made do withfirst names alone until well into the Middle Ages  Inthe Venetian Republic by the end of the th centurysome people were using fixed secondary namesto distinguish themselves and at least some of thesenames were passed from parents to children  Butoutside Venice Italians did not begin to adopt hereditarysurnames until the th and th centuriesa bit later than most of the rest of Europe accordingto Patrick Hanks and Flavia Hodges authors of theaddictive A Dictionary of Surnames Oxford UniversityPress   As in other European countrieswhat probably sparked the spread of surnames wasthe emergence of larger states that began to centralizetax collecting and other authority            New bureaucratic functionaries now had tokeep track of individuals they might never meet andthey and other namegivers such as priests andother local worthies followed a few simple rules fordistinguishing one Giovanni from another  They indicatedwhere he lived or where he came from GiovanniMontagna  lived on the mountain while GiovanniValle lived in the valley Giovanni Lombardohad his roots in Lombardy while Giovanni Genovesihad his in Genoa  They sorted him by his hair GiovanniBruno was brunette Giovanni Biondi blondeand Giovanni Rossi redheaded while GiovanniRizzo had curly hair  They pointed out his generalaspect Giovanni Piccolo was short Giovanni Macritall Giovanni Magro thin Giovanni Grasso fat  Theynoted his job Giovanni Ferraro made things GiovanniVaccaro herded cows  Or they tacked on thefirst name of his father or grandfather who himselfreflecting Italys tangled history tended to be calledby some version of a Latin ancient Germanicsaints or Old Testament name Giovanni Fabrizioderived his surname from Fabricius Giovanni Alighierifrom Aldiger Giovanni Ciccarelli from Francis and Giovanni Giacobazzi from Jacob   Whether anyname through local preference finally came to endin the masculine o  the feminine a  or the plurals ior e  the root meaning of the name remained thesame            Other Europeans followed the same rules asthe Italians Bruno is essentially the same name asBraun or Brown Piccolo as Klein Magro as Meagherand Maigret Grasso as Gross  and Ferraro as Smith But to the inherent music of their language wouldRigoletto sound the same if we knew Giuseppe Verdias Joseph Green the Italians added somethingmorea game of phonetic theme and variationseemingly unmatched in other countries a gamewhose wild rules allow Francesco to become Franceschiellior Francescuzzi Cesco or Schetti Cicco orZotti Cicconetti or Ciccarelli   Hanks and Hodges listno fewer than  Italian surname forms of GiacoboJacob  for instance and a further  variations ofGiacomo James  itself a New Testament derivativeof Giacobo   A partial list of Giacomo diminutivespet names that translate essentially as littleJimmyis as liquid and intoxicating as SambucaGiacomello Giammelli Iacomelli Comello ComelliniMello Giacometti Giametti Giamitti IacomettiIamitti Cometto Giacomini Iacomini CominelloComini Cominetti Cominotti Cominoli GiacomucciGiacomuzzi

MozzettiComolli Camolli Comoletti Camoletto CommizzoliMizzi Motto Mottini  and Mottinelli             One can easily see from this list that it is thesuffixes ello ino etto ucci uzzi olo ozzo  andtheir variants that allowed Italians to cut James downto size and they have the same effect on any othername  Inflating him was as simple as tacking theaugmentative suffixes one or oni as in Giacomoni tothe root name or its variation to get bigJames            And when another approach seemed called forsome of Jameses neighbors or overlords startedsticking on the pejorative suffixes azzo accioasso  and their variants as in Mazzo and Giacomasso One cannot easily translate these pejorativesuffixes into English they are a malignly ingeniousway of turning an otherwise perfectly inoffensivename into an inherently insulting one of sayingJames  for instance in such a sneering way that noaddon adjectives are needed to convey your obviousbut unspecified disdain  There were times howeverwhen Italians felt a need to be less subtle  Atsuch times they turned with a vengeance to nicknames            Emidio de Felice the maestro of Italian anthroponymyand author of I Cognomi Italiani Bologna Ilmulino  and Dizionario dei Cognomi ItalianiMilano A Mondadori  has estimated that nofewer than  per cent of all Italian surnames havetheir origin in nicknames  Not all these nicknamesare bad  If one is fortunate enough to carry one ofthose Italian names beginning with Bon or Buonbuonogood for example ones value is announcedto all the world the parents of MichelangeloBuonarroti arrota gain from arrogare to acquirethe compound say Hanks and Hodges wasoriginally bestowed when parents welcomed thebirth of a child probably were not surprised that heturned out so well although they might have hadeven higher hopes for his little brother BuonarrotoBuonarroti   Names beginning with Bel or Bellobellobeautiful are also historical gifts someonecalled Bellofatto fatto made put together probablyhas ancestors that were a goodlooking lot  Likewisethe original Onestis were usually honest andBevilacquas bevi drink acqua water usually soberwhile Amantis amante lover usually exhibiteda form of spiritual love that made them seem saintlyand Santillis santo sainted Salvos salvare tosave Carideos cari dear deo god and Donadiosdona given dio god usually had special relationshipswith their maker            But notice that I say usually  Hanks andHodges and de Felice say that most of these nicknamescould also be bestowed ironically  SomeBevilacquas drank even less water than their winelovingneighbors  Bevivinos may have been evenmore intemperate the spiritual love of some Amantiswas directed toward women other than theirwives and the patronymic form DAmanti given tothe children of such unions some Santillis and Salvoswere notably profane and some Carideos andDonadios were assumed to be dear to or given byGod because no one else stepped forward to explainhow they came to be left on the steps of convents ormonasteries            There is a whole class of Italian surnames thatwere given to foundlings including variations ofTrovato trovato past participle of trovare to findtrovatello foundling Proietto proietto ejected orrejected Innocenti  and Nocenti given to all childrentaken into Florences Spedale degli Innocentiorphanage the name was also given to those whowere innocent of evil or simpleminded Ignoto ignoto unknown and Esposito or Sposito espostoexposed which de Felice has found to be the mostcommon name in Naples            No sense of irony is needed to appreciate thename Malfatto male badly fatto made put togetherhowever or the names Gobbi  gobbo hunchback Porcelli piglets Boccioni boccamouth plus the augmentative suffix yielding bigmouth Capostagno capo head stagno tin Sozzifrom the Sicilian sozzu filthy or Moccio snot orslime  Not all of these surnames are terribly commonbut they are all real appearing in telephonebooks in the US England and Italy  Some insultsare more common than others  According to de Felicesextensive studies of phone books and other recordsmuch of his research is financed by SEAT Italys telephone service the most common of allsurnames in Calabria is Rotundo  which meansobese  Whether the food in thcentury Calabriawas especially filling or its wellfed citizens tendedto be more prolific than their thinner neighbors isnot clear            Although insulting nicknames form a small fractionof the Italian surname pool chances are thatanyone who knows any Italians has participated inthis ancient slangingmatch  I myself have knownpeople named Busa  which in Salvatore BattagliasGrande Dizionario Della Lingua Italiana the Italianequivalent of the Oxford English Dictionary is definedas il sterco bovino literally cow dung  Iwent to high schoola small school with only a minorityof Italianswith a girl named Pochintesta poco little in in testa head another namedZucchi a plural form of zucca squash or colloquiallyhead Hanks and Hodges say this name wasoften given to a person of scarce intelligence asin pumpkinhead one boy named Chiappa buttockand another named Chiappinelli which maybe either an extended diminutive of Chiappa or thediminutive of chiappino  which Battaglia defines as atype of ape            Even my own family has not escaped  Mygrandmothers family the Gannuscios  have longknown that some distant relatives spell the nameCannuscio the softening of hard c to hard g beingvery common as words move across Italys myriaddialects  What no one ever told me is that Cannusciois very possibly the same word as cannuccio  thesoftening of cci pronounced chee to sci pronouncedshee being also common  Battagliasdefinition for cannuccio  Membro genitale  Youcan translate it yourself            Insulting surnames generally fall into a fewbroad categories  One of the largest describes physicaland mental defects  Someone with a limp waslikely to be called some variation of Zoppo lameTorti  or Storti torto twisted Gamba or Gambaccinigamba leg or Ciampa ciampare to stumbleOne who stammered or had some otherspeech defect might be Tartaglia tartagliare tostutter Cianciulli cianciugliare to mutter Sannellasanna is an archaic form of zanna tusk orMezzalingua  mezza half lingua tongue  If onewas hard of hearing or refused good advice thename Sordo or La Sorda sordo deaf might be applieda person with neuromuscular disorders mightbe called Tremitiedi  tremito bodily tremblingThe person perennially under the weather or perhapsjust lazy might be Fiacco feeble or Stanchistanco tired while mental impairment earned thename Imbrogno imbrogliare to confuse Moscaincervello mosca fly in in cervello brain orInfante Fantazzi  or Fanciullo infante infant orsomeone of childish intellect  One who squinted orwas missing an eye was called Berlusco dialect for aperson with a squint or some variation of Occhiocchio eye  And demonstrating that in the realmof insults some things never change one who woreglasses became Quattrocchi foureyes            The animal kingdom provided a rich sourceGallos gallo cock or rooster either sang well orhad active sexual lives Gazzas and Gazzanis gazzamagpie and Malpighis  male bad piga a dialectword for magpie made a habit of gossiping or collectingthings and many Calendris and Calandrinos calandra lark were so named because people believedlarks to be remarkably witless  Quaglieris quaglia quail were quail hunters  But Quagliasand Quaglinos were either easily frightened lecherousor fat characteristics that reminded people ofthe bird  Some Tassos  tasso yew tree anvil orbadger made their homes near an arboreal landmarkor were ironworkers but others tended tosneak

irritating were eitherZampaglione the Calabrian word for mosquito orMosca fly Moscone bluebottle fly or some variantincluding Mussolini  which as we have seencould be a diminutive of Giacomo             Another group of namesa group Hanks andHodges call imperative surnames or names formedby the joining of a verbstem and a noundisplaysan especially playful method of Italian scurrilityOne lacking in imagination could use Povero pooror Scarso scarce to name a pauper or a miser  Butsomeone with more linguistic flair could use the imperativeto bestow the name Mangiacotti  mangiareto eat cotti bricks  Baro or Barro  baro cheatwas the boring option for christening thieves moreinteresting choices included Mangiavacchi vacchi aplural of vacca cow Mangiagalli  gallo roosteror Fumagalli  fumare to smoke de Felice says thatsuch thieves would smoke the chickenkeeper out toget his charges  Indelicato indelicate unscrupulousor Inganni  inganno deceit would do if onewas not to be trusted but Tagliavini  tagliare tocut vino wine in other words one who wouldstoop to adulterating wine had a certain extrapunch  For those who made ends meet by spongingmeals Mangiapane  pane bread filled the bill            Another group of names falls into the eitherorcategory in which a wellresearched onomastichistory could consign a family to either comfortingaverageness or ignominy  In the case of Licciardoand such variants as Licciardello  for instance thefamilys honor depends on whether its origins areNorthern or Southern  Northern Italian Licciardoscan feel at home with all the other Rizzardos Riccardinis and Ciardos they are just RicciardosRichard whose initial R has been transformed bydialect to L Southern Licciardos  however have tomake do with the company of Rotundos Grassos and Faucis  fauci gullet their surname comes fromthe French dialect word lichard glutton                           Fazio  another case of eitheror can be a shorteningof the first name Bonifazio  which means goodfate and which has been popular in Italy owing bothto its meaning and to the fact that it was borne by anumber of saints and popes  Yet fazio also meanssimpleton  The explanation for this coincidencemay lie in the Italian expression esser Fra Fazio tobe Brother or Friar Fazio a colloquialism for togive away money  This probably alludes either tothe generosity of some Saint Bonifazio or to theprofligacy of Pope Boniface VI  In any case it ishard not to make the connection that a Fazio and hismoney were soon parted            While it seems likely that fazio the noun as wellas Fazio the name descend from an otherwise benigneven auspicious name the history of othernames is not so easy to untangle  Schettino  for instancecan be a diminutive of Francesco  but it alsotranslates as careless  Likewise Pazzo may haveoriginally been hacked off the end of Giacopazzo  apejorative form of Jacob  but it also means lunaticAnd although the ancestors of some Puzzos mighthave lived near a well  puzza dialect for pozzo wellor fountain the forebears of others may havesmelled like a sewer  puzzo stench  It is not clearwhether the two possible connotations for SchettinoPazzo  or Puzzo are related as in the case of Fazio  orentirely accidental  But it does provoke the questionDo Italians actually think stench when theymeet a Puzzo or pumpkinhead when they meet aZucchi  Did Oriana Fallacis first editors questionthe veracity of her reporting   Fallace fallaciousDid the actors in the young Federico Fellinis filmswonder if he would honor their contracts   Fellinicomes from fello wicked or rascally  And is thewholesome image of Annette Funicello spoiled forItalian mouseketeers who know about the tormentodei funicelli  or torture of the packthreads inwhich thcentury Neopolitans painfully lashed togetherthe wrists and forearms of their prisoners            Or do they too like nonItalians succumb tothe music of these names and neglect to registertheir meaning  That is my guess  Italians are not theonly ones to live with the burden of insulting surnamesof course  But it seems likely that the melodicrise and fall of say Licciardello can deceivethe ear in a way thatjust for an exampleits Germanequivalent Schlick Middle High German togulp simply cannot  Schneck snail slow workersounds like an insult Zoccadelli nickname for astumpy slow worker does not            Which brings me back to Martin Waldseemullerand Amerigo Vespucci and why we should givethanks that the German fell under the spell of theItalians first name rather than his last  Where doesVespucci come from  It is the diminutive form ofvespa wasp and was a nickname given to particularlyilltempered individuals  My fellow Henryansdoes not sound so bad after all                              While he was alive

aware that there aresome special hazards on the fairway to wit the handlingof proverbs            Like many sports it can be both entertainingand frustrating at the same time  English speakerscommand the necessary vocabulary and grammar totranslate the words of a proverb but they cannot besure that the end product will be meaningful in thetarget language  For example how does one say Abird in the hand is worth two in the bush in FrenchA literal translation would be Un oiseau dans lamain vaut deux dans le buisson  But the Frenchequivalent or near equivalent is actually Un oiseaudans la main vaut deux dans la haie  A bird in thehand is worth two in the hedge  More to the pointto express this particular truism the French are morelikely to say something quite different Un tiensvaut mieux que deux tu lauras One hereyouareis worth more than two youllgetits             How about German  There the equivalent isBesser ein Spatz in der Hand als eine Taube auf demDach  Better a sparrow in the hand than a dove onthe roof  A finer distinction not just one bird fortwo but a lowly bird instead of a lofty one            Ornithological differences exist elsewhere tooHere is the Russian He  otherwise Dont promise a crane inthe sky give me a tit in the hand  A similar littlegreat lowhigh distinctionthat is birds that arenot exactly of a feather            Spanish  Ms vale pjaro en mano que ciento volando Better a bird in the hand than a hundred flyingAgain not quite the same as the English            So appreciating that differences exist from theslight to the complete let us look at some more proverbialequivalents and see if any generalizationscan be drawn regarding their formation or the hometruths they express  To save space the following abbreviationsare used for languages quoted F  French G  German R  RussianS  Spanish  Other languages are spelled out                           Better late than never F Mieux vaut tard quejamais  G Besser spat als nie  R S Ms vale tarde que nunca   All exactlythe same  So it can be done thank goodness                           Birds of a feather flock together Better proceedwith caution here could be tricky  F Qui se ressemblesassemble Those who resemble one anothergather together G Gleich und gleich geselltsich gern Like and like keep ready company R A fisherman sees a fisherman from afar SCada oveja con su parejaEach sheep with its pair  Here we have a differenceevery time and a range from the French andGerman generality to the various birds and beasts ofthe other languages  But at least almost all the proverbsincorporate a pleasant rhyme making themmore memorable while the German nicely alliteratesThe Russian too suggests an English alternativeit takes one to know one                            Dont count your chickens before they arehatched F                Il ne faut pas vendre la peau de loursavant de lavoir tu You should not sell the skin ofthe bear before you have killed him G Man solldie Haut nicht verkaufen ehe man den Brengefangen hat You should not sell the skin before youhave caught the bear R He Not having killed the bear do not sellthe skin S No vendas la piel del oso antes dematarlo Dont sell the skin of the bear before youhave killed him  The conclusion to be drawn here issomething of a zoological or at any rate ethnic naturethe bear is far more familiar in continental Europethan in insular Britain  Indeed he is still foundthere  We are talking about the brown bear Ursusarctos  not the black bear of North AmericaEuarctos americanus  although that animal is seldomencountered in much of the United States  Moreoverto Germans and Russians at least the bear isboth a valuable beast for his hide and meat and asymbolic one standing for strength and power  Butthe bear has long ceased to be a wild denizen ofBritain so the British prefer to express the platitudethat one should not promise something one may notbe able to come up with            On some beasts however the five languagescan more or less agree Dont look a gift horse in themouth F  cheval donn on ne regarde pax auxdents  G Einem geschenkten Gaul sieht man nichtins Maul R  S A caballo regalado no sele mira el diente   TheGerman once again has the agreeable rhyme            Encouraged we proceed to a change of subjectA new broom sweeps clean F Il nest rien de tel quebalai neuf There

thephilosophical generality of the French and Germanswith the stoical stance of the Spanish and the morecolorful imagery of the Russians  English speakerstoo have an equally vivid turn of phrase althoughcome to think of it who is likely to shed real tearsover an overturned milkjug  Yes that is the image Ihave too  But the source of the English proverb liesnot in teaparties but in teats it is the cow who haskicked the bucket and the poor dairymaid whoweeps over her lost labor            A pattern is already emerging of varying traditionsand differing national identities the Englishmaid mourns the milk but the Russian woodmancannot alter the written word hack and hew henever so well  On the other hand many lands seethe world with a single eye a new broom doessweep better than one with wornout bristles            Sometimes one needs to name the right namesin the search for an equivalent proverb                           Rome was not built in a day F Paris nest pasfait en un jour  G Rom is nicht an einem Tageerbaut  R  S No segan Zamora en una hora   German agrees with Englishhere but other countries choose their own citiesThe Spanish pick not their capital however butancient Zamora famous for its stand against the invadingMoors in the th century  The actual senseis Zamora was not conquered in an hour  It is fairto say though that a Spaniard might equally sidewith the Germans and English speakers and moregenerally add ni Roma se fund luego toda norRome built in one go  And although a Pole mightpatriotically declare Nie od razu Krakw zbudowanonot Warsaw you notice he too could well prefer tothrow in his lot with the Romans Nie Jednego Rzymzbudowano roku             Talking of Romans one should bear in mind thatalmost all proverbs however modern however nationalisticwill have had a Latin original or prototypeThe eight English proverbs cited above thushave respective equivalents as follows Plus valetmanibus passer quam sub dubio grus It is better tohave a sparrow in the hand than a crane in doubtSero quam nunquam melius Better late than neverliterally Late than never better Sic fuit est et eritsimilis similem sibi quaerit Thus it was is

negative equivalent to the English positiveWhat is done cannot be undone as an alternativeto the spilt milk Roma non fuit una die condita butof course of course            So when seeking a foreign

to be usedmetaphorically by speakers and writers who like toflaunt that sort of thing  It now designates a suddenspectacular extensive change in a program or policyor processa major breakthrough or somethingalong that line  But long before the physicists gothold of quantum it was used by ordinary writersThe OED reports that quantum from the Latinquantus how much how great has been used inEnglish

very small change but nevertheless asignificant one  Despite the illogical element in thepopular metaphorical use of the phrase it doesseem to have become firmly imbedded in currentdiscourse  But perhaps it has already become whatFowler called a battered ornament            While reading about quantum in the OED Supplement I noticed the preceding word quantophrenia which is defined as A term

Ambrose Bierce observed in oneof his newspaper columns is a merely human affairand will occasionally cut its capers            Such humor or whimsy tends in Johnsons workat any rate to be of a fairly

Although Freud so far as I know did not discussSpoonerisms on his classic analysis of slipsofthetonguehis theories as to the psychoanalytic implicationsof transposed sounds such as those attributedto Rev Spooner could have been usefully added toLearn To Spike Lunars  XVIII   by Robert ArchibaldFord  Let me suggest two examples            Spooners most widely quoted slip was his firmannouncement to a student You have hissed mymystery lecture  The conventional response to thisamusing transposition is A funny jab at a recalcitrantpupil  However Freud I am sure wouldhave stressed how the slip reveals anxieties that alllecturers including Rev Spooner harbor about addressingan audience  For example hissedmylecture clearly reflects a reality that few professorsare willing to voice that their gems of wisdom arenot universally praisedin fact are sometimes denouncedusually in private as platitudinous andsimplistic  In like fashion my mystery lecture exposesthe unconscious fear of obfuscation turgidityand other obstacles to clarity on the part of thespeaker  In both of these instances Freud would arguethat Spooner merely voiced what has long beenrepressed in Academe            Another case Television reporter Roger Muddin his early days as a radio announcer was calledupon to present an update on the ill health of thePope  The announcement came out as The conditionof Pipe Pois grows steadily worse  Mudd roaringwith laughter immediately blanked out thesound  Back in control he meant to say ThePopes doctor has summoned to the Vatican a Swissspecialist but this to Mudds chagrin came out asThe Popes doctor has summoned to the Vatican aSwish specialist            If Freud had had his say on the significance ofthis Spoonerism he would probably have assumedthat Mudd unconsciously voiced not only his unspokendisrespect for the Pope but also gave vent to theuniversally repressed notion that it is conceivablethat a Pope could be a homosexual            I am not suggesting that all the fun should betaken out of Spoonerisms but when transposedsounds reveal profound universal anxieties thenperhaps we should go beyond merely enjoying agood laugh                              I

            Philip Weinbergs EPISTOLA  XVIII  regardingthe Russian word for railroad station in BrysonsEnglish KnowHow No Problem  XVIII  deservesa comment While loan words often undergovast changes in meaning when introduced into a newlanguage the change from the whole to one of atleast two of its parts assuming there would havebeen a First Class waiting room for a Volksaal  sic  tomake sense in this case seemed too farfetchedAnd phonetically Volk  which has an initial fsoundseemed too removed from vag  to applyIndeed Langenscheidts RussianGerman Pocket Dictionaryhas the entry folklor which reflects thesound correctly the letter l has a soft sign after itmeaning Volkskunst or folklore  The dictionaryalso gives vokzal stressed on the second syllable asBahnhof or railroad station  It turns out thenthat Brysons rendering of the word in his articlevagzal is the phonetic spelling rather than the transcriptionof the word            Although zal is Russian for Saal large roomthe Volk  part is very implausible  On the otherhand the V au sound and x in Vauxhall are satisfactorilyrepresented by the VOKS sequence so that theetymology given by Bryson appears to be preferable                              Further to voksal Russian for railway stationalthoughnot to its etymology  In the earlys before overflight and satellite programs hadbeen developed the CIA included amongst its collectionprograms one of briefing selected travelersto the Soviet Union and debriefing them on theirreturn  These were not recruited agents simplyassets            There were numbers of factories and other installationsto which no access was possible whichwere encapsulated in small triangles or sometimesrectangles formed by the nearest roads and railroadsBy carefully briefing an observer who was totravel that road or rail line as to the beginning andend of the bounding segment and having him make acount a count of electrical water or gas lines crossingthe stretch and of side roads rail spurs and thelike it was possible after all three legs had beentraversed by observers for analysts to make surprisinglyaccurate estimates of the size and significanceeventhe natureof the targeted installation            One mysterious factory was enclosed by twopublic roads and a rail line little used by foreignerson which the only scheduled train passed the requiredcheckpoints in the dead of night  The roadswere no problem but it took a year to find an Americanbusinessman with an excuse to travel that raillineand he spoke no Russian  He was howevertaught the Cyrillic alphabet and could transcribesigns            On his return he reported phenomenal luckThere had been a lengthy unscheduled stop at asmall station at  am thanks to a hot box andthe passengers had been allowed off the train tostretch their legs  He had wandered several hundredyards up the line where he had found crossing it alarge cluster of transmission lines an oil line assortedpiping and a bridge with even at that hourheavy truck traffic  He was not quite sure all thiswas within the specified stretch of track as it waspitch black and the best we had been able to givehim was an estimate of the times the train wouldenter and leave the segment  But he made a carefulcount of everything and copied down the name ofthe town from the sign on the station platform            What was it  we asked eagerly            Voksal he proudly replied                              In my upcoming Greek Tragedies I often referto the Chorus  The problem is whether or not toconsider the noun singular  That depends  In somecontexts the Chorus is thought of as a unit as it is inthis very sentence  We would not say The Chorusare thought of as a unit  But there are times whenthe noun seems to cry out for a plural verbThe Chorus enter shortly after almost in panic atthe threatened attack by Polyneices                        The word panic at least to me suggests individualreactions  Members panic  Collective nouns do notSometimes the distinction is almost metaphysical            The following classic pair of sentences makesthe point more unequivocallyMy family is going to California this summerDons family are taking separate vacations                        I wish my Chorus contexts were as easy to decide                              The review of the new Random House WebsterDictionary  XVIII  gave space to the matter of inconsistenthyphenation which I appreciated and Ialso agreed with the reviewers comments regardingthe admittance of socalled naughty bits into thedictionary  But I was surprised upon reading Timesreview of this dictionary June   to realizethat there were issues raised there that were nottouched upon in VERBATIM  I wish attention hadbeen given to these rather than some of those towhich space was devoted ones I consider of lessconsequence such as the use of the name Websterthe dating of words such as ordinals and the cost ofthe dictionary in perword termsand the cost ofcollege dictionaries in general  While each of thesesubjects is of interest they pale in comparison to thecentral issued raised in the Time review namely ofwhether a dictionary is better simply because it hasmore words in it words which are included if only tomirror the language of the moment eg womyn pl  herstory waitron and Mirandize             In short just because a new word has beencoined does not mandate its publication in dictionariesin the frequency to which we have become victimover the past thirtyodd years  I have no statisticsto back me up but it is my impression that asthe rate of publication of English dictionaries has increasedover the past few decades the fabrication ofnew words has similarly increased  A kind of ParkinsonsLaw may be in effect here words will increasein number to occupy the pages publishers are willingto print  Meanwhile can we not say that accurateuse of the language has declined both in themeaning of words and in their syntax  Or put anotherway have we not become too lazy to lookthings up in the dictionary and too prone instead tomake up another word in place of the one we haveforgotten or never learned in the first place            I would like to think that a college dictionary isbest which is easy to use because it answers basicquestions about commonly used vocabulary spellingpronounciation meaning part of speech synonymand antonym  Perhaps because it probablyserves most students as the single source for suchmatters it should also include those addenda whichin Websters th consume  pages eg a list ofabbreviations a gazetteer etc  However let it becomecluttered with etymologies essays and vocabularythat I think belong in more encyclopedictomes and published at less frequent intervals andthe result is a cumbersome volume that I for onewould not be inclined to use as the handy referencea college dictionary implies            Would a lexicographer agree                              I have been entertained by the discussions ofcomputerized hyphenation  XVI  XVII   Thereis no one alive who is more enthusiastic about computersthan I  For one thing I make my living bymanipulating words on them  Whether it is right toabandon any part of the creative process to themhowever is another            And creativity is indeed involved in hyphenationnotin recognizing rules and conventions andexceptions but rather in deciding whether andhow to apply those rules conventions and exceptions            The decision is often aesthetic which is wherecomputers are useless  One may hyphenate butshould one  No hyphenation algorithm has been inventedto control rivers of white space nor to distinguishbetween project verb and project noununless one is Canadian            Someday however even that may change  Afterall it has been  years since the early days of computerizedtypesetting that Ive seen anything to comparewith the single article about sexual dysfunctionin a newspaper in Virginia that contained these twoalgorithmdriven hyphenations therapist andmolester                              In OBITER DICTA  XVIII   you remark thatolder has come to mean in certain contexts at leastless old than old  I have another example well establishedalthough not part of the vernacular of acomparative gone into reverse  Realestate firmsand agents around here routinely use newer on writtenhouse descriptions to mean recent but not newFor fear of litigation the companies use new only ifthe roof carpet or whatever was replaced at thetime of listing  Even recent is avoided because it isthought to imply something newer than newerwhereas a furnace up to two years old can safely bedescribed as newer   Customers sometimes inquireabout the word and laugh when it is translated it isconfined to print and may be considered an encapsulatedpiece of realestate trade jargon without thecurrency of your older                               As an adjunct to your article on PC PoliticallyCorrect Nomenclature

Over the years and especially recently in connectionwith the publication of the vast Omni Gazetteerof the United States of America Omnigraphics  XVIII   contributors have commented onthe curious and funny names one can find in almostany listing of place names  I have seen no criticismhowever of the total lack of imagination evident inthe naming of many roads avenues boulevardsstreets etc  On a recent expedition by car I noted alarge number of roads with names like P Avenue QAvenue and the like and everyone is familiar withthe street names in Washington DC  that reflect thesame sort of thing            One can easily understand the desire of thecommittees responsible for such things to numberstreets then designate house numbers in such a waythat strangers can readily get the idea that rd Street is on rd Street near th Avenueand I can find nothing to quarrel with in that practiceAlso the simple system used in New York Cityfor numbering streets and most avenues aboveWashington Square makes sense as anyone who hasbeen to Paris London or any other old Europeancity might agree            But surely there are more interesting ways inwhich streets can be named  For example theycould be named after American or foreign citiesAmerican states constellations foreign countriesAmerican and foreign statesmen famous operas operasingers composers works of fiction music andart novelists poets and other writers artists charactersin fiction or mythology trees flowers animalsetc the supply is almost inexhaustibleMoreover if it is deemed advisable to have thenames in alphabetical order to make it easy to find agiven street it would be a simple matter to put KarachiStreet between Istanbul and Lisbon StreetsBach Boulevard between Jerusalem and CoplandBoulevards followed by Debussy   If the inhabitantsare predominantly of a particularly ethnic stockthey might like to commemorate Italian paintersSpanish poets or Greek playwrights if they are of aclassical bent they can find names of importantworks of Latin and Greek literature on the otherhand if they like modern music they can name theirstreets after rock groups or stars  The procedurewould require a little research in the library butthat would not be onerous            One of the problems with existing names is thatthey can be misleading or ambiguous Sound ViewDrive for instance has not afforded a view of theSound since all those houses were built in the sWas Bank Street named after someone named Bankbecause it was near the bank of a river which hasnow been moved three blocks away because theland was filled in because the town bank was onceon it or because it was where they used to bankfires  How many Sunrise Highways and Sunset Boulevardsare there  It is not suggested that wellestablishedtraditional names be changed only thatboring names be replaced by interesting ones  Onewould expect that a certain amount of commonsense be exercised Palm Drive and BougainvilleaBoulevard would be as out of place in Massachusettsas Yucca Lane with the devastation wrought byDutch elm disease one might consider renaming allthe streets in America named Elm Street to describea hardier species  An office with which I have occasionto do business is at  Elm Street OldSaybrook Connecticut and I cannot help feelingthat Freddie lurks there ready to strike down theunwary  But then although I formerly owned ahouse in Essex Connecticut where the film LetsScare Jessica to Death was made I have survived thatperil  In this vein I do not advocate naming a streetBubo Boulevard or Plague Place   In Bridgeport ConnecticutI have seen a Lesbia Street  which arouses allsorts of untoward speculation            Obviously one must be careful few peoplewould want to have to say that they live on HyenaHighway or Anteater Avenue or Vulture Drive butCoyote Canyon Drive offers some alliteration ChipmunkWay sounds cute and who could object toRaccoon Road  The road leading to Laurel Heightswhere the editorial

ago or so when the town ofOld Lyme rebuilt it widened it paved it and providedit with drainage it is now in such good conditionthat I have suggested that the name be changedto Boggy Hole Boulevard an idea that has not foundmuch favor at the town hall  Boggy Hole Road it willprobably remain even though the name is provingexpensive to maintain owing to the frequency withwhich its one identifying

 How DARE You                                       Katie Bar the Door                        This old exclamation probably dating centuriesback had a sudden vogue in the late eighties andearly nineties when the sports fraternity latched onto it and spread it everywhere through radio andtelevision  The best translation I have heard isWatch out  Hells about to break loose  It will suita lot of occasions domestic political military and ofcourse those critical moments in sports  It meansthreat and tension beyond that nobody seems tocare  Katie bar the door  But where does it comefrom  Like many longago happenings nobodythought to make a permanent record  Those whoknew the storyin this case a heroic onehad noway to keep it in memory except by folk tales andsongs  But these may not get written down and thetellers and singers may have no successors  So greatdeeds of the past are ultimately forgotten the remnantsdistorted or no longer understood  Who wasKatie  When why how did she bar the door  Thefollowing tale is pieced together from obscure andscanty sources with some logical surmise            King James I of Scotland a strong man whodrew a number of chieftains together under himstrengthening the kingdom  naturally aroused rivalryand enmity which led at last to his assassinationin   This was accomplished in an outbuildingto which the King had retired with members ofhis court for recreation  The assassination had beencarefully planned the bar had been removed fromthe door and when the murderers attacked it couldnot be found  One of the guests by legend LadyKatherine Douglas thrust her arm through thestaples where the bar should have been and temporarilykept the door shut  The King took refuge in alower room but ironically the outer door had beenrecently sealed by his order  The Ladys arm wasbroken the murderers rushed in the King defendedhimself but was outnumbered and killed  But theladys heroic deed was told and sung she becameKate Barlassthe lass who barred the door  Thatis the legend but I have found no written record ofthe song nor anyone who can sing it  Katie bar thedoor must have been a refrain or a line of verseWe may guess that as the Kings company realizedthey were under attack the men looked to theirswords and one of the other ladies shouted to Katiewho finding that the bar was not there did the bestshe could think to do  A noble woman and a nobledeed  And the shout became a dire warning of imminentdanger            The last part of the tale  Katie and her storymust surely have been brought to America and sungin some of the Scottish settlements in Appalachiamade mostly in the th century  Many of these oldballads have survived to the present this one as weput it together must at least have made current thewarning Katie bar the door  And out of the hillssome hillborn singer coming north introduced itthere perhaps directly into the world of sports andsportscasting  But nobody has written down thefacts or if written they lie hidden in obscure placesAnd historians of language lexicographers need recordstoo  Is it now too late to track our surmisesback to facts to recover the missing pieces of Katiesstory  The Dictionary of
