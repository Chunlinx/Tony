                    Background        The factors responsible for the agerelated incidence of        postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS are unknown        Clinical data indicate that the peak incidence of HUS        occurs around two years of age but the disease clearly        occurs in significant numbers of older children            Populationbased studies suggest that there is a decline in        the incidence of HUS from a peak at age  years until a        nadir at about age  years      In addition a        casecontrol study of the Washington State outbreak of HUS        revealed that the mean age of patients with HUS was         years while the mean age of patients without HUS was         years     These studies raise the possibility        therefore that the appearance or disappearance of a factor        or factors in adolescents and adults reduces susceptibility        to endorgan injury in HUS        HUS is thought to be due at least in large part to        Shiga toxin Stxmediated cell toxicity     Since the        kidney is a primary target of Stx in patients with HUS it        has been hypothesized that the preferential renal injury        occurring in children with HUS is related to heightened        renal susceptibility to Stx in this age group Such        increased renal sensitivity to Stx in children if it does        indeed exist could be due to a wide variety of factors        One immediately apparent factor that has been examined is        agerelated alterations in renal Stx binding and Stx        receptor galactose galactose        glucoseceramide Gb expression An autopsy study        determined that total kidney Gb levels were lower in        infants than in adults although only two individuals under         years of age were examined     Another study using        immunostaining of biopsy samples found that glomeruli from        infants under two years of age but not from older        children or adults bound Stx     This provocative        finding albeit involving a relatively small sample size        and patients who often had glomerulopathies provided a        potential explanation for augmented glomerular Stx        sensitivity in young children Confirmation of these        observations is needed however they do suggest that Gb        levels and in particular the pattern of renal Gb        expression may be a factor in the agerelated incidence of        renal injury in HUS        The decreased incidence of HUS renal disease in        adolescents and adults raises the possibility that factors        associated with puberty may be involved There have been no        studies to our knowledge that have examined the effects        of pubertyrelated hormonal alterations on renal cell        sensitivity to Stx Indeed there is no information        whatsoever on how any sex steroid affects Stx        responsiveness of any cell type It seemed reasonable        therefore to examine whether sex steroids estrogen        progesterone and testosterone could modify the cytotoxic        effect of Stx on renal cells Further since Gb levels may        be altered with aging the effect of sex steroids on renal        cell Gb expression was examined        Several renal cell types have been demonstrated to        respond to Stx Based on histologic evidence glomerular        endothelial cells have been invoked as being primarily        involved in HUS renal injury     In vitro studies have        demonstrated that human glomerular endothelial cells HGEN        bind Stx and are modestly sensitive to the toxins        cytotoxic effect     Recent work indicates that other        renal cell types may be Stx targets in HUS cultured human        proximal tubule HPT    and human visceral glomerular        epithelial HGEC    cells express abundant amounts of        Gb and are highly sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of        Stx Consequently the current study examined the effect        of sex steroids on Stx cytotoxicity on and Gb        expression by HGEN HGEC and HPT                    Methods                  Cell culture          Primary cultures of HPT were obtained from Clonetics          San Diego CA and studied at the third passage The          identity and purity of these cultures was established by          immunofluorescent staining as previously described             in addition to the extensive characterization by          Clonetics we have determined that these cells lack von          Willebrand factor and platelet endothelial cell adhesion          molecules PECAM

dropped  decrease Consequently fresh        progesterone was added to the  day experiments every two        days        The failure of steroids to affect Stx cytotoxicity was        not due to inactivity of the steroid preparations Similar        preparations and concentrations of steroids from the same        supplier Sigma were tested by Dr Wayne Meikle in the        Division of Endocrinology at the University of Utah using        an inhouse estrogen and progesterone binding assay and a        testosteronedependent stimulation of prostate cancer cell        apoptosis assay     all the steroids retained biologic        activity data not shown                    Discussion and Conclusion        The reasons why HUS primarily affects children are        unknown It is evident that the peak incidence of HUS        occurs in very young children  years of age The        factors responsible for this apparent heightened        sensitivity to infection with Stxexpressing bacteria have        not been extensively investigated and were not examined in        the current study Indeed it is conceivable that not all        of the factors involved in HUS occurrence in young children        are identical to those involved in the diminished HUS        incidence in adolescents and adults Numerous factors could        be involved in agerelated Stx sensitivity including        differences in the degree of enteric invasion by        Stxproducing         E coli  in Stx transport across the        gut in circulating red or white blood cell toxin binding        and delivery to the kidney in the immune response to Stx        in renal Stx binding andor in intrinsic or        cofactorregulated eg inflammatory cytokines renal Stx        responsiveness The current study evaluated one of these        possibilities namely that renal cell Stx responsiveness        decreases with age due at least partially to hormonal        changes associated with puberty As stated earlier there        is no precedent in the literature for examination of the        effect of sex steroids on Stx responsiveness however the        coincidental fall in clinically apparent HUS in adolescents        and adults    raises the possibility that hormonal        changes associated with puberty induce a relatively        Stxresistant state in the kidney        HGEN HGEC and HPT were chosen for examination in this        study because these cell types at least         in vitro  have been shown to be        injured by Stx       Mesangial cells were not        examined since Stx has not been demonstrated to affect        their viability     Previous studies have separately        examined the cytotoxic effect of Stx on HGEN     HGEC            and HPT     however this is the first study to        directly compare Stx sensitivity of these renal cell        types These data indicate that as suggested from the        previous studies within the limits of the cell culture        system HPT are the most sensitive to Stx cytotoxicity of        the three cell types HGEC are slightly less sensitive and        HGEN are at least three orders of magnitude less sensitive        than either HGEC or HPT Such differential sensitivity is        quite interesting particularly considering that glomerular        endothelial cell damage is a prominent histologic feature        in biopsies obtained from patients with clinically well        established HUS     The significance of these        observations remains therefore to be determined Although        speculative it is tempting to propose that HPT and HGEC        may be early targets of Stx and that this could play a        role in the pathophysiologic processes that characterize        renal injury in HUS        Estrogen progesterone or testosterone did not affect        Stx mediated renal cell cytotoxicity or Gb expression        Cells were exposed to the steroids for up to one week in        order to allow time for steroidregulated gene        transcription and protein expression In addition both        physiologic and pharmacologic concentrations of steroids        were utilized Despite these efforts to be insure that the        system was optimized in order to detect a steroidmediated        alteration of Stx responsiveness the concern still exists        that this system may not really reflect the influences of        sex steroids in vivo Indeed one might argue that an        animal model in which the testes or ovaries are removed        and the animals are given Stx in the presence and absence        of steroid replacement would be better Such studies        would however be problematic Traditional animal models        such as mice rats rabbits or pigs do not develop typical        renal disease when given either Stx or         E coli H     Further        animal models that most closely reflect human HUS are only        in the early stages of development     Hence the cell        culture system remains the most reasonable means to assess        an effect of sex steroids on renal cell Stx        responsiveness such systems have clearly been demonstrated        to be responsive to sex steroids eg        testosteroneregulated KAP promoter activity in proximal        tubule cells    as well as estrogenregulated        endothelial cell function     Given these        limitations our data suggest that sex steroids do not        alter renal cell sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of        this Stx Consequently the reasons why clinically        apparent HUS primarily occurs in children remains to be        determined                    List of Abbreviations        HUS hemolyticuremic syndrome        HGEN human glomerular endothelial cells        HGEC
