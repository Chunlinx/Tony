                                 Folie             People with high IQs tend tobe nearsighted This is not because they read a lot or stare at computerscreens too much That commonsense hypothesis has been discredited byresearch Rather it is a matter of genetics The same genes that tend toelevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads tomyopia This relationshipknown in genetics as pleiotropyseems to becompletely accidental a quirk of evolution            Couldthere be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics Reading thisabsolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar an economics writer for theNew York Times  I began to wonder Its subject John Nash is amathematical genius who went crazy at the age of  and then after severaldecades of flamboyant lunacy was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics forsomething he had discovered as a graduate student He is now about to turn Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line ofmathematiciansstretching back to that morbid paranoiac Isaac Newtonwhohave been certifiably insane during parts of their lives            Just in the last  years or so most of the heroicfigures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or havedied by their own hand The greatest of them Kurt Gdel starved himself todeath in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food Of thetwo pioneers of game theorythe field in which Nash garnered his NobeloneErnst Zermelo was hospitalized for psychosis The other John Von Neumann maynot have been clinically insane but he did serve as the reallife model forthe title character in Stanley Kubricks Dr Strangelove             So maybethere is an accidental pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematicsOr maybe it isnt so accidental Mathematicians are after all people whofancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objectsabstract spacesinfinite numbers zeta functionsthat are invisible to normal humans Theyspend their days piecing together complicated scrupulously logical tales aboutthese hallucinatory entities which they believe are vastly more important thananything in the actual world Is this not a kind of a folie  n wheren equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide            ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about thepsychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness It is also avery peculiar redemption story how three decades of raging schizophreniacapped by an unexpected Nobel Prize can transmute a cruel shit into a frailbut decent human being            As a boygrowing up in the hills of West Virginia Nash enjoyed torturing animals andbuilding homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters one of whom wasaccidentally killed by a blast Given Nashs childhood keenness for explosivesand his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers throughthe mail its a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect Hemade his way to Carnegie Tech where he was a classmate of Andy Warhols andthence to Princetonthe world capital of mathematics at the timeat the ageof             In sheer appearance this cold and aloof Southerner stoodout from his fellow math prodigies A beautiful darkhaired young manhandsome as a god he was  feet  inch tall with broad shoulders a heavilymuscled chest which he liked to show off with seethrough Dacron shirts atapered waist and rather limp and beautiful hands accentuated by longfingernails Within two years of entering Princeton Nash had framed and provedthe most important proposition in the theory of games            Mathematically this was no big deal Game theory was a somewhat fashionablepursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days when it looked as if it mightdo for military science and economics what Newtons calculus had done forphysics But they were bored with it by the early s Economists after afew decades of hesitation picked it up in the s and made it a cornerstoneof their discipline            Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunchof participants or players The players could be poker pals oligopolistscompeting to corner a market or nuclear powers trying to dominate each otherEach player has several strategy options to choose from What Nash showed wasthat in every such game there is what has become known as a Nash equilibriuma set of strategies one for each player such that no player can improve hissituation by switching to a different strategy His proof was elegant butslight A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium it turns out for thesame reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred at least one coffeemolecule must remain absolutely still Both are direct consequences of afixedpoint theorem in the branch of mathematics known as topology Thistheorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things therewill necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remainunchangedthe fixed point Nash found a way of applying this to the domainof all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibriumfor the gameclever but the earlier topological theorem did all the workStill for an economics theorem that counts as profound Economists have beenknown to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementarycalculus            Nashsbreakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp which was thena secretive military think tank in Santa Monica its name is an acronym forresearch and development However the achievement did not greatly impresshis fellow mathematicians To do that Nash on a wager disposed of a deepproblem that had baffled the profession since the  th century Heshowed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of smoothnesscan be embedded in Euclidean space Manifolds one must understand are fairlywild and exotic beasts in mathematics A famous example is the Klein bottle akind of higherdimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same asits outside Euclidean space by contrast is orderly and bourgeois Todemonstrate that impossible manifolds could be coaxed into living inEuclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting Nash did this byconstructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematiciansthoroughly befuddled            That about marked the end of Nashs career as amathematical genius The next year he was expelled from Rand as a securityrisk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public mensroom near Muscle Beach At MIT where he had been given a teaching job hehardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solvingtheir thesis problems He carried on affairs with several men and a mistresswho bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support His cruel streakextended to the woman he married a beautiful physics student named Alicia whowas awed by this genius with a penis Once at a math department picnic hethrew her to the ground and put his foot on her throat            All thewhile Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israeloften asign of incipient insanity at least in a nonJew Geniuses slipping intomadness also tend to disrobe in public I learned this from a volume on chessprodigies who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses Nash showed upfor an MIT New Years Eve party clad only in a diaper And then of coursethere was the New York Times  that old mainstay of psychoticdelusionNash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through itspages come to think of it that could explain the Times  oddprose            When the big breakdown came it was properlymathematical Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached  Nashdecided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematicsthe Riemann Zeta conjecture This bold guess about the solutions to a certaincomplexvalued infinite series made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in would if true have farreaching implications for the structure of themost basic of entities the natural numbers Before an eager audience ofhundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in  Nash presented hisresults a farrago of mathematical lunacy Nashs talk wasnt good or badsaid one mathematician present It was horrible Some weeks before Nash haddeclined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds thathe was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica            Suchebullitions of insanity continued for three decades becoming more rococo Nashwent to Europe to form a world government attempting repeatedly to renouncehis US citizenship He did stints in tony asylums hanging out with RobertLowell and in dismal state institutions where he was subjected daily toinsulininduced comas He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee calledCORPSE a great Japanese shogun C Esau the prince of peacelhomme dOr  a mouse As Nasar observes his delusions were weirdlyinconsistent He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of theuniverseI am the left foot of God on earthand an abject persecutedpetitioner            He returned to the Princeton area in the s where hewas taken care of by the longsuffering Alicia now his exwife she supportedhim partly through computer programming partly on welfare He haunted thecampus where students began to call him the Phantom They would come toclass in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard atnight Mao TseTungs Bar Mitzvah was  years  months and  days afterBrezhnevs circumcision            Then inthe s inexplicably the voices in Nashs head began to quiet down Nasargives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among thosediagnosed with schizophrenia At the same time the Nobel committee inStockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics forgame theory Dare they make a known madman into a laureate What might he sayto King Gustav at the ceremony Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here bypenetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing thebackstage machinations for and against Nashs candidacy He did fine at theceremony by the way            Indeed he has evolved into a very fineperson according to his exwifehumbled by years of psychotic helplessnessbuoyed up by the intellectual worlds highest accolade The Nobel has aterrible effect on the productivity of many recipients paralyzing them withgreatness For Nash it was pure therapy Then too there is the need to takecare of his son by Alicia whopleiotropicallyinherited both hismathematical promise and his madness His older son the one born out ofwedlock got neither The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the littlebungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shakymenage When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A BeautifulMind  Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazineto live in a house clad in insulbrick            The eeriest thing Idiscovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within acouple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital I was actuallyworking there but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of thepatients that its hard to tell the difference after a while A few years afterthat I found myself in a mathematics PhD program Youll be glad to know thatIm in remission
