                    Introduction        Smallpox while not found in the worlds population at        present remains a potential health hazard especially due        to the possibility of its use as a bioweapon                There is currently no accepted treatment for smallpox        although a number of agents have been evaluated            Therefore new therapeutic or virucidal agents could have        great utility in slowing both the progression and spread of        the disease in an epidemic situation In the present study        we have investigated the potential of porphyrins Por and        phthalocyanines Pc to prevent infection by vaccinia virus        in cell culture                    Materials and Methods                  Porphyrins and phthalocyanines          Porphyrins were obtained from Midcentury Chemicals          Chicago Illinois or Frontier Scientific Logan Utah          and used as received Porphyrin designations are as          follows PP protoporphyrin IX HP hematoporphyrin IX          TPP           meso tetraphenylporphine TNapPS          sulfonated tetranaphthalenylporphyrin          TAnthPS sulfonated          tetraanthracenylporphyrin Other          porphyrins are tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives eg          TPPF is tetraphenylporphyrin with a fluoro group at the          position on each phenyl ring An S at the end of the          name indicates that the parent porphyrin was sulfonated          In most cases these are mixtures with variable numbers          of sulfonates andor positions of the sulfonates on the          ring The sulfonated copper phthalocyanine sold as          CuPcS was purchased from Aldrich                          Cell lines and virus strains          CV BSC and TK B cells were maintained in          Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium DMEM supplemented          with  fetal bovine serum FBS and incubated at C           CO             CV cells were utilized for virus          titer determinations and TK B cells were used in          virus stock preparations HeLa S cells were grown at          C in RPMI  culture medium supplemented with           FBS and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin                          Growth of vaccinia virus VV          Two strains of vaccinia virus VV were used in this          study the Western Reserve WR and International Health          DepartmentJ IHDJ strains The WR strain produced by          Virotech International Rockville MD was a gift from          Dr Mark Feinberg Emory University The IHDJ strain          was grown as described previously     TK B cells          grown in roller bottles were infected with the WR strain          of the virus and incubated for  days at C The cells          were collected resuspended in a buffered solution of           mM TrisHCl pH  and homogenized with  strokes in a          Dounce homogenizer Large debris and nuclei were          sedimented by centrifugation at  rpm for  min The          supernatant was collected and trypsin  gmL added          This was then loaded on a  sucrose cushion and the          virus pelleted by centrifugation at  rpm for  min          using a Beckman SW rotor Extracellular particles of          IHDJ were obtained by infecting TK B cells After           h incubation at C the culture medium was precleared          and the virus was concentrated by centrifugation at           rpm for  min in a SW rotor and resuspended in           mM TrisHCl pH                           Prevention of virus infection          A plaque assay was used to determine the ability of          test compounds to prevent infection Compound stock          solutions  mgmL were diluted fold in DMEM without          FBS and mixed with virus particles to five final          concentrations     and  gmL After  h          incubation in the dark the virusdrug mixture was          diluted fold in DMEM without FBS to  L and           L added to each well of confluent CV or BSC cells          grown in well plates This afforded  pfuwell             pfucell Following virusdrug adsorption onto the          monolayer  h at C cell monolayers were washed twice          PBS to remove residual virusdrug mixture New growth          medium supplemented with  FBS was then added to each          well          A plaque assay was used to determine the quantity of          infectious particles remaining after drug treatment Two          days after infection the growth medium was removed and          the cells washed twice with PBS A solution of           crystal violet  formaldehyde in phosphate buffered          saline PBS was then added to the wells After  min          incubation the stain was removed and the wells washed          with PBS and allowed to dry The number of plaques was          then determined and activity calculated based on the          reduction in average number of plaques in wells where          the compound was preincubated with the virus compared          to the control wells inoculated with untreated virus As          an alternative to the liquid overlay agar overlays were          also investigated Similar results were obtained with          both assays Hence further plaque assays were done using          liquid overlays          EC            values were calculated as response           min  maxmin explogdruglogEC             using Kaleidagraph Synergy          Software Reading Pennsylvania Reported EC            values are the average and standard          deviation of three separate determinations each          replicated three times                          Inhibition of virus yield          Confluent monolayers of CV cells were infected with             pfuwell  pfucell of WR for  h at C          The cells were then washed twice with PBS to remove any          residual virus Compound stock solutions  mgmL were          diluted in DMEM with  FBS to final concentrations of           or  gmL This media containing compounds  L          was then added to the cells At  h postinfection cell          monolayers and culture medium were harvested and          subjected to several cycles of freezethawing to release          intracellular and extracellular virus particles A plaque          assay on CV cells was used to determine the virus          titer CV cells were infected with the virus inoculum          for  h the growth medium was removed and  FBS in          DMEM added to the cells After  days the cells were          washed with PBS and later stained with a solution of           crystal violet  formaldehyde in PBS and the viral          plaque number was counted To determine if viral          inactivation occurs after cell lysis the cell monolayers          were washed three times with DMEM to remove the compounds          then harvested and subjected to several cycles of          freezethawing to release intracellular virus          particles                          Cell proliferation assay          Cell proliferation was measured by  Hthymidine          uptake     HeLa S cells    cellswell were          incubated in well plates in the presence of varying          concentrations of the tetrapyrroles for  days at C          after which HTdR  Ciwell was added The cells were          further incubated for  h then harvested and HTdR          incorporation monitored by using a liquid scintillation          counter Data are from a single experiment                          Cytotoxicity of active tetrapyrroles          CV and BSC cells were seeded at a concentration          of    cellswell in a well plate and allowed to          attach overnight after which they were  confluent          Compounds in DMEM with  FBS were added to the cells          After  days a trypan blue viability assay    was          performed The  cytotoxic concentration CC             is the concentration required to          reduce viable cell numbers by  relative to untreated          control cell numbers This was determined by incubation          in growth medium containing serial dilutions of compounds          in the range of    gmL for  days after which          the viable cell numbers were determined To determine the          effect of the compounds on cell proliferation after  h          incubation the cells were washed and further incubated          in the absence of the compounds for  day and then a          trypan blue assay was done Data are from a single          experiment                          Cytostatic activity          CV cells were seeded at    cellswell in          growth medium in a well plate and allowed to attach          overnight the compounds in growth medium were then          added Following a  h incubation the cells were          counted                            Results        Initial screening of porphyrins and phthalocyanines        Figure  involved more than  different compounds        These compounds were preincubated with the virus and then        the mixture was inoculated on CV cells and residual virus        titers were determined by plaque assay Based on the        results obtained we were able to determine the most active        compounds that is compounds at  gmL that inactivated        the virus completely no plaques seen Figure  These        were chosen as candidates for further study        Approximately  natural porphyrins based on the        protoporphyrin ring skeleton of hemin were evaluated In        general structures with the hematoporphyrin ring ie        hydroxyethyl groups at the  and positions see CuHPIX        in Figure  were found to be more active than structures        with the protoporphyrin see ZnPPIX in Figure         mesoporphyrin deuteroporphyrin or deuteroporphyrin        disulfonic acid rings ethyl hydrogen or sulfonate at        positions  and  respectively CuHPIX and ZnPPIX were        evaluated in more detail CuHPIX was more active than        ZnPPIX eg EC          values of  vs  gmL for        IHDJ in CV cells but neither was as active as the        sulfonated porphyrins          vide infra  The ability of these        compounds to prevent infection was also compared in BSC        cells Generally the EC          data obtained from both cell lines        were of the same order of magnitude however in the BSC        cell line the WR strain of the virus showed a hundredfold        greater sensitivity to CuHPIX as compared with CV cells        Table         A large number of sulfonated tetraphenylporphyrin        derivatives was also evaluated A series of  metal        chelates of tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonate TPPS was        tested but none showed more than  activity at  gmL        using either the WR or IHDJ strains these candidates        therefore were not pursued A series of         tetraphenylporphyrin derivatives made via sulfonation of        the F Cl and Br the F and Cl and the F and Cl        tetraphenylporphyrins was evaluated Many of these        derivatives completely blocked infection by both strains at        concentrations of  gmL Figure  TPPClS and TPPFS        were studied in more detail These two derivatives had        similar activities within a factor of  in the WR and        IHDJ assays A series of sulfonated derivatives of the        difluoro and dichlorotetraphenylporphyrins was also        studied The parent compounds and the CoIII chelate of        the difluoroporphyrin completely inhibited infection at         gmL the CoIII chelate had EC          values of  CV and  gmL        BSC in the WR assay and  gmL CV in the IHDJ        assay The other compounds tested were less active ie        at  gmL they inactivated the virus by less than         Four nonhalogenated porphyrin derivatives with aryl side        chains TNapS TAnthS TPPOH and TPPOMeS had        high activity Table  All of these had EC          values of   gmL in both        assays TNapS and TAnthS were more active against the IHDJ        than WR strain Table  using CV cells TPPOH        also had high activity EC          values were  CV and         BSC gmL for the WR assay and  CV and         gmL BSC in the IHDJ assay TPPOH is a        neutral compound with eight hydroxyl groups Figure         this may give it amphiphilic properties that could play a        role in blocking infection        Approximately  sulfonated phthalocyanines PcS were        evaluated Only the copper and chromium PcS were able to        inhibit viral infection The copper phthalocyanine        sulfonate only had an EC          of approximately  gmL in the WR        assay in both cell lines It was somewhat more active in        the IHDJ assays but the sulfonated phthalocyanines were        not studied further        Since there are major differences in surface antigens        and presumably in the host cell receptors between the        intracellular and extracellular particles of VV              we also compared the sensitivity of the two forms to        the compounds to be tested Generally the compounds tested        were highly effective against both forms Table         Comparison of the intracellular mature virion IMV third        column in Table  and extracellular enveloped virion EEV        forms of the IHDJ strain showed differences in activity of        some compounds in blocking infection by the two forms of        the virus These results suggest that the tetrapyrroles may        be binding to different components on the surface of the        two forms of the virus and thus show differences in        efficiency of preventing virus infection        The active compounds exhibited very low to moderate        toxicity in assays for their effects on cell viability        Table  Therapeutic ratios calculated as CC          EC           were found to be in a range from           with the exception of ZnPPIX for which the ratios        were in the range of    The compounds were also tested        in CV cells and a human cell line HeLaS for their        effect on cell growth Table  The compounds tested        generally inhibited CV cell growth at high        concentrations and Hthymidine uptake in HeLa cells by         only at concentrations above  gmL except for        CoIIITPPFS CC            gmL        The ability of a number of tetrapyrroles to inhibit        virus replication was determined in CV cells infected        with the WR strain in the absence of compounds Following        virus adsorption  h compounds in growth medium were        added to the cells After  h postinfection cells and        media were collected virus was released by freezing and        thawing and virus yields determined by plaque assay        Reduction of virus yield was observed with all compounds        assayed Table  with most compounds resulting in           reduction at  gmL These results indicate that        infectious virus production is being inhibited by these        compounds        These results were compared to those of other        experiments in which the compounds were removed before        viral titration was done Table  The effect on viral        yield was found to be significantly reduced when the        compounds were removed prior to harvest indicating that        the inhibitory effect occurs predominantly after viral        release Using a lower moi  pfucell and removing        the compounds before the viral harvest resulted in        reduction of viral yields by as much as  Table         indicating that the compounds block multiple cycle        replication of the virus Inhibition of virus spread by        these compounds has also been observed when the        tetrapyrroles were included in the overlay medium in a        plaque assay After  h the cell monolayers were stained        and the plaque numbers determined We observed substantial        reductions in plaque numbers and size data not shown        indicating inhibition of both virus infection and        spread                    Discussion        Photoinactivation of viruses by diamagnetic porphyrins        and phthalocyanines has been widely studied                   Photoactivation involves absorption of        light by the tetrapyrrole with resulting production of free        radicals and singlet oxygen In the current study        inhibition of vaccinia infection is not due to        photoactivation of the tetrapyrroles as shown by two        aspects of the experiments First there was little        exposure to light during experiments with no additional        irradiation Second we observed that the extent of        inactivation was not a function of the spin state        diamagnetic or paramagnetic for metal chelates of the        porphyrins and phthalocyanines Only diamagnetic        tetrapyrroles are able to inhibit viruses via        photoinactivation the excited states of the paramagnetic        derivatives have short halflives and do not give        significant amounts of free radicals or singlet oxygen        Tetrapyrroles previously have been reported to inhibit        certain other viruses by mechanisms not involving        photoactivation A cationic phthalocyanine was reported to        inhibit human rhinovirus type  RV infection            Selected porphyrin derivatives inhibit specific viral        targets including retroviral reverse transcriptase               and HIV protease            In previous studies of the antiviral effects of        porphyrins Song et al investigated the antiviral effects        of Fe                 meso tetrakisdisulfonatomesitylporphyrin        FeTMPS and         meso tetracarboxyphenylporphyrin        TPPC and its iron and nickel chelates for a variety of        viruses     EC          s were generally  gmL or greater        for VV VSV HSV HSV Coxsackie virus B and        poliovirus FeTMPS showed activity in this range also for        parainfluenza reovirus and Semliki forest virus        FeTMPS was more active for sindbis virus VZV and CMV with        EC          s of  to  gmL Fe and Ni TPPC        were also quite active against CMV        Porphyrins and metalloporphyrins have also been shown to        have antiviral activity against HIV                           Previous studies indicated        that some porphyrins inhibit the interaction between the        virus envelope protein and its receptors                    We have shown also that porphyrins block        infection by HIV and that this activity appears to be a        result of an interaction with the envelope protein            In this regard the compounds that were active in blocking        infection by HIV tended to be sulfonated compounds or        other negatively charged compounds In the present study        it is of interest that the uncharged molecule        TPPOH was one of the most active compounds tested        This result indicates that the activity of this compound        with VV is not merely a reflection of an interaction        between a negatively charged molecule and positively        charged sites on the viral surface but that other        structural features are important for interaction with        viral proteins        Although the WR and IHDJ strains exhibited similar        sensitivity to most of the compounds tested some        differences in their relative sensitivity was observed The        WR strain was  to fold less sensitive than IHDJ to        several compounds including TAnthPS CuHPIX and TPPFS        but was about fold more sensitive to inhibition by        TPPOH These results support the conclusion that        the compounds block infection by interacting with specific        viral proteins and that strainspecific differences in        protein structures determine the differences in        sensitivities to specific compounds The sensitivity of the        activity to relatively small structural changes in our work        indicates either that amphiphilicity and steric and        specific axial ligand effects significantly control binding        to the virion target or that more than one mechanism of        inhibition is operational        EC          data obtained from both viruses        studied ranged from  to  M This range is comparable        to that observed for other compounds active against        vaccinia For example cidofovir an acyclic nucleoside        with activity against a variety of DNA viruses used        clinically in some instances     has been shown to be        effective against a number of poxviruses with the following        EC          values  M camelpox  M        vaccinia  M monkeypox and  M cowpox             Other classes of compounds have been tested for their        effectiveness against vaccinia virus including the IMP        dehydrogenase inhibitors EC             gmL OMP decarboxylase        inhibitors    gmL and polyanionic compounds           gmL            In conclusion we observed that both porphyrins and        phthalocyanines have substantial antiviral activity against        vaccinia virus Examples of the natural porphyrin        sulfonated tetraphenylporphyrin neutral        tetraphenylporphyrin and sulfonated phthalocyanine classes        were all found to be active These results as well as the        high therapeutic ratios observed indicate that these        compounds represent attractive candidates as antiviral        agents to control poxvirus infection                    Competing Interests        None declared                    Author
