                     This is an interview with Darlene Maurer interviewing Eric St John         So Eric would you tell us what stories or book you remember reading as a child         What was your favorite story                     Uh my favorite book or stories were the uh phew The Cat in the Hat because I always loved all of the colors         And theres always all of the kids were having a great time while the parents left and it was like one big huge flight of fancy and they just go from one thing to another thing and it was like really fun and chaotic and just neat         And then and then it was always like an adventure though because then all of a sudden toward the end like the parents are coming back         And we all know that if we dont have everything cleaned up youre going to get punished         And so it was like Can they do it         Can they do it         Can they get cleaned up in time         Are they going to make it         So its like having a blast and going on a flight of fancy and then coming back to reality and then like not getting caught          kind of         And they always did                     And what age were you when you read this                     Oh boy         I dont know         I was probably anywhere from anywhere five on up         I dont have a lot of memories         I can remember four and earlier         They come once in a while but I dont really have anything real strong         But uh I loved the colors and all the illustrations too and just the zaniness         And then everythings a little bit later I really I loved reading         I would be this is more like when I was eight nine and ten and  I would have a bedtime and it was always way earlier than I wanted but I would lay I would have this little lamp Id put underneath my bedcovers and I would be reading         And I would read I would read like baseball biographies         I loved baseball still do but uh you know just to read about these famous people and dream about playing sports and being some kind of hero         And uh every once in a while I think my dad caught onto that but uh hed come down and tell me to shut the shut the lamp off every once in a while         But uh Id usually I just read and read and read         Im surprised I didnt set the whole house on fire with that high intensity lamp                     So what baseball hero did you want to be when you grew up                     Oh I wanted to be uh Harmon Killebrew because I was from MN                     Hmm                     He was the famous slugger from MN played for the Twins         And then when Id play baseball I I could hit pretty good too when I was real young         I couldnt in high school         I became a pitcher                     Uhhuh                     And they never hit but uh I always loved biographies of of famous people and events in history as I got older         And uh I still have kind of a passion for history and historical type things         Uh golly         Also some of these other questions that also leads to the fact that uh my brother you know I had seven or six brothers and sisters four until I was  and then three more joined the family when I was          And my my younger brother was hes like the most hilarious storyteller         And I remember his stories too because he would just make them up and just it would just be zaniness         And yet he was he was really funny too and he could make faces and really creative even as a little kid         Hes always the happygolucky kid and I was the oldest         But it was a blast to hear him tell stories and then just start building off of them and just go all over the place         I guess thats kind of like The Cat in the Hat story too         But uh that was I liked him         He was a really good storyteller         Now a good as I get older a really good storyteller is my other brother who is like really serious         You never really catch him really laughing hes always really controlled         But he tells a good story with a dry sense of humor and uh golly he spent his career in the Army still he just went to Germany         But uh those are the two best storytellers I know in our family         I remember my dad my dad told us he would tell us stories about his childhood but usually usually from him that that doesnt really come until later         But uh when he would start telling about when he was a teenager some of the some of the teenaged stuff he and his teenaged brothers did when they worked for their dads business my grandfather         Uh I didnt I never did know him         I dont remember him he died when I was four         But it was hilarious just hearing what they did         Im surprised theyre still in business         Well they were in business                     Do you remember any of the stories                     Oh yeah         How hard it was how hard it is you know way back then they would drive halfton trucks         They were only halfton trucks and they would drive grain feed around and coal and stuff to the farmers in MN in southern MN         But they would the father my grandfather wanted to save money so he would rig them up so theyd haul hed haul a ton and a half on a halfton truck         And so he was constantly busting up and twisting up axles and he always he would get mad when the sons would do it                     Uhhuh                     which usually meant that they werent being careful         But anyway their stories would go on and on about going one mile an hour up a hill taking forever to get somewhere driving getting up a head up steam in the winter and Bucking snowdrifts is what they called it         The snowdrifts would come out into the streets into the road and uh this was in rural MN so half the time you couldnt see where the road was anyway but they would go plowing these snowdrifts you know         It was all fun and teenaged fun until you until you ended up in a ditch in the middle of a blizzard                  You broke the radiator or twisted an axle of a truck and had to call your dad and tell him what happened                     Oh                          And top of that  of course all the dad all the grandfather wanted he wanted the customer serviced                              Get the job done                     Of course youre in the ditch trying to explain what happened but uh                     Was that your dad or his brother                     Both                     Both                     Both would do that         I think my dad was the ringleader he was the oldest also                     What year do you think that would have been                     That was probably uh golly my dad was born in          So when he was  and ish probably the early s as best I can tell from those stories because they both went into the service very late my dad went into the service at the very end of World War II and my uncle served in Korea         So that would be about right                  I tell you I dont really remember anyone reading stories to me thats although I know my mom did         I just have a sense that that happened but I dont remember specifics                     What are some stories that you might tell yourself now that to help you through hard times                     Well now now the two stories would always be uh would be the story of Joseph in the Old Testament or and or the story of Paul in the New Testament         Which is in Joseph throughout his life he was basically done wrong by his brothers and jailed unfairly and so on and so forth but in the end no matter he didnt pay back his brothers even though he was the second most powerful man in Egypt         He just said you know the moral of the story and what he said was You meant evil for me but the Lord meant good         That I might save you know that many might be saved         Uh and thats been a huge a huge blessing and and source of comfort         Especially in the midst of trials that uh no matter whats happening its being done to uh for our for our good and our and our uh perfection meaning meaning that uh hes sanding off the edges constantly of us         And uh also the story of Paul and in particular its in I think its in the Book of Romans Romans  where he says All things work for good for those who love the Lord         Uh and Paul Pauls life is like a Indiana Jones movie where at one time theres   Jews uh Jewish scholars or whatever had taken the vow of hunger until they caught him they werent going to eat         So theres  guys who hadnt eaten in  days chasing them         So you reckon at least one of them is going to catch them somehow but he he managed to elude them all         And then of course he spent the rest of his life you know on shipwrecks and in jail and being beat up and uh Im sure verbally abused and just you name it         But he counted all that joy uh for the work he was doing for the Lord         And and that no matter what was happening he was able he was able to uh mentally adjust to the situation knowing that the Lord was working in his life uh for his good even if he couldnt always exactly see why         So thats it         And then of course the story of Jesus is the other one uh the biggest uh just about what he took on himself and that he was you know he was betrayed by everybody his closest closest friends uh and loved ones uh down to the last the last disciple and apostle         Well excuse me just disciple         Uh and yet he you know he still carried through with the Fathers will uh and and kept his composure and and his perspective and focused no matter what         So those are the three that no matter what the situation therell be something in those three lives that speak to me that I will repeat to myself no matter what                     Through difficult times                     The harder it gets the more I will reflect on those lives and go back to the passages that talk about their lives                     OK         Sounds like you get a lot of strength from your faith in Jesus                     I get all of it all of it from there         It happened three years ago and its been amazing journeys Im looking forward to the rest of it                     Umm thats great thats great         Is there anything else youd like to share                     Thats about it I think                     OK Eric thank you                     Youre welcome                     I appreciate it
