and Irishpress to fears that it might fail In Britain only the Independent recentlypurchased by the Irish CEO of HJ Heinz Co Tony OReilly appeared todiscount the possibility of failure from the start A frontpage headline lastSaturday read Peace at last for Ulster and an editorial gushed It isnot naive to be optimistic about its prospects and we must all resist thetemptation to see future violence described as a failure of the peace processalthough that temptation would surely be strong            Theconservative Daily Telegraph  always deeply suspicious of any dealings betweenBritain and Sinn Fein the political wing of the Irish Republican Armycriticized several aspects of the settlement and emphasized that it does notin itself mean peace in Ulsters time It added that Ulsters unionist votersshould not at least as yet feel that they are against peace by rejectingyesterdays agreementor be stampeded into voting Yes in a referendumPlease make it work begged the liberal Guardian in its frontpage headline saying in itseditorial that while failure was a possibility so also was success It is atime for gratitude and even the odd private prayer it went on For this wasa blessed Good Friday The Financial Times said What has been achieved is a great newopportunity but it is only that The people of Ireland north and south mustmake up their minds to take it            By Easter Sunday the Sunday Telegraph was leadingwith the news that peace was already threatened by Sinn Feins refusal to pressthe IRA to hand over its weapons immediately Rupert Murdochs SundayTimes  on the other hand described divisions among the Protestantunionists as the main threat to peace Most of the British Sunday newspapershighlighted an agreement between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and hisConservative predecessor John Major to campaign together for a Yes vote innext months referendum in Ulster The Sunday Mirror published an exclusive frontpage report that Blair was going to ask the queen to confer aknighthood on the chairman of the peace talks former US Sen GeorgeMitchell            Surprisingly the Sunday Telegraph s editorial was hostile to PresidentClinton who had elsewhere been garnering plaudits for his contribution to thepeace settlement It described his intervention as merely opportunistic andadded In his intrusions into the peace process President Clintona man whotook no risks last weekhas tried to represent Britain as if it were acolonial power slowly withdrawing from a Third World statelet It is worthreminding him that Ulster is and remains part of the United Kingdom and assuch is part of a developed democracy            By Monday every British broadsheet wasstressing the difficulties facing the peace settlement because of divisionswithin Sinn Fein and among the unionists while the Guardian led itsfront page with a warning by Mitchell of increased terrorist violence at thetime of the referendum Continental newspapers too emphasized the problemsThe Irish peace remains to be built said the conservative Paris dailyLe Figaro over its mainfrontpage story In an adjoining comment it described the Ulster settlementas typically English in its pragmatism What continental jurist could havethought up a statute which reaffirms Ulsters dependence on the crown withoutexcluding its eventual reattachment to the Republic of Ireland it asked OnTuesday Le Monde carriedan article by its Madrid correspondent about intense Spanish interest in theUlster settlement as a possible key to solving the Basque terrorist problem inSpain But El Pas ofMadrid quoted Blair spending Easter with his family in Crdoba as sayingthere were no comparisons to be made between the two situations            The Ulster agreement wasgreeted with even greater euphoria in the Irish press than in its Britishcounterpart The Cork Examiner hailed it as the achievement of lasting peace and theIrish Times comparedJohn Hume the Ulster Social Democratic Party leader who played the key role inlaunching the peace negotiations to Moses entering the PromisedLandthough as the Irish historian and politician Conor Cruise OBrienpointed out in an oped article in the Times of London on Monday Moses never actually enteredthe Promised Land            But OBrien who has alwaysbeen opposed to making deals with Sinn Fein noted that there was now less openemphasis in Ireland on peace than on a breakthrough for Irish nationalism andhe added that an article in the Sunday Business Postthe Dublin newspaper mostsympathetic to Sinn Feinhad rather given the game away with an article thatsaid The IRA which is likely to maintain its ceasefire for several monthswill almost certainly resist any attempt to accede to unionist demands foractual decommissioning of weapons by early summer OBrien predicted that SinnFein and the IRA would continue to operate the peace process as a fertileand rewarding field for further blackmail and that the peace proposals maywell be defeated by unionist voters in the referendum
