                    Background        Rapid robust and reversible induction of transgene        expression would significantly facilitate certain        applications of gene therapy and the study of cancer        biology Several inducible systems have been developed to        regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level in a        temporal and quantitative manner       These include        systems based on heat shock heavy metal ion tetracycline        steroid or ecdysone hormone induction For in vivo        applications tetracycline steroid rapamycin and        ecdysone responsive systems have been studied most and in        recent years Currently the most popular inducible system        is based on components of the tetracycline resistance        operon which has seen use in both tumors     as well        as transgenic animals    However these systems have        limitations the most important being the significant        background expression Recently the development of an        inducible system based on the insect steroid ecdysone and        the nuclear receptor that mediates its effect    has        provided an alternative that may circumvent these        limitations The use of ecdysone inducible transgene        expression in vitro     and in transgenic mice           has recently been demonstrated The use of this system in        vivo has several potential advantages over other regulatory        systems The ecdysone hormones do not affect mammalian        physiology like glucocorticoids or progestins and are not        known to be toxic or teratogenic like tetracycline           allowing their use in both developmental studies with        transgenic animals as well as in the context of gene        therapy and tumor biology studies in mature animals        The popularity of the ecdysone inducible gene switch        system has led us to investigate its characteristics as a        regulator of transgene expression in tumor xenografts since        to our knowledge this has not yet been reported Prior to        evaluating this in vivo we have thoroughly examined the        kinetics of this switch in vitro in  different tumor cell        lines using  different reporters in order to evaluate the        generality of these observations The in vivo evaluation        was carried out in a model of highly aggressive murine        bladder cancer which has previously been used for testing        various therapeutic interventions     These bladder        cell lines were transfected with a novel ecdysone system        regulating the expression of firefly luciferase and then        injected subcutaneously into syngeneic hosts Treatment of        the animals with ecdysone analog        AmethoxyethylbenzoylAdimethylbenzoylAtertbutyl        hydrazine GSE was then carried out with subsequent        evaluation of in vivo gene expression Our data suggests        that in vivo induction of tumor transgene expression is        feasible and reversible using an ecdysone switch and opens        the avenue for the efficient functional characterization of        many newly discovered genes as well as novel gene therapy        approaches                    Results                  Derivation of mouse tumor cell lines containing a          novel gene regulatory mechanism          A description of the plasmids encoding the two          components of an ecdysone inducible transcription          activation system was reported previously     The          plasmids pGALEcR and pVPmRXR encode proteins which          heterodimerize and regulate transcription upon the          addition of ecdysone type ligands Figure A Using          these plasmids as a starting point a novel indicator of          the inducible gene expression system was constructed as          follows The CMV promoter and enhancer were removed from          the mammalian expression vector pCIneo Promega          Inserted in its place were five copies of the GAL          binding site followed by the minimal promoter region of          the major late promoter from adenovirus from pGluc          Promega and the coding region for the enhanced green          fluorescent protein EGFP gene from pEGFPN          Clontech The control plasmid pRLTK Promega          expresses the Renilla luciferase gene under the control          of the HSV thymidine kinase TK promoter This plasmid          provides constitutively high gene expression and we use          it as an indicator of the number of tumor cells present          in the tissue samples harvested from mice in the in vivo          experiments          MBT cells a mouse urothelial cancer cell line or          Panc a mouse ductal adenocarcinoma were transfected          by electroporation with a mixture of the four plasmids          the two components of the gene expression system          pVPmRXR and pGALEcR the indicator and selection          plasmid pGALEGFPSVneo and the internal control          plasmid pRLTK Stably transfected MBT cells were          selected in media containing  gml G and Panc          cells in  gml G for three weeks after which there          were many large cell colonies on each transfection plate          The drug resistant cells were harvested by          trypsinization pooled and cloned to single cells by          limiting dilution in  well plates When colonies had          grown in a subset of the wells in the  well plate          fresh media containing GSE was added to all wells to a          final GSE concentration of  M Cells were treated for           hours and all wells were visualized with the          fluorescent microscope to detect EGFP expression          At least  clones of MBT or Panc clones          demonstrating fluorescence were trypsinized and expanded          into  well plates When the clones had reached at least           confluence in the  well plate GSE was again added          to  M to verify the earlier observation of induced EGFP          expression Four clones of each cell line exhibiting high          levels of EGFP expression were expanded for further          analysis Each cell line was transiently transfected with           g pFRluc and carrier DNA Luciferase activity in the          DMSO treated wells was similarly low in all wells of the          triplicates of the eight transfections After treatment          with  M GSE three of the four MBT clonal cell          lines had a twofold or lower increase in luciferase          activity Clone  had fold higher luciferase          activity with GSE treatment This clone designated          MBTRheoSwitch was used for further development In a          similar analysis PancRheoSwitch and  demonstrated          induction levels of  and fold respectively No          significant change in the Renilla luciferase activity was          observed with GSE treatment in all cell lines                          Stable introduction of inducible reporter genes          into the RHeoSwitch tumor cell lines          The MBTRHeoSwitch cell line containing the          RHeoSwitch expression system was used for the          introduction of two different reporter gene systems The          plasmid pGluc contains the GAL response element          expressing the luc gene Figure B The vector          pGALSEAP containing the GAL response element and the          coding region for the SEAP protein a unique second          reporter gene was also used Each of these vectors was          linearized and cotransfected with linearized pSVZeo          by electroporation into the MBTRHeoSwitch cells          Cells were selected in media containing  gml Zeocin          until colonies appeared in each of the plates Zeocin          resistant cells were trypsinized pooled and single cell          cloned by limited dilution in  well plates Aliquots of          the pooled cells used for cloning were also plated in          triplicate treated with GSE or DMSO for  hrs Assays          for the appropriate reporter in each cell pool showed          induction ratios of fold for the luciferase          transfected cells and fold for the SEAP transfected          cells This verified the presence of the GSE inducible          reporter genes luciferase or SEAP in the cloned pool of          cells          Clones were grown in Zeocin containing media until          colonies appeared Eightyfour luciferase transfected          clones and  SEAP transfected clones were transferred          from the  well plates and duplicate wells of each were          treated with either DMSO or  M GSE in DMSO for           hours Each pair of wells was assayed for reporter          protein activity and clones demonstrating basal levels of          activity in the DMSO treated sample and high levels in          the GSE sample were further expanded for additional          testing These cell clones were plated in a six well          plate and triplicate wells were treated with DMSO or           M GSE for  hours Luciferase clone          MBTRHeoSwitchlucB was chosen to be used for a          more detailed analysis of the properties of the gene          induction system          The inducible reporter gene plasmids pGluc and          pGALSEAP were transfected into the PancRHeoSwitch          and  cells and stable transfectants were isolated as          they were into the MBTRHeoSwitch cells Multiple          Zeocin resistant cell clones from the four transfections           PancRHeoSwitchluc  PancRHeoSwitchluc           PancRHeoSwitchGALSEAP           PancRHeoSwitchSEAP were plated in duplicate and          treated with DMSO or  M GSE A sample of clones with          basal level of reporter in the DMSO treated sample and          the highest level of reporter in the GSE treated sample          were selected to be expanded and further tested          Multiple assays in triplicate on the GALSEAP          transfected clones gave induction levels ranging from           to fold for the best five PancRHeoSwitch          clones and from  to fold for the best twelve          PancRHeoSwitch clones Clones          PancRHeoSwitchGALSEAP and  and          PancRHeoSwitchGALSEAP and  were used for          further characterization Multiple assays in triplicate          on the pGluc transfected clones yielded induction          levels ranging from  to fold for the four best          PancRHeoSwitch clones and from  to fold for the          four best PancRHeoSwitch clones Clones          PancRHeoSwitchlucC AND B and          PancRHeoSwitchlucA and B were used for          further characterization These clones do not exhibit the          high levels of induced GFP expression that was seen in          the initial RHeoSwitch transfected cells This may be          explained by the fact that they were selected on the          basis of the induction level of the reporter gene          expression however contrary to the initial screen the          level of induction of GFP was not used as a selection          criteria and cell clones in which the expression of GFP          has variegated were isolated A summary flowchart of the          cell line selection and characterization is shown in          figure                           Characterization of the novel gene regulatory          mechanism in vitro          Treatment of luciferase clone B with  M GSE for           hours consistently induced luciferase levels from near          background with only DMSO added to nearly fold          Table  when adjusted for non specific RLuc induction          which was approximately  fold In order to understand          the induction kinetics of the inducible system cell          clone MBTRHeoSwitchlucB was treated with GSE          and cells were harvested at different times to determine          the time course of gene induction At each time point          the control and treated cells were collected in passive          lysis buffer and dual luciferase assays performed Data          were plotted as a GSE RLURLUControl RLURLU          ratio as in Table  fold induction over the  time          point which was set empirically as  This data shown in          Figure Aindicates that gene expression is increased by           hours and reaches maximum induction by  hours The          internal control Renilla luciferase increase steadily          with time reflecting the increase in cell number but          the increase was the same with DMSO or GSE treatment          raw data not shown but effect accounted for in the          calculation as defined above          The sensitivity of the gene expression system to          varying doses of GSE was determined by treating          duplicate samples of clone MBTRHeoSwitchlucB          with varying concentrations of GSE for  or  hours          and dual luciferase assays were performed on the cell          lysates Figure B Data were plotted as a          GSERLURLUControlRLURLU ratio as in Table           fold induction over the  drug concentration which was          set empirically as  These results show an increase in          gene inducing activity with increasing GSE          concentrations up to  M A significant increase was          seen with as little as  M GSE No change was seen in          the level of the internal control Renilla luciferase with          varying concentrations of GSE raw data not shown but          effect accounted for in the calculation as defined          above          The decay characteristics of the induction were also          studied After a  hour incubation the medium          containing GSE was removed and the cells washed three          times with complete medium without GSE The cells were          then re incubated for various durations At set intervals          replicate wells were removed and dual luciferase assays          were performed on the cell lysates Figure A This data          indicates that the GSE mediated induction is completely          reversible and that this occurs within  hours          Similar dose response and time course of induction of          gene expression experiments were performed on the Panc          cells containing the RHeoSwitch and the inducible          reporter genes The time course of gene induction          demonstrated for four independent          PancRHeoSwitchluciferase cell clones each showed an          increase within  hours of GSE treatment and reached          the maximum induction by  hours Four independent          PancRHeoSwitchSEAP clones also induced expression by           hours but the level of SEAP activity continued to          increase for  hours possibly due to the accumulation          of the enzyme in the cell culture media over the entire          treatment time Treatment of five of these independent          PancRHeoSwitchreporter gene clones with varying doses          of GSE consistently yielded a significant induction in          gene expression with  M GSE fold induction over          DMSO treatment alone and a maximal induction with  M          GSE fold induction over DMSO The dose response          and time course of induction in the Panc cells were          similar to the results seen in experiments on the MBT          cells These results show that the RHeoSwitch gene          induction system gives consistent results independent of          the cell type being used the reporter gene used to          assess the activity as well as the chromosomal          integration site of the DNA encoding the RHeoSwitch          components compare PancRHeoSwitch and  described          above or the integration site of the reporter gene DNA          compare multiple reporter clones from each of three          RHeoSwitch clones described above                          In vivo results          The potency and favorable kinetics of GSE as an          ecdysonesystem inducer in vitro in both the pancreatic          and bladder cell lines led us to evaluate its performance          in vivo in a bladder xenograft model To measure the          pharmacokinetics of GSE mediated gene induction in          animals we inoculated the MBT murine bladder cancer          cell line into syngeneic mice and after the tumors          reached  mm in diameter the mice were treated          with GSE At  and  hour intervals following          inoculation the tumors were excised and analyzed for          luciferase induction Luciferase protein was chosen          primarily because its  hour halflife in mammalian          cell allows precise kinetic studies     The renilla          luciferase was used as an internal control in addition to          untreated mice Data shown in Figure Bindicates that          induction of luciferase activity in tumor xenografts is          prompt peaking between  hours In addition decay of          the effect occurs swiftly and baseline expression levels          are reached by  hours Although available to us the          identification of cell specific expression within the          tumor using the induction of GFP in these tumor cells was          complicated by the decrease in the level of GFP          expression data not shown presumably due to position          effect variegation of the transfected DNA as well as poor          quantitation ability                            Discussion        Methods devised to control gene expression must allow        for rapid robust precise and reversible induction of        gene activity Because steroids are small lipophilic        molecules that penetrate all tissues and are quickly        metabolized and cleared they appear to be ideal inducers        for developing gene regulation systems that fulfill these        criteria To exploit the pharmacokinetics of steroids while        eluding the potential complications of the use of a        mammalian hormone as the inducer the Evans laboratory        developed an inducible system based on the insect steroid        ecdysone and the nuclear receptor that mediates its        effects    This system is comprised of a chimeric        protein composed of the VP activation domain Vg fused        to an ecdysone receptor EcR with altered DNAbinding        specificity heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor        RXR and binds a unique synthetic response element not        recognized by natural nuclear hormone receptors Upon        exposure to the ecdysone analog muristerone A murA the        VgEcRRXR complex efficiently induces the expression of        reporter genes in mammalian cells and transgenic animals        In the RHeoSwitch gene expression system the properties of        the chimeric receptors have been optimized through the        analysis of a series of truncation and sitedirected        mutations Palli etal manuscript in preparation This        study demonstrates the utility of a first generation system        in vitro and in vivo and subsequent modified versions of        the RHeoSwitch will be sensitive to lower concentrations of        ligand and result in higher levels of induced gene        expression see wwwRHeoGenecom        The popularity of the ecdysoneinducible gene switch led        to the unexpected rapid depletion of murA stocks the        primary inducer used in the system MurA was isolated in        the early s from the seeds of kaladana Ipomoea        calonyction a plant native to the southern slopes of the        Himalayas    The difficulty in obtaining kaladana        seeds prompted efforts to seek alternative inducers derived        from more common plants or synthetic analogs such as GSE        GSE is one of a family of diacylhydrazines that have been        found to act as nonsteroidal ecdysone mimics that can        function as gene inducers            The avalanche of new genes resulting from completion of        the genome project has accentuated the need to develop        methods to determine gene function The requirement for        tight regulation easy titration and minimal background        expression is particularly important in the study of genes        such as tumor suppressors or cell cycle regulatory genes        for which cell lines stably expressing the product can        rarely be made In addition deliberate manipulation of        gene activity is also an indispensable tool for clinical        applications such as gene therapy The strengths of the        ecdysoneinducible system appear to be its tight        regulation its dose responsiveness and the favorable        uptake and clearance kinetics of the inducer which results        in rapid gene switching Thus it appears ideal for both the        in vitro and in vivo study of newly characterized genes in        their role in tumor formation and progression In vitro        data indicates that our constructs when used in combination        with GSE offer an excellent induction profile and rapid        decay of gene expression when the compound is removed from        in vitro culture Importantly we have demonstrated similar        kinetics for  different cancer cell lines with  different        reporters Fluc and SEAP thus validating the generality        of the observed results In addition these constructs are        also associated with a low baseline gene expression level        allowing the study of genes whose expression may be        incompatible with the generation of constitutively        expressing clones A recent report showed that the        expression of nonmuscle myosin heavy chainB induced by        Muristerone A in vitro    suppressed the subsequent        tumorigenicity of the implanted cells in vivo        The potency and favorable kinetics of the cell lines we        developed in conjunction with GSE as an ecdysonesystem        inducer in vitro in both the pancreatic and bladder cell        lines led us to evaluate the performance of this system in        vivo in a bladder cancer xenograft model The advantages of        the MBT murine bladder tumor model are several fold        First it was derived by chemical carcinogenesis the most        common known etiologic factor in bladder cancer Second        when inoculated orthotopically it reproduces the biology of        human muscle invasive bladder cancer Thirdly it has been        widely used as a model system of various therapeutic        interventions in bladder cancer     Interestingly        our data indicates that the kinetics of induction of tumor        luciferase in response to GSE mirror those observed with        transgenic mice in response to PonA    This finding        may indicate that despite their use in a malignant context        the ecdysone constructs behave with similar kinetics to        that in normal cells thus implying a general utility in        studies of various histological tumor types In addition        comparison of the in vivo Figure B and in vitro Figure        A induction curves reveals roughly similar time to peak        induction despite the fact that the in vivo experiments        were carried out with a mixture of GSE in sesame seed oil        which purportedly slows its delivery           Although available to us the identification of cell        specific expression within the tumor using the induction of        GFP in these tumor cells was complicated by the decrease in        the level of GFP expression presumably due to position        effect variegation of the transfected DNA In addition the        utility of GFP for the localization of gene expression in        vivo particularly in conditions of hypoxia such as        tumors has been recently been questioned     Finally        quantitative analysis of tumor GFP induction is difficult        and less reliable than other reporters such as luciferase        Therefore we have limited our in vivo experiments        determining the general level of gene induction within the        tumor by using a luciferase reporter which has been proven        to be reliable in vivo                    Conclusions        We have used a modified ecdysone reporter system which        has favorable baseline and induction kinetics in response        to a novel ecdysone analog GSE in murine tumors in vitro        We have demonstrated the general applicability of this        system by demonstrating its use in two different mouse        tumor cell lines integration of the RHeoSwitch DNA        components at multiple chromosomal locations as well as        with  different gene reporters luciferase and SEAP We        have presented data that is the first demonstration of        tumor cell lines stably transfected with an ecdysone        inducible constructs tested in vivo demonstrating that in        vivo these constructs coupled with GSE allow rapid and        robust induction of gene expression in tumor xenografts        Finally due to the rapid decay of gene expression        following maximal activation this system can be easily        titrated for the duration of the induction necessary by        using slow release formulations such as ALZET mini pumps            The postgenomic era has accentuated the need to        develop methods to determine in vivo gene function in        cancer and this ecdysone system may be a useful approach to        address this                    materials

pVPmRXR          pRLTK Renilla luciferase and pGALEGFP The plasmids          pGALEcR encodes a fusion protein between the yeast GAL          DNA binding domain and the ligand binding domain of the          ecdysone receptor from the spruce budworm Choristoneura          occidentalis Plasmid pVPmRXR encodes a fusion protein          between the transcriptional transactivator VP from          Herpes simplex virus HSV and the mouse RXR protein The          vector pRLTK Promega expressing the Renilla          luciferase enzyme from the HSV thymidine kinase TK          promoter was included as an uninduced constitutively          expressed internal control The vector pGALEGFP was          constructed from pCIneo Promega by replacing the CMV          promoter and enhancer with a fragment from pGluc          Promega containing the   GAL recognition sequences          and the minimal promoter from the adenoviral late          promoter and the EGFP gene from pEGFP Clontech In          addition to the GALEGFP expression cassette this          plasmid contains the neomycin resistance gene under the          control of the SV promoter and enhancer for selection          of transfected cells in G                          Transfection and isolation of clones stably          transfected with inducible reporter gene plasmids          Cells were transfected by electroporation with          mixtures of the four plasmids which had been linearized          by restriction enzyme digestion Following transfection          cells were allowed to recover for  h prior and were          then selected in  gml G for MBT cells and           gml G for Panc cells for three weeks Cells were          then cloned by limited dilution into  well plates          Expression of green fluorescent protein GFP was induced          by addition of GSE          AmethoxyethylbenzoylAdimethylbenzoylAtertbutylhydrazine          GSE is a member of the bisacylhydrazine chemical family          which has been shown to have no adverse effects over a          broad dosage range in mammals    The  well plates          were visualized under a fluorescent microscope before and          after addition of the compound Clones exhibiting low          background of green fluorescence prior to addition of the          compound and high levels following the addition were          selected for further transfections          Cell clones were transiently transfected using          Superfect reagent with  g per well of  well plate with          either pFRluc Promega or pGALSEAP secreted alkaline          phosphatase provided by Dr R Herzig Rheogene Inc          and  g carrier DNA pLITMUS New England Biolabs To          three wells DMSO was added to a final concentration of           vv GSE in DMSO was added to the remaining three          wells to a final GSE concentration of  M and DMSO          concentration of  Cells were treated for  hours          at which time they were collected in Passive Lysis Buffer          and the activity of firefly and Renilla luciferase in the          cell extract was determined The clone exhibiting the          highest level of induced gene expression was then used          for further development These cells where in turn          cotransfected with pSVZeo Invitrogen and pGluc          Promega encoding firefly luciferase or pGALSEAP and          MBT cells were selected in  gml Zeocin and Panc          cells in  gml Zeocin Zeocin resistant cells were          then cloned by limiting dilution into  well plates          Replica plates were then created and induction of          luciferase activity in response to GSE carried out as          for GFP Clones exhibiting low background luciferase          expression prior to addition of the compound and high          levels following the addition were selected for further          in vivo and in vitro study                          Measurement of reporter protein levels in vitro and          in vivo          To determine the luciferase activity cells or tissues          were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer Promega and assayed          for firefly Fluc and Renilla RLuc luciferase          according to the Promega Luciferase assay kit          instructions in a Turner Designs Sunnyvale CA TD          or a PharMingen Monolight  luminometer The          luciferase activity was recorded as Relative Light Units          RLU          For the determination of SEAP levels cells were          treated with DMSO or GSE for  hours Media was removed          from all cultures and either assayed or stored at           degrees until assayed Assays were performed using the          chemiluminescent SEAP assay procedure as described by the          manufacturer in the Great EscAPe SEAP Assay system          Clontech The chemiluminescent signal was measured with          a PharMingen Monolight  luminometer and recorded as          Relative Light Units RLU                          In vivo tumor assays          Sixto weekold CHHe origin mice were obtained          from Taconic Farms  wwwtaconiccom and maintained          strictly according to approved Institutional Animal Care          and Use Committee protocols Food and water were provided          ad libitum Cohorts of mice were given injections in the          anterior flank  sites per mouse with  tumor cells          suspended in  ml of serum free medium Mice were          examined every week and tumors were measured with          calipers in the greatest  diameters When tumors reached           mm in greatest diameter mice were injected          intraperitoneally with either  milligrams of GSE          dissolved in  l of DMSO and  l of sesame oil or          with equivalent volumes of DMSO and  l of sesame oil          alone Cohorts of  mice were euthanized   and           hours following drug administration and cohorts of  mice          euthanized  and  hours following vehicle          administration and tumors processed for luciferase          activity as described above To evaluate the reporter          induction the ratio of RLU from firefly Fluc and          Renilla RLuc luciferase was evaluated          RLUFlucRLURluc This time course was based on          the pharmacokinetics of PonA following this route of          administration                             Statistical analysis
