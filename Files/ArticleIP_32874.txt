expletives deleted policy so as not tooffend their readers In a speech on Monday to mark Syrian Army Day Tlassattacked Arafat for selling out to Israel over Jerusalem and for kowtowing toPresident Clinton You son of  whores he said You shouldnt havebeen so cowardly and submissive at the White House  But you just stoodthere like a black cat and didnt dare say a word about Palestine andJerusalem

President Hafez Assad sought peace withIsrael only so that he would be able to pass on his job to his son repliedwith vigor to Tlass outburst The general could not be taken seriously wroteAbdelbari Atwan in an editorial for his greatest achievements have not beenin the battlefield in Palestine or the Golan but in composing romantic poetryextolling beautiful women Atwan said Tlass should be reminded how the femaledefense minister of a Scandinavian country once complained of the disgracefulway in which he made a pass at her when she was on a visit to Damascus Perhaps that would embarrass him into retiring having plumbed depths ofbehavior unworthy of a scout guide let alone the defense minister of a countryon whose role in recovering usurped Arab rights so much hope was pinnedAlQuds alArabi attributed Tlass outburst in part to a redcarpetwelcome Arafat gave recently to Assads nephew Sumer Rifat a possible rivalof his son Bashars for the succession            InIsrael Haaretz led
