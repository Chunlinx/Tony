                       PapistDefines Papal Bull                        I note the headline inTodaysPapers March  by Scott Shuger Papal Bull Clearly this refers tothe important Vatican document We Remember a reflection on the Shoah Thedocument expresses repentance for actions of Catholics during the Shoah Ofcourse this document is historic and groundbreaking but it is not a bull            I quotefrom The Church Visible The Ceremonial Life and Protocol of the RomanCatholic Church  by JamesCharles Noonan Jr Page             Apostolic bull A documentthat derives its name from the Latin bulla  meaning leaden seal whichis used to imprint the reigning popes insignia or seal on the document Themost solemn of the papal documents the bull creates a prelate a cardinalalthough the biglietto announces it Bishops are officially appointedby the papal bull as are other highranking officials It is also the documentthat announces beatifications and canonizations            I recommend this book for                  Slate               s reference libraryit has all manner of interesting factsabout the Catholic Church and is quite authoritative            I knowthat many people commonly use the term papal bull to describe almost anydocument coming from the Holy See but you are                   Slate                and thusseek the highest standards Todays Papers is a helpful

Lying Lawyers                        David Feiges comments aboutLying Lawyers werenot far off targetif the target was set up in New York state in about But since he appears to be talking about lawyers functioning in the UnitedStates generally and he appears to be talking about  and  hes noteven close            As many of your readers mayknowbut Lawyer Feige apparently does notthe American Bar Associationadopted a new code in  known as the Model Rules of Professional ConductThe model rules have been adopted usually with amendments in more than US jurisdictions not including New York The model rules explicitlyreject virtually everything Feige said in his Gist piece            Im thecoauthor of one the leading treatises on legal ethicsand its updatedannually But dont take my word for it Ask any current teacher of legalethics in any law school in the United States  including a law school inNew York             W WilliamHodes Professor of lawIndiana University School of LawIndianapolis                                             DavidFeige replies The point of my piece was not to examine the minordifferences between the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and theModel Code of Professional Responsibility a subject that I am sureProfessor Hodes has examined in a more lengthy tomebut rather to discuss theapplication of the code or rules in the real world                                       It issurprising to me that someone as well known and erudite as Hodes can fail tograsp the simple thesis of my piecethat lawyers apply their analytical skillsto the rules of professional responsibility much as they do to any other textThat people want zealous advocates to defend their interests and as aconsequence zealousness tends to gain the upper hand in the battle betweenaggressive advocacy and restrained dignified legal conduct Lawyers willinterpret the rules to maximize their ability to do what they believe is in thebest interests of their clients and this is made easier by the porousconstruction of both the Rules and the Code  Whether this is agood thing is a subject worth discussing whether it happens is obvious Andnot just in the South Bronx where I practice but in every jurisdiction frommunicipal court to federal court in Code states and Rule statesalike                                       WeisbergWatcher                        Im going to break withtradition and write about something Ive enjoyed recently about                  Slate                rather than something about which I have ants in the pantsThroughout the year and a half that Ive been reading his column in                  Slate                the tone of Jacob Weisbergs columns has consistently beensomewhat cynical and worldly about the political process he covers In recentcolumns however I have greatly enjoyed seeing his intelligent skepticismpointed as much toward the media as toward the politicians Whats mostnoticeable about his columns on the Clinton scandal is that his viewpoint isunique among all those emanating from Washington Its not a JamesCarvillestyle partisan critique one could hardly peg Weisberg as a Clintonfan and its not a Molly Ivinsstyle quit drooling over inconsequential sexcritique Its a critique that takes on the cultural attitude and assumptionsof the press and how those assumptions slant their journalism and itsrefreshing            The mostrecent column Betty and Monica makes a muchneeded point about thesubtly condescending nature of traditional journalisms attitude towardsuccessful blacks a column in the future might explore the press similarattitude toward the Southern population of the country From the article aboutthe Georgetown establishments distaste for the Clintons through theDispatchentries and the column about why the press feels the need to takeClinton down I have greatly enjoyed Weisbergs writings Moreimportantlyand much rarerI have learned a lot Keep up the good
