        all right   have you ever been drug tested   um thats a good question um       i had a job i had to go get a blood test for   uhhuh   um and they and they did a full blood screen       on me but they didnt call that a drug test so that i think they checked for drugs they just dont  tell you they did   yeah       i had ive had uh two or three drug tests that i had to get before i could start working at a job   uhhuh   uh different jobs i had one at TI and then one at another engineering company and really i mean i dont mind them i dont do drugs anyway i guess if i did maybe i would but um i dont know i know a girl that shes a nurse and they get drug tested randomly ive never been randomly drug tested   uhhuh   but that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that youre going to be drug tested and you didnt know about it   yeah well i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about   yeah i guess so       i guess so do you think that its right   well uh uh i i come from kind of a biased opinion because im a a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor   uhhuh   and ive done employee assistant work and i i know the the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job   right   that are specifically drug and alcohol related and its like in the billions of dollars every year   right   um and the the only way that they can prevent that is is you know making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free   thats true   and you know the the problem in the work place is that that people are like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever i mean you can come to come to work drunk and get in an accident and hell cover up for you and nobody knows about it but could you know ends up costing the company lots and lots of money   right thats true   so you know there   i believe its right especially for certain jobs       i think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that i think they should be randomly drug tested i believe full force in that   uhhuh yeah yeah   i dont know that i believe every secretary in every company needs to be   true   you know secretaries arent arent really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something so i dont know i im kind of biased too because i dont do drugs and so i really dont care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me because i have nothing to worry about   uhhuh yeah   so i guess thats kind of biased   yeah well and its i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job   yeah it does   if somebody else is impaired because  generally you know it um you find out one way or another if somebodys got a problem on the job   yeah thats true   and if even even if like you say even if its just the secretary if her work or abilities start affecting her coworkers then it its still a problem   yeah thats true   so   but what do you do about the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before and you know its its been the whole weekend since theyve done anything and they happen to be tested Monday morning       and they could be fired for that you know that thats kind of unfair also   well yeah i guess it comes with the turf   yeah i guess so i guess if youre going to do it you need to suffer the consequences   yeah and then youre in in in terms of drugs theyre illegal so youre   thats true   youre breaking the law anyway   thats true   um probably the the biggest problem with those is they dont do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol   thats true   and thats probably the biggest problem there is   yeah i think so more than drugs         and i know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab   yeah   they would pay for an alcohol but they dont always pay for drug rehabilitation   uhhuh well i guess thats one of the positive things that has has come out of it some of the employee assistance program if you do test positive for something   yeah   they will give you an opportunity opportunity opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job   thats true   and i think   i think thats fair   yeah and i think the benefits the company benefits in the long run   yeah thats true thats about all i have to say on it     what what kind of testing do they do when you went   uh its a urine test and they uh   urine screen yeah   it was really very official you have to go in a room solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours and       and you have to fill the bottle yourself and label it yourself and all of that so that theyre sure that you havent borrowed anybodys i guess or something   uhhuh well that happens   yeah i know i cant its hard to believe but i guess it does   it happens a lot there there are people that know pay other people for that   i know im amazed at the things people will do   to help them out   yeah   it is amazing i guess there are people that do that and they are those are expensive tests im glad i never had to pay for one   yeah yeah it depends really really really on how how strong a test it is theyve got different degrees as far as as how far back they can check   yeah i guess so   they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests theyve theyve got some companies that are doing um hair tests   oh really   yeah well that theyll pull out one of your hairs and they can apparently test um back a certain period of time   how weird i didnt know  that   um because um some of the the residue ends up in your hair follicles you know its kind of   oh thats weird   hair follicles i guess are just dead protein and they   yeah   and it its apparently almost almost like a a calendar they theyve got it pretty precise now that they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and and that type of thing   thats wild   so   its amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body   yeah so i guess if they perfect that and then its not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that   yeah thats true   thats true im glad i never had to do that by giving blood  i cant stand the thought of giving blood   uhhuh   i cant even do it for Wadley even though its a good cause   yeah   well i enjoyed talking to you   well i did too   thank you   uhhuh bye bye   bye bye
