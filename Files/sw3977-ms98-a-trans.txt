would get  i always get people from Texas   im i i i just i never call anybody i just let them call me   do you thats probably why i always call because i figure its easier that way   yeah   than trying to catch me at home  well okay are you ready for me to push one okay     sure       okay what kind of exercise do you do or do you do any   um i do some not a lot  im kind of lazy um   well i am a couch potato   yeah  i know how that is  i do play like racquetball a lot thats fun i like that the best   ive never played racquetball no uh   you havent  well im in college and i took it as a class like last semester and i just loved it i thought it was great its really a lot of fun   uhhuh   its not real hard now im taking like weight training and i hate it its so dumb   ive tried weight training i just i just cant get into it  no it   really it seems so pointless   and it well i dont like having the sore muscles i like to run jog   do you   yeah i i used to jog about six miles a day and then i i tore the ligaments in my ankle so i i dont really run that much but i i i jog some about a mile or so now   oh my gosh uhhuh   when i have time   yeah i know im not real into like aerobics are anything like that only exercise when i have to i mean   yeah thats thats basically me   you know im kind of im really bad about it   im im i exercise more in in the summer and spring than i do um like this time of year because   yeah when the weathers nicer is it really   it its too cold here  yeah well i i i think forty degrees is too cold so   yeah  little cold for you i know thats how i am too because i i love going outside and stuff when its warmer and stuff but otherwise i wont i mean i wont go work out or i wont jog i wont go outside ill just stay at home you know on the couch watching TV or renting movies or something   yeah thats thats basically what i do i like  i like to um to walk too i i guess they said its a good form of exercise i guess uh if you consider that exercise i walk a lot   yeah do you   but i i have such a normal fast pace so it i dont really i dont really think its   it its its nothing  or it could be your exercise for the week right   right i because i mean i ive always walked fast so i i dont know i need to get on a some kind of exercise program though because im im starting to gain weight im getting at that age where  you dont need to start putting on the pounds   oh listen to you uhhuh theyll catch up with you     yeah it it has caught up with me in the past year or so ive ive put on about twelve pounds so i need to work and get it off i thought about doing a diet but i really dont need to diet i i just need to   really exercise   exercise i think   yeah it sort of that does make you feel better though i had to admit that you know after   yeah because when i get off work i usually come home and fix dinner and watch TV and then im tired i take a nap whatever   yeah yeah see after work i dont know  i think if i worked all day theres no way i would do anything   oh i work i work eight to five so i mean   yeah so then when youre home youre like okay i just want to relax and not think about work and definitely not exercise you want to eat   right i i do accounting and and its on a computer all day and im so brain dead when i get off work its kind of like just dont even talk to me just let me sit here and vegetate so   yeah youre probably drained and probably exercising probably wouldnt help   well i dont i dont know  i they say once you once you get in a routine of exercising it gives you a lot more energy energy i know when i ran um i kind of got like addicted to it   uhhuh   you know you see these people um i never was die hard you know they they had a story on the news about uh people becoming addicted its like uh people that do drugs its its a high for them   that have to do it see ive heard that   ive got a couple uh uh a real good friend of mine that i went to school with lives here too she works for The News and Observer and shes the one who got me started running in in college and i i was never   uhhuh   die hard like she was it was we had a sleet storm and she was outside running in it icicles hanging down and all this other kind of stuff and i i told her she was crazy but she runs about thirteen miles now   oh my gosh yeah oh my gosh   shes really training and i when we were in college we both chain smoked like freight trains and she would get out and run everyday and it never would bother her and its like it dont bother me   uhhuh hm   and her husband made her stop after she got married her husband made her stop so so now shes just like   really thatd be like   channeling all of her energy into running now   yeah thats good though but i just God
