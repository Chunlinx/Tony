TestimonyGAOBefore the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government ManagementRestructuring and the District of Columbia Committee onGovernmental Affairs US SenateGAOTGGDStatementManagement Reform Elements of Successful ImprovementInitiativesMr Chairman and Members of the SubcommitteeWe are pleased to be here today to contribute to theSubcommittees ongoing efforts to identify ways to improve themanagement and performance of the federal government As you knowlast January we issued a new volume of reports the Performance andAccountability Series outlining the major management challengesconfronting our largest federal agencies and the substantialopportunities for improving their performance Many of thechallenges discussed in that series represent longstandingdifficult and complex problems that our work has shown will not beeasily or quickly resolved In fact implementing and sustainingmajor change initiatives requires a cultural transformation formany agencies Therefore given the magnitude of the problems anagency may face and the extensive effort and long period of timeit can take before problems are fully resolved progress must oftenbe measured initially in terms of whether the agency has a wellthought out management improvement initiative in place to guide itsreform effortsAs agreed with the Subcommittee this morning we will discussthe elements that our wideranging work on federal managementissues suggests are particularly important in implementing andsustaining management improvement initiatives that genuinely takeroot and eventually resolve the problems they are intended to fixThese elements are  a demonstrated leadership commitment andaccountability for change  the integration of managementimprovement initiatives into programmatic decisionmaking thoughtful and rigorous planning to guide decisions particularlyto address human capital and information technology issues employee involvement to elicit ideas and build commitment andaccountability  organizational alignment to streamlineoperations and clarify accountability and  strong andcontinuing congressional involvement Not surprisingly theelements of successful management improvement initiatives that wewill discuss today are consistent with the approaches shared byperformancebased management efforts under the GovernmentPerformance and Results Act Results Act and quality managementthat we discussed in our July   statement for thisSubcommittee Our statement today is based on our broad body ofwork and resulting knowledge of management issues including ourexamination of the implementation of the Results Act and relatedinitiatives our reviews of selected National Partnership forReinventingMaj or Management Challenges and Program RisksGAOOCGSET January Management Reform Using the Results Act and Quality Managementto Improve Federal Performance  GAOTGGD July  Page  GAOTGGDDemonstrated Leadership Commitment and Accountability forChangeGovernment NPR recommendations and our ongoing analyses ofagencyspecific improvement efforts such as the Internal RevenueService IRS modernizationPerhaps the single most important element of successfulmanagement improvement initiatives is the demonstrated commitmentof top leaders to change This commitment is most prominently shownthrough the personal involvement of top leaders in developing anddirecting reform efforts Organizations that successfully addresstheir longstanding management weaknesses do not staff outresponsibility for leading change Top leadership involvement andclear lines of accountability for making management improvementsare critical to overcoming organizations natural resistance tochange marshalling the resources needed in many cases to improvemanagement and building and maintaining the organizationwidecommitment to new ways to doing businessCommissioner Rossottis efforts at IRS provide a clear exampleof leaderships commitment to change The Commissioner hasarticulated a new mission for the agency together with support forstrategic goals that balance customer service and compliance withtax laws Moreover the Commissioner has initiated a modernizationeffort that touches virtually every aspect of the agency includingbusiness practices organizational structure management roles andresponsibilities performance measures and technologyCommissioner Rossotti has assigned clear executive ownership ofeach of IRS major initiatives and is using executive steeringcommittees to provide oversight and accountability for driving thechange effortsSustaining top leadership commitment to improvement isparticularly challenging in the federal government because of thefrequent turnover of senior agency political officials As aresult sustaining improvement initiatives requires commitment andleadership by senior career executives as well as politicalleaders Career executives can help provide the longterm focusneeded to institutionalize reforms that political executives oftenmore limited tenure does not permit In addition the otherelements of successful management improvement initiatives that weshall turn to shortly are important for institutionalizing reforminitiativesIRS new mission statement reads Provide Americas taxpayerstop quality service by helping them understand and meet their taxresponsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity andfairness to all IRS supporting strategic goals are to provide top quality service to each taxpayer  provide serviceto all taxpayers by applying the law with integrity and fairnessand  increase productivity by providing a quality workenvironment for its employeesPage  GAOTGGDIntegration of Management Improvement Initiatives intoProgrammatic DecisionmakingTraditionally the danger to any management reform is that itcan become a hollow paperdriven exercise where managementimprovement initiatives are not integrated into the daytodayactivities of the organization Thus successful organizationsrecognizeand implement reform efforts on the basis oftheessential connection between sound management and the programmaticresults those organizations hope to achieveThe Results Act provides a readymade statutory mechanism formaking this essential connection engaging Congress in a discussionof how and when management problems will be addressed and helpingto pinpoint additional efforts that may be needed We have foundthat annual performance plans that include precise and measurablegoals for resolving missioncritical management problems areimportant to ensuring that agencies have the institutional capacityto achieve their more resultsoriented programmatic goals Moreoverby using annual performance plans to set goals to addressmanagement weaknesses agencies provide themselves and Congresswith a vehiclethe subsequent agency performance reportsfortracking progress in addressing management problems and consideringwhat if any additional efforts are neededUnfortunately we found that agencies do not consistentlyaddress major management challenges and program risks in theirfiscal year  performance plans In those cases wherechallenges and risks are addressed agencies use a variety ofapproaches including setting goals and measures directly linked tothe management challenges and program risks establishing goals andmeasures that are indirectly related to the challenges and risksor laying out strategies to address them Figure  shows thedistribution of the  agencies covered by the Chief FinancialOfficers Act and their different approaches to addressingmanagement challenges and program risks in their annual performanceplansManaging for Results Opportunities for Continued Improvementsin Agencies Performance Plans  GAOGGDAIMD July  Page  GAOTGGDFigure  Approaches Used to Address Management Challenges andProgram RisksNote Numbers do not add up to  percent due to roundingSource GAO analysis based on agencies fiscal year performance plansIRS has important management reform initiatives underway toaddress longstanding management weaknesses but it missed theopportunity to demonstrate these actions in its portion of theDepartment of the Treasurys fiscal year  performance plan Forexample the Department of the Treasurys plan has no goalsmeasures or strategies to address several of the highrisk areaswe have identified at IRS includinginternal control weaknesses over unpaid tax assessmentsWe found that the lack of a subsidiary ledger impairs IRS abilityto effectively manage its unpaid assessments This weakness hasresulted in IRS inappropriately directing collection effortsagainst taxpayers after amounts owed have been paidthe need to assess the impact of various efforts IRS hasunder way to reduce filing fraudthe need to improve security controls over informationsystems and address weaknesses that place sensitive taxpayer dataat risk to both internal and external threats Our highrisk updatereported that IRSThese areas are characterized as highrisk because of theirgreater vulnerability to waste fraud abuse andmismanagementPage  GAOTGGDcontrols do not adequately reduce vulnerability to inappropriatedisclosure and weaknesses in internal controls over taxpayer receiptsSimilarly the General Services Administrations GSA fiscalyear  annual performance plan does not address severallongstanding problems identified by the GSA Inspector GeneralThese problems include top managements lack of emphasis onensuring that the internal controls are in place to deter fraudwaste and abuse GSAs plan also does not fully address issuesraised by the Inspector General related to developing newmanagement information systems and ensuring that automatedinformation systems have the proper controls and safeguards Theseomissions are significant because GSAs governmentwide oversightand serviceprovider role its extensive interaction with theprivate sector and the billions of taxpayer dollars involved incarrying out its activities make it especially important thatGSAs operations be adequately protectedThoughtful and Rigorous Planning to Guide DecisionsThe magnitude of the challenges that many agencies face inaddressing their management weaknesses necessitates substantiveplanning be done to establish  clear goals and objectives forthe improvement initiativethe concrete management improvement steps that will betaken  key milestones that will be used to track theimplementation status andthe cost and performance data that will be used to gaugeoverall progress in addressing identified weaknesses Our workacross the federal government has found the effective use of humancapital and information technologyboth separately andimportantly as they relate to one anotherare areas wherethoughtful and rigorous planning is needed if fundamentalmanagement improvements are to be madeFor example we looked at the efforts of four agencies theDepartments of Agriculture Health and Human Services Interiorand Veterans Affairs to both improve services and reduce staffinglevels in their personnel offices through the better application ofinformation technology The agencies planned to increase operatingefficiencies and improve services by automating paperbasedpersonnel processes The agencies expected that new hardware andorsoftware technology would reduce paperwork and workload therebypermitting sizable staff reductions However the agencies made thestaffing reductions before much of the new automation was in placeand automation efforts had not been fully implemented as ofManagement Reform Agencies Initial Efforts to RestructurePersonnel Operations GAOGGDJuly  Page  GAOTGGDlate  As a result the agencies were struggling to achievetheir efficiency and service improvement objectivesOn a more positive note we recently reviewed the efforts ofthree agencies the Postal Service the Department of VeteransAffairs VA and the Park Service to more strategically managetheir facilities and assets by forming business partnerships withthe private sector In each of the six partnerships that wereviewed the agency built the expertise to engage in thepartnership and make it successful For example the Department ofVeterans Affairs established a separate organizational unit staffedwith professionals experienced in management architecture civilengineering and contracting to manage its partnershipsWith regard to planning for major technology projects IRS hashistorically lacked disciplined and structured processes fordeveloping and managing information technology We reported inFebruary  that IRS had not clearly defined system modernizationphases nor had it adequately specified organizational rolesmaking it unclear who was to do what IRS systems modernizationchallenges include completing a modernization blueprint to definedirect and control future modernization efforts and establishingthe management and engineering capability to build and acquiremodernized systems The key to effectively addressing thesechallenges is to ensure that longstanding modernization managementand technical weaknesses are corrected before IRS invests largesums of modernization funds As we have reported IRS recentlyinitiated appropriate first steps to address these weaknesses viaits initial modernization expenditure plan that represents thefirst step in a longterm incremental modernization programThe Census Bureau through its effective use of technology inexpanding the electronic availability of census data demonstrateshow federal agencies can leverage performance and customersatisfaction through the better use of technology Before applyingtechnology to its data

for releasing data from the CensusSuccessful management improvement efforts require the activeinvolvement of managers and staff throughout the organization toprovide ideas for improvements and supply the energy and expertiseneeded to implement changes Employees at all levels ofhighperforming organizations participate inand have a stakeinimproving operational and program performance to achieveresults Our work has shown that highperforming organizations usea number of strategies and techniques to effectively involveemployees including  fostering a performanceoriented culture working to develop a consensus with unions on goals andstrategies  providing the training that staff need to workeffectively and  devolving authority while focusingaccountability on resultsFostering a performanceoriented culture requires agencymanagement to communicate with staff throughout the organization toinvolve them in the process of designing and implementing changeSetting improvement goals is an important step in gettingorganizations across the government to engage seriously in thedifficult task of change The central features of the ResultsActstrategic planning performance measurement and publicreporting and accountabilitycan serve as powerful tools to helpchange the basic culture of government Involving employees indeveloping and implementing these goals and measures can helpdirect a diverse array of actions to improve performance andachieve results However our survey of federal managers conductedin late  and  indicates there is substantial room forimprovement in this area This survey found that only onethird ofnonSES managers as opposed to nearly threefourths of the SESmanagers reported they had been involved in establishing longtermstrategic goals for their agenciesEmployees in highperforming organizations understand theimportance of and the connection between their performance and theorganizationsThe Government Performance and Results Act  GovernmentwideImplementation Will Be Uneven GAOGGD June  Page  GAOTGGDsuccess The failure to constructively involve staff in anorganizations improvement efforts means running the risk that thechanges will be more difficult and protracted than necessary Forexample in the fall of  the Nuclear Regulatory CommissionsNRC Office of Inspector General surveyed NRC staff to obtaintheir views on the agencys safety culture In its June report the Inspector General noted that the staff had a strongcommitment to protecting public health and safety but expressedhigh levels of uncertainty and confusion about the new directionsin regulatory practices and challenges facing the agency Employeeswho are confused about the direction their agency is taking willnot be able to effectively focus on results or make as full acontribution as they might otherwiseOne way highperforming organizations can enhance employeeinvolvement and gain agreement on an organizations goals andstrategies is by developing partnerships with employee unions TheUS Postal Services longstanding challenges in labormanagementrelations illustrate the importance of having a shared set oflongterm goals and strategies agreed upon by managers employeesand unions As we have reported labormanagement relations at thePostal Service have been characterized by disagreements that haveamong other things hampered efforts to automate some postalsystems that could have resulted in savings and helped the Servicereach its performance goals Although there has been someprogress problems persist and continue to contribute to highermail processing and delivery costs To help the Postal Serviceresolve its problems we have long recommended that the Service andits unions and management associations establish a frameworkagreement to outline common goals We have also noted that theResults Act can provide an effective framework for union andmanagement representatives to discuss and agree upon goals andstrategiesEmployees capabilities also play an important role in achievingperformance improvements and training is a key factor enablingemployee involvement Agencies that expect their employees to takegreater responsibility and be held accountable for results mustensure that the employees have the training and tools they need tofulfill these expectations In that regard IRS is beginning toimplement significant changes that will require training forfrontline employees and their supervisors For example in lieu ofhiring a large number of seasonalMajor Management Challenges and Program Risks A GovernmentwidePerspective  GAOOCGJanuary Major Management Challenges and Program Risks US Postal Service GAOOCG JanuaryPage  GAOTGGDemployees to handle return processing workload during the annualfiling season IRS plans to increase the number of permanentemployees and expand their job responsibilities to includecompliance work that they can do after the filing season Thoseemployees will have to be crosstrained so that they can handleboth their return processing and compliance responsibilitiesTraining is expected to be a key factor in IRS efforts to providetopquality customer service Further given the dynamicenvironment agencies face employees need incentives training andsupport to help them continually learn and adapt Our survey found that about  percent or more of the supervisors andmanagers reported that their agencies had not provided them withthe training necessary to accomplish critical resultsorientedmanagement tasksHighperforming organizations also seek to involve and engageemployees by devolving authority to lower levels of theorganization Employees are more likely to support changes whenthey have the necessary amount of authority and flexibilityalongwith commensurate accountability and incentivesto advance theagencys goals and improve performance Allowing employees to bringtheir expertise and judgement to bear in meeting theirresponsibilities can help agencies capitalize on their employeestalents leading to more effective and efficient operations andimproved customer service Some federal agencies such as theSocial Security Administration SSA are exploring new ways toinvolve employees by devolving decisionmaking authority Althoughthe efficacy of this initiative has not been fully assessed SSAhas been implementing a pilot program to establish a singledecision maker position This program expands the authority ofdisability examiners who currently make initial disabilitydeterminations jointly with physicians and allows the singledecision maker to make the initial disability determination andconsult with physicians only as neededOur work has shown that agencies can improve the extent to whichthey devolve authority for employees to make decisions and theextent to which they hold employees accountable for results Our survey of federal managers found that less than onethirdof nonSES managers felt that to a great or very great extent theyhad the decisionmaking authority needed to accomplish strategicgoals Likewise only about half of the managers we Executive Guide Effectively Implementing the GovernmentPerformance and Results Act  GAOGGD June SSA Disability Redesign Actions Needed To Enhance FutureProgress GAOHEHS Mar Page  GAOTGGDsurveyed reported that they were being held accountable forprogram resultsOur work has also shown that agencies can do a better job ofproviding incentives to encourage employees to improve performanceand achieve results Only onefourth of nonSES managers reportedthat to a great or very great extent employees received positiverecognition from their agencies for efforts to help accomplishstrategic goals At the request of this Subcommittee we aresurveying federal managers again to follow up on whether there havebeen improvements in these critical areasSome agencies have explored new ways of devolving decisionmakingauthority in exchange for operational flexibility andaccountability for results For example in fiscal year  theVeterans Health Administration VHA management structure wasdecentralized to form  Veterans Integrated Service Networks VAgave these networks substantial operational autonomy and theability to perform basic decisionmaking and budgetary duties VAmade the networks accountable for results such as improving patientaccess efficiency and reducing costs VA also establishedperformance measures such as increasing the number of outpatientsurgeries reducing the use of inpatient care and increasing thenumber of highpriority veterans served to hold network and medicalcenter directors accountable for resultsOrganizational Alignment to Streamline Operations and ClarifyAccountabilitySuccessful management improvement efforts often entailorganizational realignment to better achieve results and clarifyaccountability For example GSA has sought to improve itsefficiency and effectiveness by changing its organizationalstructure to separate its policymaking functions from itsoperations that provide services GSA recognized that it sufferedfrom conflicting policymaking and serviceproviding roles andneeded to replace its outmoded methods of delivering service Toaddress this issue GSA established the Office of Policy Planningand Evaluation in  which it later renamed the Office ofGovernmentwide Policy to handle policy decisions separately fromfunctions that deliver supplies or services GSA believes that thisrealignment has improved efficiency and reduced the perception ofconflict of interest that existed prior to the separation of itspolicymaking and servicedelivery rolesWhile GSAs efforts thus far are an important reform additionalopportunities for organizational realignment appear to exist ForexampleVA Health Care More Veterans Are Being Served But BetterOversight Is Needed GAOHEHS Aug  Page  GAOTGGDthe GSA Inspector General has expressed concerns that GSAsorganization and management structure has not kept pace with GSAsdownsizing streamlining and reform efforts In addition theInspector General has said that GSAs organizational structure doesnot seem to match the responsibility for managing programs with theauthority to do so As a result for example GSA has facedsituations where regions which operate independently have takendivergent positions on similar issues according to the InspectorGeneralIRS ongoing efforts provide another example of the importanceof aligning organizational structures As Commissioner Rossotti hasstated IRS current cumbersome organizational structure andinadequate technology are the principal obstacles to deliveringdramatic improvements in customer service and productivity TheCommissioner is reorganizing IRS with the aim of building anorganization designed around taxpayer groups and creatingmanagement roles with clear responsibilities One of the firstorganizational realignments taking place is in the Office of theTaxpayer Advocate This office is intended to among other thingshelp taxpayers who cannot get their problems resolved throughnormal IRS channels Formerly the Advocates Office had to rely onfunctional groups within IRS like examination and collection toprovide most of its program resourcesincluding staff space andequipment When functional needs conflicted with Advocate Officeneeds there was no assurance that advocate needs would be met Inthe new organization all advocate program resources will becontrolled and managed by the Taxpayer Advocate By organizing thisway IRS hopes to improve both program efficiency and service totaxpayersThe organizational realignments at GSA and IRS are consistentwith a more general exploration under way to use streamlined andclarified organizational arrangements to help enhanceaccountability and improve performance For example building onreform efforts in the United Kingdom and other countries theAdministration has proposed creating PerformanceBasedOrganizations PBOs in which selected agencies that delivermeasurable services receive greater organizational autonomy inexchange for heightened accountability for results on the part oftop and senior leadership Last year in an attempt to addresssignificant management and accountability problems with federalstudent financial aid programs Congress enacted the first PBO theOffice of Student Financial Assistance within the Department ofEducation We haveIRS Management IRS Faces Challenges as it Restructures theOffice of the Taxpayer Advocate  GAOGGD July  Page  GAOTGGDidentified the management of student financial aid programswith more than  billion in outstanding student loans as beingat highrisk to waste fraud abuse and mismanagementThe PBO structure exemplifies new directions in accountabilityfor the federal government because the PBOs Chief OperatingOfficer who reports to the Secretary of Education is helddirectly and personally accountable through an employmentcontract for achieving measurable organizational and individualgoals The Chief Operating Officer is appointed by the Secretary ofEducation to a minimum year and a maximum year term and mayreceive a bonus for meeting the performance goals or be removed forfailing to meet themThe Office of Student Financial Assistance was provided withincreased flexibility for procurement and personnel management andkey managers are to be held directly accountable for performanceobjectives that include improving customer satisfaction  providing high qualitycosteffective services and  providing complete accurate andtimely data to ensure program integrity The Chief OperatingOfficer is to enter into annual performance agreements containingmeasurable organization and individual goals with key managers whocan receive a bonus or can also be removedAn additional accountability mechanism is that the ChiefOperating Officer and the Secretary of Education are required toagree on and make public a year performance plan thatestablishes the Offices goals and objectives To furtherunderscore accountability issues the PBOs Chief Operating Officeris to annually prepare and submit to Congress through theSecretary a report on the performance of the PBO The report is toinclude an evaluation of the extent to which the Office met thegoals and objectives contained in the year performance plan Inaddition the annual report is to include  an independentfinancial audit  applicable financial and performancerequirements under the Chief Financial Officers Act and the ResultsAct  the results achieved by the Office relative to its goals an evaluation of the Chief Operating Officers performance recommendations for legislative and regulatory changes to improveservice and program integrity and  other information asdetailed by the Director of the Office of Management andBudgetPage  GAOTGGDStrong and Continuing Congressional InvolvementFinally Congress plays a crucial role in management improvementefforts throughout the executive branch through its legislative andoversight capacities On a governmentwide basis Congress underthe bipartisan leadership of this Committee and the HouseGovernment Reform Committee has established a statutory frameworkconsisting of requirements for goalsetting and performancemeasurement financial management and information technologymanagement all aimed at improving the performance management andaccountability of the federal government Through the enactment ofthe framework and its efforts to foster the frameworksimplementation Congress has in effect served as an institutionalchampion for improving the management of the federal governmentproviding a consistent focus for oversight and reinforcement ofimportant policies On an agencyspecific basis as well supportfrom the Congress has proven to be critical in instituting andsustaining management reforms such as those taking place at IRSGSA and elsewhere across the federal governmentCongress in its oversight role can monitor managementimprovement initiatives and provide the continuing attentionnecessary for reform initiatives to be carried through to theirsuccessful completion Information in agencies plans and reportsproduced under the Results Act high quality financial and programcost data and other related information can help Congress intargeting its oversight efforts and identifying opportunities foradditional improvements in agencies management In this regard wehave long advocated that congressional committees of jurisdictionhold augmented oversight hearings on each of the major agencies atleast once each Congress Congress could examine for example thedegree to which agencies are building the elements of successfulmanagement improvement initiatives that we have discussed todayinto their respective management reform efforts Such hearings willfurther underscore for agencies the importance that Congress placeson creating highperforming government organizations Also throughthe appointment and confirmation process the Senate has an addedopportunity to make clear its commitment to sound federalmanagement and explore what prospective nominees plan to do toensure that their agencies are wellmanaged and striving to behighperforming organizationsIn summary Mr Chairman serious and disciplined efforts areneeded to attack the management problems confronting some of ourlargest agencies Successful management improvement efforts oftencontain a number of common critical elements including topleadership commitment and accountability the integration ofmanagementPage  GAOTGGDimprovement initiatives into programmatic decisions planning tochart the direction the improvements will take employeeinvolvement in the change efforts organizational realignment tostreamline operations and clarify accountability and congressionalinvolvement and oversight Experience has shown that when theseelements are in place lasting management reforms are more likelyto be implemented that ultimately lead to improvements in theperformance and costefficiency of governmentMr Chairman this concludes our prepared statement We would bepleased to
