                            T lymphocytes may have an important role in the pathogenesis of smokingrelated        emphysema according to a new study by researchers from Houston Texas United States We        now know that T cells are not only present in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD        but are harmful comments Steven Shapiro from Brigham and Womens Hospital         Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study We also now        have a pathway that could be interrupted to prevent lung destruction in COPD        Farrah Kheradmand and colleagues took lung samples from  exsmokers who had been        admitted to hospital for lung resection  patients had moderate to severe COPD as well as        evidence of emphysema and ten patients had none The researchers isolated lung lymphocytes        from the samples and used twocolor flow cytometry to phenotypically characterize the        cells They found that lymphocytes taken from patients with emphysema expressed more CCR        and CXCR receptors which are associated with a particular type of T cell called T helper         Th than did those from control individuals By contrast expression of CCR        receptors which are found on T helper  Th cells was very low in both control and        emphysema groups        In a separate experiment Kheradmands team showed that lung lymphocytes taken from        patients with emphysema secreted more of three other proteinsinterferon gamma monokine        induced by interferon MIG and interferoninducible protein  IPthan control        patients MIG and IP are known to be produced by injured epithelial cells and are        ligands for CXCR receptors which are expressed by Th cells Importantly the researchers        were also able to show that isolated peripheral lung macrophages secreted matrix        metalloproteinase MMP an enzyme that degrades elastina protein important for lung        elasticityin the lungs in response to IP and MIG Together these findings say the        authors indicate that Th cells but not Th cells are required for producing the        elastindestroying lung environment of emphysema        The researchers now intend to investigate the antigens that drive the Thbased        inflammation that underlies emphysema Ultimately we seek to understand the biochemistry        of tobacco smoke that triggers inflammation in the first place and whether such insight        might explain other environmentally triggered lung diseases explains Kheradmand To        understand such detailed immune mechanisms we really need an improved experimental model        of disease and this we are currently working on
