                                 Is the Economic Crisis a Crisis for Economics            I have often used thiscolumn to defend economics and economists against their critics It sometimesseems as if no public intellectual be he Irving Kristol or George Soros feelshis rsum is complete until he has published an article or book attackingeconomic theorya project that does not of course require that its authormake much effort to find out what that theory really says Nonethelesseconomists can stand a little informed criticism Right now it seems to methe discipline is in some trouble Specifically the marriage betweenmacroeconomics and microeconomicsan imperfect but workable union achievedhalf a century ago which has allowed economists to combine moderately activistviews about monetary policy with otherwise generally free market beliefsisnow being called into question by events            This isnot an abstract problem It is one with urgent application to the currentglobal economic crisis Conventional microeconomic analysis depends on thepresumed ability of governments to maintain more or less full employment Ifthey cantand if economists cant find a way to resolve the worlds newlyintractable macroeconomic problemsall sorts of heresy become entirelyreasonable And in the end that will be disastrous not just for the economicsprofession but for the world economy            Suppose for example that you are an advocate of freetrade but some Brazilian tells you that his country needs export subsidies andtariffs to protect its industry and save jobs Well if Brazil cannot devalueits currency for fear of speculators cannot use fiscal or monetary policy toreflate its economy because to do so would cause capital flight and thecountry must therefore endure a prolonged period of recession and deflationyou cannot in good conscience make the conventional arguments in favor of freetrade That is you cannot tell him that protectionism only redistributes jobsthat it cannot create them since the truth is that under these circumstanceshis proposal would increase output and employment            Now I amnot advocating protectionism for Brazil or for that matter for anywhere Noram I giving up on microeconomics in general or on the general presumption infavor of free markets in particular I still believe that macroeconomicactivism is possible that Japan can reflate itself out of its slump thatcountries such as Brazil can find ways to deal with the threat of speculativeattack Many people disagree with my ideas thats fine as long as they havean alternative to offer But very few of my colleagues as far as I can tellare even making a serious effort to rise to the challenge            To understand the nature of this challenge you need torealize that although the name of John Maynard Keynes is anathema to manyconservatives it was in fact Keynesian economics that allowed capitalism as asystemas well as belief in the efficacy of free marketsto survive the GreatDepression After all circa  it was very hard for an observant person tosee much future in the free market I happen to own a copy of James BurnhamsThe Managerial Revolution  a nowforgotten  book that was for a timehugely influential It purported to see the rise of both communism and fascismas part of the inevitable replacement of capitalism by a more efficientmanagerial state Burnham did not attack free market economies he simplyregarded them as doomed and those who thought otherwise as naive            The first and perhapscrucial evidence for the view that capitalism is not going to continue muchlonger is the continuous presence within the capitalist nations of massunemployment  Capitalism is no longer able to find uses for the availableinvestment funds which waste in idleness in the account books of the banks The capitalist organization of society has entered its final years            Gloomy sentiments indeedbut at the time they seemed quite reasonable As far as most people who thoughtabout it could see capitalist economies were indeed unable to make use oftheir savings and thus of their resources Given that massive failure thetraditional case that free markets lead to microeconomic efficiencyto theproper allocation of resources among firms and of goods among consumersseemednot so much wrong as irrelevant            ButKeynesian economicsby which I mean not so much the specifics of Keynes ideasas the understanding that monetary and fiscal policy could be used to fighteconomic slumpsrescued both capitalism and microeconomics from oblivionThanks in large part to the new understanding of governments that increasinginterest rates raising taxes and cutting spending in a recession is a badidea the first postwar generation was one of nearfull employment in mostWestern countries And with the assurance that savings would be invested andthat there would be enough demand to make use of the economys resourceseconomists could return in good conscience to the microeconomic question of howthose resources would be usedand to the broad presumption that free marketsexcept in some specific cases would get it right            Take for example the debate about the effects of theNorth American Free Trade Agreement Although most of the public debate overthat agreement focused on alleged job losses or gains Ross Perots greatsucking sound vs the administrations claim that NAFTA would create hundredsof thousands of jobs believed that the net effect on employment would bezero This is basically because the overall number of jobs in the United Statesis determined by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan who is always trying to get theeconomy as close to full employment as he can without creating inflation Sofor serious economists the real questions about NAFTA involved microeconomicissues such as efficiency and income distributionand efficiency concerns atany rate offered a strong case in favor of free trade            In short the success ofmacroeconomic activism in both theory and practice has made it possible forfree market microeconomics to surviveagain both in theory and inpractice            Trueduring the s and early s macroeconomics suffered a crisis Theexperience of stagflationthe combination of inflation and unemploymentbadlydamaged the prestige of economists in general and macroeconomics in particulareven though it was not that much of a theoretical surprise Equally importantwas an internal crisis of selfconfidence Rational expectations theoristsled by Chicagos future Nobelist Robert Lucas challenged the whole idea thatgovernments could do anything to mitigate macroeconomic instability In theend however rational expectations to Keynesian macroeconomics Socalled newKeynesian economists provided at least a theoretical fig leaf for more or lessKeynesian ideas and in practical terms the intellectual basis of modern USmonetary and fiscal policy is pretty much what was already in the textbooks years ago            Now however economists are in troubleagaintrouble that is a sort of muted version of what happened in the sThe world is not now in depression nor is a fullscale replay of the slikely But substantial parts of the world economy are depressedand for onereason or another apparently cannot or will not use macroeconomic policy torestore full employment Emerging market nations terrified of capitalflight dare not reflate their economies on the contrary we find thefrontline economy of the moment Brazil compelled by fear of speculators toact in a precisely antiKeynesian fashion increasing interest rates raisingtaxes and cutting spending even as the economy slides into a nasty recessionMeanwhile Japanthe worlds secondlargest economy and a country that bynormal criteria ought to have no trouble increasing demandfinds itself stuckin exactly the trap Burnham described no longer able to find uses for theavailable investment funds which waste in idleness in the account books of thebanks            So economists must berushing to solve these problems right Well not exactly You see therational expectations challenge to Keynesian economics was halfsuccessful Itdid not build a workable new structure for macroeconomic theory and policy butit did seriously damage the old structure And the effect of that damage hasbeen to discourage economists from even thinking about the traditionalKeynesian issues Most younger economists have simply avoided macroeconomicsentirely orif they do work on macroeconomic issuesthey choose safetopics such as longrun growth avoiding the academic minefield of businesscycle research I cant blame them but it leaves us with a dangerous lack offresh thinking about how to handle recessions at a time when the usual remediesdont seem to be working            I wish Ihad more of a sense that other economists understand what is at stake Thepoint is not that the world is going to collapse that could happen but it isnot the clear and present danger Rather the point is that the theory andpractice of more or less free market economics depend crucially on theavailability of adequate solutions to the problem of macroeconomicinstabilityand for the first time in half a century the availability ofthose solutions cannot be taken for granted            If you didnt chase thelinks in the text is a reminder of how some people react to the sort ofpronouncements we economists are prone to make and is a little more on why theequilibrium macroeconomics school of thought has recruited few pupils
