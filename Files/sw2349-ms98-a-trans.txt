        okay   all right   um i i understand that its being proposed as a requirement for uh young people to be   uhhuh   to go into public service i think   yes all all young Americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means   yeah yeah i think that it probably would be a a good program i think probably two years is too long i think maybe a year would be the the longest that   yep yeah probably youre probably right yeah two years is might be a little too long   yeah and you there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i dont think that theyre gonna be serving anybody   thats right that that would be the problem   yeah so i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who arent even aware that they can do such a thing   sure would umhum umhum   to get out there and do so   yeah or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it   yeah   uh you know college credit you know something you know im not sure what but i   right right college credit is a good idea because   im not sure they need to be you know paid you know a super do salary of any kind that that kind of takes away from public service   right thats right yeah they probably couldnt do anything monetary but i think giving giving some kind of college credit   but just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday you know im not sure that would be a terrifically good idea   uhhuh no i dont think so either because a lot of people um  depending on how the public service programs are set up and im not that that familiar with them to know   im not either really   but you know if  a lot of people flat cant afford to you know that and most kids these days have gotten themselves into um financial situations where they have to be working all the time   thats right thats right uhhuh thats right absolutely then youll youll   so its its a really tough question   young families whatever they just they just couldnt you know take off to do that   thats right yeah and if you put them in public service right out of high school then thats that postpones their college for a year and that would upset a lot of people too because they just wanna get on   only thats right umhum umhum sure would there would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think   yeah i you know i think it it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program but i i i think it cant be something thats mandatory it has to be something thats voluntary you know which is a pretty much the way it is now they might   umhum yep yep thats right im not even really sure this point in time you know what what programs are out there   yeah and thats the other thing is that  you know instead of making it mandatory they maybe maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and and uh you know go to the schools and   umhum umhum   do programs and tell them that we need your help and you know uh uh volunteer for such and such a time and you you have a choice of where you wanna go and and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it   umhum umhum yeah yeah like maybe if if there was something you know they could do in their own own you know their own town or city   yeah in their own community right   yeah and not to have to pull up roots and you know and go somewhere half way around the world or something   yeah thats true  most of them probably wouldnt do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents   thats right yeah thats thats true too thats true too but   but they would have to be supportive in some way and im not sure those those programs are available to do that   yeah yeah me either and you you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know   right   just sit around for their year or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind   right exactly thats   yep its tough its tough   yeah it is tough its and and i dont know whos even proposing it or or how they plan on implementing it if they do   yeah yeah im im not sure either but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information uh you know disseminated before you say lets do this you know   yeah yeah i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them you know itd be it it wouldnt take up much much it would take up more time than anything but it wouldnt take up a lot of money they wouldnt have to spend money advertising and things like that   yeah umhum yeah yep thats right   you go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience you get them all in the auditorium and you you know give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something and   umhum yeah umhum   and i think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded but they dont know where to go to to to do anything   yeah umhum thats right yeah thats a real waste too it really is   yeah it is it really is   i dont really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps like we you know we saw back i guess in the Carter administration that was that was a big thing with him   right yeah yeah   and i guess even back to Kennedy as a matter of fact i guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was it you know really interested in things like that     uhhuh   but i just dont hear much about it anymore like i say i dont even know what programs are are even ongoing now you know   i dont either thats what   anyway its a tough question really is you know   yeah it is a tough question   okay well thanks for your time enjoyed talking to you okay take care bye bye     sure same here take you too bye bye
