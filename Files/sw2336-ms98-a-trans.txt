            okay so what kind of car are you thinking about getting   well none at the moment  No no no   well when you decide to   i currently drive a a Ford Taurus and   uhhuh   i would imagine i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car a new car i will go with the Taurus or something similar uh in that regard   so you like the Ford   absolutely i have had it for about two years now and its uh   uhhuh   its everything its supposed to be uh i havent had a minutes trouble with it and uh   uhhuh   the only thing i have against it in thats its a Taurus but is it i still feel a little even after two years i still feel uncomfortable driving it because i had a Honda before that   uhhuh   and so its a little bit larger but thats the only the only difference that i see really   right   but i would my my criteria would be at the moment it would be uh American uh personally   uhhuh Yeah its the this the car i had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact and uh i loved it i really did   and umhum   But uh um i finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were So i bought myself a a a Nissan a two forty S X   uhhuh   But even though i love the car ive got now i think my next car will probably be American again because if i can at all do it id like to stay American i always have up until now i just for one time decided to go outside So   uhhuh well my wife drives a still has a a Honda Accord and its a very its an excellent automobile   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh but you know price and so forth im not a real car fan so i i i do not uh opt for uh something that would be you know expensive you know i want i want something thats serviceable serviceable something that i can use and uh and i and with the Taurus i have a Taurus uh you know LX and its you know   right uhhuh   youre talking when you think about price its several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines   uhhuh   and as i said as far im concerned it it has been extremely uh uh serviceable and everything i wanted   well Fords done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to ten six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um   uhhuh oh i think so too now i you know in travel and renting automobiles uh in ive driven you know Chevrolet automobiles and so forth and Dodge and i   uhhuh   if its Chevrolet i just will not touch it uh   um   i had a Chevrolet before i bought my Taurus i purchased a   uhhuh   a Chevy um Citation   oh yeah those were not good cars   and uh i was ready to get rid of it  two months after i bought it and uh   uhhuh   so i i shopped around and i would i probably if i had thought i uh wanted to pay the amount of money i probably would have gone with uh uh an Accord or even a a Civic or something comparable from Nissan or or Toyota   uhhuh right   and uh but it was just i had i have a friend who uh has a uh an auto shop and he purchased one of the first Sables that was uh manufactured for his wife a Sable station wagon and he just absolutely swore by it   uhhuh   and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and AM FM radio and all these other things uh   uhhuh   it was just there was no there was no comparison uh the only thing that i find you know if i would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride uh uh not well that about the only thing i find you know disadvantageous to it   right   but my criteria is simply something that looks good something thats serviceable and i you know i drive around a lot but uh and its you know its very comfortable on the highway i can drive for you know ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way   uhhuh   but those are my criteria and i i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again and if theres something out there that uh is comparable to what i have now so ill go ahead and get it   uhhuh You know the only thing im looking at right now um i just i just bought you know the Nissan that ive got about uh say nine months ago i guess it was       So the only thing that that would um get me to change cars right now would be if see at the moment im single and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it But uh i dont have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know   umhum uhhuh   uh cars are too expensive right now to uh   i see yeah   to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know its   in our parking lots uh two or three days ago i saw one of the new Honda sports cars   uhhuh uhhuh   uh i i cant remember what the name is its the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is and it looked it resembled a Mazaratti very very closely   um   and its an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth but   uhhuh   to pay that much money for an automobile uh is just i cant i cant conceive of doing that   yeah thats uh i went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago and um you know of course they had the normal the Ford the the Chevrolet that stuff But then you started looking at the uh uh they had Ferrari there they had uh BMW and and all these other kind of cars and and Ferrari didnt even let you near the car i mean they were thats how expensive they were   umhum   um and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars you saw eighty thousand dollar cars and you know even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but uh i cant see buying or paying more for a car than i would for a house you know i   thats true well   that doesnt seem likely   uh the difference there is too is uh is between us is that i am not really crazy about driving i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my drivers license when i was young when i was sixteen   uhhuh uhhuh   so ive never really cared now what i was you know before i was married and before i went to graduate school i used to do little you know sports car racing i never it was never my own car it was always someone elses   uhhuh   and that sort of thing i enjoy but to go out and drive uh never has really been had any appeal to me in that regard so   uhhuh   well i guess weve discussed that enough dont you think  we wont we dont we wont get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight thats happened to me almost every time ive   i think so thats happened to me once so uh   well when its its very easy when you get a topic you get on a topic that you know you enjoy and   yeah like uh you know i think the one time i did it was on Saudi the Mid the Mid East the crisis out there and everything that was had a great conversation but uh then they came off and told us we couldnt do it any more so   oh yeah yeah   well i was talking to a lady last evening and we were talking about fishing and uh we were cut off uhhuh well we were told to quit okay well you have a pleasant evening   uhhuh yeah you too uhhuh byebye   take care goodbye
