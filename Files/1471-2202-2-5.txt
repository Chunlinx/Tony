                    Background        The dorsal striatum is a massive nucleus in the basal        forebrain that plays a pivotal role in modulating motor        activity and higher cognitive function Approximately         of all neurons in the striatum   to  million in mice           and  million in humans     belong to        an unusual type of inhibitory projection cell referred to        as medium spiny neurons        Striatal neurons are        divided into two major subpopulations patch and matrix        that have somewhat different gene expression profiles and        have different patterns of pre and postsynaptic        connections                Numbers of medium spiny neurons and ratios of these and        less numerous striatal interneurons are critical variables        that influence motor performance and aspects of cognition        In the case of Huntington disease the loss of  of the        normal complement of medium spiny neurons leads to distinct        movement disorder in both humans and transgenic mouse        models        The subset of genes that normally        control the proliferation differentiation and survival of        striatal neurons      are therefore of considerable        importance in ensuring adaptive behavior at maturity        In this study we use a forward genetic approach           to begin to map and characterize members of the subset        of normally polymorphic genes that specifically modulate        the production and survival of striatal neurons Our        analysis of the neurogenetic control of striatal cell        populations relies on the combination of two complementary        quantitative approaches The first of these complex trait        analysis is a comparatively new genetic method that makes        it possible to map individual loci that underlie polygenic        traits    The second consists of a set of unbiased        stereological procedures that can be used to obtain cell        counts accurately and efficiently from large numbers of        cases           From a technical point of view the mouse striatum has        several advantages that make it an excellent target for        complex trait analysis of the mammalian CNS First it is a        large cytoarchitectonically distinct region comprising        approximately  of the volume of the mouse brain        Second the dorsal striatum has a comparatively homogenous        cellular composition potentially reducing the number of        quantitative trait loci QTLs that affect striatal neuron        number Finally recent experiments on the molecular        control of telencephalic development have highlighted a        number of genes that influence neuron proliferation and        differentiation of the striatum and other neighboring        forebrain structures                  We report here both neuroanatomic and genetic        quantitative evidence that the size of the striatum and the        number of neurons contained within it are modulated        independently                    Results                  Phenotypes                      Strain differences                                      Brain Weight and Striatal              Volume               Five strains were chosen to represent low mid            and high brain weights Fig A Brain weights of the            two high strains BXD    mg SEM and BALBcJ               mg are significantly greater P              than that of CBLJ    mg Similarly the            brain weights of AJ    mg and DBAJ               mg are significantly lower than those of the other            three strains P   As anticipated            differences in striatal volume correspond well with            differences in brain weight and volume The striata of            BXD    mm  and BALBcJ    mm             mice are significantly larger P   than those            of CBLJ    mm  AJ    mm             and DBAJ    mm  strains                                      Striatal NeuronPacking              Density              There is a significant difference among strains in            the packing density of striatal neurons P              for all comparisons AJ has a higher mean density               neuronsmm  than all strains other            than DBAJ    neuronsmm  BALBcJ               neuronsmm  and BXD               neuronsmm  do not differ significantly from each            other but do differ from all other strains CBLJ               differs from all other mice with the            exception of DBAJ Inbred strains with smaller            striatal volumes have higher neuronal packing densities            Fig C                                      Striatal Neuron Number              As a result of the reciprocal relation between            volume and density there is no significant difference            in striatal neuron number among the five strains Total            striatal neuron numbers ranges over a very modest range             from a low of    million in CBLJ to a            high of    million in BXD                                Correlational Statistics            Our comparisons are based on five strains and one            consequence of this modest sample size is that sampling            errors and intraclass correlations may bias the results              We therefore also analyzed a larger sample of            genetically heterogeneous ABF intercross animals an            F intercross between AJ and BXD We first            determined that the distribution of all four dependent            measures were normally distributed Fig  before            subjecting the data to correlational analysis In this            set of animals brain weight correlates significantly            with striatal volume              r   df               P   Fig A Striatal            volume is negatively correlated with neuronpacking            density overall              r   df               P   again indicating            that the greater the striatal volume the lower the            neuronpacking density Fig B Despite this            relationship the total population of striatal neurons            correlates positively with striatal volume in this            larger sample              r   df               P   Fig C In this            crucial respect results from the genetically            heterogeneous F animals differ from those of inbred            strains                                    QTL Analysis          The analysis in this section is focused principally on          two traits striatal volume absolute and residual          values and striatal neuron number also absolute and          residual values Residuals for these traits were          computed for both traits to minimize the influence of          brain weight Two additional traits were mapped to assess          specificity of the effects of putative QTLbearing          intervals namely brain weight and nonstriatal brain          weight Table  This last parameter was estimated by          subtracting the estimated bilateral striatal weight          assuming a specific gravity of  from that of the          whole brain          The strongest linkage was found between variation in          striatal volume and an interval on chromosome  between          the markers           DMit at  cM and           DMit at  cM The likelihood          ratio statistic  a value that can be read as a          chisquare  peaks in this  cM interval at  and is          associated with a P value of  Table           equivalent to a LOD score of  Fig A The          genomewide probability of achieving a linkage of this          strength by chance is  This locus accounts for          as much as a third of the total phenotypic variance in          striatal volume and as much as  of the genotypic          variance            h   Alleles in this Chr           interval that are inherited from the BXD parental strain          contribute to a significantly larger striatum than do          alleles inherited from AJ Mean bilateral volume          corrected for shrinkage for the           AA genotype at           DMit            n   is    mm whereas          that for           AB and           BB genotypes are    mm and             mm            n   and  respectively The          insignificant difference between           BB and           AB genotypes suggests that the           B allele is dominant BXD is a          recombinant inbred strain initially generated by crossing          strains CBLJ and DBAJ Most of the proximal part of          Chr  in BXD is derived from DBAJ but a short          interval between  and  cM is derived exclusively from          CBLJ This CBLJ region corresponds to the peak          LRS score We estimate a single           B allele inherited from the BXD          parent increases striatal volume by approximately           mm           The Chr  interval has an appreciable effect on brain          size Variance in brain weight minus that of the striatum          is associated with an LRS of  in the same location          between           DMit and           DMit  Each           B allele adds  mg to total          brain weight The Chr  locus clearly has pleiotropic          effects on the CNS but its effect on the striatum is          more intense Nonetheless until we know more about the          scope of effects we have opted to give this Chr  locus          a generic name           Brain size control a            Bsca  The specific striatal          component of the           Bsca was analyzed by mapping the          residual striatal values that corrects for differences in          brain volume The specific effect of a           B allele is reduced from  mm to           mm  and the LRS is reduced to  a value          which still has a pointwise probability of only           indicating a significant independent effect          We identified a second strong candidate interval on          distal Chr  that may modulate striatal neuron number          The LRS peaks at  a LOD of  at one of our more          distal markers            DMit   cM p   In          mapping neuron number we actually used the residual cell          population as a trait and we are therefore confident          that this interval has a selective although not          necessarily exclusive effect on numbers of neurons in          striatum Fig B Each           B allele increases the population          by approximately  cells The           AA genotype has an average residual          population that is  less than the mean ie a          residual of            n   the           AB heterozygotes have an average of           neurons            n   and the           BB homozygotes have an average of           neurons            n   Corresponding absolute          numbers of striatal neurons for the three genotypes are            and  million The twotailed genomewide          probability of this locus is at the threshold for          declaring a QTL p     twotailed for an          additive model and    for a free model No other          chromosomal interval has an LRS score remotely as high as          distal Chr  The next highest LRS value is only  on          Chr  near           DMit and has a pointwise          probability that is  times higher than the Chr           interval Given these findings we have given the distal          chromosome  interval the name           Striatal Neuron Number a            Stnna  Allelic differences in          this interval account for up to  of the total variance          in striatal neuron number As the heritability of this          trait is  this trait can be said to account for over           of the genetic variance Residual neuron counts have          a higher LRS than the total neuron counts LRS of           vs  This indicates that the Chr  interval is          likely to have selective effect on the striatum          Consistent with this hypothesis the LRS for brain weight          on distal Chr  is under  and weights of all three          genotypes average    mg Linkage on Chr  is not          affected at all by remapping with control for the          striatal volume locus on Chr  Thus Chr  and Chr           intervals do not interact or cooperate in controlling          striatal volume or neuron number                            Discussion                  Betweenstrain variability          Variation in the size of CNS regions and cell          populations is already known to be substantial in the          striatum and in many other regions of the CNS The number          of striatal cholinergic neurons for example varies           among  BXD RI lines   Interestingly this          variation appears to be unrelated to susceptibility to          haloperidolinduced catalepsy The volume of the granule          cell layer of the dentate gyrus varies as much as           among different inbred strains of mice                More recent experiments using stereologic techniques have          reported substantial variation in both neuron number and          volume of the pyramidal and dentate cell layers of the          hippocampus   Granule cell numbers in NZBBINJ and          DBA were  greater than CBLJ mice and          differences in volume were even larger up to  larger          in the DBA as compared to the CBLJ mice There is          also substantial amongstrain variation in other          structures in the nervous system including the nucleus of          the solitary tract   the spinal nucleus of the          bulbocavernosus   and retinal ganglion cells             Taken together these results point to a high level          of variability in neuron number in the CNS of mice          Based on these findings we anticipated significant          differences in the striatum of inbred strains We did          find large strain differences in volume What was          surprising was that in our set of five highly divergent          strains the differences in volume were not matched by          significant differences in neuron number There was in          fact a strong inverse relationship between striatal          volume and neuronpacking density that led to a          remarkably stabile neuron number The variation in          neuronpacking density with volume contrasts somewhat          with the report of Abusaad and colleagues   who          found no significant differences P   in neuronal          packing density in the dentate gyrus cell layers of the          hippocampus among the three mouse strains that they          examined but did see a significant difference in the          pyramidal cell layers A recent report demonstrates a           range of granule cell packing density among  BXD          recombinant inbred lines   a finding supporting the          notion that packing density varies significantly among          mouse strains          These data suggest that principles that govern the          relationship between neuronal volume and neuronpacking          density may differ between the striatum and the other CNS          regions The striatum may be a special case  a region in          which numbers of medium spiny neurons is more tightly          regulated than neuron populations in some other regions          It could also be that measuring specific neuronal          subtypes would demonstrate a greater amount of variance          than we currently report   Given the relatively          small number of strains that we have sampled our          hypothesis of lower variation in striatal cell          populations requires a more extensive test a problem          which we are now pursuing using the large numbers of          strains in the Mouse Brain Library          httpwwwmblorg                          Verification of QTL Results          We have quantified the population of striatal neurons          on both sides of the brain in  cases total This is a          large sample from the perspective of stereological          analysis of the mouse CNS but from the perspective of          gene mapping and quantitative genetics this is of          course a modestsized sample size and one that will need          to be treated as a starting point for more refined          genetic analysis Nonetheless we have succeeded in          mapping one locus           Bsca  which modulates striatal          volume with a genomewide significance of P   We          have also discovered linkage on Chr  to variation in          the total number of striatal neurons These mapping data          are concordant with our strain comparison and          collectively suggest that there is apparently no          significant genetic correlation between striatal volume          and neuron number To confirm and refine our genetic          dissection of the striatum we plan to analyze the AXB and          BXA recombinant inbred RI strains generated by crossing          AJ with CBLJ This large RI set has already been          processed and regenotyped and is now part of the Mouse          Brain Library see httpwwwmblorgand          httpwwwnervenetorgpapersbxnhtml An analysis of          RI strains can be quickly extended by generating F          intercrosses between AJ and the subset of RI strains          that have recombinations in the QTL intervals on Chrs           and  Isogenic sets of RIbackcross progeny can be used          to test specific models of gene action for example the          dominance of the           B allele at           Bsca           A major goal of QTL mapping is to define loci that          affect critical phenotypes with sufficient precision to          generate short lists of candidate genes Generating lists          of candidates for QTLs will soon be greatly facilitated          by more complete and better annotated mouse and human          sequence databases combined with information on gene          expression profiles of whole brain and striatum            Once chromosomal positions of the QTLs have been          determined to a precision of  cM reducing the          probability that a QTL actually represents a cluster of          linked genes it will become appropriate to assess          strengths of candidates using transgenic animals and by          sequence comparisons            Interval mapping places the QTL for           Bsca in the central portion of          Chr  in proximity with a number of genes known to          affect brain development One of these is           Grk  a member of the family of          ionotropic glutamate receptor genes that is thought to          play a role in modulating Huntington disease   In          the mouse members of this receptor type act to          indirectly downregulate synaptic activity in the          striatum   Another gene that falls into the           Bsca interval is           Macs  the gene encoding the          myristoylated alaninerich C kinase substrate MARCKS          protein This molecule is important in cerebral          development MARCKSdeficient mice have a high incidence          of exencephaly agenesis of the corpus callosum and          abnormalities other forebrain structure including          widespread neocortical ectopias    The          MARCKSrelated protein gene is expressed in the striatum          during early brain development in the rat            The location of the QTL modulating striatal neuron          number to the distal part of chromosome  places it in          proximity to a number of genes that have been recently          been shown to be important factors in telencephalic          development particularly           Vax            Vax is a homeoboxcontaining gene          and is a close relative of the           Emx and           Not genes           Vax is localized during          development to the anterior ventral forebrain and is          expressed in the striatum during embryogenesis            This molecule also has an important role in axon          guidance both the anterior portion of the corpus          callosum and the optic chiasm are malformed or absent in           Vax knockout mice   In          addition           Vax interacts with several          molecules including sonic hedgehog           Pax            Pax  and           Rx that are known to be important          during development of the basal forebrain                             Brain volume and neuron number          It has previously been shown that differences in brain          weight are proportional to total brain DNA content and          consequently to total CNS cell number    For this          reason brain weight has been suggested to be a good          surrogate measure for total cell number in mice as in          humans   Moreover previous work has demonstrated a          tight link between regional brain volume and neuron          number    which implies that volumetric measures          reliably estimate neuron number With this literature in          mind we expected that our measures of striatal volume          would predict neuron number in this nucleus With the          inbred strains however we found that strains with small          striata AJ had virtually the same number of neurons as          those with large striata BALBcJ This result indicates          that at least for the striatum volume is not a reliable          indicator of neuron number and that they may be two          independent traits This conclusion is bolstered at the          genetic level by our report of two distinct QTLs for          these two morphologic phenotypes Taken together with          previous reports       we speculate that while          total neuron number in the cerebrum may relate to total          brain weight the relationship of these two variables is          flexible at the regional level                            Materials and Methods                  Subjects          Thirtyfour of the  mice that we analyzed were          common inbred strains that were selected to sample a wide          range of brain weights and by expectation striatal          volumes Low brain weight strains included AJ            n   and DBAJ            n   Mid and high brain weight          strains include CBLJ            n   BALBcJ            n   and BXD            n   formally this recombinant          inbred strain is known as BXDTy One of the ten          CBLJ subjects was removed from the analysis because          values for striatal neuron number were anomalous with Z          scores more than           To map QTLs that modulate variation in CNS size and          cell populations we used an F intercross between a          strain with low brain weight AJ and a strain with high          brain weight BXD A total of  of these ABDF          progeny were generated but for this study we selected a          subset of  cases of which  were fully genotyped see          below The sample included  animals in the lowest and          highest quartiles and  cases within  SD of the mean          brain weight We therefore measured subjects representing          the full range of brain weights see Fig A The ABDF          intercross has been used previously to map QTLs that          modulate total brain weight   and cerebellar volume            The BXD strain used as the paternal strain in this          intercross is a recombinant inbred strain that was          derived by crossing CBLJ and DBAJ lines of mice            As a result ABDF progeny are a mixture of three          genomes  AJ  CBLJ and  DBAJ However          at any given locus there will be only two alleles           A and           B  or           A and           D  All stocks of mice were          obtained from the Jackson Laboratory httpwwwjaxorg          ABF mice were generated at the University of Tennessee          by Dr Richelle Strom   using Jackson Laboratory          foundation stock The F mice ranged in age from  to           days The standard inbred strains ranged in age from           to  days We studied approximately equal numbers of          males and females                          Histological Preparation          All brains analyzed in this study are part of the          Mouse Brain Library MBL The MBL is both a physical and          Internet resource Highresolution digital images of          sections from all cases are available at          httpwwwmblorg          Mice were anesthetized deeply with Avertin           tribromoethanol and            tert pentyl alcohol in water           ml ip and perfused through the left ventricle          with  sodium phosphate buffered PB saline pH           followed by  glutaraldehyde paraformaldehyde in           M PB pH  over a period of  to  min An          additional ml of doublestrength fixative           glutaraldehyde paraformaldehyde was injected for           to  min at an increased flow rate The head with brain          was placed a vial with the last fixative and stored at          C until dissection          Following dissection the brains were weighed          immediately Brains were subsequently shipped to Beth          Israel Deaconess Medical Center They were immersed in          fresh  formalin for at least one week before being          embedding in celloidin   Brains were cut on a          sliding microtome at  m in either horizontal or          coronal planes Freefloating sections were stained with          cresylechtviolett and four series of every tenth section          were mounted on slides and coverslipped see          httpmblorgprocedurestissueprochtmlfor further          details                          Histologic Phenotypes                      Total Brain Volume            To accurately estimate histological shrinkage for            each brain in the sample we determined the volume of            the entire brain and took a ratio of this value to the            original fixed brain weight Brain volumes were            determined from serial sections using point counting            and Cavalieris rule Highresolution  mpixel            images of entire sections were taken from the Mouse            Brain Library and point counting was performed on            these images using NIH Image             httprsbinfonihgovnihimageand an Apple Macintosh            computer httpwwwapplecom If the criteria for            using the Cavalieris estimator were not met due to            missing or damaged sections a measurement method            involving piecewise parabolic integration was employed              Subsequent measurements of striatal volume and            neuron packing density were corrected for volumetric            shrinkage The average shrinkage was    a            mean residual volume of                                 Striatal Volume            Volume of the striatum was also determined from            serial section analysis using point counting and            Cavalieris rule Images from the sections were            captured at  x and were projected onto a video            monitor Point counting was performed as above Volume            was computed separately for the right and left sides            and corrected for shrinkage                                Striatal NeuronPacking Density and Neuron            Number            Neurons were counted using the dimensional            counting software of Williams and Rakic   A series            of six contiguous counting boxes each  x  x  m            aligned in a  x  matrix were placed randomly within            the striatum and those neurons the nucleoli of which            were in focus were counted as described previously               This large functional counting box  x  x             m was chosen to minimize sampling variance by            ensuring an equitable sampling of striatal patch and            matrix Two of these large fields were counted in each            of the hemispheres Neuronpacking density was computed            as the number of cellsmm corrected for shrinkage            Multiplying the volume of the striatum by its            cellpacking density permitted estimation of the number            of neurons in that nucleus                                Reliability            We determined testretest reliability by having an            observer blindly remeasure striatal volume on a subset            of  brains from the collection The observer not only            remeasured the striatal volume from the same series of            sections as the original measure but also estimated            volume from a second series of  in  sections offset            by  sections from the previous series The            correlations among the three estimations ranged from             to  P   indicating a high degree of            reliability for this dependent variable            We assessed reliability of our estimates of neuronal            numbers by having an observer blindly reestimate            neuron number in the same  brains above The            intraobserver correlation for this measure was  P              which is similar to the reliability seen in            previous estimates of neuron number                                       Genotyping and QTL Mapping                      Regression Analysis of Trait Values            The unadjusted striatal estimates vary to a large            extent as a result of variation in total brain weight            However one of our goals in this study is to map QTLs            with relatively intense effects on the striatum For            this reason we also have corrected all of the            parameters used in the mapping analysis for variation            in brain weight using linear regression analysis We            have mapped data with and without compensation for            variance in brain weight The corrected values are            referred to as residuals                                    Analysis          All data were analyzed using regression correlation          and ANOVA statistical tests see StrAnatDataxlsfor          original data used to perform this analysis A          BonferroniDunn correction was used for post hoc          examination of significant main effects in the ANOVA          This posthoc test is functionally identical to a Fisher          PLSD but the alpha level is more conservative
