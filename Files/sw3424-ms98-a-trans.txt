                 okay um do you participate in family reunions   i did for years i dont have enough family left to have them   uhhuh did you uh were they far away were they close   thats well  i come from a family that was very large in Bell County   uhhuh   and and my grandfather came to Bell County on a covered wagon   oh how neat   and had ten children and so sometimes we would have a reunion with that group   uhhuh   and then sometimes we would go to Arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group you know   oh that would be fun   yeah it was a lot of fun   yeah well we uh we have a family reunion on my mothers side of the family thats uh oh it started probably about forty years ago um because i remember going as a teenager before i was ever married and then my husband and i went uh while we were still dating and its still going on and it used to be held at Lake Brownwood down at Brownwood Texas but now we hold it at uh Lake Texoma so that the Oklahoma group doesnt have to drive as far   umhum   and uh we have had as many on a Saturday night it starts on Friday and goes through Sunday and weve had as many on a uh Saturday night as about two hundred and fifty   um now we would have group like that in Arkansas wed have two hundred and fifty or three hundred   uhhuh yes and we took uh i assume you all brought in food and everything   well so many of us came from a long way that we wed usually at a motel and we bought food there   oh uhhuh uhhuh its i know on Sundays we all elect now to chip in and we go get Kentucky Fried Chicken and bring out and uh but we kind of take our food for three days and uh   but umhum hum   now our grandchildren are participating in it and just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see once a year   umhum umhum     enthused and uh with it and our children you know thoroughly enjoy it so its been kind of nice it started out when i was a youngster and watching my mother now im to the  mother was and uh i am uh   umhum well umhum   now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter you know participate  more   umhum   and everything and uh   well its something i really miss because i had twenty seven first cousins   oh my word   and you know we were very close family but my fathers generation was enough older than i my father would be a hundred now   oh uhhuh   that theyre all dead and in fact many of my first cousins are dead   oh are they   and course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that so we really very rarely all of us get together   get together any more   and and were a long way away and and the younger generation the next like my cousins children i dont know very well you know   uhhuh uhhuh   but it so its i doubt that that will come to be again but as long as my oldest aunt lived we we got together once a year   i think i do think now we have noticed a waning of interest and i think as as parents       get older and start dying off i think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going   well and and folks have gotten so mobile i mean like i have       a son and a daughter and two nephews that are grown   umhum   and a brother who has a new marriage and a younger son but my brother and his wife live in Nevada my daughter lives in Colorado one of my nephews lives in New York City one nephew lives in Memphis   umhum   and my son lives here but i think its very unlikely well have a family reunion you know   yeah you probably do good just to get your immediate family together   yeah and im divorced and really only immediate family i have left is my my i have a son and a daughter   uhhuh uhhuh   but my familys really all dead   uhhuh   but it was great pleasure while we did it you know   oh yeah theyre a lot of fun well my sister i have a sister and then we have a son and a daughter and we have three grandchildren and and our son and daughter are both married and uh   umhum   our sons not as interested in it as our daughter but our daughter our daughter is really interested and uh   did it does it bother you if your children are not interested in it   i beg you pardon   does it bother you if your children are not interested in it   oh a little bit i i wish that our son was you know and um   umhum   but uh the cousins are closer to our daughters age and than to our sons and just totally different interest group and plus and hes just hes newly married and doesnt have children and   uhhuh   umhum   you know im hoping that as they you know are married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined to want to go     umhum   you know to it i know that   what what kinds of things do you do to try to get your children interested to talk to them about it   well talk to them about it and you know tell them some of the things were doing now when he was a child uh a young oh preteen you know when he was like ten or twelve he loved going he had another cousin he was close to   umhum   and we but that cousin kind of quit going and as he got to be a teenager um he wasnt quite as as interested he was more interested in rock and roll and this is more country western group and uh just lack of interest   umhum
