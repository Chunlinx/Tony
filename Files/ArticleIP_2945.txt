                                 A Limousine Republican            After years of fighting turfbattles as a senior official in the State Department during World War II theyoung Nelson A Rockefeller returned to New York City to face a far moredaunting challenge his father All around the familys headquarters atRockefeller Center were reminders that John D Rockefeller Jr was lord andmaster of the worlds biggest fortune and his children were not Nelsonsresponse to powerlessness was architectural He transformed part of the fustyold family precincts into a sleek Bauhaus fantasyland for himself and hisbrothers            Gee Pa Nelson exclaimedwhen he showed his father the redesigned offices isnt this allimpressive            Nelson said thepatriarch whom are we trying to impress            Whomindeed Nelson Rockefeller was born into a family of such wealth power andinfluence that its hard to understand how he could have been so perenniallyeager to please His childhood on his familys sylvan  acre estate inPocantico Hills NY was one of almost unimaginable privilege yet from thebeginning he felt compelled to flatter cajole and even engage in abjectselfcriticism if thats what it took to get his way particularly with hispuritanical and disapproving father His efforts to insinuate himself were sorelentless that Cary Reich the author of this sprawling new biography and ofan earlier biography of the financier Andr Meyer refers to his subject as apatrician Sammy Glick though he never reaches the heights of heeldomdemonstrated by the hero of Budd Schulbergs novel about prewar Hollywoodbackstabbing Rockefeller never won the presidencydespite allout campaignsin  and but he served as governor of New York for  years and thencompleted his public career as Gerald Fords vice president He had an enormousimpact on American politics and the landscape of New York More than  yearsafter his death you can still start a fight by calling someone a RockefellerRepublican Among other things this book helps explain what the term actuallymeans            To admirers Rockefeller Republican alludes to Nelsonscreation of an outstanding state university system a vast network ofhospitals housing projects mental health facilities water treatment plantsparks and highways To enemies it refers to a legacy of bankrupt stategovernment and failed social programs What is most striking about The Lifeof Nelson A Rockefeller Worlds to Conquer  the first of aprojected two volumes though is that this dualitythe push to achieve wedto a penchant for flamboyant failure the ability to win a passionate followingyet alienate the people who could keep him in powerwas evident well before hethought about running for public office            It wasRockefeller after all who singlemindedly campaigned for the United Nationsto be established in New York persuading his father to buy and donate the EastRiver property for its site During World War II Rockefeller forged a defensealliance among Latin American countries to ward off Nazi influence He thentransformed it into an antiCommunist alliance on the eve of the Cold War Hepushed for foreign aid and investment throughout the developing world andhelped persuade President Truman to come up with his famous Point Fourformulation in  which set the framework for American economic assistanceoverseas As undersecretary of Health Education and Welfare Rockefellerhelped pioneer the idea of national health insurance As overseer of Cold Warpropaganda he fought for and won adoption of Ikes open skies proposallinking inspections to the cause of nuclear arms control But in almost everyone of these efforts Rockefeller either overextended himself or managed tomake so many enemies he ended up being ousted from power            In Reichs generally quite readablethoughoccasionally overly detailedbook three strands of Rockefellers characteremerge all of them reflecting the same degree of urgent vitality andsometimes an edge of selfdestructiveness The first is the womanizingRockefeller a persona the public only glimpsed at his death inflagrante with a younger female staff member in  Reich focuses on twoaides Joan Braden and Nancy Hanks and on Rockefellers empty marriage andseparate living quarters with his first wife who could be seen weepingquietly when he was elected governor in  The stories fill in some blanksbut not unfortunately in a way that explains what his philandering mightactually have been about            Thesecond of Nelsons passions was for art especially the abstract expressionistsof New York and Paris Scheming to take over an institution his mother hadhelped to establish the Museum of Modern Art Rockefeller oversaw every detailof its construction and acquisitionsall by the time he was  He brought thesame zeal to his own collections asking Picasso to weave tapestries out of hisown paintings and Henri Matisse and Fernand Lger to create murals for hisFifth Avenue apartment Lger actually came to New York and painted his muralin Nelsons living room With the nonchalance of someone ordering a touchupNelson then asked the artist if while he was at it he could stay and domurals for the staircase and hallways            One reason for Nelsons enthusiasm for art and sculptureaccording to Reich was his dyslexia which made reading treacherous As abureaucrat Rockefeller certainly preferred big colorful charts to text inlaying out plans to colleagues Reich might have gone further however bynoting that dyslexia is often accompanied by hyperactivity which seemed tocharacterize the astonishing and sometimes undisciplined energy Rockefellerbrought to everything            Which brings us to the thirdside of Rockefellers personality and the main theme of the book that ofempirebuilding Nelson was probably destined for politics from the start whenhe was named after his mothers father Sen Nelson W Aldrich of Rhode Islandwhom Lincoln Steffens once called the archrepresentative of protectedprivileged business He was the third child in the family but from hisearliest years he was determined to be the leader of his generation ofRockefellers By his s he was already striving to forge his siblings into apowerful unit organizing his brothers and sister to confront their father witha demand that the family assets be turned over gradually to the nextgeneration Nelson also carried out what was in effect a coup detat atRockefeller Center forcing out the retainers loyal to his father so that hecould take over himself            Early onNelson got into the habit of tapping his own financial resources to surroundhimself with talented people He was forever commissioning huge semiacademicstudies of problems by an array of experts like Henry Kissinger a practicewhich throughout his life elicited resentment from colleagues less flush withcash Rockefellers addiction to living in an expensive realm of his own forcreating his own entourage ultimately accounted for Gerald Fords decision totoss Rockefeller overboard and pick Bob Dole as his running mate in something that will presumably be discussed in Reichs next book            His involvement in Latin America was indicativeof how he would mobilize resources to get something done then go to suchextremes hed have to abandon the project Rockefeller first became interestedin the region through its artists and then through the Venezuelan subsidiaryof Standard Oil of New Jerseythe family business To ward off increasinglystrident demands from leftists Rockefeller wanted to create businesses thatwould raise peoples standard of living using his own resources he set upcompanies to raise cattle grow crops market food develop natural resourcesand build housing Before long however many of these projects went bust andNelson had to turn to his family for financial assistance to ward offbankruptcy Eventually he decided that only the United States government couldsupply the resources to do the job            Nelsonsurge to enter the public arena was partly the legacy of his father whoseRockefeller Foundation helped create the modern science of philanthropy thoughits underlying purpose was to expunge the malevolent connotations attached tothe name of Rockefeller in the wake of the predations of the Standard Oiltrust The philanthropic worldview also informed Rockefellers ambitious ideasabout government spending which would eventually make him an easy targetAnother influence was that patrician politician Franklin Roosevelt who waslike John D Rockefeller the focus of Nelsons relentless sycophancy andblackbelt bureaucratic infighting Reich tells the story of how Rockefellergot wind one day of a scheme to get the president to eliminate hisRockefellers operation at the State Department He quickly found out who wasgoing to be seeing FDR that morningit was Vice President Henry Wallaceandpersuaded him to win a stay of execution But unlike Roosevelt Rockefellernever developed the resilience to stay in power Eventually his forcedresignations from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations led Rockefeller toturn to elective office as the one way of establishing an independent base            Upon first hearing that Rockefeller might run for governorof New York the millionaire incumbent Averell Harriman dismissed it as a jokeHe even let Nelson head up a commission on the state constitution thoughTammany leaders warned he would regret it As they predicted Rockefeller usedthe commission to educate himself and build a case for change in Albany Whatsurprised everyone was that he turned out to be a most charismatic campaignerwith a much more downtoearth touch than Harriman ever exhibited Hey thesesubways are neat said Rockefeller I dont know why people complain aboutthem It didnt matter that he was naive People wanted somebody they knewcould not be bought            Reichs book ends asRockefeller stands on the threshold of a new era of expansive government thepresidency beckoning in the background By then we already know what being aRockefeller Republican consists of a mixture of lavish spending arroganceambition scheming and pragmatism a belief in expertise and big projectsand above all excitement about the sheer adventure of governing For all hisfailures and disappointments Nelson Rockefeller set a standard for excellencethat the country will not see again any time soon
