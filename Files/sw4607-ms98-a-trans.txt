                okay lets see do you live uh do you live in a neighborhood that uh has been affected recently by any uh crimes   uh let me see not recently i were Framingham is uh midway between Boston and Worcester and its mostly mostly in Boston that were finding a lot of problems um basically its lined up blacks versus whites and thereve been a lot of murders and mostly boyfriend girlfriend type of thing   yeah we uh in Portland is is pretty uh how shall i say it they have a lot of problems but the problems are confined confined to low income neighborhoods well i shouldnt say low income neighborhoods uh neighborhoods where a lot of low income families live and and uh where theres lot a lot of drug and uh broken families and things like that   umhum     uh that doesnt i i try to uh in my thinking to keep from blaming it on the on the nationality of people and more blame it on the culture of the uh you know broken families and and uh drugs and things like that   right i think drugs plays a really big part a lot of times it doesnt come out in the paper or on the news um you know theyre more into as far as the news reporters into oh you know two black guys killed each other or they knifed each other other to death and we have a lot with uh gang problems   yes the gang problems   yeah that   the the problem   that seems to be the major thing and we just recently with all the problems that there are in Boston we did have i was thinking we did have one crime in Framingham where a girl picked up a guy at a bar and uh her kids woke up she brought him home and her kids woke up and she was dead she had been knifed to death   oh my goodness   and he was a homeless person but why anybody would want to bring somebody like that home you know     too many hormones huh   really  i think that was the the major part of it too much alcohol and she just invited him in and he waited until she was sleeping and then let her have it     too much alcohol   yeah just kind of a psychopath   umhum   the the crime problem is uh i dont know if if youre this is uh about a four hour topic but a five minute uh window here so the for me i feel very bad about uh the people that are affected uh the people in the crime ridden areas are more innocent in some cases uh than the than the press finds well what im really trying to say is they are working class people who work very hard and are seriously affected by that and uh so even though i see   umhum right umhum   uh how shall i say it uh the problems of crime affect the black working class and uh minority working people   umhum   much worse than they affect me uh so the the crime problem has to be solved one of the problems that i see is that and they always compare  uh America they say well in America we have uh you know a gun problem and uh uh that i i read a discussion once of of uh the reason why England for instance uh has their gun problems and other problems are so low and it basically boils down to they dont have the Bill of Rights doesnt exit for those guys if you are standing at a corner and somebody and the Bobby walks up to you and he says youve been standing here four buses have gone by uh youre a pickpocket empty your pockets if he finds some things in in there then they will proceed to your house perhaps and uh say open your door up and go in and search your house and after that they can enter at any time   hm   now that has the advantage of uh weeding out how shall i say it of getting rid of the dandelions before theyve before they uh populate your lawn   right   but  it it just doesnt function in our court system over here we we wont allow you to be uh frisked by a cop uh without good reason   yeah i think thats wrong i think thats where the law has got to change because theyve found uh how many people have we read about or heard about in the national news that have been picked up and because of a technicality theyre left let off   yeah an actually   you know and thats really not right and then they go out and do it again you know   thats right and and like i my earlier example uh       uh i could spend every day all day just picking the heads off of dandelions uh once i let my lawn get infested   umhum right   uh
