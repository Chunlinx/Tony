                                  Guilt by Acquisition            When the German car makerDaimlerBenz announced plans to acquire a controlling share of Chrysler CorpJewish novelist Cynthia Ozick announced in the Wall Street Journal thatshe would never buy a Chrysler Other Jews some of whom would never buy aChrysler because theyd only ever buy a Mercedes saw the issue verydifferently Last May shortly after the merger was announced the JewishBulletin carried an article by Natalie Weinstein surveying the range ofopinion particularly among Holocaust survivors The responses ran thepredictable gamut Some agreed with Ozick But others such as Rabbi TedAlexander took their cues from Deuteronomy which admonishes that Fathersshall not be put to death for children neither shall children be put to deathfor fathers Going by that verse of the Torah said the rabbi I cannotblame this generation            The rabbis analogytreats the DaimlerBenz of  as the child of the DaimlerBenz thatemployed slave laborers in  From a strictly legal perspective the analogyis inaccurate Under the law a corporation lives forever The entity thatcontrols Chrysler is exactly the same entity that collaborated with the Nazisnot a descendant            But it would be wrong to view an essentially moral questionfrom a strictly legal perspective A corporation is not a moral entity itsthe corporations flesh and blood owners who are moral entities From thatperspective the rabbis analogy fails in a different way The current ownersof DaimlerBenz are not by and large the children of previous owners fromhalf a century ago Stocks trade hands every day            That observation seems tostrengthen Alexanders position If we should not punish children for the sinsof their fathers then surely we should not punish children for the sins oftheir fathers countrymen But that analysis can be definitive only to thosewho believe that nothing can be added to the words of Deuteronomy otherwisetheres more to be said            When is it permissible to punish one person for the wrongsof another The question is a tangle of moral and economic issues Morallywere concerned with things such as justice fairness and individual rightsEconomically were concerned with creating good incentives            To see how uncomfortableit can be when economic and moral issues brush up against each other considerthe revision of accident law thats been proposed by theeconomisticonoclastlaw professor David Friedman Friedman suggests that whentwo cars collide causing a total of say  worth of damage everyone whowas within a mile of the accident should be required to pay a fine of That way anyone who sees an accident about to happen will take allcostjustified measures to prevent it perhaps by honking furiously to warn ofimpending danger To my knowledge Friedmans proposal has never struck anyoneas fair but at least it gets the incentives right            Or does it My own view is that the Friedman plan failseven by its own strictly economic criteria because it creates an incentive forpeople to avoid highaccident areas and take inefficiently long routes towherever theyre goingor to cancel their trips entirely In principle itcould even increase the accident rate by scaring potential good Samaritans offthe roads Enforcement of course would be a nightmare            Those objections asideFriedmans proposal does illustrate the tension between economic and moralconsiderations And Friedmans innocent bystanders are at least partlyanalogous to DaimlerBenzs innocent stockholders Lets keep those lessons inthe back of our minds as we revisit the DaimlerChrysler controversy            Corporations can be punished for misdeeds in at least twoways One is a consumer boycott and another is a voluntary or involuntaryfine Both kinds of punishment have been visited on DaimlerBenz thougharguably at levels that are small compared with the underlying offenses Inthe s the corporation paid about  million to the descendants of itsslave laborers            Who exactly suffers fromthose punishments You might think the  million came from the pockets ofthose who owned DaimlerBenz stock in the s but thats not necessarily thecase Suppose for the sake of argument that in  it becomes foreseeablethat DaimlerBenz will eventually make reparations Then every share ofDaimlerBenz stock sold between  and  sells at a discount reflectingthat expectation Without the discount nobody would buy the stock So givensufficient foresight the prospect of a  punishment hurts the  ownerseven if they sell in the interim And those who buy stocks after  are notpunished at all because the discount compensates them for the fine            Therefore if all companies are permanently on notice thatbad behavior will eventually be punished they have an incentive to behave wellat all times Thats an outcome that seems both fair and economicallyefficient The punishment falls on the sinners and thereby deters the sin Buthere are two caveats            First even if punishment is inevitable it fallsnot on the owners at the time when the sin is committed but on the owners atthe time when the sin is discovered After all its not till the discoverythat the stock price falls So punishing past corporate sins is not like finingeveryone who was present when an accident occurred but when it was reportedwhich seems both unfair and pointless But this caveat has a countercaveat Theprospect of future punishments gives you an incentive to investigate thecorporations history before you buy which improves the chance that badbehavior can be uncovered while the actual perpetrators can still bepunished            Second its hard tomaintain a consumer boycott especially when the goal is to punish the pastrather than to influence the future Consumers can quite reasonably argue thathistory cant be changed and so is best forgotten As a result corporationshave little to fear from boycotts unless consumers commit themselves tomaintaining the boycotts even when they serve no purpose Its hard to imaginehow such commitments might be maintained which suggests that fines are moreeffective than boycotts especially if they are written into law rather thanimposed on an ad hoc basis            If youre looking for a firm conclusion to all this youllhave to look elsewhere I hope Ive at least illuminated some of the attendantmoral and economic issuesthough even these can become very different insituations that are superficially similar Click for an example            And punishing evil corporations is very differentfrom punishing evil governments In the first case we punish stockholders whoinvested voluntarily while in the second we punish taxpayers who might havebitterly opposed their governments policies But that is a topic for anothercolumn
