                                 The  Man            Bob Barro doesnt deserve asalary of  per year But then who does The ability to do innovativeeconomic research is at least as rare as the ability to sink a basketballthrough a hoopand a lot rarer than many other abilities that routinelycommand six or even sevenfigure salaries So there is nothing particularlyoutrageous in principle about the recordbreaking offer that has just inducedthe Harvard economist to move to Columbia University            Stillthe April  New York Times story that confirmed the rumors about Barrosdeal has caused quite a stir here in academe Nobody as far as I can tellbegrudges his good fortune Barro is by anybodys standards a firstrateeconomist But a description I once saw of Stephen Hawkings reputation amongphysicists applies to Barro quite well He is esteemed but not revered by hiscolleagues That is there are a couple of dozen other economists who can withreasonable justification regard themselves as being in the same league Arethey all now going to be demanding comparable paychecks            Well probably not But there is certainly the possibilityof a pay and perks explosion among a small circle of highprofile economistsWhyand what does it say about economics as a profession            The firstthing you need to do is drop any stereotype you may have about economists as abunch of suitwearing sloganparroting guys divided into squabblingideological factions I have never seen Barro in a suit the photo in theTimes was a revelation More important nobody makes a career inacademic economics by repeating traditional slogans Free trade goodprotectionism bad may get you a job at a think tank but not at HarvardAcademic success depends on a reputation for cuttingedge researchwhichtypically means either clever mathematical models or ingenious statisticalexercises that redefine some important issue or explode some piece ofconventional wisdom And while there are of course factions and cliqueswithin economicsdont get me startedthere is in general a surprisingdegree of agreement about what constitutes good work Mainly this is becauseleading university departments value technical skill and originality ratherthan ideology in fact the profession is startlingly apolitical given howpoliticsdriven economics is outside the ivory tower            Now it turns out that the ability to writehome run economics papersyes thats the phrase everyone uses in hiringmeetingsis a quite rare one Anyone who manages to do it two or three timesbecomes in the eyes of the whole profession a staragain thats the wordpeople actually useand immediately becomes a very desirable commodity Adepartment with five or six star faculty out of say  will be highlyvisible It will be the kind of department that can make a strong case to theuniversity administration that it should receive preferential financialtreatment because it contributes to the prestige of the university as a wholeand hence ultimately to the institutions ability to raise money A departmentwithout stars no matter how excellent its teaching or worthy its longruncontributions to human knowledge will not be able to make that case And soany economist who has managed to establish himself or rarely herself as auniversally acknowledged star can routinely expect to receive offers from manyof the leading departments            But notuntil now  offers Whats going on I think that a major part of theexplanation lies in the development of economic theory over the past couple ofdecades and a somewhat dysfunctional response of the profession to thosedevelopments            It is now becoming clear in retrospect that the s ands were a sort of golden age for the academic star system Some big newideasasymmetric information the seller knows if a car is a lemon thebuyer does not game theory rational expectations the market is as smartas the economist modeling it monopolistic competition etcopened updramatically new ways of thinking about a number of economic issues One ofthe truly ludicrous things about Brian Arthurs fantasy about how stodgy economists refusedto listen to his radical ideas is that it is set in an era that everyone knowswas in fact marked by a manic neophilia a worship of the wild and crazy Andfor a smart techedup guy it was a perfect environment for career buildingJust be the first person to work out how asymmetric information could beapplied to industrial organization or game theory to international tradetheory andprestoa star was born It became not only possible but commonfor a successful young economist to become famous within a few years aftergraduate school to become a full professor at a top school in his late s orearly s No sour grapes here My own career followed exactly that scriptAnd to this day top departments regard instant stardom as the normal careertrack for the kind of person they want to hire            Butsomething has gone wrong with the star formation process The people are assmart as ever but the state of economic theory has changed The bigliberating ideas of the s and s have been absorbedwe are liberated upto hereand now the problem is one of application of really careful work thathelps us decide which wild and crazy ideas actually make sense or fitthe facts A good barometer of the change is the John Bates Clark Medal whichis given every two years to an economist under  which incidentally makesit harder to get than the Nobel From the s to the early s the Clarkgenerally went to home run hitting theorists but the last couple have gone toempirical labor economists whose reputations have been built not on a couple ofthrilling papers but from an accumulation of careful dataintensive researchThe days of instant stardom in other words appear to be largely over            And yet the demand for stars continuesunabated Indeed it has probably increased due both to culturalcontagionthis is the Age of Celebrity in all walks of lifeand to theheightened competition among universities for increasingly footloose donordollars So what happens Well ambitious departments are in more or less thesame position as producers of action films who having been unable to findbankable new stars are still bidding against each other for the services ofArnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis If a young economist should show even asimulacrum of oldfashioned star quality he is likely to be deluged withoffers but for the most part the race for academic prestige has become a gameof musical chairs in which everyone still wants the same old enfantsterribles  and there are not enough of them to go around In my own fieldof international trade the joke is that there are only three people in the top Result Juicy offers for a handful of aging superstars            Its not such a terriblething When you consider how large a role economics plays in our nationaldebateand how much of the public discussion of economics is dominated bycranks and poseursseeing a serious economist like Barro get offered what isstill by private sector standards a fairly modest paycheck doesnt seemparticularly out of line But I do worry that the Barro offer sends the wrongsignals to younger economiststhat by telling them the profession stillinsists on the appearance of superstardom that it only values home runs whenwe really ought to be looking for a solid series of base hits it willencourage what is already a disturbing propensity to favor attentiongrabbingshowmanship at the expense of deeper more timeconsuming work
