                                 The Affirmative Action Wars Part             The backlash against William G Bowen and Derek Boks The Shape of theRiver  a liberal defense of affirmative action has kicked into gear andmuch of it wont surprise you Theres the attacker Abigail Thernstromcoauthor with her husband Stephan of America in Black and White OneNation Indivisible and one of the loudest opponents of affirmative actionaround Theres the venue the Wall Street Journal editorial pageTheres the old jugglewithnumbers Is a  percent graduation rate for blacksat top colleges proof of the success of racesensitive admissions or of itsfailure Proof of success according to Bowen and Bok proof of failureaccording to Thernstrom The white graduation rate is  percent so shereconfigures the stats to show that blacks have a dropout rate thats percent higher for blacks than for whites            But Thernstoms main argument is original She says an education at an elitecollege doesnt matter as much as everyone says it does so elite collegesshouldnt work so hard to admit more blacks Bowen and Bok claim we needaffirmative action from top schools because thats what created the blackmiddle class in the first place Not so fast says Thernstrom Where are theircontrol groups demonstrating in some rigorous fashion that the equallyacademically strong ambitious and discipline black student who attends theUniversity of South Carolina instead of Oberlin does less well in lifeLacking hard data Thernstrom supplies anecdotal evidence a list of blacks whodid well in life even though they didnt go to Princeton or Penn It includesCynthia Tucker editorial writer at the Atlanta Constitution  who wentto Auburn University Clarence Page a columnist for the ChicagoTribune  who went to Ohio Brent Staples of the New York Times  whowent to Widener Vernon Jordan who went to Depauw and so on            Leaving aside the little hooks that ripple this flowing counternarrative ofsuccess like the fact that Staples went to graduate school at the Universityof Chicago Culturebox is charmed by a certain selfinverting quality toThernstroms argument If like her we believe in strict formal equality in allthings rather than remedies to past discrimination and black people dontneed fancy schools to do well in life why should we think white people needthem either Think of the current master of the universe Disney chief MichaelEisner who graduated from Denison a university in Granville Ohio Or StevenSpielberg who never graduated at all But if white people dont need degreesfrom tony colleges to succeed why do Thernstrom and her cohorts care so muchabout these schools efforts to level the playing field The better strategywould be to cede it altogether leaving blacks to enjoy their Pyrric victoryMore fools they that they believe in the power of a Harvard education            Thernstrom sent her daughter Melanie Thernstrom to Harvard so we know shedoesnt accept the unintended consequences of her own argument But thatdoesnt undermine her case entirely Thernstrom is translating for broadconsumption a debate raging among economists It is widely known that there isa huge economic return on higher education in general The question is Isthere a bigger one on an education at an elite school In other words does itmatter where you went to college or that you went to college            In purely economic terms it turns out it matters only that you wentto college But pure economics doesnt explain why people like Thernstrom careso much about getting their kids into Harvard The answer is that a Harvardeducation does more than get your child into the middleclass or even theuppermiddle class It plugs your child directly into a network of people whomake up what used to be called the Establishmentwhich is exactly whereThernstrom would want her daughter to be             Judith Shulevitz
