            uhhuh   um i guess were supposed to talk about music   okay   and uh let me go ahead and push one here   uh do you have are you a musician yourself   uh well i sing i dont play an instrument though   uhhuh uhhuh where do you sing in in a choir or a choral group   oh not right now   uhhuh what kind of singing do you like to do     oh pretty much anything   yeah uhhuh Um are you uh are are have you have you been singing a long time or have you studied uhhuh   oh yeah a long time out all through college and everything i was in the choirs   right   and ive had some classical vocal training umhum   oh really oh great did did you do that in uh Texas or somewhere else   no i was in Europe   oh whereabouts   in uh in Germany   uhhuh oh thats wonderful um well i likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs and then i didnt sing in a choral group um until after i was uh married and i sang in a couple of uh community choirs and then  um waited for a while and now ive for about the last eight years ive sung in a church choir here in Texas and um   oh yeah     so i i enjoy just the chorals singing a lot as well Um are you a soprano alto or   umhum soprano   a soprano yeah so am i do you and uh what kind of music do you like to sing um you were saying you had classical training do you have a particular composer that you like or a particular type   oh well as far as opera goes im i think most fond of Verdi   uhhuh ive been listening to um some um some advertisements for Madam Butterfly and im wondering if you if you have ever done anything like that have you ever done any uh if if you had done Madam Butterfly   no no i havent done um id love to but   yes   um thats uh Puccini i think right   uhhuh yes uhhuh um Madam Butterfly was um in Dallas its been two or three years ago now and then i went to see that and it was really wonderful it was particularly well the acting was particularly nice i thought and um     umhum yeah   so it was quite popular um you dont play um an instrument so ah   no   uh um have you ever wanted to like guitar or piano or   uh i think it would be nice if i played the piano   yeah yeah that i think thats always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does you know some other kind of instrument i think piano is always good background beginner Um   uhhuh   i played piano all through well i guess from the time i was five five until i graduated from college and uh then i was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school so um that was the instrument both of my children started on but neither of them stayed with it   umhum   one of them um turned into a violinist and the other one is the boy is um guitar and and percussion so um   umhum   but the i i think that the piano background is very um useful and um im sure that it for you it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself just for practicing and so on   oh yeah     uhhuh do you have any other kind of music that you like   um oh i like to listen to all different kinds of music   umhum i have a i used to work with a fellow who had um although this was a computer company he had his uh PhD in musical uh i guess it was in composition actually from University of North Texas and uh when i would go into his his office every now and then you never knew what kind of music hed be playing on the radio It may be country it might be classical it might be rock you know it was just he said that that just about what you said that he just liked all kinds of music   umhum yeah   and that was that was neat for for me to hear that somebody is   theres you know some of the really totally country stuff i dont really particularly like but   yeah yeah um do you have any plans to uh do anything with your music in the near future or   well i have i have like we i wish i could but i i dont really know how to go about it without having a degree or   umhum yeah   um   i know that there are if youre interested in choral singing im not sure where you are in Texas but i do know that some communities have uh uh community choruses and uh thats often a good way to get back into it again um its not really terribly demanding you might have to audition but that probably wouldnt be a problem but um   uhhuh   there usually you know that they take tours and things like that and you get to know you know people um socially as well as as in a musical setting so thats always fun i think thats   umhum yeah   well thats one reason why i have enjoyed my choir so much is that not only do we sing wonderful music but weve gotten to know each other quite well um in on a a social level and i think we sing better because of that i think you know i think we sing more like uh   umhum thats good   people who trust each other  which is really nice   uhhuh yeah     so whereabouts in Texas are you if i could ask   oh im in Flower Mound uhhuh   Flower Mound okay well im in Plano so um were just not too far apart actually   yeah thats pretty close   uhhuh it was funny um  um its you know i talk to people all over uh Texas um and only one person outside of the country uh of the state so im always asking where where in the state you know the person is from if theyre in Texas   yeah   um are do you have a family   um im married   uhhuh i was wondering if your if your spouse or if you know if you had uh other musical people in your family   im sorry   uh if you have other people in your family who are also musical   oh a little bit   uhhuh do you come by it naturally was your were your parents that musical yeah yeah that often is the case um   yeah i think so   the you know its it sometimes it will skip like my husband is not musical at all but his mother is very musical and um and his children are very musical so  you never know where the talent is going to show up i guess sometimes so um  well im not sure how long weve talked i havent paid havent been paying attention to the to the clock but uh   i think   ill bet weve done weve done at least five minutes   probably   well i ve enjoyed talking with you uh Becky and um maybe well talk again uhhuh byebye   okay all right thanks byebye
