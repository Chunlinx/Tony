to a closeby February  and a contentious vote about witnesses resulting in thepossibility that Monica Lewinsky may end up on the Senate floor Thats justan expression USA Today  betting on impeachment fatigue puts Lewinskystestimony status inside and goes its own way with Russias faltering role inthe International Space Station NASA has just learned that Russiawont be ready with the next piece of the station on time And this comes ontop of Russias decision to keep its own aging station Mir in orbit raisingfears that Russia and its programmed contribution of up to  billion cannotbe depended on            The coverage explains that each impeachment witness will be questioned forfour hours by each side Two senators one from each party will supervise Thewitness plan authorizes videotaping of witnesses Lewinsky Vernon Jordan andSidney Blumenthal but requires majority votes of approval before theirvideotapes can be shown in the Senate and before the witnesses could be calledto testify before the Senate in person Even so the LAT says in itsleads subheader that yesterdays votes could pave way for public broadcastof witness tapes Also decided yesterday was that Republican managers cannotseek any additional evidence or testimony uncovered during these witnessdepositions without getting the approval of both Trent Lott and Thomas DaschleThe NYT and LAT call this provision giving Daschle a veto powerover the subsequent course of the trial The NYT goes much higher thanthe LAT or Post with word that the notion of a split decisionwhere a finding of fact is voted on in addition to the ultimate issue ofimpeachment is still a live option            The NYT reports that the White House expressed concern that theschedule is actually openended with spokesman Joe Lockhart threatening thatthe defense team might well respond with delays of its own The LAT leadreports that President Clinton visited Capitol Hill Thursday to attend amemorial service for Lawton Chiles a onetime Florida senator and governorwith the paper noting that Chiles daughter made a clear reference to theimpeachment trial by stressing to the senators in attendance the importance ofmercy But its the WP  in an

on projected government budget surpluses to fix Social Securityprimarily because budget forecasts have proven to be so unreliable TheWP front seizes on Greenspans declaration that the boom in Internetstock prices is good for our system in that its channeling capital topromising new enterprises before they actually turn a profit A Postinside piece notes instead that despite his doubts about the reliability ofsurplus projections Greenspan supported Clintons advocacy of using surplusesto draw down the national debt and to help fund Social Security The Wall Street Journal piece on the Chairmans appearancestresses this Social Security stance            According to inside stories in the WP  NYT  and WSJ Marine General Anthony Zinni commander of all US forces in the Persian Gulftestified at a Senate hearing yesterday that he had reservations about theClinton administrations proposal to arm opposition groups in Iraq because sucha move could create a rogue state there
