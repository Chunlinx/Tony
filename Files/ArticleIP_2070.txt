                                 Katz on the Cross            By Jack Shafer            Media critic Jon Katz hasachieved the impossible Hes recast some of Americas most fortunate sons anddaughters as victims in a cultural civil war            Critics are selfappointednot made and Katz is no exception After a journeymans career as a reporterand editor at the Washington                Post and several other big citydailies he made his first electronic news as the executive producer of theCBS                Morning                News in the late s There he says hewas run out of journalism and turned freelance media critic His firstbelated taste of cyberspace came in  when he connected to the WELL theBay Area bulletinboard system Id come home he writes and join theraging debates about media religion politics and the cyberculture            Plying his mediacrit tradeat Rolling Stone and New York  he eventually joined Wiredand its Web sibling HotWired  becoming Media Rant columnist on theNetizen channel in January  He struck an instant pose as the Webstroubadour and great defender simultaneously promoting it to outsiders andprotecting it from arrivistes like Slate which launched five monthslater The persona worked He quickly became one of the Webs signature voicesa Dave Garroway or Milton Berle who defined the nascent medium for mostpeopleinside and outside Webworld Brainy quick to identify enemies andflame them Katz indulged the clannishness of the Web pioneers who swarmed tothe site And they indulged him answering and amplifying hisprovocationscallandresponse stylein

for unlikely victims Who can shed tears for folk who are blessedwith smarts youth leisure time and moxie and who own plusPentium computers If any group has a right to consider itself vulnerable inthese cybertimes its Americas computer illiterates who stand in awe of theKatz Corps            But in Katzs world cybernauts are oppressed daily by TheMediaphobes the oldmediaworshipping JudeoChristianethicspreachingbackwardfacing windbags and pious souls who presume to know what is moral foryou and your family They despise the fact that you now get your news directlyfrom Usenet groups or chat rooms untainted by effete journalists they fumebecause todays politicians speak directly to the people via Larry KingLive and MTV they are furious because kids play interactive Nintendo gamesinstead of passively watching television cartoons            Although Da Man may jam IceTs signal hes been extraordinarily good to Katz The Old Media boys atRandom House have just published his new book Virtuous Reality How AmericaSurrendered Discussion of Moral Values to Opportunists Nitwits                Blockheads Like William Bennett and the Old Media boys at the New YorkTimes excerpted it in the Jan  Arts and Leisure section            Theirloss of control has been jarring to our traditional media and politicalorganizations who had sat astride a tight monopoly over politics and newsKatz writes in Virtuous Reality  They fought back and have beenfighting ever since complaining that these new interactive media are dangerousand destructive of public discourse New media have brought with them enormouscultural displacementthe journalists producers publishers editors andacademics who controlled most of our information flow have all been to varyingdegrees pushed aside They dont like it            Katzs fury against the Mediaphobes isimpressive yet only rarely does he name those conspiring to deny him and hiscyberweeny buddies their maximum media liberty He insinuates on many pagesthat the Big Media suffer from Mediaphobia but he mostly leaves them off thehook At the top of his short hate list resides popular scold William BennettBennetts books on virtues sell well But how effective a censor is he Wellhe did succeed in coercing Time Warner into selling its interest in thegangstarap heavy Interscope labelonly to see the label and its artiststhrive under the patronage of its new coowners MCA Also infected withMediaphobia is the opportunistic gang of legislators who passed theCommunications Decency Act knowing full well that the Supremes will overturnit And dont forget Tipper Gore During her brief and brilliant midscareer in rock n roll Comstockery she convinced some labels to affixvoluntary warning labels to mature materiala ratings system that manyyounger listeners embraced as a sort of Good Housekeeping Seal of ApprovalToday shes a ribboncutting second lady who avoids controversy Oh andTime magazine cried wolf about the prevalence of porn on the Net            Somecultural civil war            If there is a cultural civil war going on theMediaphilesled by Wall Streethave routed the phobes Big business haswagered hundreds of billions of dollars on the development of hightechlowcost media technologybroadband services satellites encryptiontechnology miniaturized computers and communications devices you nameitthat is largely impervious to the Bennetts and Gores of this world            Katzs waris won but declaring victory and resting his vocal chords would mean giving uphis career as the Jeremiah of cyberspace and finding a new hustle Stillcommercial calculation isnt sufficient to explain his stand He identifies sodeeply with the victims he has invented the aggrieved Internet comrades andthe chastised Jerry Springer fans that hes become one of them Lest one thinkIm exaggerating Katzs martyr complex check out Virtuous Reality sChapter  in which he chronicles the life and times of another political rebelwho embraced a new technology to speak truth to power and suffered greatly forit Thomas Paine            KatzequalsPaine is an awful stretch but hisbook invites the comparison Actually Katz better resembles that othericonoclastic s media hacker Ted Kaczynski the alleged Unabomber Not toimply that the Katz would threaten murder to get published in the WashingtonPost  To the best of my knowledge he hasnt maimed or killed anyone exceptthe characters in his Suburban Detective Mystery series Death by StationWagon  The Last Housewife  The Fathers Club  and TheFamily Stalker  But like the Unabomber Katz is driven frothy by a worldthat wont conform to his expectations Consider the parallels            Ted Kaczynski brooded alonein his cabin limiting his contact to the outside world to letters and booksobtained through the interlibrary loan systems He stands accused of authoringan impenetrable screed titled Industrial Society and Its Future  and ofbuilding bombs            Jon Katz broods in theisolation of his suburban basement office apparently limiting his contact tothe outside world to email from other selfpitying souls He composed hisVictims Manifesto that impenetrable screed called Virtuous Reality Ihope it bombs            Notreally I wish Virtuous Reality and Katz great success because hedeserves it Wrapped tightly in his Web cocoon the First Netizen of the Churchof Cyberspace suffers hourly in the service of his new media victims thetimorous who prefer the Internet to the terror of facetoface contact theparanoid who extrapolate the world is out to get me conspiracies from thedetritus of politics Game Boy boys phone phreaks the kids down at the SmutShack and the teeming millions whose idea of a reality check is consulting aWeb address            Katzs basement sounds like a clammy and frightening placeto work but its not the scariest place he knows as he confided to NewYork magazine two months ago in a piece about his suburban community ofMontclair NJ            Montclair is a place whereIm totally comfortable walking my dog at one or two in the morningwhich I doall the time Katz said But Im far too frightened to go to a schoolboardmeeting
