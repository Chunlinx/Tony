CorpgroupCorptravelers and Groupciti we hear and will become the fifth largestAmerican corporation The newspapers accounts of the size of the deal varysomewhat the New York Timessays its  billion the Washington Post says  billion USA Today the LosAngeles Times and Wall Street Journal say its  billion The NYTfigure apparently doesnt take into account the increase in the companiesshares during the Wall St explosionthe Dow closed over  for the firsttime everthe deal touched off            The papers report that the new financial services company will offeronestop shopping for consumers and corporations The NYT andWP are somewhat breathless about the possibility but the LATsays its not at all clear that consumers want this noting that previousefforts to offer it have generally failed The WSJ elaborates pointing out that previoushighprofile attempts by American Express and Sears to crosspollinate withWall St partners failed In addition notes the Journal  creating ahuge fullservice financial edifice flies in the face of the trend towarddiscount brokerage firms and cheap online trading            The dailies emphasize that the most striking part of the deal is thatcurrent laws in force since the Depression prevent financial crossselling onthis scale The deal boldly challenges all this says the WP  puttingpressure on Congress and regulators to change the status quo in the next fiveyears before the deal goes into full effect The NYT calls this featureremarkable brashness and the LAT says it is its most remarkableaspect Another pressure factor is that its widely believed this merger willinspire other similar ones            Another unusual aspect of the deal drawing lots of comment is thatTravelers Sanford Weill and Citicorps John Reed have decided to rule theirnew kingdom as coCEOs A piece on the USAT Money front page saysexperts are dubious about the arrangement The WSJ wonders if the twomen can merge their egos And the NYT business section piece on therelationship runs under the header The Odd Couple            Weill and Reed are quoted as saying the merger will not produce largescalelayoffs But notes the WSJ  layoffs of over  employees followedeach of Weills previous big deals            As has become common in merger reporting some of the papers attempt tocloak the event in intrigue and drama The Journal and the NYTtry to summon atmosphere with their descriptions of early meetings where thetop dogs sniffed each other And the WP says the excitement waspalpable during Mondays news conference at the Waldorf announcing the mergerwith the arrival of Weill and Reed reminding the paper of nothing so much asthe arrival of movie stars at the Academy Awards But the excitement is notinfectious after all what you have here basically is suits writing checks tothemselves            Indeed the only real corrective to all the days money euphoria comes inthe WP frontpage piece Boom Is FineIf You OwnStock which notes that six of every ten American households still do notown any shares of anything            The LAT front reports that the California Supreme Court handed adefeat to unwed fathers with its ruling Monday that a man who fathers a childwith a women who is married to someone else may be denied all legal parentalrights As the paper points out this is significant in a state where a thirdof the children are born to couples who are not married to each other            If you missed the two top stories in yesterdays USAT thegovernments first postderegulation attempt to preserve competitiveness amongairlines and the emergence of a drug that can prevent breast cancerthey areon the NYT s front today            The WP runs a piece inside reporting that during a church servicelast Sunday Cardinal John OConnor of New York criticized PresidentClinton from the pulpit for taking Catholic communion while in SouthAfrica The South African priest who invited Clinton to do so is quoted in thepaper as saying that once Clinton stood up he was thinking about how muchembarrassment it would have caused him by my saying please sit down            Novelist Lucian Truscott IV a former Army officer and son and grandson ofgenerals writes a NYT oped in support of the Clinton administrationslatest assault weapons ban Truscott compares the intensive training you get inthe Army with one of these weapons long before youre ever allowed to fire itand then only under the supervision of an expert marksman with the situationin states like Arkansas where its legal for a yearold to own asemiautomatic assault weapon without a moment of safety
