                okay Michelle um could you give me a few ideas on what you think is wrong with our public school system   um i dont think that the parents back the teachers enough any more like with discipline and and such and i think that the um because of that the teachers are starting to lose oh i dont know lose interest like you know before like they would really try and help you i think and i can see the difference from when i was in high school and my little brothers and sisters are in it now where the teachers like they cant discipline you whenever you are you know so they just dont even care any more   yeah  im not sure if thats if thats a condition of of the lack of interest of the parents or if thats a condition of the administrators in the school systems um  ive got a brotherinlaw that was was teaching in Connecticut down by the Navy base and they have a  a a   umhum   fairly a transient population you know theyre um only stationed there for a short period of time so most of the kids never get to finish high school uh there one or two years and then they have to be theyre shipped off some place else  and he teaches uh  he teaches English and he teaches uh shop   umhum   and it got to a point where he said that the administrators were coming to him just about every year having him downgrade his English exams because too many students were failing them   oh thats not good     yeah so in that particular school system um that was that was one of the problems and i guess one of the reasons the administrators uh were were putting so much pressure on him was uh the parents were going to them saying you know my Johnny or my Mary is smarter than that and blah blah blah and they cant fail and so   oh you know and thats really bad because thats really hurting them in the long run because up here at college now um we are so far behind the foreign students   thats right   they are so far more advanced than we are and a lot of them even know their English grammar better than i do and they cant speak it as well but i mean to write it is probably better than the way i write it   um yeah because they uh they care its something that they want to learn um   umhum   im sure youre youre more uh fluent in other things the things that youre interested in than some other people too uh ive been out of school for a long time so you know when i went to school i it was in a rural area and they had like two grades in the same class so when youre i think it was uh  first and second third and fourth were in the same classroom so when you went through the first grade and you graduated you went to the second grade you just moved to the second half of the class on the other side of the room i found looking back at it now that   umhum yeah   when i was in the second grade i knew just about everything that was there i had learned it from the first grade and the same thing with the fourth i had learned it so its the amount of teaching you get i think uh um youre like a sponge when youre young you absorb just about everything that they can throw at you   umhum   um today well youre youre closer to it now than i am um did you go to high school in Pennsylvania   yes i did   okay so thats youre youre native then to Pennsylvania so how was your high school did they have with the split out like some people were going to college so they took certain courses and some people were shop   uhhuh okay yeah we had um college advanced courses and if you were going to college you could take them or if you didnt want to go to college you didnt have to take them but they were optional you know they were there if anyone wanted to take them just because you were going if you if you wanted to take them and you werent going to college you still could they didnt limit it to just the people who wanted to college could take them um our math i think we were very strong in our math we were taking tests and our math   okay okay   was um placing like third and fourth in like the nation where you had to send them in   oh that was good yeah   and our and our you know for our level and stuff like that you know they had the placing were placing third or fourth but our English i feel was way below i dont know if im just more math oriented but like even on my SATs i scored two hundred more points on my math than i did in my English and to have that big of a spread is unreal   yeah yeah um and we were just the opposite up here um i took the same algebra class two years in a row same book same teacher and thats only because of our school system but as far as English um   umhum      we had a professor that taught English which was very unusual for our school system so our English was probably better than than most of the other school systems in in the state   umhum   um up here now were finding that more and more parents of are pulling their children out of the school systems and they are tutoring them at home   really   yeah i work with uh a couple of the people that i work with you know share the same office are doing that theyve pulled their children out and they get a much rounder education um and why that is i dont know i think its too much administration at the top   umhum   also i dont know the level of the teachers today are they dedicated like they used to be years ago or is it just a  its just a job so they can get the summers off   i dont think they are umhum   how about college   im very disappointed with professors at college theyre only required to be in their office five hours out of the entire week some of them only have two or three classes and at the most they probably spend five hours in their classes and five hours that theyre required to be in their office thats ten hours a week theyre probably making more i know theyre making more than my father and he you know hes making like forty five thousand and a lot of them have like other part like i know a lot of the business majors and computer   hum   professors  they have other jobs like some of them may be accountants and they do accounting you know and this is just to me it seems like its a hobby to them and i dont and ive even expressed to some of my professors i dont think its right as i think they should be spending more time and too they they teach the same class year after year well i know one professor he comes up from Pittsburgh you know and he hasnt changed his tests or  even his you know presenting material in years you can get the notes off someone else and never go to class and just go for your midterm and final and as long as you study those notes from two years ago youre still going to do fine in his class   thats incredible thats incredible   and i i i dont think it i dont think its right at all  just like youre not even teaching any more you dont care youre getting paid whether we show up or not i mean uh i i just im very disappointed with the   so when he files his lesson plans for the year he just he just drags out the old ones and just files them and nobody even looks at them and all that is fine and   yeah uhhuh yeah he just has the same outlines year after year   so hes getting away with it so is it is it his fault or is it his boss or the people that he has to respond to report to   i i dont know because you know we fill out a student evaluation form every semester you fill one out on your professors and i know   and who does that   me and along with other students we we have the same complaints year after year and nothing seems to be getting done so i dont know if they even   who does that go to though who does that evaluation form   its supposed to ones supposed to go to the professor himself and um another is supposed to go to like the administration i dont know if theyre just doing it to satisfy the students so they think that were doing something   thats what it sounds like   or  th eyre usually really using it but i know we complain about the same thing year after year you know   do they do they ever publish any results um   no   how about the student newspaper   um what about it   would it be wise to put an article in there say you know were doing these evaluations and every year were were making the same evaluations but yet the administrations not looking at the evaluations   oh well you know theyve even done stuff like that our teachers are now telling us that these do you know apply they please fill them out properly you know we are really are using them they tell us that but we dont see  any you know   yeah what do you think uh can be done   i have no clue what you mean i dont know what else we can do   as far as um well one others things probably is i dont know if it happens down there but every time the contracts teachers contracts come up its just before school season starts and they all go on strike so they close the schools down until they get what they want   umhum   whats the matter with the uh students doing the same thing say hey uh were we want a quality education and were not getting it lets go on strike you know then see what youre going to do itll create a lot of headlines thats for sure   yeah my high school had a walk out two years ago
