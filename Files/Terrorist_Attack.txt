Terrorist Attack Upstages Legal Services Initiative ButProvides Greater Urgency For ItBy Thomas AdcockOne morning last year David Bookstaver arrived at work in lowerManhattan and literally pulled the plug on the first official newsof what is surely the most substantial initiative for pro bonopublico in the history of the New York State Unified CourtSystem establishment of the Access to Justice Center the firstcourtsponsored entity in the nation to address the shortfall ofcivil legal services to the poorAs communications director for the courts Mr Bookstaverordinarily has the duty of spreading such news across the stateBut on the morning in question Mr Bookstaver a formerjournalist knew there was only one story to be told the big onestill making headlines known as simply Mr Bookstaver was himself caught up in the middle of that bigstory walking along West Street on the way to his office At am the second terrorist piloted plane of the day screamedoverhead then slammed into the south tower of the World TradeCenterWith building debris and an ocean of smoke and dust pouring downfrom the sky Mr Bookstaver ran for his life  four blockssoutheasterly to the Office of Court Administration at  BeaverStreet He would later tell a New York Law Journal reporter of thedeafening thunderous whistling noise that was like a missile  asound I never hope to hear againFinally he was safe inside OCA headquarters part of a storycomplex But even there he recollected the walls shook and atelephone slid off his desk as the twin towers of the former WorldTrade Center imploded and collapsed He spotted his assistant MaiYee at the fax machine She had just sent the official news to thefirst contact on her list the Law JournalI took the cord out of the wall from the fax machine MrBookstaver said in a recent interview I said Look Im notgoing to send out something thats terribly important that could beconstrued as trivial Meanwhile in Albany three top jurists were set to back up thenews release with a press conference  Chief Judge Judith S KayeChief Administrative Judge Jonathan Lippman and Judge Juanita BingNewton deputy chief administrative judge for justice initiativesBut never mind news of the Justice Center  all the more importantin the wake of Sept  an event that left thousands more NewYorkers impoverished  would have to wait Mr Bookstaversreasoning for the delay went deeper than journalistic instinctback to his years as press officer for the Emergency Services Unitof the New York Fire Department With reference to the devastationhe witnessed he said Most people would think that with all thosefirefighters that it was OK that things were under control But Iknow too much I knew that friends of mine were dying in thosebuildingsThus the consensusbuilding for the Justice Centers main orderof business  the creation of a working structure for the orderlydonation of legal services by the private bar  did not commenceuntil last June with the first of four pro bono convocations heldat the Manhattan campus of Fordham University School of LawTwo more convocations are scheduled for October at the StateUniversity of New York campus in Buffalo on Oct  and at AlbanyLaw School on Oct  The final convocation is set for Nov  inGeneva at the Ramada Inn Notes on the wideranging discussions ateach convocation will be compiled by Judge Newtons office andsubmitted to the Court of Appeals for further considerationPublic Service Bar ExamAt the same time though in a far less formal way consensusbuilding also began in June for yet another farreaching proposalfor the courts consideration one with a distinctive pro bonoelement  the socalled Public Service Alternative Bar ExaminationWithin the next several weeks the Association of the Bar of theCity of New York and the New York State Bar Association will issuea joint report based largely on the findings of a threeyear studyby Kristin Booth Glen a former State Supreme Court judge and deanof the City University of New York School of LawThe report will recommend a pilot project of up to two yearsduration to assess the effects of substituting public service forthe multistate law segment of the current bar exam At personaloption law school graduates could perform supervised work in thecourts instead of demonstrating their ability to memorize tracts ofblack letter law In an essay scheduled for publication next monthin the Columbia Law Review  titled Thinking Out of the Bar ExamBox a Challenge and Proposal for Change  Dean Glen contends thatpublic service scored by specially trained evaluators would be amore useful test of future lawyers potential than rote memory andwould simultaneously strike down what she sees as unfair barriersfor poor people and minorities seeking entry to the legalprofessionIn a copy of her essay for the Columbia Law Review Dean Glensuggests that students opting for public service could help fillwhat Chief Judge Kaye and others have championed in the wake ofSept  the need to maintain the historic outpouring of volunteerlawyering and increase the spirit of volunteerismThe alternative exam would require applicants to work aslawyers in the court system for  to  weeks performing avariety of tasks Dean Glen writes in her essay The courtsystem has an enormous need for additional lawyer assistanceThe chief judge has created numerous worthy justice initiativesbut because there is little or no additional funding thecourts must rely on pro bono legal services if those initiativesare to be successfulPlacing bar applicants for three months contributes to butdoes not solve the courts needs the essay continued This iswhy those who elected the alternative exam would have anadditional obligation pro bono hours owed to the court systemin the three years following admissionFor every  successful alternative exam takers the courtswould have  pro bono hours of service to be utilized as thecourts found most compelling As an additional advantage all ofthat pro bono service would be done by attorneys already familiarwith and trained in the courts they would serveAs an example of urgent pro bono need Dean Glen cited the CivilCourt of New York the nations busiest In landlordtenantdisputes small claims and housing matters high numbers of poorlitigants must argue pro se Only some of them receive help fromthe Civil Courts SelfRepresentation Office which Dean Glentermed a valiant attempt at fair resolution In the press releasedelayed by Mr Bookstaver last September Judge Lippman was moreforceful in assessing the need for pro bonoThe state of civil legal services has reached a turning pointin New York Judge Lippman said in the release Ninety percent ofall tenants appearing in Housing Court  many facing eviction fromtheir homes  do not have an attorney And while the demand isgreat the supply is shrinkingThe New York State Access to Justice Center will galvanizeour efforts to find permanent civil legal service funding streamsand I am confident that it will make significant headway in thisimportant area of public interestAmong the approximately  lawyers at the Fordham convocationwas Kevin J Curnin a senior associate at Stroock  Stroock Lavan LLP and attorney director of the firms Public ServiceProjectWe heard a lot of good ideas from people whove beencontributing for many years to pro bono service said Mr CurninWe have to sift through all the ideas and decide whats best forthe state and how to accommodate our differences We do thingsdifferently in New York City for instance than upstate Headded Weve made a good startFrederick P Rooney director of the Community Legal ResourceNetwork at CUNY Law identified a major task ahead in meeting ChiefJudge Kayes hopes for keeping the pro bono ball rollinglegislationWeve got to reduce the liability of lawyers willing to engagein pro bono in much the same way the Good Samaritan Law protectsdoctors who stumble onto accidents and provide care said MrRooney who is also a general practice partner in Rooney Mannicci Gardner LLC of Bethlehem PaOn the Public Service Alternative Bar Examination Mr Curninwas reserved It will be a lightning rod for controversy hepredicted But a new idea like that as bold as it is  thatswhat youd expectTaking note of the generally conservative impulse of New Yorkslegal community Mr Curnin suggested that the multiple pro bonoaspect of Dean Glens sweeping proposal could be lost on judges whomight dismiss the matter in terms of a bar exam procedural issuewith a social good patinaA lot of people are going to look at it and say Well I tookthe exam the way it is and thats what I had to do it said MrCurnin What Id love to see is this alternative bar exam inconjunction with an increase in legal work for the poor at lawschool clinics Perhaps if the economic doldrums continue and thepoor get poorer the pro bono increase that Mr Curnin and otherswant will indeed occur There does seem to be a relationshipbetween the state of the economy and the amount of free legalservice that big firms at least are willing or able toperformTwo years ago American Lawyer magazine a sister publication ofthe Law Journal found that during the fat year of  theapproximately  lawyers at the nations  highestgrossingfirms spent an average of eight minutes a day on pro bono cases orabout  hours per year which is down significantly from anaverage  annual hours during the recession year of  TheAmerican Bar Association recommends that private firm attorneyscontribute  hours per year to pro bono work By contrast NewYorks Volunteers of Legal Service recommends  hoursEsther F Lardent director of the Pro Bono Institute atGeorgetown University Law Center said the good economic times ofthe late s saw lawyers at large firms suddenly responsible foras many as  billable hours per year compared with the lesstime consuming and more typical  hoursPoverty law agencies too have recently registered fewer hoursof service to clients who most needed legal help In  aRepublicancontrolled Congress prohibited lawyers receiving federalfunding  the mainstay of nearly all poverty law offices  fromengaging in classaction lawsuits and matters involving abortionillegal immigration or challenges to reduced welfare benefitsinaugurated by President Clinton and some other Democrats But evenin good times  for lawyers at least  there remain two seeminglyimmovable stumbling blocks for private attorneys willing to go tobat for poor people caught up in Civil Court mattersCorporate lawyers whose transactional work seldom takes theminside a live courtroom full of emotional frightened civilians andtesty judges may feel like fish out of water in the great sea ofpro bono work divorce and child custody issues landlordtenantsuits workers compensation and Social Security claimsIn a recent interview Chief Judge Kaye noted efforts by theCity Bar and by emergency consortia of large Manhattan firms toaddress this concernWe saw a whole new model develop  a holistic approach tolawyering onestop shopping she said Corporate lawyersreceived brushup training from the City Bar and a given firmwithout certain expertise felt free to call on another firm thathad it The result for pro bono clients traumatized by Sept said Chief Judge Kaye was more efficient delivery of neededservice emotional frightened clients had only one contact tomake no matter how many problems they had the lawyers would sortout the mess One of the principal functions of the Access toJustice Center she said would be to foster such a holisticapproachThe Slowly Grinding Wheels of JusticeOn the second point Judge Newton said in a recent interviewIve heard this complaint a hundred times An attorney arrives inCivil Court at  in the morning hoping the matter can be takencare of in an hour But then for a whole range of reasons the casemight not be heard until late in the afternoon  if at all thatdayIn meetings around the state Judge Newton has invited courtadministrators to suggest solutions to such complaints A solutionthat makes most sense she said would be to change calendarprocedures in order to expedite hearings where pro bono counsel arescheduled to appearWe can solve this if we keep working together said JudgeNewton With reference to the dramatic increase in pro bono afterSept  she added The first thing I learned is that there is agreat passion among lawyers and judges to focus on access tojustice no matter what problems we have to solveThe second thing I learned is the importance of collaborationamong judges bar associations private attorneys and civil legalservice providers If we get everybody to the table wellcrystallize these problems and turn our focus onto solutions thatwill workMeanwhile Mr Rooney suggested that lawyers might individuallyelect to do more reduced fee or lowbono work  in the manner ofthe New York firm Marcos  Negron LLP Last year the ABApresented the firm with its Pro Bono Publico Award despite thefact that Marcos  Negron does not work for freeBut they do outstanding work at reduced fees and it was goodto see that encouraged by the ABA said Mr Rooney His own firmin Bethlehem he said operates under the Marcos  NegronphilosophyWe make a decent living Sure it would be great to make a lotmore But when you represent a client in desperate need of servicewho may not have the required retainer  guess whatThat person will come back to you when they have a personalinjury case or some other case that has the chance of substantialeconomic gain he said Kindness can pay off
