                                 More Sex Is Safer Sex             By StevenE Landsburg                            words postedFriday July  to be composted Friday July                         Its true AIDS isnatures awful retribution for our tolerance of immoderate and sociallyirresponsible sexual behavior The epidemic is the price of our permissiveattitudes toward monogamy chastity and other forms of sexualconservatism            Youveread elsewhere about the sin of promiscuity Let me tell you about the sin ofselfrestraint            Suppose you walk into a bar and find four potential sexpartners Two are highly promiscuous the others venture out only once a yearThe promiscuous ones are of course more likely to be HIVpositive That givesyou a  chance of finding a relatively safe match            But suppose allonceayear revelers could be transformed into twiceayear revelers Then onany given night youd run into twice as many of them Those two promiscuousbar patrons would be outnumbered by four of their more cautious rivals Yourodds of a relatively safe match just went up from  to four out of six            Thats why increasedactivity by sexual conservatives can slow down the rate of infection and reducethe prevalence of AIDS In fact according to Professor Michael Kremer of MITseconomics department the spread of AIDS in England could plausibly be retardedif everyone with fewer than about  partners per year were to takeadditional partners more frequently That covers threequarters of Britishheterosexuals between the ages of  and  Much of this column is inspiredby Professor Kremersresearch            Ifmultiple partnerships save lives then monogamy can be deadly Imagine acountry where almost all women are monogamous while all men demand two femalepartners per year Under those conditions a few prostitutes end up servicingall the men Before long the prostitutes are infected they pass the diseaseto the men and the men bring it home to their monogamous wives But if each ofthose monogamous wives was willing to take on one extramarital partner themarket for prostitution would die out and the virus unable to spread fastenough to maintain itself might die out along with it            Or consider Joan who attended a party where she ought tohave met the charming and healthy Martin Unfortunately Fate through itsagents at the Centers for Disease Control intervened The morning of theparty Martin ran across one of those CDCsponsored subway ads touting thevirtues of abstinence Chastened he decided to stay home In Martins absenceJoan hooked up with the equally charming but considerably less prudentMaxwelland Joan got AIDS Abstinence can be even deadlier than monogamy            If those subway ads aremore effective against the cautious Martins than against the reckless Maxwellsthen they are a threat to the hapless Joans This is especially so when theydisplace Calvin Klein ads which might have put Martin in a more sociallybeneficent mood            Youmight object that even if Martin had dallied with Joan he would only havefreed Maxwell to prey on another equally innocent victim To this there are tworeplies First we dont know that Maxwell would have found another partnerWithout Joan he might have struck out that night Second reducing the rate ofHIV transmission is in any event not the only social goal worth pursuing If itwere wed outlaw sex entirely What we really want is to minimize the numberof infections resulting from any given number of sexual encounters the flipside of this observation is that it is desirable to maximize the number ofconsensual sexual encounters leading up to any given number of infectionsEven if Martin had failed to deny Maxwell a conquest that evening and thusfailed to slow the epidemic hecould at least have made someone happy            To an economist its clear why people with limited sexualpasts choose to supply too little sex in the present Their services areunderpriced If sexual conservatives could effectively advertise theirhistories HIVconscious suitors would compete to lavish them with attentionBut that doesnt happen because such conservatives are hard to identifyInsufficiently rewarded for relaxing their standards they relax theirstandards insufficiently            So a socially valuableservice is underrewarded and therefore undersupplied This is a problem weveexperienced before We face it whenever a producer fails to safeguard theenvironment            Extrapolating from theirusual response to environmental issues I assume that liberals will want toattack the problem of excessive sexual restraint through coercive regulationAs a devotee of the price system Id prefer to encourage good behavior throughan appropriate system of subsidies            The question is How do wesubsidize Martins sexual awakening without simultaneously subsidizingMaxwells ongoing predations Just paying people to have sex wont worknotwith Maxwell around to reap the bulk of the rewards The key is to subsidizesomething that is used in conjunction with sex and that Martin values more thanMaxwell            Quiteplausibly that something is condoms Maxwell knows that he is more likely thanMartin to be infected already and hence probably values condoms less thanMartin does Subsidized condoms could be just the ticket for luring Martin outof his shell without stirring Maxwell to a new frenzy of activity            As it happens there is another reason to subsidizecondoms Condom use itself is underrewarded When you use one you areprotecting both yourself and your future partners but you are rewarded with alower chance of infection only for protecting yourself Your future partnersdont know about your past condom use and therefore cant reward it withextravagant courtship That means you fail to capture the benefits youreconferring and as a result condoms are underused            It is often argued thatsubsidized or free condoms have an upside and a downside The upside is thatthey reduce the risk from a given encounter and the downside is that theyencourage more encounters But its plausible that in reality thats not anupside and a downsideits two upsides Without the subsidies people dontuse enough condoms and the sort of people who most value condoms dont haveenough sex partners            All these problemsalongwith the case for subsidieswould vanish if our sexual pasts could somehow bemade visible so that future partners could reward past prudence and therebyprovide appropriate incentives Perhaps technology can ultimately make thatsolution feasible I envision the pornography of the future Her skirt slidto the floor and his gaze came to rest on her thigh where the imbedded monitorread This site has been
