                     Ive never been timid in my life         This is a change of pace for me         I grew up in a small town east of Charlotte Hamlet         There are only  people there and in the s it was a great place to grow up         Its a railroad town and most people work for the railroad including my dad         So were all pretty much on the same economic plain         There wasnt too much difference between anyone         The schools were not integrated at that time which was just a way of life         We didnt think of it as right or wrong it was just the way things were         The biggest prejudice that we saw exercised at the schools the children that lived out of town were called bus children and they were brought into town on a bus and they were grouped together in a class         They had to come earlier in the morning and had to stay later in the afternoon and most of them were poor because if you tried to farm in the sand hills of NC it was pretty hard to make a living         The soil is not particularly fertile         The freedom that we had as children is unheard of today         There was nowhere in town that you couldnt ride on a bicycle or walk as long as you told your mother where you were going and you were home by dark         I wish that my children growing up in a different age where they didnt have this kind of safety and where everybody in the town didnt look out for them could have had this experience of this much freedom         To be able to go into the woods on the edge of town and play without anybody worrying about me was a wonderful gift         And we had time to explore and imagine and do things without adult supervision which were totally innocent and great fun                  There were many interesting characters in this small town two of whom lived across the street from me         They were the Lann twins         These were identical twins who had dressed alike probably since the they day they were born         By the time I was a child they were well into middle age and were the most incredibly nosy people in this entire town         They went to the same church we went to First Methodist and they sat on a certain pew and woe be unto the person who sat that chose to sit on the Lann twins pew         They watched everybodys coming and going when we we kids on the street became teenagers         They could tell you who everyone was dating and if you were a girl whether or not you got a goodnight kiss under the porch light and probably reported it at every bridge table they sat at for the next several weeks         Probably my most memorable occasion with the Lann twins was when my mother died         Um my mother was very adamant about never telling her age         She was a good deal older than most people thought she was and she just didnt ever want that to be made public         She had made me promise that when she died that her age would not be put in the newspaper         She had been with us during her last illness about six or eight weeks where we were living in VA and died there         When we came home for the funeral we had not been in the house more than five minutes and here come the Lann twins across the street         The first words out of their mouths or out of one of thems mouths and their names were Augusta and Virginia and I never knew who was who so I dont know who asked the question         The first thing one of them asked was Kittys age was not in the newspaper how old was she         I said Kitty didnt tell her age when she was alive and I just dont think were going to start now         They were not even put off and did not even slow down         The next thing they wanted to know was I going to sell the things in mothers house and how much did I want for the mirror above the fireplace         It I guess it was somewhat reassuring even then that it didnt matter that they didnt express sympathy but that some things never change and always stay the same
