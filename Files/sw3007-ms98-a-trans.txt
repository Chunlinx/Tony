                 okay do you have any pets   yes ive had ive had a number of them in my lifetime and ive i am a golden retriever fan but i had to replace it with something that the kids could carry yes yes   yeah oh  instead of being carried   yes well they were they really wanted something teeny tiny and i uh really wanted that retrievers disposition uh the ultimate to tolerant trainable disposition so i called   yeah really   four or five dog trainers because i dont like the little dogs and and i asked them you know these are the ages of the kids what do i get   uhhuh   and they all said golden retriever and i said okay put it under twenty pounds and the only thing that they could come up with was a bichon frise which is a do you know what that is     huh yes ive seen those theyre cute   theyre cute they look like an airheaded dog but let me tell you theyre calm theyre not yappy theyre trainable theyre uh very personable in a different way that a golden retriever is theyre not dignified like a retriever can be yeah so how old is your retriever   uhhuh oh shes about four shes not completely pure we got her from the uh Humane Society when she was a puppy she looks like a golden she looks just like a golden retriever but shes a little bit smaller shes like fifty five pounds     well actually you know thats the breed standard for females what you yeah what you see shown and bred now as golden retrievers this you know plus eighty to a hundred pound range   is it uhhuh   that is not breed standard fifty five is the minimum but they usually run about sixty to sixty five and the ones that are shown   huh   they are inside that weight allowance you cannot show your retriever if its you know a hundred plus pounds so dont say shes small just say shes perfect   uhhuh oh huh yeah shes perfect well shes got a brown nose instead of black too     uhhuh   which makes her i guess unshowable even if she had papers which she doesnt but but we love her anyway shes just a lot of company to us we didnt   yep     we havent had any kids and were expecting a baby this summer but up until then shes been our substitute kid and she was a lot of fun   well they are they are the ultimate dogs to have around kids so long as your kids not scared of a big dog because i had a retriever actually i had a retriever Irish setter cross   right oh   which is a really nice animal and fortunately it was just like a retriever and then ive had a retriever   i bet it had a pretty coat too   it was gorgeous it was just gorgeous i mean just gorgeous um and they both you know both the half breed and the pure breed had the um what i consider the the the perfect disposition but you know what you know what scares me about golden retrievers   huhuh   since theyve become so popular you get what i call backyard breeders which is probably where yours came from people that dont know what theyre doing and   yeah   they breed them you know for a certain characteristic and in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big for somehow big is perceived as better and when you start doing that you really tamper with you know the all the the years of uh culling litters and and uh you tamper with what the dog innately is   yeah   we when i was when i bought my last purebred retriever i mean i looked all over because i wanted one that still looked like retriever you know the short to the ground stocky golden uh trainable tractable quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house and i ended up getting one that uh came out of a a a hunting stock because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did   right oh   and ive seen an awful lot of lately really dumb       dumb retrievers and im and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that its going to be ruined   yeah we have some friends with a brother and sister golden retriever and those dogs have been having seizures and i wonder since both of them are having them if its some kind of a breeding problem     oh yeah you bet you you bet you you know how they came up with the retriever dont you the golden it was bred out of several different retrievers and they bred it for companionship and uh uh disposition and and ability to hunt it was kept only by kings   huhuh oh   but they selectively culled those litters i mean for many hundreds of years and since it slept in the castle with its master i mean it had it had to be of a disposition to make it you know an animal you could keep around that closely but but they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect now you know that seems like a cruel thing to do   yeah   on the other hand you sure you know they sure created a a wonderful breed i mean a wonderful breed   yeah they did i i had never really had a golden retriever before we were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husbands family had had shepherds and all the other we looked at some of shepherd mixes and the puppies werent very       uh social and stuff and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling  and that was mine   uhhuh well i tell you you know the the German shepherd is the classic case of what im talking about because in America thats called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena   uhhuh   only in America is there a dog called a German shepherd that dog is bred out of three European dogs the Belgian Tervurien a German schutzhund and   oh really   i always forget the third one i can see it uh  but the third one is a childrens dog and   oh   there are distinct breeds in Europe now what happened over here was is that people saw the the first um which would actually have been a schutzhund which is what Rin Tin Tin was   uhhuh   and everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin and it was known as a German shepherd here       so they created a breed standard the American Kennel Club did that said anything that is a schutzhund a a Tervurien and uh Alsatian thats the other one Alsatian   oh   any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here and what happened is is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect and they bred a dog that   huh   i the its called a an animals critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you       that German shepherd the American German shepherd here was a a a such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute refused to use them because they would turn on their on their handlers and   uhhuh huh uhhuh   even um uh police corps which started you know finding other breeds to use because this thing this this thing known as a German shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible so about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this so they went back to Europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred   uhhuh   to a standard what they wanted an American German shepherd to be which is a very heavily now schutzhund and Alsatian and its the Alsatian thats the kids dog its just you see them in Europe and theyre just lovely   huh   but youll see i mean if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for German shepherds they will say on them bred for disposition AKC conforming   huh   which means that their advertising that this is no longer an indiscriminate dog this is bred for and they had to go through and destroy a for a while there about seventy five percent of their puppies that they bred   wow   because they were looking for this disposition and nowadays you youll get youll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific you know breeder handler theyll recommend their shepherds as a childrens dog but   huh
