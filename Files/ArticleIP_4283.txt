                                 Bleak Houses            Todd Solondz the skinny guywith the thick glasses and oddly passionate drone had an arthouse smash in with Welcome to the Dollhouse  which reinforced the perception thatarthouse smashes are pictures that take one bleak uncommercial idea andpummel you into a stupor with it Telling the story of a myopic adolescent girlwhos persecuted by her peers and slighted by her suburban family whichreveres her pretty little sister a goodytwoshoes in a tutu Solondzprolonged his heroines humiliations until I wanted to scream I GET ITALREADY He was a maestro all right but of the sadistic kind and themovies laughs didnt leaven its punishingly untranscendent miserytheycondensed it This was the world as seen through glasses so thick they barelylet in light            Solondzsnew foray into misery Happiness  lays it on even thicker This timehowever he spreads the pain around and he brings in sundry instruments toshare in the playing of his lone theme The upshot defies categorizationHappiness is an aching roundelay a triumphantly benumbed ensemble farcethat mingles condescension and compassion in a manner thats disarminglyandoften upsettinglyoriginal            Before I go any further You should know that I havecollaborated with the coproducer of Happiness  Christine Vachon on anew book called Shooting to Kill  which may be ordered by clicking hereJust kidding Wait a minute Im not kidding Click here before you do anything else I was around forpreproduction and made a few casting suggestions politely ignored went on astupefyingly dull tech scout with the director and key crew watched somescenes being shot and got steady gossip from Christine that I cant share withyou although I might if you email me proof that youve bought the book Ithought about recusing myself but I have no direct financial ties to thepicture and think its one of the most interesting of the year Why should Ideprive myself                           Happiness revolves around three sisters who live some distance from alarge metropolis but the relationship to Chekhov ends there The place issuburban New Jersey Sweet tremulous Joy Jordan Jane Adams the youngesthas turned  and still lives in the house of her parents Mona Louise Lasserand Lenny Ben Gazzara who have a condo in Florida and are in the throes of avexingly tentative separation Middle sister Helen Lara Flynn Boyle is theauthor of arty titillating short stories and a magnet for studs and weightlifters she resides in a dim highrise down the corridor from two unrelatedfatties Kristina Camryn Manheim and Allen Philip Seymour Hoffman Thelatter a compulsive obscene phone caller who longs for his sleek chicneighbor is the psychiatric patient of Bill Maplewood Dylan Baker whohappens to be the husband of Helens older sister chipper Trish CynthiaStevensonand also a pedophile who in the course of the film drugs littleboys and has off camera sex with them            Pedophilia rape murder suicidedismemberment obscene talk Happiness is about the sense ofincompleteness that these seemingly disparate people carry inside themandmore important the ways in which their prodigious longings manifest themselvesin their sexual predilections And yet these kindred spirits almost neveracknowledge a connection Their similarities dont mitigate their alonenessand talking about their problems doesnt help much either Its no accidentthat Solondzs pedophile protagonist is a shrink and that the characters whoget things off their chests go ahead and act on them anyway Theres no suchthing as catharsis Come once youll want to come again and again andagain            Thepretitle sequence sets the drolly excruciating tone Joy has just told AndyJon Lovitz that she thinks they should stop seeing each other Solondz goesso tight on Lovitzs ample flesh that he could sweat off the screen and ontoyour lap But as his strangled monosyllables give way to lavish verbal abusethe shots go wider so that we take in the romantic restaurant awash in fakeplants and fripperya setting that mocks this unhappy couple the way themovies very title hangs over it like a mushroom cloud Solondz keepsHappiness right on the border between irony and empathy The gags areoften easy but the characters are in an authentic hell And there isnt atrace of irony in the skinny frazzled Adams whos as raw as a newly birthedgazelle Some directors know how to exploit their actors vulnerabilities andSolondz seems to have scraped off layers of his leading ladys skinits sotranslucent you can almost read her organs            At the other extreme Hoffman as one of the two fatneighbors is encased in his flab like a tortured prisoner of war His dolefullow tones and operatic mouthbreathing give even his vilest lines a dopeysweetness In fact Solondz compels us to collude with even his most unsavorycharacters Bakers pedophile is so furtive that hes almost immobile but weregister the darting eyes under the bland Mr Rodgerslike faade and as hewaits for a little boy to eat a drugged tuna sandwich we hold our breaths theway we did in Psycho when Norman Bates watched the car with the body ofMarian Crane almost not sink into the swamp The only character whose pain wedont feel is also the only normal one Stevensons Trisha sugarypassiveaggressive gargoyle who embodies everything that made some of us fleethe suburbs for the urban jungle            Not all ofHappiness is as consistently inspired The scenes of Joy at workwanting to do good she crosses a picket line to take a job teaching Englishas a second language are coarsely conceived and the parents Mona and Lennydont exist on the same level as the other characters Boyles Helen is a thindirty joke rescued only by a good punch line and Boyle who drops her voice toa husky whisper looks wildly out of place in this clearly Jewish family Butsome of the onejoke roles turn out to have more under the surface than is atfirst apparent In one scene fat Kristina tells Allen about a horrible deedshe has committed and while her listener attempts to process it appalledtucks into an ice cream sundae That might have been the cheapest kind of fatgag but because of the way its shot and acted our responses dont end with asnicker We can see that Kristina is living a life of nightmarish deprivationand getting the only kind of pleasure that she knows            John Waters once said that he would like tomake a film that received an X or NC rating with no foul language orgenitaliait would just be so offensive to peoples values Happinesscertainly has foul language as well as a brief shot of Joys uncoveredbreasts but whats truly shocking is its unblinking gazehard and clinicalbut also nonjudgmental Scenes in which Maplewoods son Rufus Read asks hisdad about masturbation come close to being healthy  But the context istoo spooky and the conversations creep into the red zone when the fatheroffers to demonstrate his technique            Solondzs writing doesntcut very deep but it does swing wide smashing taboos on all sidesthe filmis the dark side of Theres Something About Mary  And in some ways itcouldnt have had a more fitting launch At the same time that the picture waswinning an international critics prize at the Cannes Film Festival where itwas shown outside the main competition Universal the studio that financed itthrough its recently acquired indie wing October unloaded it in apaniclargely because its new owners the Bronfmans of Seagram feared beingassociated with a movie that featured a pedophile That the boozepeddlingBronfmans wanted nothing to do with a film that functions as the opposite of anintoxicant is the kind of irony with which Happiness teems            October did choose torelease The Celebration  a Danish dysfunctional family drama that treatsmatters of incest and perversion with a tad more taste Children siblingsnieces and nephews all gather at a prosperous estate to celebrate the th birthday of its formidable patriarch Henning Moritzen whoturns out to have had monstrous designs on two of his own children Youve seenthis sort of picture before People get drunk and drag skeletons out ofclosets and the tension between the formal dinner party rituals and the truthsthat simmer beneath the surface give way to a Walpurgisnacht  Theantipatriarchal content is fairly routine but you should see the movie anywaybecause the director Thomas Vinterberg is a great hypersensitive filmmakerwhose edgy grainy caughtonthefly camerawork seems to make the verycelluloid shiver with rage
