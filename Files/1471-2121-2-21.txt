                    Background        A nearuniversal feature of cell signaling         via seven transmembrane G        proteincoupled receptors is attenuation of a cellular        response upon prolonged exposure to an extracellular        stimulus     This desensitization process is        wellestablished for GnRHstimulated LH secretion from        pituitary gonadotropes      and occurs after about  h        of continued exposure to GnRH in rats     removal of        GnRH permits recovery from the profound suppression of LH        secretion albeit rather slowly  days  The        molecular mechanisms involved in GnRHinduced        desensitization are poorly understood but they do not        appear to be due to alterations in GnRH receptor expression            or to changes in LH concentrations in the pituitary        gland             Earlier we presented evidence that a regulator of G        protein signaling RGS might participate in the        regulation of GnRH receptor signaling     The mechanism        of RGS action is antagonism of the G protein either by        accelerating its hydrolysis of GTP thereby prematurely        terminating signaling due to reassociation of the G and        G complexes     or by antagonizing interaction of        the G protein with its effector such as phospholipase C             A large number of RGS genes have been identified        in mammals based on the presence of a  amino acid core        domain        RGS proteins have been described        that interact with the G         i  and G         q members of the G protein family                       Previously we showed that RSG was expressed        endogenously in rat pituitary cells and when        experimentally coexpressed together with GnRH receptors in        a heterologous cell line COS it suppressed        GnRHstimulated inositol trisphosphate production            Here those studies have been extended to include        GnRHstimulated LH secretion using adenovirusmediated gene        transfer of RGS complementary DNA into normal rat        pituitary gonadotropes RGS was found to profoundly        inhibit GnRHstimulated LH secretion and Hinositol        phosphate accumulation However a calcium ionophore        stimulated LH secretion in RGSexpressing gonadotropes        confirming a specific site of action occurring at        phospholipase C or earlier in the signal transduction        pathway                    Results        The initial experiments were performed to confirm our        earlier finding that RGS suppressed GnRHstimulated IP          production in COS cells    and to        test a truncated form of RGS RGST RGS            for suppressive activity in the same assay Fig  cDNAs        representing the GnRH receptor and RGS or RGST were        cotransfected into COS cells for GnRHA treatment  h        later intracellular IP          concentrations were measured at           and  sec after addition of  M GnRHA Fig  As        expected RGS exerted a profound suppression of IP          production at each of the time points        during the  sec after agonist treatment p          Fig  RGST is comprised primarily by the consensus RGS        domain and was originally reported to decrease the growth        rate of yeast and to inhibit IL receptor mediated        activation of MAP kinase by a factor of  fold as        compared to RGS    and was subsequently reported to be        a normally expressed variant of RGS     Therefore we        compared it to RGS for attenuation of GnRHstimulated IP          production in COS cells Fig  As        reported by others      we found that RGST was more        potent than RGS p   Fig  Identification of        a Cterminal  amino acid variant of RGS that has equal        or greater potency than the fulllength  amino acid RGS        will facilitate the identification of RGS functional        protein domains that are important for its activity        The family of RGS proteins are established to interact        with various Gprotein subunits thereby antagonizing        their activities           Indeed we        previously reported that RGS bound Gq     the G        protein subunit that mediates GnRH receptor signaling            Here we have extended those binding studies to include        other G proteins Fig  An RGSGST fusion protein was        incubated with an SMetGprotein and the amount of        labeled Gprotein was determined using glutathionecoupled        beads to pull down the RGSGST SGprotein complex        that was then separated and quantified by SDSPAGE Fig         More Gq was bound by RGS than any other protein        although its binding was not significantly different from        that of Gz and Gi p   Significant p          amounts of Gi Gi Go and Gs also were bound        but were not as high as Gq Gz and Gi These results        confirm our previous findings that RGS interacts with Gq        but also show that it has significant interaction with all        other Gproteins studied        The findings of the current and an earlier study            demonstrate clearly that RGS suppresses GnRH receptor        signaling in a heterologous cell system Because of the        evidence that the signal transduction pathway for GnRH in        gonadotropes involves the GnRH receptor Gq phospholipase        C and cellular IP          release      we determined the        effect of RGS on GnRHstimulated LH secretion using        adenoviralmediated gene transfer in rat pituitary cells        Fig  In these experiments we performed a        doseresponse test that included three experimental groups        uninfected adeno galactosidase and adenoRGS infected        Adenogal infection was used for determination of the        fraction of cells infected at each dose of virus Fig         top panel and as a control for the effects of adenoRGS        on GnRHstimulated LH secretion Fig  middle panel        Cell viability measured as trypan blue exclusion varied        from  Fig  top panel The fraction of cells        infected by the adenovirus depended on viral dose         MOI  MOI   viral particlepituitary cell and        ranged from about  no adenovirus to   MOI        Adenogal had no effect on LH secretion at any dose        compared to the uninfected group Fig  middle panel In        contrast an inverse doserelated effect was observed        between adenoRGS and GnRHstimulated LH secretion Fig         bottom panel RGS  MOI was the lowest dose to        inhibit LH secretion p   and  and  MOI        exerted near complete inhibition of LH secretion ie LH        concentrations in these two latter GnRHtreated groups did        not differ from their cohort controls p          The profound inhibition of GnRHstimulated LH secretion        observed in Fig required verification that RGS        expression was induced by adenoRGS infection To address        this issue we performed RGS immunoblots Fig  which        showed an increase in RGS protein expression in adenoRGS         MOI infected pituitary cells as compared to low to        negligible levels of protein in the uninfected and        adenogal infected groups        As evidenced earlier the molecular locus of RGS protein        action is thought to be the G protein  subunit        specifically Gq in the case of GnRH receptor activation        The results shown in Fig are consistent with this        conclusion adenoRGS infection of rat pituitary cells        profoundly suppressed GnRHstimulated Hinositol phosphate        accumulation These results are compatible with a molecular        site of action for RGS being at phospholipase C or earlier        in the signal transduction pathway        Another experiment conducted to test the specificity and        molecular locus of RGS action in inhibiting        GnRHstimulated LH secretion was treatment of adenoRGS        infected cells with an agent that increases intracellular        calcium Fig  Calcium is an established stimulator of        LH secretion that is thought to act at sites downstream of        phospholipase C      Therefore adenoRGS infected        pituitary cells were treated with a calcium ionophore        A AdenoRSG inhibited LH secretion in the        GnRHtreated control group as expected Fig  However        the calcium ionphore stimulated LH secretion in        RGSexpressing gonadotropes Fig  an effect that would        be expected if the RGS inhibition was exerted at the level        of the Gq protein        In two final control studies we investigated the effect        of adenoRGS on LH concentrations in pituitary cells and        on GnRH receptor binding Fig  In neither case did RGS        affect these parameters of gonadotrope function p                             Discussion        The quantity of LH secreted by the anterior pituitary        gland is the outcome of an interaction between the amount        of hypothalamic GnRH secretion and the level of gonadotrope        responsiveness to GnRH     Quantitatively gonadotrope        responsiveness is more important than the level of GnRH        secretion for example during the estrogenstimulated        preovulatory surge of LH secretion in the rat there is a        fold increase in GnRH secretion but a fold increase in        LH secretion     Moreover a quantity of GnRH that will        evoke a normal preovulatory LH surge during the period        preceding ovulation will induce only a small increase in LH        secretion at other stages of the estrous cycle            Similarly termination of the preovulatory LH surge appears        to be due to desensitization of the gonadotrope to GnRH        action in the sheep a decrease in LH secretion precedes        the decrease in GnRH secretion     whereas in the rat        although the decrease in GnRH and LH secretion are        coincident     there is evidence that the gonadotrope        is already desensitized to GnRH             The mechanisms that alter gonadotrope responsiveness to        GnRH are unknown but they do not appear to be due to GnRH        receptor number or LH stores in the pituitary gland               However the fraction of LH that is released by a        maximal dose of GnRH does vary positively with gonadotrope        responsiveness     and elucidation of the mechanisms        altering the fraction of releasable LH is likely to        illuminate mechanisms of gonadotrope responsiveness to GnRH                   Two molecular loci recently have been implicated as        potential modulators of GnRH receptor signaling one is the        receptor itself     and the other is the G protein        that transduces the signal generated by binding of the        receptor to its agonist     With respect to the former        locus G protein coupled receptor kinases GRKs act in an        agonistspecific manner to phosphorylate intracellular        regions of the receptor thus permitting  arrestin binding        that sterically inhibits G protein association with the        receptor      We have reported previously that        experimental expression of GRKs in GnRH receptorexpressing        heterologous cells COS suppressed GnRHstimulated IP          production and that coexpression of        GRK and arrestin  suppressed GnRH receptor signaling        more than that of either alone     Stronger evidence        that the GRK arrestin paradigm may play a role in        regulating GnRH receptor signaling is our recent finding        that adenovirusmediated gene transfer of GRK into normal        pituitary gonadotropes suppressed GnRHstimulated LH        secretion and IP          production     However no        evidence has been presented for a direct interaction        between arrestin and the GnRH receptor        With respect to the G protein as a locus for modulation        of GnRH receptor signaling we reported earlier that        experimental expression of RGS but not RGS  or  in        GnRH receptor expressing COS cells suppressed        GnRHstimulated IP          production     In the current        report we present evidence strengthening the hypothesis of        a regulatory role for RGS in GnRH receptor signaling        adenovirusmediated expression of RGS in normal pituitary        gonadotropes profoundly inhibited GnRHstimulated LH        secretion and Hinositol phosphate accumulation Arguing        for the specificity of this effect is the stimulation of LH        secretion by a calcium ionophore and the failure of LH        stores and GnRHreceptor binding to be affected by RGS        Moreover our finding that GnRHstimulated IP          production was inhibited supports the        locus of the RGS effect as residing at phospholipase C or        earlier in the transduction pathway most likely at the G        protein because of our studies both earlier    and here        showing that RGS binds Gq         in vitro Finally the stronger        inhibitory effect of RGST than RGS  on COS cell function        was presumed to be true also for gonadotrope function and        therefore was not tested here        The determination of RGS specificity for receptorG        protein pairs are currently unknown ie we and others        have found that several RGSs interact with Gq but only        one RGS has potent inhibitory activity on GnRH receptor        signaling For instance RGS and RGSGAIP     RGS            RGS     and RGS our unpublished findings all        bind Gq the established G protein that transduces GnRH        receptor signaling     Nevertheless RGS and             and RGSGAIP and RGS our unpublished data are weak or        null inhibitors of GnRH receptor signaling A recent report        seems to have clarified this issue RGS must bind not only        Gq but also selected Gqcoupled receptors before it can        inhibit receptor signaling      Based on this        finding we propose that RGSs binding to the GnRH        receptor as well as to Gq accounts for its specific        inhibiting of GnRH receptor signaling                    Conclusions        The results of the current investigation as well as        those presented earlier    nominate two molecular        mechanisms as playing roles in setting the responsiveness        level of GnRH receptor signaling ie the RGS system        acts at the G protein transducing step and the GRK        arrestin system acts at the level of the receptor Future        studies must address whether both neither or only one of        these mechanisms are physiologically relevant                    Materials and Methods                  cDNA transfection

cotransfected with GnRH          receptor cDNA and RGS or RGST cDNA using Lipofectamine          Life Technologies Gaithersburg MD     and  h          later treated with  M GnRHA for    or           sec before being collected for IP            measurements               IP            measurements were performed on COS          cell cytosolic preparations using a radioreceptor assay          in

were prepared           in vitro using a          transcriptiontranslation protocol     cDNAs for Gq             and Gz    were obtained from M I Simon for          Gs ref No  and Gi ref No  were

recombinant RGSGST          fusion protein to SMetGproteins were performed as          detailed     Glutathionecoupled beads were used to          select SG proteins bound to RGSGST and were then          eluted for separation by SDSPAGE     The amount and          molecular size of SG protein were determined using a          Phosphor imaging device Molecular Dynamics                          Preparation of AdenoRGS          Recombinant adenovirus containing RGS cDNA was          prepared using procedures previously described in detail          by Becker           et al    and by us              Human RGS cDNA    was restricted from the pRCCMV          vector with EcoRI and then subcloned into the          corresponding site of the pACCMVpLpa plasmid The proper          orientation of the RGS cDNA was confirmed by nucleotide          sequencing The procedure for preparation of the          adenovirus was cotransfection of a human embryonic          kidney cell line HEK  with the pACCMVpLpa plasmid          and another plasmid pJM containing most of the viral          genome     A relatively rare recombination of the          two plasmids occurs in the HEK  cells that          reconstitutes the adenoviral genome The recombination          event reconstituting adenoRGS was confirmed using PCR          analysis to detect the presence of RGS cDNA Next          adenoRGS was isolated by clonal selection in HEK           cells followed by a second PCR to confirm the presence of          RGS cDNA Finally largescale amplification and          titering of adenoRGS was performed in HEK  cells          This virus preparation was used for infection of rat          pituitary cells                              Culture and infection of rat pituitary cells

pituitary cells at  h after adenoRGS          infection  MOI were collected by trypsinization          homogenized and a protein determination made Fifty g          protein samples were heated in SDSPAGE sample buffer          containing mercaptoethanol and then electrophoresed on          a  SDSpolyacrylamide gel Separated proteins were          electroblotted onto nylon membranes Millipore Corp          Bedford MA which were then incubated for  h in a          blocking solution containing  nonfat dry milk in          phosphate buffered saline containing  Tween The          primary antibody chicken IgY  gml was diluted in          blocking solution and incubated overnight at C with the          nylon membrane Blots were then incubated for  h at room          temperature in alkaline phosphataseconjugated goat          antichicken IgY  gml diluted in blocking solution          Aves Labs Tigard OR Color development was achieved by          incubating the membrane in

of cell contents             anterior pituitary cells infected or not  h          previously with adenoRGS or adenogal were trypsinized          and plated for  h LH was extracted from the cells             by removing and discarding the medium and adding  ml          extraction buffer  mM NaCI  mM Tris  mM EDTA          and  mM bacitracin pH  followed by freezethawing          twice After centrifugation the supernatant was removed          and subjected to LH RIA as described above                          Measurements of GnRH receptors by receptor          radioassay RRA          About    pituitary cells infected or not  h          previously with adenogal or adenoRGS were          trypsinized and cell membranes containing the GnRH          receptors were prepared by placing the cells in a Dounce          homogenizer Kontes Co Vineland NJ and disrupting          them with  strokes of the pestle The cell membranes          were pelleted by centrifugation at             g and then resuspended in  mM          Tris buffer The GnRH RRA on the membranes was performed          as described previously      Cell membranes and             cpm  IGnRHA were incubated at C for  min          Nonspecific binding was determined as counts per min          bound in the presence of  M unlabeled GnRHA Bound          and free  IGnRHA were separated by filtration The          filters were counted by scintillation spectrometry                          Data analysis          The results are presented as the mean  SEM of at          least three independent experiments unless
