                                 Election Night Excuses                            We did better than Newt Gingrich said wewould                        Gingrichwith typical chutzpah has predicted the GOP could pick up  or more Houseseats Democrats with equal chutzpah will portray anything less as aDemocratic victory                            Wedid better than the pundits said we would                        Theconventional wisdom on likely Republican gains has ranged from six to  Houseseats and from three to five Senate seats If Democrats hold the GOP below theupper end of this range theyll claim victory If Republicans beat the lowerend theyll claim victory                            We did well considering how heavily wewere outspent                        Democratswill use this alibi in nearly every close race Republicans will claim thatmany of their candidates were outspent if you count the additional unionmoney                            We didwell considering the presidents difficulties                        Democratswill offer this excuse without acknowledging that it implies the public isstill upset with the presidents behavior Simultaneously they will assertthat the election is a mandate for ending the investigation of the presidentsbehavior                            We didwell considering the backlash against the investigation                        Republicans will offer this excuse without acknowledging that the backlash ismainstream Instead theyll portray it as a surge of turnout among diehardClinton supporters                            We didwell considering the six year itch                        Democratswill point out that the presidents party usually loses dozens of congressionalseats in his sixth year What they wont mention is that the reason Clintondidnt lose those seats in his sixth year is that he lost them in hissecond                            Americans reelected the Republicanmajority                        This isthe ultimate Republican fallback Even if the GOP somehow loses seats in bothhouses it can ignore its relative setbacks and reassert its absolutesupremacy                            TheRepublicans failed to win a filibusterproof majority                        This isthe ultimate Democratic fallback If Democrats lose fewer than five Senateseats theyll say they weathered the tide because voters decided not toentrust Republicans with complete control                            Wewon the close races                        Bothsides will use this line Close races are the ones your side won If a racelooked close but you ended up losing it then it wasnt really close so youneednt mention it                           Their candidate won on local issues                        A good spinner neveradmits that his partys candidate lost because of the national partyspositions If an antihealth maintenance organization propubliceducationDemocrat wins Democrats will say its because voters liked her positions onHMOs and education If she loses theyll say its because voters disliked herposition on building a local freeway                            Their candidate won with vicious negativeads                        If theircandidate wins its because his negative ads distracted voters from theissues If your candidate wins its because voters agreed that the othercandidate was wrong on the issuesas your candidate pointed out in hisnegative ads                            Ourcandidate lost because of vicious media attacks                        If yourcandidate ran negative ads and their candidate didnt and your candidate stillmanaged to lose you can always accuse the media of attacking your candidateThis argument comes in particularly handy when the media have criticized yourcandidate precisely for running negative ads                            Ourcandidate lost because he screwed up                        If anantitax family values Republican wins its because voters liked hispositions on taxes and family values If he loses its because he was unfairlysavaged by the local press for calling his opponent a putzhead                            Ourcandidate did well in a tough district                        TheDemocratic Party recruits each candidate by telling her that her districtopposes the Republican candidate on the issues The Democratic candidate spendsa year on the campaign trail repeating this line Then on election night thecandidate and the party claim that she lost because the district wasRepublican                            Our candidate did well considering hewas up against an entrenched incumbent                        This isthe least bogus spin Generally incumbents do have enormous advantages inclout money and name recognition But when a challenger has these advantagesand still manages to lose his party will invoke the entrenched incumbentexcuse anyway                            Ourcandidate did well to make the race close                        This isthe corollary to spin No  If your candidate was blown out you brush it offby saying it was never really a race If your candidate wasnt blown out youcall this an achievement                           Their candidate won thanks to a vocal minority                        This willbe the trademark spin of this years elections Everyone knows turnout will below So if you lose you can always claim that the silent nonvoting majoritysupported your candidate                            Their candidate won on ourissues                        The GOPs treatment of Clinton is an excellent example Throughout the campaignRepublicans call the Democratic candidate a liberal After he wins they say hewon by running as a conservative                            Ourcandidate lost on their issues                        IfRepublican Matt Fong loses the California Senate race conservatives will sayhe blew it because hes a squish ie a moderate If Democrat Glenn Poshardloses the Illinois governors race liberals will say he blew it because hesantiabortion                            Thepolls show voters support us                        If yourparty gets creamed you can always find comfort in the exit polls Somewhere inthe blizzard of questions a couple of findings will suggest that voters sortof agreed with your partys position on something or other even if they votedagainst all your candidates And after all isnt that what really counts                           RecentFrame Games                        The Flytrap AdWar Why the GOPs new ads are too clever by half posted
