                                 The Al GoreBill Bradley GreenOff Part I            The Washington Post ran a surprising news article last week by David Broder reporting thatFriends of the Earths political action committee would endorse Bill Bradleyfor president The surprising news wasnt that Friends of the Earth was dissingGoreas Broders article explained Friends of the Earth is both somewhat smaller than andsomewhat to the left of most other national environmental groups which arestill expected to endorse the vice president No what was surprising was thatin the course of justifying this bit of interestgroup entrepreneurship theFriends of the Earth PAC was able to state that looking at both candidatesyears in Congress Bradley had a significantly more progreen voting recordthan Gore The Broder article or more likely the Friends of the Earthhandout that Broder was paraphrasing slightly botched the two candidatesrespective scores from the League of Conservation Voters LCVwhose ratings go pretty muchunquestioned within the environmental movement Broder said Bradley scored percent to Gores  percent when in fact Bradley scored  percent toGores  percent  But the claim that Bradley had a much better LCV scorethan Gore is quite true Indeed since the gap is reall y                percentage points rather than  points its a little truerthan Broder said            In the great scheme of things of course both Bradley and Gore havesufficiently high LCV ratings that one really shouldnt call into questioneither candidates commitment to environmental protection Still Gore issomeone who once wrote in his  book Earth in the Balance  that we must make the rescueof the environment the central organizing principle for civilization Bycontrast Bradley is someone who once wrote in his  book Time Present Time Past  that the environmentalmovement brought a vast improvement in the quality of New Jerseys ecologyBradley is much better known for his interest in tax reform and racial healingand of course basketball than for any interest in conservation How can itbe that Bradleys environmental voting record is so much better thanGores            Perhaps Chatterbox thought there was something unfair about the LCVcalculations Examining Gores and Bradleys LCV scorecards which sadlyarent available on the Web Chatterbox noticed that Gore was being judgedpartly on votes that occurred during the two years before Bradley came toWashingtonand in one of those years  Gore earned his thirdworstannual LCV score ever  percent Mightnt Bradley have cast a fewantienvironmental votes if hed been around during those two years SoChatterbox knocked out  and  and recalculated Gores lifetimeLCV score That brought Gore                up from  percent to percent  Then Chatterbox recalculated Bradleys lifetime LCV score byknocking out  through  when Bradley retired since this was aperiod when Gore wasnt around to vote except of course on Senatetiebreakers but LCV doesnt count those This left Bradley at percent  with the GoreBradley gap narrowed from  to percentage points            Then Chatterbox noticed that Gore had missed a total of  LCVscoredenvironmental votes during his years in Congress while Bradley has missed onlynine Nine of Gores absences occurred during  and  when Gore wasquite understandably occupied by running for president and vice presidentrespectively So Chatterbox knocked those years out of Gores LCV lifetimescore too That brought Gore                up from  percent to percent  But Chatterbox had to do the same thing for Bradley That broughtBradley                up from  percent to  percent  leavingthe GoreBradley gap stuck at  percentage points            Maybe Chatterbox thought the only fair comparison was for the years through  when Gore and Bradley served together in the Senate samechamber same votes no room for applesandoranges mismatches That broughtGore from his raw score of  percent up to  percent but it also brought Bradley up from his raw score of  percentto                 percent  leaving a stubborn gap of  percentagepoints in Bradleys favor Chatterbox narrowed this gap to eightpercentage points by eliminating  and  from both mens Senate scoresagain because Gore had absences presumably related to the presidentialraces Gore shot up to  percent  while Bradley inchedup to  percent             Conclusion No matter how hard you try to give Gore a break Bradley has thegreener congressional voting record An examination of the particular votesthat cost Gore this contest will follow                            To Be Continued                                         Pedants Corner  the erroneous  to  percent calculations werealmost certainly arrived at by averaging the yearly LCV scores but LCVcalculates a legislators lifetime score by adding up all hisproenvironment votes and dividing that number by the total number ofLCVscored votes that took place while he was in Congress Because of a typo onthe LCV scorecard for Bradley Chatterbox momentarily thought Gore had beenrooked dividing Bradleys lifetime total of  proenvironment votes by which the scorecard presents as the total number of LCVscored votes that tookplace during Bradleys years in Congress Chatterbox got not  percentbut  percent  Chatterbox then added up all the numbers in that columnand realized that the  total was erroneous  the real total was hence Bradleys  percent lifetime score was correct  Butbecause Chatterbox had already done the calculations that comprise much of thisitem he had to go back and redo several of them based on the  total Thiswas extremely annoying
