Josef von Sternbergs Fun in a Chinese Laundry  Adolf LoosNevertheless  or too clever by half  Roman by Polanski In thisobscure pantheon a place must be reserved for Klaus Kinski the erraticallygifted PolishGerman actor and noted mal                vivant  who tried topublish the English version of his autobiography in  under the massivelyironic title All I Need is Love  The book was caught in a copyrightdispute between Random House and a West German publisher with huge libelproblems looming it was withdrawn shortly after publication and became one ofthe books most often stolen from public libraries Now five years after itsauthors demise it has reemerged as Kinski                Uncut  Despite theunfortunate change of name this ghastly and hypnotic memoir lives up to itslongfestering legend The whole witless genre of the celebrity confessionalundergoes a horrifying selfdisembowelment            Kinski with the huge burning eyes the weirdly coloredhair yellow orange rotting gold the sandpaper voice the glint of a sharpintellect beneath a brutish exterior He emitted a strange kind of electricitybefore he even said a word on screen he put everything and everyone on edgeIn his fiveminute role in Dr Zhivago  he seems to be performing witha wax statue of Omar Sharif There was no visible technique to his actingother than radiating ineffable Kinskiness His secret weapon was perhaps hisplayfulness his sense of being slyly amused by a mad world and his own madself He will live into posterity on the strength of the five films he madewith the great German director Werner Herzog Fitzcarraldo andparticularly Aguirre Wrath of God  his Aguirre the languidlynihilistic martinet who leads an Amazon expedition toward nothingness is oneof the great human monsters in movie history But for the most part histalents were wasted and Kinski Uncut shows how he went about wastingthem            He wasborn Niklaus Nakszynski in  in the old free city of Danzig now Gdansk inPoland Growing up impoverished in Berlin he was drafted into the ragtagteenage and oldage army that fought for Hitler in the last days of World WarII He showed no enthusiasm for the Nazi cause and soon deserted On the otherhand he said afterward that he would have outdone Hitler if he had been giventhe part He began acting in Berlin and regional theaters developing areputation for savagely accented classical performances and electrifyingoneman shows In the latter he would read mad scenes from plays poems ofRimbaud or Franois Villon and other programs of his own devising He beganacting in movies in  from  on he made at least one film a year andsometimes five or                            T he film careerbegan promisingly He appeared in Douglas Sirks A Time to Love and a Timeto                Die  a film by the mildly celebrated German director HelmutKutner Sergio Leones For a Few Dollars More  and several crispEnglish thrillers and war flicks Addicted to quick work and upfront salarieshe quickly gravitated toward the lower road countless crime serialslowbudget horror films spaghetti Westerns other multinational genre picturesof no distinction Even when he began the seemingly careertransformingcollaboration with Herzog he kept spewing out atrocious B C and D moviesright up to his death in  He was the kaiser of crap and took pride in hisbad taste Several times in Kinski Uncut he lists the famous directorshe turned down Fellini Visconti Pasolini and so on He passed on Raidersof the Lost Ark for something called Venom  because Spielberg didntpay enough            The nearly unrelievedsqualor of this career goes side by side with a selfconsciously decadent anddegenerate lifestyle Episodes recorded in Kinski Uncut fall into fourcategories  sexual encounters with hundreds of women beautiful and uglyyoung and old in a grotesque pornographic idiom that excludes sensualpleasure  Clineesque voyages of degradation and misery often involvingvomit excrement and delirium  excoriations of incompetent directorsproducers writers actors journalists and generally all individuals who arenot Kinski  bouts of selfrighteousness mixed with intense selfloathing Heactively sets out to make himself appear the biggest creep who ever walked theearth            Oncewhen I was asleep I pissed on my sister because I dreamed she was a treewrites Kinski I believe there is no stench that I havent stunk of writesKinski The chick with the blond curls  yells Kinski which sounds likeFuck me  writes Kinski Herzog is a miserable hateful malevolentavaricious moneyhungry nasty sadistic treacherous blackmailing cowardlythoroughly dishonest creep His socalled talent consists of nothing buttormenting helpless creatures and if necessary torturing them to death orsimply murdering them  Every scene every angle every shot is determinedby me  I can at least partly save the movie from being wrecked by Herzogsbungling writes Kinski This behindthescenes mastery of cinema did notseem to bear fruit in his  directorial debut Paganini  which hasbeen described as unwatchable by the few people who have watched it            On and on it goes sickening and tedious by turns But thisbook is weirdly enjoyable for what is not in it conventional film gossipnamedropping showbiz folly of any kind Here is a man who reports working onFor a Few Dollars More but fails to mention Clint Eastwood For goodlong stretches youll be wondering What year are we in or even Whatdecade There are no dates and few hard facts movies are referred to assome piece of crap directors as some idiot The New York actress slutreferred to on page  is Susan Sarandon For other helpful annotations seethe Kinski filmographyattached He doesnt even give the full names of his various wives You alsowonder whether certain things actually happened Some of the sexual escapadessound curiously like unfulfilled fantasies Phrases recur in them like literarymotifs            Eventually a genre crisis sets in Is this autobiography or anautobiographical novel It becomes an interesting game to guess at the realfeelings behind this Kinskiesque character called Kinski The Herzog sectionsring particularly false if Herzog was a bungling murderer why did Kinski keepmaking films with him Read Maureen Goslings journals about the making ofFitzcarraldo  or Bruce Chatwins essay on Cobra Verde  and youdiscover a rather different Kinski an irascible lonely lovable eccentricwhose fits of rage come and go like squalls whose childish enthusiasm forfilmmaking and playacting bursts through the puton cynicism The camerafaithfully recorded his impishness Aguirre Wrath of God andFitzcarraldo are grand dark but also comic and Kinski supplies thelions share of the wit                           S o why isKinski such a glum book Part of the problem may be the translationJoachim Neugrschel is a respected and experienced translator but he tries toohard to turn Kinskis thuggish prose into slinky American slang Idioms aresometimes not quite on the markfor example references to Kinskis palssleeping with minor boys and minor girls The translation that Kinski madehimself in I found one remaining copy in the New York Public Librarywasmore arch cold stylish Also there are strange discontinuities between thetwo versions each has material omitted from the other and the new uncutedition is actually much more cautious naming names All this will have to besorted by Kinski scholars of the future            In the end the book isanother performance another ranting Kinski creation If asked for aSiskelandEbert yea or nay I wouldnt know what to say It can be recommendedonly to certain tastes Amateur psychologists may enjoy it as a sort ofhighlevel Nintendo game of bombarding sexual neuroses Students of humanmisery can savor its underlying sadness and futility And as always withKinski theres a taunting taste of comedy the tears on his cheeks are fromlaughter As I put this wretched book down I thought I heard a cackle fromsomewhere and a man with red eyes rasping Idioten
