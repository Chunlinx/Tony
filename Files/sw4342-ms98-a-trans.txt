        so how do you uh so it so it sounds like youve got a television going on there so i can assume that you probably watch TV news is that     i almost never watch TV news  i get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio   really wow   uh what what station do you listen to   uh its a local radio station its called uh KLIF cliff   cliff i see so um its not affiliated with anything is it not not a network station okay yeah because i i listen to uh public radio a lot and they have   no no   they have KCRW which i i i saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable TV outlet i guess theyre getting a little getting a little feisty now   well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news   uh   and occasionally in the morning ill pick up something like uh CNN or that but i hate watching the like ten oclock news or   yeah so you have a paper or something or   yeah we have a local well we have uh Dallas Morning News which is the big paper in Dallas we read it i read it pretty much   umhum yeah   from cover to cover   how do you like it its been  its been a while since i read the Dallas news i uh fact last time i read the Dallas Dallas news i was in Arkansas uh   the Times Herald went out of business here   oh yeah   and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one Fort Worth newspaper     well that must be pretty bad so how did that happen anyway   uh financial trouble   no not how i mean when did it when did they  yeah   oh when did it happen i guess they closed down about three months ago   oh really       huh   so how do you keep up   oh me i um  good grief i read the Times Los Angeles Times theres uh quite a task if youve ever run into one theyre uh specially   yes theyre very voluminous   yeah theyre thick um       if theres something you want to know its its in the Times and then in in detail um they uh we we used to have two papers here in town and then the Herald Examiner collapsed about two years ago because of oh i dont know just just nobody was buying it really   so there really is only one major LA newspaper now   yeah pretty much um there used to be in fact i think there still is the uh the Daily News which runs out of the San Fernando Valley       and um theyre not bad as far as a uh you know as far as a local paper goes in fact it was kind of weird because i met the uh i met the i met the editor uh while i was on uh while i was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff he was a really cool guy um you know went to Columbia University and all this stuff and uh its its a pretty good paper but um you know its not the its not the Times   yeah   although i see you know im starting to see some of their um theres theres a daily new uh news rack right around the corner from where i live which means that theyre theyre expanding i guess but uh and and occasionally i i pick up like Time magazine or something i think uh if theyve got an interesting lead story but you know its i i dont have time   i used to read Time magazine a lot but i dont read it much anymore   yeah thats thats kind of a problem for them theres a lot of people who fall into that category   and then we have a local rag here in town that i pick up periodically and read just to see whats going on in our little community   uhhuh i see   because we dont get an awful lot of coverage in the Dallas Morning News   yeah  the big dailies dont like to dont like to step much out of their uh out of their home turf i have to admit the Times is kind of provincial too its basically anything thats south of downtown they dont bother to cover   now they have started here running a three day or three times a week Plano section   uhhuh   and its just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers whats going on in Plano but its still not an awful lot of news   yeah i know i uh it was it was a big discovery when when the Times when the Times found out there was a place called Orange County       i mean  the way they i mean the way theyve been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed shots to go south of the LA county border   oh i would imagine in uh you know  in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs suburbs and of course they tend to cover the county and were not in Dallas county so they tend to ignore places outside of the county   yeah oh really yeah yeah i i i find that attitude kind of arrogant though its like youre taking our money but youre not bothering to cover things that are interesting to us      yeah
