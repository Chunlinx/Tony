isgreat except for one very minor problem We sleep in a kingsize bed and Ifeel we both might sleep better in two double beds I would for sure I amthinking of a setup like the one in I Love Lucy  where they slept in thesame bedroom but in separate beds We both move around a lot in our sleep andI really dont like it when a toenail pokes me somewhere unpleasant just as Iam drifting off I hesitate to bring it up with my wife because I dont wantto hurt her feelings and have her think I dont want to be near her and Idont want friends and family to think we are even weirder than they alreadybelieve we are married  years no kids I would appreciate anysuggestions                                       FSR in Fort WaltonBeach Fla                        Dear F            Prudie can relate havingbeen socked a time or two by the beloved when hes dead to the world A goodnights sleep however should be your paramount concern and not everyone is aneat sleeper            A singlebed is no barometer of a relationship Prudie suggests you tell your wife andnot friends and family that you are as crazy about her as ever butthink two beds might improve sleep for both of you And dont forget to pointout that visiting can certainly spice up the nighttime situation            Prudie conjugally                                             DearPrudence                                                      I wakeup in the middle of the night with a terrible thought that leaves me so ashamedI feel I should be sent to the moral equivalent of a reeducation camp For along time Ive wondered why the president who once promised to tell us thewhole truth about laffaire Lewinsky  is so silent while his staff isactive at the meanest level in riling a sizable portion of the public withstonewalling tactics Truly I believe the country is in the best of hands buthow do I rid myself of these impure thoughts                                       Ashamed andEmbarrassed                        DearAsh            If you are a Catholic youconfess If you are a Democrat you simply hope the president comes to termswith his heatseeking missile            As to whyPresident Clinton promised an explanation that seems not to be forthcomingthis is apparently the strategy he thinks best for selfprotection If silenceis golden it is also sometimes the best way to maintain decorum And reallydear Ash what would you care to hear him say Prudie thinks this might be oneunion we do not need to hear the state of And regarding the stonewallingstaff just think of them as the collective Bad Cop As for feeling ashamed andembarrassed you have much of the country for company Try to get a goodnights sleep            Prudie somnolently                                             DearPrudie
