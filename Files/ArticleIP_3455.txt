Whether the characters onscreen end up bearing much relation to theirmodels however varies from film to film Hoodlum  directed by BillDuke tells the story of Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson a black gangster who didbattle with mobster Dutch Schultz in the s Though rooted in history itsportrayal of Johnson fits into the great Hollywood tradition of dramaticenhancement            Thefilms central story concerns a battle over the Harlem numbers racket Thenumbers game was an illegal daily lotteryparticularly popular in Harleminwhich typically players chose a number from zero to  and placed betsthrough policy banks A player won if his number matched an agreedupon dailyvariable made known through some public channelfor example the last threedigits of the total amount wagered at a given racetrack which anyone couldlearn through the sports pages Since the game never favored the players thebankers naturally amassed large profits Besides the outcome was oftenfixed            Schultz was one of Harlems most notorious fixers When thefilm begins in the early s he played by Tim Roth is a white Prohibitionbeer baron who has muscled his way into the neighborhood numbers racketshutting down competitors or forcing them to join his operation JohnsonLaurence Fishburne who had made his criminal reputation in s Harlemreturns from jail upset by the white incursion into the trade Meanwhilepowerful mobster Lucky Luciano Andy Garcia worries that Schultzsnumbersracket war may be bringing too much attention to bear on organizedcrime even as he continues to do business with Schultz he schemes to takeover the latters operation In the end Johnson and Luciano form an allianceand Schultz is bumped off This plot line though embellished is mostly basedon reality            DutchSchultz and Lucky Luciano are renowned figures staples of crime books andstudies But who was Bumpy Johnson And what are the major discrepanciesbetween the films portrayal of him and the record Though he may have beenoverlooked in white newspapers of the time and in subsequent histories of theera Johnson was certainly notorious When he died in  New YorksAmsterdam News called him Harlems most famous underworld figure Thefilm though exaggerates his role in several instances and gives no hint as towhat happened to him after the numbers battle was over            For starters Hoodlum elevates Johnsonsimportance at the expense of Stephanie St Clair a k a Madame Queen CicelyTyson an immigrant from Martinique who became a numbers millionaire and forwhom Johnson went to work after his release from jail In the film MadameQueen effectively drops out of the picture when she is sent to jail in But Karen E Quiones Miller a staff writer at the PhiladelphiaInquirer who is writing a book on Johnson says that while St Clairwas in fact imprisoned for eight months it was during  before thefight started for control of the Harlem racket            Onscreen St Clair is depicted as being scared of Schultz and Johnson has tofight in her place In life she was less passive Paul Sann former executiveeditor of the New York Post  writes in Kill the Dutchman The Storyof Dutch Schultz  that St Clair herself stood up to Schultz evenasking city officials to crack down on his racket Its Schultzs life ormine St Clair reportedly said Dutchs men know I am the only one in Harlemwho can take back from their boss the racket he stole from my colored friendsand they know Im going into action And in  when Schultz was dying in aNewark hospital having been gunned down in a mob hit St Clair sent a WesternUnion message As ye sow so shall ye reap That telegram is omitted from thescript which has Schultz dying immediately after being shot            Thats only one of several inaccuracies in the filmsportrayal of Schultzs murder Viewers are left with the impression thatJohnson orchestrated the killing Fishburnes Johnson plays Roths Schultz offagainst Garcias Luciano effectively duping Luciano into slaying Schultz Inlife Schultzs murder was ordered by the national criminal syndicate formed byLuciano and the famed mobster Meyer Lansky agree that the main reason Schultzwas killed was because hed recklessly threatened to rub out special prosecutorThomas Dewey who was after him for tax evasion and racketeering Hed evenproposed the hit to the syndicate which rejected it The mob couldnt affordthe attention such a murder would bring                           Hoodlum s Dewey William Atherton bears little resemblance to the realprosecutor district attorney governor and failed presidential candidateMost glaringly hes shown taking cash from Luciano some of which is meant toprevent him from going after Schultz This never happened and theres noevidence that Dewey was corrupt In fact it was Dewey who later successfullyprosecuted Luciano on prostitutionrelated charges            Since the film ends with Schultzs death itleaves little indication as to what became of Johnson And it implies that theHarlem racket reverted to local control The Encyclopedia of New Yorkstates that after  Luciano and Lansky took over the Harlem racketJohnsons role remained an important one but he was definitely not his ownboss In Black Mafia Ethnic Succession in Organized Crime Francis AJ Ianni writes Johnson essentially worked as a middleman for theItalian syndicate When a black wanted to buy a franchise to establish anumbers bank he went to Bumpy            As for Johnsons characterthe movie depicts him as a gangster with a heart but a gangster nonethelessAt one point he throws cash to people in a local soup line At another themother of a teenager murdered while in Johnsons employ sobs People call youa hero  youre just a common thief reminding us of the violence he broughtto his neighborhood Quiones Miller says that though Johnsons reputation inHarlem was mixed he was known for taking care of the community Bumpy madethe Italians give money to neighborhood charitable organizations When Johnsondied in  of natural causes Jimmy Breslin wrote a column calling him aRobin Hood of Harlem            According to HelenLawrenson a former Vanity Fair editor and Johnsons selfproclaimedexlover this is a romantic view of him In her memoir Stranger at theParty  she quotes the New York Daily Mirror on the news thathe was sentenced to sixto in Sing Sing Harlem is in a state of rejoicingthat his reign of terror is over But she also quotes the AmsterdamNews  which says that Johnson was welcomed like a conqueror when he cameback to Harlem in  after doing time in Alcatraz and other prisons The filmends with the camera zooming toward Johnsons eye until the screen becomes moreand more grainy and ultimately black as if to suggest that settling the bigquestions of who Bumpy Johnson really was and what he meant to Harlem may bebeyond its range After all its only a movie
