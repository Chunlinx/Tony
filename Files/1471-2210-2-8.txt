                    Background        Parkinsons disease PD is the prevalent        neurodegenerative disorder of adults and is believed to be        due to a dopamine deficiency state in the fore brain area        It is caused by the death of more then  of mid brain        dopamine producing neurons Tremor rigidity and akinesia        characterize the disease Genetic and environmental factors        are believed to initiate Parkinson disease The        environmental theory of PD recently received strong support        from the work of Greenamyre         et al            At present there is no satisfactory medication for the        treatment of PD Levodopa which is a dopamine structural        analog is the golden standard in PD but its side effects        upon long term administration dyskinesia dystonia etc            compel the search for drugs with better        pharmacological profiles Other dopamine DA agonists do        not provide adequate therapeutical response     Thus        multidrug therapy is usually often used In this therapy        various adjuvants alleviate side effects of levodopa and        enhance its antiparkinsonian action Three main groups of        compounds were found to have antiparkinson effect These        are dopamine DA receptor agonists MAOB inhibitors and        NMethylDAspartate NMDA receptor antagonists                   The monoamine oxidase enzyme exists under two forms        MAOA and MAOB Dopamine is oxidized in the brain by the        MAOB form MAOB inhibitors maintain dopamine        concentration by blocking the MAOB enzyme whose activity        is also known to increase with age     In addition        MAOB inhibitors can block the formation of toxic        metabolites from the compounds that are capable to cause PD        eg MPTP            The beneficial action of DA agonists is based on direct        stimulation of the DA receptors There are two classes of        dopamine receptors D D D subtypes and D D D D        subtypes The antiparkinson action of dopamine agonists        was found to be mainly due to the stimulation of the        Dclass receptors     Therefore we favored in the        present work those DA agonists that exhibit at least        moderate activity toward Dclass of DA receptors        NMDA antagonists were observed to enhance the        therapeutic effects of dopaminomimetics in PD They block        the glutamatergic excitatory pathways that are        overstimulated in PD     Such action decreases the        influx of calcium ions into the neuron and hence        downregulates the activation of calcium dependent enzymes        This can prevent the neuronal excitotoxic damage        We set to identify the pharmacophores responsible for        each of these pharmacological activities so as to provide        guidelines for the synthesis of new and possibly more        potent analogues We also speculated that better drugs        could be identified that contain more than one biophore        possibly providing activity at multiple sites We therefore        designed some potential drug by grouping several biophores        into a single molecule thereby creating a single molecule        cocktail of drug activity        The use of such a drug might reduce side effects stress        imposed on the patients while the synergy of its effects        might improve overall response                    Methods        Information about available MAOB inhibitors               DA agonists        and NMDA antagonists                 was collected from literature sources        Their structures were coded and three separate databases        MAO inhibitors DA agonists and NMDA antagonists were        created and submitted to analysis by the MCASE program        MCASE is a powerful analysis tool whose principles have        been described in detail elsewhere     Basically the        program works with databases of structurally diverse        compounds where each entry contains the structural formula        of a molecule and its activity in a specific endpoint        MCASE looks for keyfeatures that may be responsible for        the observed activity of the compounds of the database The        basic idea is that if a substructure is related to the        observed activity it will be found mainly in active and        marginally active compounds On the other hand if it is        not relevant to the observed activity it will be randomly        distributed amongst active and inactive compounds of the        database The substructures that are seen to be responsible        for activity are called         biophores     which in the case        of pharmacological process are basically the        pharmacophores        The compiled databases contain qualitative data about        compounds Our MAO inhibitors database used data from        Kalgutkar    and others It consists of compounds tested        as potential MAO inhibitors Two strategies were tried with        this database In the first approach the selectivity of        MAOinhibitors was used as the main criterion Selectivity        database Hence the preferable MAOB inhibitors were        treated as actives while MAOA inhibitors where entered        as inactives and unselective MAO inhibitors as compounds        of marginal activity In the second strategy only the        actual activity of inhibitors towards MAOB form was        considered Activity database Under these conditions        all compounds that inhibit the MAOB enzyme were treated as        active and the others as inactive More details will be        given later during the discussion of the specific databases        and their biophores        For the DA database obtained from the paper by Seeman           and others agonists are listed as active while        antagonists are entered as inactive Partial agonists are        seen as compounds with marginal activity        The third database contains information about NMDA        antagonists and includes compounds collected from various        reports      and others The database was created        as follows NMDA antagonists were set as actives NMDA        agonists as inactives and partial agonists as marginally        actives        In addition to ensure that databases built on the bases        of selectivity also possess structural information about        the corresponding generic activities binding to the NMDA        or DA receptors inhibiting both MAO isoforms active        compounds were required to have low K         i the dissociation constant of the        moleculereceptor enzyme complex        Models were created automatically by the MCASE program        for each of these databases These models were tested for        robustness and reliability In order to estimate the        quality of the models tenoff validation procedures were        performed for each database In these validation        procedures ninety percents of all compounds from a        database were selected randomly and used as learning set to        create a reduced model The remaining ten percents of        molecules test set were then tested against the reduced        sets to evaluated the predictive power of these models        Three trials oftenoff validations were performed for each        database The results are shown in Table         As can be seen good predictions ie high concordance        and wide coverage almost all chemicals from the test sets        received a prediction were obtained for all databases The        ability to recognize active compounds was slightly better        by about  for the DA database whereas for the MAOB        and the NMDA databases the situation was reversed In fact        we prefer to underpredict activity ie some        experimentally active molecules being predicted to be        inactive rather than overpredict it when some        experimentally inactive molecules are predicted to be        active since overprediction can lead to the design of        drug candidates that lack efficacy Overall high coverage        and good predictive power by all models indicated that the        databases biophores are not products of        chancecorrelation but are relevant to the specific        activity types they represent        As an additional validation each model was tested with        a large group of structurally diverse molecules which were        taken from the FDA rodent carcinogenicity database            Results Table  demonstrate good specificity of the        models Number of predicted active compounds with        unaccounted activity is low approximately  for the NMDA        and DA database and even less for the MAOB databases        The most reliable biophores from each model were then        selected as initial structural elements for the        construction of new drug prototypes                    Results                  MAOB inhibitors          IC             the concentration of inhibitor          that decreases enzyme activity by  does not provide          sufficient mechanistic information as it depends on the          conditions of the experiment     Therefore it cannot          be used to compare mechanistically diverse data as in our          case Instead we used K           i  the dissociation constant of the          enzymeinhibitor complex to compare the activity of          different inhibitors Indeed this is a better indicator          of a molecules potential to reversibly inhibit the          enzyme Furthermore reversible inhibitors are less likely          to cause enzyme malfunction    than irreversible          ones          As mentioned earlier the selective and reversible          inhibition of MAOB versus that of MAOA is the major          criterion used to create the Selectivity database          Table  Chemicals with a ratio greater than  were          considered to be selective MAOB inhibitors and therefore          were used as active entries while compounds with a          ratio less than  were considered to be selective MAOA          inhibitors and thus inactive MAO inhibitors which          ratio was within  range were considered as          unselective MAOB inhibitors and were treated as          marginally active molecules          In the Activity database Table  inhibitors with          a K           i MAOB value less than  M were          treated as active while compounds with a K           i MAOB value in the  M range          were treated as marginally active molecules All those          with a K           i MAOB larger than  M were          entered as inactive           The best biophores Table  to be used for the          derivation of new and better drugs were selected from the          MAO datasets on the base of the following criteria           The biophore should have a high probability to be          relevant to activity PRA The lowest acceptable PRA          value was           A sufficient number of molecules should contain the          selected biophore The biophore should be present in at          least  compounds          Analysis of biophores     showed that both          of them occur in substituted benzyloxy          phenyloxadiazolHones and their analogs          Figure  many of which are known to be strong MAOB          inhibitors     Biophore  represents a flexible CH            O bridge between aryl moieties and          was found to enhance the activity and selectivity of the          inhibitors as shown in the original work              Biophores  and  include aromatic moieties whose main          function is presumably to bind to the hydrophobic site of          MAO          Biophore   exists in NAminoethylbenzamides          with substitutions on the aryl ring These compounds are          known to be timedependent inhibitors of MAOB                       Several QSAR and CoMFA analyses were published          reporting relevant properties and structural parameters          that govern MAO inhibition        All of them          were performed for narrow data sets and hence the results          were confined to the same group of compounds We used          these studies to confirm the relevance of some of our          biophores For example biophore  was found to be an          important factor enhancing the interaction between the          inhibitor and the protein core of the MAO enzyme                                         NMDA antagonists          The NMDA receptor consists of two subunits that          together create a membrane channel Each subunit belongs          to the NR or NR subunit family Various splice variants          are also known     Activation of the NMDA channel          requires that glutamate and glycine bind at the same time          to NR and NR subunits respectively Thus three main          types of NMDA antagonists are known glycinesite          antagonists binds to NR subunits glutamatesite          antagonists binds to NR subunits and channelblockers          In order to avoid unwanted side effects NMDA antagonists          should have either low affinity for the NMDA receptor          eg aminoadamantane derivatives or bind with high          selectivity to one type of NMDA receptor eg          ifenprodil eliprodil or similar compounds              The chemicals used in the NMDA database were required          to have significant affinity for the NMDA receptor For          that purpose K           i the dissociation constant of the          moleculereceptor complex of accepted NMDA antagonists          was required to be less than  M The same criteria were          used in the selection of the best biophores from the NMDA          model as were described in the case of the MAO databases          Biophores  Table           Biophore  features the glutamatebinding site of          NMDA antagonists Figure  The molecules that contain          it are derivatized amino acids whose phosphonate group          is a functional replacement of the carboxyl group of          glutamic acid The phosphonate group of the NMDA          antagonist binds to the glutamatereceptor as does the          natural agonist glutamic acid but no conformational          change that activates the NMDA channel occurs              Beart et al    performed a SAR analysis of this type          of NMDA antagonists They report a deep hydrophobic          pocket good for binding of the class of compounds shown          in Figure B and a region to accommodate the          phosphonategroup biophore  binding site    as          structuralfeatures of the binding site of NMDA          competitive antagonists The generic structure of these          NMDA antagonists is shown in Figure           Biophores  and  are characteristic of the NMDA          channel blockers Biophore  features an aromatic          residue that presumably binds to the hydrophobic pockets          of the channel walls eg Triptophan Alanine              The nitrogen of biophore  can contribute to          activity possibly by interacting with the negatively          charged residues or by forming hydrogen bonds eg          Asparagine              Figure A shows the generic structure of an NMDA          antagonist that carries biophores  and  and B the          relative locations of biophores   and  in the          eliprodil molecular family Biophores   and           also occur in the NMDA antagonists that bind to          glutamatebinding site of NMDA receptor eg  in SDZ          EAB   in SDZ EAA   in SDZ                         Thus the NMDA biophores that were identified actually          characterize two groups of NMDA antagonists channel          blockers and glutamatesite antagonists                          Dopamine agonists          The same strategy was used to create the Dopamine          agonists database as was used for the NMDA database          Compounds with substantial affinity for dopamine          receptors K           i within nanomolar range were          collected The best biophores were selected using the          same criteria as those used to assess the NMDA and the          MAO databases Table           Biophore  identifies the ortho hydroxyl groups of          the catechol ring which is one of the structural          features of dopamine and its derivatives Biophore           describes agonists that possess only one hydroxyl in          metaposition preclamol RU RU etc This          biophore demonstrates the relative importance of the          metahydroxyl group as compared to the parahydroxyl          group For example metatyramines binding affinity to          the dopamine receptor is significantly greater than that          of paratyramine              Biophores  and  characterize DA agonists without          hydroxyl groups in the aromatic ring Putatively the          aromatic nitrogen of this biophore carries the function          of the metahydroxyl group since it has the same          structural location relatively to the phenylethylamine          backbone          Most of the compounds that contain biophore   out          of  active compounds also carry a hydroxyl group          Table  The majority of compounds that contain          biophore  also have at least one hydroxyl in one of          the three possible branching positions Table           Metabolites of such compounds might be more active than          the parent compound Thus aromatic hydroxylation of such          compounds at the orthoposition would form a catechol          ring Table   and produce metabolites that are          structural analogues to dopamine          Both biophores  and  represent dopaminelike          agonists that have restricted conformation for the sake          of enhanced binding          Based on the biophores that were identified by the          program a generic structure of the DA agonist was          constructed Figure  The specifications for such          structure include a nitrogen atom separated by two carbon          atoms from an aromatic moiety and containing an electron          donating substituent at the metaposition The importance          of this backbone finds support in a number of QSAR and          CoMFA analyses as well               To ensure compatibility we compared biophores and          biophobes fragments that are found to be responsible for          molecular inactivity across all three databases and          found no collisions On the contrary structural overlap          between some biophores across the three databases was          observed This was used as an additional encouragement to          select them for inclusion in prospective new drugs                            Discussion        The modeling procedure requires the construction of        precursor candidates precursor here is a molecule designed        to have a single mechanism of antiparkinsonian action on        the basis of selected and compatible biophores of each        database Precursor candidates for NMDA antagonism MAOB        inhibition and DA agonism were drawn to be within the        context of the types of molecules they are derived from        The precursor structures that were generated were then        merged into candidate drug molecules        Two types of precursors of active MAOB inhibitors were        identified The structure of the first one is shown in        Figure  Aand B as a generic moiety The second one is        based on a class of compounds that contain biophore         whose structure is shown in Table Biophore  The        latter precursor has the advantage of small size and its        activity is quite tolerant to derivatization at the        paraposition     whereas the former is known to have        high oral bioavailability and low toxic effects in rats                   A possible way of derivatization of the compound in        Figure X  O Z  CN R  H is substitution at the        terminal aromatic ring Analysis of the original work           shows that such substitution decreases binding affinity        However the decrease in activity is acceptable for methyl        and methoxyl substitutions in meta and parapositions        Thus the IC          of the unsubstituted compound is         nM whereas the metamethylated analog has an IC          of  nM the value for the        paramethylated is  nM that of the paramethoxylated is         nM and the IC          of the metamethoxylated derivative        is  nM            There are many possible choices for the selection of a        suitable structure for an NMDA antagonist One possibilitys        to use the backbone presented in Figure A another one is        to use the generic structure of the glutamatesite NMDA        antagonists Figure B The latter group contains fewer        biophores but there are some insights of its mechanism of        action and a structural analysis has been made for it            Hence glutamatesite NMDA antagonists Figure B were        favored as a structural prototype since some NMDA        antagonists from the former group Figure A express        antagonistic activity toward dopamine receptors eg        haloperidol        Glutamatesite NMDA antagonists can be readily        derivitized Thus the aryl ring Figure B can carry quite        a large variety of substituents that enhance binding if        they are hydrophobic     Since many good biophores        were identified in the DA database we designed two        different DA precursors Figure  instead of one This was        accomplished by combining a few biophores into a single        molecule Each of these precursors has structurally close        known homologues that are potent Dtype dopamine        agonists        When merged together in different ways the prototype        structures yielded a group of candidates These compounds        were tested in silico against all compiled databases DA        MAO and NMDA Candidates with the best predictions were        submitted for further evaluation of their pharmacokinetic        parameters Thus they were tested against databases        predicting plasma protein binding affinity     oral        bioavailability and urine excretion unpublished results        The metabolism of each candidate was then evaluated by the        META program    using a mammal metabolism database        LogP values logarithm of the noctanolwater partition        coefficient were calculated by the MCASE program on the        base of a group contribution approach            Possible side effects of the drug candidates were        assessed by testing each candidate and its predicted        metabolites against carcinogenicity and mutagenicity        databases                Evaluating candidate molecules by the predicted        pharmacokinetic parameters Table  we favored those with        higher oral bioavailability scores and lower urine        excretion scores For optimal sustained action we chose a        plasma protein binding range of  to  percent        The four finalists shown on Figures and received the        best overall prediction Compounds III with X  O Y  H        and OH in position  and compound II with X  S and Y  H        were selected as the most promising candidates since their        predicted oral bioavailability was among the highest while        the potential harmful side effects were predicted to be low        Table  Nevertheless the entire group of compounds is        proposed for synthesis and evaluation of their potential        antiparkinsonian activity Structural variation changing        X Y and the position of the hydroxyl group can be used        for membrane permeability adjustment enhancement of oral        bioavailability and improvement of BloodBrain Barrier
