                                 Pay Up Shrum            On Meet the Press yesterday Gore adviser Robert Shrum attemptedmanfully to deny that his candidate had ever suggested hed make support of hispolicy on gays in the military a litmus test for nomination to the JointChiefs of Staff All Gore was doing Shrum said was restating theconstitutional principle that the Chiefs are obliged to obey their commander inchief                           What he said  was that he would insist that people appointed tothe Joint Chiefs of Staff agree to support his policy as president He neversaid in the New Hampshire debate that he would inquire into their personalconvictions His litmus test is a constitutional one civilian control of themilitary  I defy you to find a place in that transcript where he ever saidhe would inquire into someones personal position  Ill bet you  bucksFind him saying that hes going to examine their personalconvictions                        Nice try Bob But the transcript of the New Hampshire debate makes itpretty damn clear that Gore was saying exactly what Shrum said he didnt sayThe video clip played by MTP host Tim Russert might not have nailed theissue down it showed Gore declaring I would insist before appointing anybodyto the Joint Chiefs of Staff that that individual support my policy But thediscussion that precedes the clip does The whole context was Peter Jenningsquestion about whether Gore or Bradley would apply a litmus test to JointChiefs nominees like that occasionally applied controversially to SupremeCourt nominees In the context of the Supreme Court of course litmus testclearly means an inquiry into a potential nominees personal convictionsonsay abortion or civil rightsprior to their nomination            Gore said he had rejected the notion of litmus tests on the Supreme Courtby saying there are ways to find out the kind of judgment somebody has withoutposing specific litmus tests He then said                           I think that its a little different where the Joint Chiefs ofStaff are concerned because youre not interfering with an independentjudicial decision As commander in chief a president is giving orders ineffect or he is the superior of the officers that are reporting to thecommander in chief in the chain of command I would try to bring about the kindof change in policy on the dont ask dont tell policy that PresidentHarry Truman brought about after World War II in integrating the military And I think that would require those who wanted to serve in on the positionofon the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be in agreement with that policy Soyes Emphasis added                        This isnt quite a smoking gun but its mighty close As Gores boss mightsay it all depends on what the definition of in agreement with is It wasclear to me watching the debate that Gore meant that the nominees personalviews had to be in agreement For one thing that is what in agreementmeans Its also what the explicit analogy with the Supreme Court litmus testimplies Otherwise Gore would have said You dont need a litmus testbecause they have to obey the policy whatever their personal views are Or hecould have used the word obey or support instead of be in agreementwith            This interpretation is reinforced by the reality of the gaysinthemilitarydebate The president cant just order the Chiefs to change thedontask policy since that policy has now been written into law byCongress and changing it requires congressional action Thats why it would beso important for a president to know that his Joint Chiefs nomineespersonally support his policy so theyll be on his side in the battlewith Congress and not just that they will obey him which wouldnt do thepresident any good            Bob Dont you owe someone              Conflict of interest disclosure Shrum and his wife Marylouise Oatesare friends of mine Ive eaten dinner at their house Ive even stayed therewhen in Washington God its all too embarrassing I think Shrum may have beena good soldier in this instance attempting to defend an untenable positionBut in a very brief phone conversation he said hed read the whole transcriptand he seemed sincere in sticking to his interpretation I admit I havent beenso understanding of others such as                JamesCarville                who havent fed me so many meals
