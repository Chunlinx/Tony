                                 Privatize the Independent Counsel            Kenneth Starr as youresurely aware has spent about  million on his investigation of thepresident That comes to roughly  cents per American If theres an Americanwho hasnt got  cents worth of entertainment out of this affair Ive yet tomeet him On that basis alone the Starr investigation might be one of the bestbargains the taxpayers have ever had            There ishowever a larger issue Independent counsels are not punished foroverspending so in general theyll have a tendency to overspend Over the pastseven months or so a lot of people have made that point but few have placedit in its proper context Overspending due to bad incentives is not a problemwith independent counsel investigations in particular its a problem withgovernment undertakings in general            To address that problem by tinkering with the independentcounsel statuteor even by abolishing the office altogetheramounts to afailure of perspective No matter how deeply you believe Starr has egregiouslymisspent your  cents it would require extraordinary naivet to imagine thathes dealt you the most devastating financial blow youve suffered at the handsof an overzealous public official            So insteadof obsessing over a minor symptom of a major ailment maybe we should devotemore attention to the underlying disease If the disease is incurable we canat least think about how best to alleviate entire clusters of symptoms            To that end abolishing the independentcounsels office is not terribly useful Maybe that office should beabolishedbut it would be a shame if that was the only insight we gained fromthis episode Applying the same insight to more serious instances of spendingrun amok well end up making recommendations like abolish the Pentagon orabolish the Department of Health and Human Servicesrecommendations that aresurely unrealistic and possibly unwise Well learn more if we ask questionslike this Assuming that were going to have an independent counsel how can weadjust his incentives to make him more fiscally responsible By thinking aboutthat question we might learn something about how to encourage fiscalresponsibility more generally            Heres anidea Make the independent counsel finance his investigations out of his ownpocket At the same time reward him handsomely for results such asconvictions or impeachments That sets up two good incentives First whentheres good reason to suspect provable wrongdoing the prospective rewardencourages prosecutorial tenacity Second when investigations devolve intonothing more than political or personal harassment the prospective expenseencourages prosecutors to shut down sooner rather than later            Theres another advantage to this system Once theindependent counsels become independent contractors it will be relatively easyfor legislators to adjust their activity levels If a prosecutor is too laxCongress can either raise the bounty for convictions or subsidize the counselsexpensessay by making him pay only some percentage of those expenses thepercentage can be finetuned at will If he is too inquisitorial Congress cando the opposite So legislators retain control of the prosecutors overallfervor while inducing him to concentrate that fervor where its mostwarranted            Similarschemes might improve the performance of any government agency that has clearlydefined goals For example the Food and Drug Administration is charged withkeeping dangerous pharmaceuticals off the market Here the potential problem isnot so much excessive spending as excessive caution which creates unwarranteddelays in the introduction of safe and effective new drugs But thats not adifferent problemits the same problem in a different guise Just as aprosecutor is tempted to overprosecute when hes spending other peoples moneyso also is a regulator tempted to overregulate when hes playing with otherpeoples health If the problems are fundamentally the same then so are thesolutions The regulator like the prosecutor should bear the costs of hisactions One way to accomplish that is to pay FDA officials not in cash but inpharmaceutical company stock which ought to introduce an appropriate sense ofurgency to the drug approval process Unfortunately it will also discouragediligencebut we can correct that by levying large fines against theregulators whenever a deadly drug slips through to the marketplace            The net result could be an FDA approval processthat is either more or less stringent than it is today at the option of thelegislators who determine the size of the stock grants and the size of thefines But either way it would give regulators an incentive to focus theirattention more precisely on those drugs that are most likely to beproblematic            Rewardingpeople for good outcomes and punishing them for bad ones is relatively easywhen the quality of the outcomes is easy to measure But its harder forofficials with broader portfolios of responsibility Take the president forexample How do we know when the president had done a good job Should wereward him for keeping us out of war What if he keeps us out of war throughpolicies that make the world more dangerous for our children Should we rewardhim for prosperity What if that prosperity is a temporary illusion And whoshould decide            Only one system of government has ever dealt adequatelywith the incentive problem for the chief executive and thats hereditarymonarchy When you know that your beloved heirs are going to in essence ownthe entire country you tend to take a longrange view of the nationalinterest Unfortunately hereditary monarchy has offsetting drawbacks which Iassume I dont need to enumerate for the readers of                   Slate                           But heresa way to recover some of the advantages of monarchy while retaining theadvantages of our current system of government We could pay our presidentstheir salaries in land instead of in cash The price of American land reflectsthe value of living in the United States of America If the president mortgagesour future by weakening defense the price of land will fall If he raisestaxes to support defense programs that fail to justify their costs onceagain the price of land will fall So by giving the president a sufficientlydiversified portfoliosome ranch land in Wyoming a bit of Californiacoastline a few blocks in the South Bronx a hill in Tennesseewe can ensurethat the nations interests and his personal interests coincide Whenever thepresident makes a bad decision his pocketbook will surely feel our pain            Heres another way to accomplish the samething Allow the president upon leaving office to sell  UScitizenships to the bidders of his choice We can add some side conditionsthat prohibit him from dealing with known terrorists and other undesirablesIf he does a better job those citizenships will become more valuable andhell get a better price for them            Let me close by answering inadvance the question that I know Ill be asked in email namely Are youreally serious The answer is no and yes No I dont believe that anythingIve said in this  word column amounts to a detailed policy proposal Butyes I believe that incentives matter and that we should seriously entertainradical proposals for improving them Even when we ultimately reject thoseproposals we learn something by articulating their flaws And every now andthen a crazy idea stops seeming crazy once youve thought about it hardenough
