million and  millionrespectivelyWhile the analysis states that EPA is confident of the costfigures included in the analysis an estimation of the benefits ismore difficult because of EPAs inability to quantitativelyevaluate all human and ecosystem benefits and to assign monetaryvalues to these benefits for a comparison in a standardcostbenefit framework For example EPA was only able to monetizethree of the seven air pollutants affected by the ruleThe analysis also discusses in qualitative terms the benefits ofthe rule regarding human health including the health effects forNative American subsistence fishermen and reduction of projectednoncancer effects and improvements in fish and wildlifehabitatii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and EPA has
