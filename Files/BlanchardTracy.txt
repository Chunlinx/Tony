                     Can I please have your name                     Tracy Blanchard                     And your age                                          Where are you from in Charlotte                     Concord                     OK         And is there anything in particular you want to talk about         Are you a Freshman                     Yes                     OK         And did you like living in Charlotte all your life                     Um yeah         Its a nice place to grow up         Um I dont think Ill be able to settle down here though because most of my relatives live up north         So when I graduate more than likely Ill move to Boston but Charlotte has definitely been a nice place to live         Ive never experienced any problems with crime or anything like that and theres always been something for me to do like in high school or in college theres always things to go do so its been a nice place to grow up                     Do you think it will be strange to move up north when youve lived in Charlotte all your life         Do you think therell be a very big culture shock                     I dont know that it will be a very big culture shock because Ive grown up going to Boston all the time         So its almost like a second home         It wont be too different but the style of the city is a little different so                     Umhmm         Why wouldnt you want to stay on Charlotte         Is there any particular reason                     I need a change         Ive lived here all of my life         So I need a change and Bostons the place Ive always looked to live at so                     Umhmm         Do you feel that Charlotte has changed a lot since you were growing up here         Do feel like its changed a lot                     Its definitely grown                     Uhhuh                     And a lot more things have come up since then for people to do         So I dont know                     If you want to move so bad why did you go to school here                     Uh the reason I choose to go to school here is because my parents live around  minutes away and I wanted to be away from home yet be able to go home if I needed to so                     Uhhuh         Are you close to your family                     Yes         Very close to my family         I usually go home once or twice a month                     Dont you think that will be hard if you move all the way up there not seeing them as much         Or do you feel youre ready for the change                     Um Ill definitely be ready for the change         Ive been going up as a progress in school so I it will be a good change for me                     So youll stay here for the four years and then move or would you transfer schools                     Um if I was able to get educational opportunities in school I would transfer but Im happy with school here with my sorority with the city with I mean Im happy with the way things are right now so probably when I graduate                     And what is it you want to do when you graduate                     I would like to look for a job in education possibly teaching elementary school um hopefully up north I would rather do that up north so                     How come         For any particular reason                     I mean just mostly because my family lives up there and I enjoy being up there                     It wont bother you the cold weather and stuff         I can say that because Im from there         That wont bother you                     It would definitely be an adjustment but Ive been up there with the weather before and um Im not its not hard for me to adjust to things so                     Do you like the weather in Charlotte         Do you enjoy                     Oh I definitely like the weather in Charlotte so that would be kind of a shock for me to have those winters but Ill be able to adjust to it         Although I do enjoy Spring and March here                              How was it going to high school in Charlotte         Do you feel like do you think it would have been different if you had gone to school in Boston or someplace else up north                     I guess actually it would because in high school I was on a State cheerleading championship squad and they dont have squads like that up north as much my cousins tell me from their high school         So I think it would definitely been different just because of that                     Do you feel like thats a Southern thing or a NC thing or                     Well I actually kind of having guys on a cheerleading squad in high school is more a Southern thing because my cousins in Boston had never heard of that before me so                     Uhhuh         So you feel like its a southern thing         Because in NY where Im from they do not cheerleading and that stuff isnt as big as it is down here                     Well that was a big part for me in high school so I definitely think it would have made a difference it I had lived up there for high school                     So was an important part of being in high school                     Oh         That was my life         It truly was my life in high school                     And it was an important aspect was there a particular crowd that hung out because of that                     Oh yes         It was the little popular crowd you know the little were better than everybody else crowd         I hate to say that but it is true                              What about the people that didnt do that                     I mean I wasnt a particular snobby one but there were some that were so                     So it was the cheerleaders dated the football players                     Yeah                  It really was         It was the stereotypical high school                     It was         And do you feel like it was a good thing to grow up around                     No         I really dont         You should really give everybody a chance         Just because they dont have as much money as you or they dont do the same things as you do doesnt mean theyre not a good person inside                     The money aspect is that in your high school did that affect stuff how a person fit in or                     It really did because a lot of the people on my group their friends were well off         They had awesome cars and they strutted around with their awesome clothes and the other people who didnt really didnt hang out with our group of friends                     Does that make for a lot of pressure to have a lot of money                     It does         Because my family is by no means rich but we never had that much trouble so         You always wanted to have the update styles clothes and the updated car         You want to be down anymore than anybody else so                     Is there anything else you wanted to talk about         High school or college                     I guess I want to say that its been a real positive experience living here because my my mother really wants to move back up north because thats where shes from         But my father loves the South so I guess it would be an adjustment for him if they moved so         Charlottes a good city its expanding and its getting better         UNCC is a good school its probably the right size I wouldnt want to go to a bigger school so         I enjoy UNCCharlotte                     Well thank you for sharing your experiences with me and your time         I appreciate it Tracy
