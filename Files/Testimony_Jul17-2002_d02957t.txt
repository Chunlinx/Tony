United States General Accounting OfficeTestimonyGAOBefore the Select Committee on Homeland Security House ofRepresentativesFor Release on Delivery Expected at  am Wednesday July HOMELAND SECURITYCritical Design and Implementation IssuesStatement of David Walker Comptroller General of the UnitedStatesaGAOTMr Chairman and Members of the Select CommitteeThank you for the opportunity to appear beforethis Select Committee today to discuss one of the most importantissues of our time the reorganization of government agencies andthe reorientation of their missions to improve our nations abilityto better protect our homeland It is important to recognize thatthis transition to a more effective homeland security approach ispart of a larger transformation effort that our government mustmake to address emerging security economic demographicscientific technological fiscal and other challenges of the stcentury and to meet the expectations of the American people fortimely quality and costeffective public servicesIn the months since the horrible events of September th thePresident and the Congress have responded with important andaggressive actions to protect the nation including creating anOffice of Homeland Security OHS passing new laws such as the USAPatriot Act and an initial emergency supplemental spending billestablishing a new agency to improve transportation security andworking with unprecedented collaboration with federal state andlocal governments private sector entities nongovernmentalorganizations and other countries to prevent future terrorist actsand to bring to justice those individuals responsible for suchterrible actsMore recently the Congress and the President have sought toremedy longstanding issues and concerns in the governmentshomeland security functions by proposing greater consolidation andcoordination of various agencies and activities On June th thePresident announced a proposal to establish a Department ofHomeland Security DHS and on June th he transmitted draftlegislation to the Congress for its consideration Both the Houseand the Senate have worked diligently on these issues and thisSelect Committee is now deliberating on a variety of proposals andissues raised by House committees and subcommitteesIn my testimony today I will focus on two major issues that webelieve the Congress should consider creating a new cabinetdepartment principally dedicated to homeland security  thenational strategy and criteria needed to guide any reorganizationof homeland security activities and to help evaluate which agenciesand missions should be included in or left out of the new DHS and key issues related to the successful implementation of andtransition to a new department including leadership cost andphasing and other management challenges Our testimony is basedlargely on our previous and ongoing work on national preparednessissues as well as a review of the proposed legislationIn response to global challenges the government faces in thecoming years we have a unique opportunity to create an extremelyeffective and performancebased organization that can strengthenthe nations ability to protect its borders and citizens againstterrorism There is likely to be considerable benefit over timefrom restructuring some of the homeland security functionsincluding reducing risk and improving the economy efficiency andeffectiveness of these consolidated agencies and programs Sortingout those programs and agencies that would most benefit fromconsolidation versus those in which dual missions must be balancedin order to achieve a more effective fit in DHS is a difficult butcritical task Moreover the magnitude of the challenges that thenew department faces will clearly require substantial time andeffort and will take institutional continuity and additionalresources to make it fully effective Numerous complicated issueswill need to be resolved in the short term including aharmonization of the communication systems information technologysystems human capital systems the physical location of people andother assets and many other factors Implementation of the newdepartment will be an extremely complex task and will ultimatelytake years to achieve Given the magnitude of the endeavor noteverything can be achieved at the same time and a deliberatephasing of some operations will be necessary As a result it willbe important for the new department to focus on articulating aclear overarching mission and core values establishing a shortlist of initial critical priorities assuring effectivecommunication and information systems and developing an overallimplementation plan for the new national strategy and relatedreorganization Further effective performance and risk managementsystems must be established and work must be completed on threatand vulnerability assessments See Related GAO Products at the end of this testimonyCongress in its deliberations on creatinga new department should payHomeland Securityspecial attention tostrategy criteria and priorities for reorganization critical tothe nations efforts to protect the nation from terrorismReorganizationHomeland Security StrategyIn recent testimony before the Congress GAO urged that theproposal for establishing DHS should not be considered a substitutefor nor should it supplant the timely issuance of a nationalhomeland security strategy Based on our prior work GAO believesthat the consolidation of some homeland security functions makessense and will if properly organized and implemented over timelead to more efficient effective and coordinated programs betterintelligence sharing and a more robust protection of our peopleborders and critical infrastructure At the same time theproposed cabinet department even with its multiple missions willstill be just one of many players with important roles andresponsibilities for ensuring homeland security At the federallevel homeland security missions will require the involvement ofthe Central Intelligence Agency CIA Federal Bureau ofInvestigation FBI the US Marshals Service the Department ofDefense DOD and a myriad of other agencies In addition stateand local governments including law enforcement and firstresponder personnel and the private sector also have criticalroles to playIf anything the multiplicity of players only reinforces therecommendations that GAO has made in the past regarding the urgentneed for a comprehensive threat risk and vulnerability assessmentand a national homeland security strategy that can providedirection and utility at all levels of government and across allsectors of the country US General Accounting Office Homeland Security Proposalfor Cabinet Agency Has Merit But Implementation Will Be Pivotal toSuccess GAOTWashington DC June   US General Accounting Office Combating Terrorism SelectedChallenges and Related Recommendations GAOWashington DC September  Page  GAOTWe are pleased that the Administration has just released thenational homeland security strategy and GAO stands ready to workwith the Congress and the Administration to ensure that a sound andstrong strategy can be effectively implemented to protect thecountry against terrorism Although GAO has not had time tothoroughly analyze the strategy yet we previously suggested thatcertain key elements be incorporated in the homeland securitystrategy We have indicated that a national homeland securitystrategy should  clearly define and establish the need forhomeland security and its operational components  clarify theappropriate roles and responsibilities of federal state and localentities and build a framework for partnerships for coordinationcommunication and collaboration and  create specificexpectations for performance and accountability includingestablishing goals and performance indicators In addition GAO hassaid the national strategy development and implementation shouldinclude  a regular update of a nationallevel threat and riskassessment effort  formulate realistic budget and resource plansto eliminate gaps avoid duplicate effort avoid hitchhikerspending and protect against federal funds being used tosubstitute for funding that would have occurred anyway coordinate the strategy for combating terrorism with efforts toprevent detect and respond to computerbased attacks coordinate agency implementation by reviewing agency andinteragency programs to accomplish the national strategy and carefully choose the most appropriate policy tools of government tobest implement the national strategy and achieve nationalgoalsBased on our preliminary review some of these elements havebeen addressed in the national strategy In the past the absenceof a broadbased homeland security definition or the ad hoc creationof a definition by individual government departments suggest that aconsistent and transparent definition be applied to help create amore integrated approach and unified purpose The Presidentsnational homeland security strategy does provide for a proposeddefinition of homeland security which should help the governmentto more effectively administer fund and coordinate activities bothinside and outside a new department and to ensure that all partiesare focused on the same goals and objectives results and outcomesIt is critically important that the Congress and the Administrationagree on a definition since it serves as the foundation for anumber of key organizational operational and fundingdecisions GAOTNeed for Criteria and ReorganizationFinally I would also note that in the past we have suggestedthat a central focal point such as OHS be established statutorilyin order to coordinate and oversee homeland security policy withina national framework Today we reemphasize the need for OHS tobe established statutorily in order to effectively coordinateactivities beyond the scope of the proposed DHS and to assurereasonable congressional oversightOften it has taken years for the consolidated functions in newdepartments to effectively build on their combined strengths andit is not uncommon for these structures to remain as managementchallenges for decades It is instructive to note that the legislation creating DOD was further changed by the Congress in   and  in order to improve the departmentsstructural effectiveness Despite these and other changes made byDOD GAO has consistently reported over the years that thedepartment  more than  years after the reorganization continues to face a number of serious management challenges Infact DOD has  of  government wide highrisk areas based onGAOs latest list including the governmentwide highrisk areas ofhuman capital and computer security This note of caution is notintended to dissuade the Congress from seeking logical andimportant consolidations in government agencies and programs inorder to improve homeland security missions Rather it is meant tosuggest that reorganizations of government agencies frequentlyencounter startup problems and unanticipated consequences thatresult from the consolidations are unlikely to fully overcomeobstacles and challenges and may require additional modificationsin the future to effectively achieve our collective goals fordefending the country against terrorismThe Congress faces a challenging and complex job in itsconsideration of DHS On the one hand there exists a certainurgency to move rapidly in order to remedy known problems relatingto intelligence and information sharing and leveraging likeactivities that have in the past and even today prevent the UnitedStates from exercising as strong a homeland defense as US General Accounting Office Homeland SecurityResponsibility and Accountability for

Planning Reorganizations GAOGGDWashington DC March  Page  GAOTemerging and potential threats warrant Simultaneously thatsame urgency of purpose would suggest that the Congress beextremely careful and deliberate in how it creates a new departmentfor defending the country against terrorism The urge to do itquickly must be balanced by an equal need to do it right Thisis necessary to ensure a consensus on identified problems andneeds and to be sure that the solutions our government legislatesand implements can effectively remedy the problems we face in atimely manner It is clear that fixing the wrong problems or evenworse fixing the right problems poorly could cause more harm thangood in our efforts to defend our country against terrorismGAO has previously recommended that reorganizations shouldemphasize an integrated approach that reorganization plans shouldbe designed to achieve specific identifiable goals and thatcareful attention to fundamental public sector management practicesand principles such as strong financial technology and humancapital management are critical to the successful implementationof government reorganizations Similarly GAO has also suggestedthat reorganizations may be warranted based on the significance ofthe problems requiring resolution as well as the extent and levelof coordination and interaction necessary with other entities inorder to resolve problems or achieve overall objectivesGAO based on its own work as well as a review of otherapplicable studies of approaches to the organization and structureof entities has concluded that the Congress should considerutilizing specific criteria as a guide to creating and implementingthe new department Specifically GAO has developed a frameworkthat will help the Congress and the Administration create andimplement a strong and effective new cabinet department byestablishing criteria to be considered for constructing thedepartment itself determining which agencies should be includedand excluded and leveraging numerous key management and policyelements that after completion of the revised organizationalstructure will be critical to the departments

Elevating the EPA toCabinet Status March   GAOTPage  GAOTFigure  Organization and Accountability Criteria for theDepartment of Homeland SecurityWith respect to criteria that the Congress should consider forconstructing the department itself the following questions aboutthe overall purpose and structure of the organization should beevaluatedDefinition Is there a clear and consistently applieddefinition of homeland security that will be used as a basis fororganizing and managing the new departmentStatutory Basis Are the authorities of the newdepartment clear and complete in how they articulate roles andresponsibilities and do they sufficiently describe the departmentsrelationship with other partiesClear Mission What will the primary missions of the newDHS be and how will it define successPerformancebased Organization Does the new departmenthave the structure eg Chief Operating Officer COO etc andstatutory authorities eg human capital sourcing necessary tomeet performance expectations be held accountable for results andleverage effective management approaches for achieving its missionon a national basisCongress should also consider several very specific criteria inits evaluation of whether individual agencies or programs should beincluded or excluded from the proposed department Those criteriainclude the followingMission Relevancy Is homeland security a major part ofthe agency or program mission Is it the primary mission of theagency or programSimilar Goals and Objectives Does the agency or programbeing considered for the new department share primary goals andobjectives with the other agencies or programs beingconsolidatedLeverage Effectiveness Does the agency or program beingconsidered for the new department create synergy and help toleverage the effectiveness of other agencies and programs or thenew department as a whole In other words is the whole greaterthan the sum of the partsGains Through Consolidation Does the agency or programbeing considered for the new department improve the efficiency andeffectiveness of homeland security missions through eliminatingduplications and overlaps closing gaps and aligning or mergingcommon roles and responsibilitiesIntegrated Information SharingCoordination Does theagency or program being considered for the new departmentcontribute to or leverage the ability of the new department toenhance the sharing of critical information or otherwise improvethe coordination of missions and activities related to homelandsecurityCompatible Cultures Can the organizational culture ofthe agency or program being considered for the new departmenteffectively meld withthe other entities that will be consolidated Field structuresandapproaches to achieving missions vary considerably betweenagenciesImpact on Excluded Agencies What is the impact ondepartments losing components to DHS What is the impact onagencies with homeland security missions left out ofDHSIn addition to the above criteria that the Congress shouldconsider when evaluating what to include and exclude from theproposed DHS there are certain critical success factors the newdepartment should emphasize in its initial implementation phaseOver the years GAO has made observations and recommendations aboutmany of these success factors based on effective management ofpeople technology financial and other issues especially in itsbiannual Performance and Accountability Series on major governmentdepartments These factors include the followingStrategic Planning Leading resultsorientedorganizations focus on the process of strategic planning thatincludes involvement of stakeholders assessment of internal andexternal environments and an alignment of activities coreprocesses and resources to support missionrelatedoutcomesOrganizational Alignment The organization of the newdepartment should be aligned to be consistent with the goals andobjectives established in the strategic planCommunications Effective communication strategies arekey to any major consolidation or transformation effortBuilding Partnerships One of the key challenges of thisnew department will be the development and maintenance of homelandsecurity partners at all levels of the government and the privatesector both in the United States and overseasPerformance Management An effective performancemanagement system fosters institutional unit and individualaccountability US General Accounting Office Major Management Challengesand Program Risks A Governmentwide Perspective GAOWashington DC January Page  GAOTHuman Capital Strategy The new department must ensurethat its homeland security missions are not adversely impacted bythe governments pending human capital crisis and that it canrecruit retain and reward a talented and motivated workforcewhich has required core competencies to achieve its mission andobjectives The people factor is a critical element in any majorconsolidation or transformationInformation Management and Technology The new departmentshould leverage stateofthe art enabling technology to enhance itsability to transform capabilities and capacities to share and actupon timely quality information about terroristthreatsKnowledge Management The new department must ensure itmakes maximum use of the collective body of knowledge that will bebrought together in the consolidationFinancial Management The new department has astewardship obligation to prevent fraud waste and abuse to usetax dollars appropriately and to ensure financial accountabilityto the President the Congress and the American peopleAcquisition Management Anticipated as one of the largestfederal departments the proposed DHS will potentially have some ofthe most extensive acquisition government needs Early attention tostrong systems and controls for acquisition and related businessprocesses will be critical both to ensuring success and maintainingintegrity and accountabilityRisk Management The new department must be able tomaintain and enhance current states of homeland security readinesswhile transitioning and transforming itself into a more effectiveand efficient structural unit The proposed DHS will also need toimmediately improve the governments overall ability to performrisk management activities that can help to prevent defendagainst and respond to terrorist actsChange Management Assembling a new organization out ofseparate pieces and reorienting all of its processes and assets todeliver the desired results while managing related risks will takean organized systematic approach to change The new departmentwill require bothHomeland Security Reorganization andMissionsan executive and operational capability to encourage and managechangeThe Presidents proposal for the new department indicates thatDHS in addition to its homeland security responsibilities willalso be responsible for carrying out all other functions of theagencies and programs that are transferred to it In fact quite anumber of the agencies proposed to be transferred to DHS havemultiple functions Agencies or programs that balance multiplemissions present the Congress with significant issues that must beevaluated in order to determine how best to achieve all of thegoals and objectives for which the entity was created While wehave not found any missions that would appear to be in fundamentalconflict with the departments primary mission of homelandsecurity as presented in the Presidents proposal the Congresswill need to consider whether many of the nonhomeland securitymissions of those agencies transferred to DHS will receive adequatefunding attention visibility and support when subsumed into adepartment that will be under tremendous pressure to succeed in itsprimary mission As important and vital as the homeland securitymission is to our nations future the other nonhomeland securitymissions transferred to DHS for the most part are not small ortrivial responsibilities Rather they represent extremelyimportant functions executed by the federal government that absentsufficient attention could have serious implications for theireffective delivery and consequences for sectors of our economyhealth and safety research programs and other significantgovernment functions Some of these responsibilities includemaritime safety and drug interdiction by the CoastGuardcollection of commercial tariffs by the CustomsServicepublic health research by the Department of Health andHuman Servicesadvanced energy and environmental research by theLawrence Livermore and Environmental Measurements labsresponding to floods and other natural disasters by theFederal Emergency Management Agency FEMA andauthority over processing visas by the State Departmentsconsular officersThese examples reveal that many nonhomeland security missionscould be integrated into a cabinet department overwhelminglydedicated to protecting the nation from terrorism Congress maywish to consider whether the new department as proposed willdedicate sufficient management capacity and accountability toensure the execution of nonhomeland security missions as well asconsider potential alternatives to the current framework forhandling these important functions One alternative might be tocreate a special accountability track that ensures thatnonhomeland security functions are well supported and executed inDHS including milestones for monitoring performance Converselythe Congress might separate out some of these functions In doingso the Congress will still need to hold agencies accountable forthe homeland security missions that are not incorporated in the newdepartment In making these decisions Congress should consider thecriteria presented earlier in my testimony especially thoserelated to agency transitions such as mission relevancy similargoals and objectives leveraging effectiveness and creating gainsthrough consolidation There are clearly advantages anddisadvantages to all of the decisions about placing agencies orprograms with multiple missions in DHS and Congress must carefullyweigh numerous important factors related to performance andaccountability in crafting the legislationFor example we have indicated in recent testimony that DHScould serve to improve biomedical research and developmentcoordination because of the current fragmented state of disparateactivities Yet we remain concerned that the proposed transfer ofcontrol and priority setting for research from the organizationswhere the research would be conducted could be disruptive to dualpurpose programs which have important synergies for public healthprograms that need to be maintained Similarly we have testifiedthat the Presidents proposal in tasking the new department withdeveloping national policy for and coordinating the federalgovernments research and development efforts for responding tochemical biological radiological and nuclear weapons threatsalso transfers some of the civilian research programs of theDepartment of Energy Again there may be implications forresearch synergy US General Accounting Office Homeland Security NewDepartment Could Improve Biomedical RD Coordination but MayDisrupt DualPurpose Efforts GAOTWashington DC July   US General Accounting Office Homeland Security Title IIIof the Homeland Security Act of  GAOTWashington DC July  Page  GAOTCongress may also craft compromises that strengthen homelandsecurity while reducing concerns of program disruption orunanticipated consequences One such example is seen in recentdeliberations about the appropriate location for visa processingCongressional debate has focused on two of our criteria missionrelevancy and gains through consolidation The visa functionattempts to facilitate legitimate travel while at the same timedenying entry to the United States of certain individualsincluding potential terrorists Some have argued that the missionof the visa function is primarily related to homeland security andthat therefore the function should be located within the proposeddepartment Others have advocated that the Department of StateState should retain the visa function because they believe thatthere would be no gains from consolidation They point out thatState has an established field structure and that it may beimpractical to create a similar field structure in the proposeddepartment The compromise position of several committees has beento transfer responsibility for visa policy to the proposeddepartment while retaining the cadre of overseas visa officerswithin StateAs part of these deliberations the Congress should consider notonly the mission and role that agencies fulfill today but themission and role that they should fulfill in the coming yearsThus while it may be accurate that large portions of the missionsengaged in by the Coast Guard or FEMA today do not relate primarilyto homeland security it is wholly appropriate for Congress todetermine whether the future missions of such agencies should focusprincipally on homeland security Such decisions of course wouldrequire the Congress to determine the best approach for carryingout a range of the governments missions and operations in orderto see that nonhomeland security activities of these departmentsare still achieved In fact given the key trends identified inGAOs recent strategic plan for supporting the Congress and ourlong range fiscal challenges it is appropriate to ask three keyquestions  what should the federal government do in the stcentury  how should the federal government do business in thest century and  who should do the federal governmentsbusiness in the st century These questions are relevant for DHSand every other federal agency and activityAs the proposal to create DHS demonstrates the terrorist eventsof last fall have provided an impetus for the government to look atthe larger picture of how it provides homeland security and how itcan best accomplish associated missions Yet even for thoseagencies that are not being integrated into DHS there remains avery real need and possibly a unique opportunity to rethinkapproaches and priorities to enable them to better target theirresources to address our most urgent needs In some cases the newemphasis on homeland security has prompted attention tolongstanding problems that have suddenly become more pressing Forexample weve mentioned in previous testimony the overlapping andduplicative food safety programs in the federal government Whilesuch overlap and duplication has been responsible for poorcoordination and inefficient allocation of resources these issuesassume a new and potentially more foreboding meaning afterSeptember th given the threat from bioterrorism In anotherexample we have recommended combining the Department of JusticesOffice of Domestic Preparedness with FEMA to improvecoordination A consolidated approach to many of these issues canfacilitate a concerted and effective response to new threats andmission performanceSimilarly we have conducted a number of reviews of States visafunction over the years and based on our work we believe thatthere are a number of areas in which the visa function can bestrengthened For example theUS government needs to ensure that there are sufficient staffat overseas posts with the right training and experience to makegood decisions about who should and who should not receive a visaIn addition we are currently looking at ways that the visafunction can be strengthened as a screen against potentialterrorists and we expect to make recommendations later this fiscalyear These recommendations will apply regardless of decisionsabout the respective roles of the State Department and the proposedDepartment of Homeland Security regarding visa functions Food Safety and Security Fundamental Changes Needed toEnsure Safe Food October   GAOT GAOPage  GAOTHomeland Security Implementation andTransition IssuesThe ultimate effectiveness of the new department will bedependent on successfully addressing implementation and transitionissues Picking the right leadership for these critical positionsin the new department will be crucial to its success If you donthave the right leadership team in key policy operational andmanagement positions the department will be at risk In additionproviding the new department with some reasoned and reasonablehuman capital management and budget flexibilities combined withappropriate safeguards to protect the Congress constitutionalauthorities and to prevent abuse can also help contribute to asuccessful transition Both the Congress and the Executive Branchhave critical roles to play in achieving desired outcomes for theAmerican peopleKey Success Factors Leadership andAccountabilityAmong the most important elements for effectively implementingthe new cabinet department will be close adherence to the keysuccess factors Strategic planning building partnerships humancapital strategies financial management and other critical factorswill make the difference between a department that can quickly riseto the challenge of its mission and one that might otherwise becomemired in major problems and obstacles that hamper efforts toprotect the nation from terrorismThe quality and continuity of the new departments leadership iscritical to building and sustaining the longterm effectiveness ofDHS and homeland security goals and objectives The experiences oforganizations that have undertaken transformational change effortsalong the lines that will be necessary for the new department to befully effective suggest that this process can take up to  to years to provide meaningful and sustainable results Given thescope and nature of challenges facing the new department thecritical question is how can we ensure that the essentialtransformation and management issues receive the sustainedtoplevel attention that they require The nation can illafford tohave the secretary or deputy secretary being sidetracked byadministrative and operational details  the mission of thedepartment requires their undivided attentionAs a result it is important for the Congress to give seriousconsideration to creating a deputy secretary for managementchiefoperating officer COO position within the department to providethe sustained management attention essential for addressing keyinfrastructure and stewardship issues while helping to facilitatethe transition and transformation process Recent legislativelanguage adopted by the House Committee on Government Reformsuggests elevating the undersecretary for management to a deputysecretary equivalent to the deputy position provided for in theAdministrations proposal We believe that is an important firststep to ensuring that transformation and management issues receivethe toplevel attention they require Raising the organizationalprofile of transformation and management issues is important toensure that the individual has the authority needed to successfullylead departmentwide initiatives We are not convinced that anunder secretary for management on par with the other undersecretaries would necessarily have sufficient authorityTo provide further leadership and accountability for managementCongress may wish to consider several pointsFirst Congress should consider making the deputysecretary for managementCOO a term appointment of up to  yearssubject to Senate confirmation A term appointment would providecontinuity that spans the tenure of the political leadership andthereby help to ensure that longterm stewardship issues areaddressed and change management initiatives are successfullycompletedSecond to further clarify accountability the COO shouldbe subject to a clearly defined resultsoriented performancecontract with appropriate incentive reward and accountabilitymechanisms The COO would be selected without regard to politicalaffiliation based on  demonstrated leadership skills in managinglarge and complex organizations and  experience achievingresults in connection with good government responsibilities andinitiatives Requiring that both the performance contract and thesubsequent performance evaluation be made available to the Congresswould provide additional accountability andtransparencyIn addition to providing toplevel leadership andaccountability the department will need to develop employeeperformance management systems that can serve as a key tool foraligning institutional unit and employee performance achievingresults accelerating change managing the organization on adaytoday basis and facilitating communication throughout theyear so that discussions about individual and organizationalperformance are integrated and ongoing A cascading set ofresultsoriented performance agreements is one mechanism in aperformance management system that creates a line of sightshowing how individual employees can contribute to overallorganizational goalsFurther accountability can be achieved by ensuring that allrelevant management laws are applied to the new department egGovernment Performance and Results Act GPRA Chief FinancialOfficers Act ClingerCohen Act etc These laws provide afoundation for the management structure of the new department and abasis for ensuring appropriate transparency and accountabilityUS

Selected Agencies Use of PerformanceAgreements GAO Washington DC Oct  Page  GAOTRequest for Increased Human Capital andManagement FlexibilitiesThe Presidents proposal includes a set of human capital andmanagement flexibilities for the new department GAO believes thatits reasonable for certain flexibilities to be granted to the newdepartment in such areas as human capital provided that they areaccompanied by adequate transparency and accountability safeguardsdesigned to prevent abuse Human capital and management flexibilitywill help the new department to reorganize realign and transformitself to achieve its important missions Appropriate safeguardscan help to prevent abuse of federal employees and provide adequatemonitoring mechanisms to gauge performance For instance theCongress may wish to provide the new department with early outand buy out authority in order to help quickly realign thecomponent entities and provide for future flexibility DHS mightconsider new scientific and technical personnel tracks to encouragerecruitment retention and rewarding of individuals with criticalknowledge or Congress may wish to provide the new department withsome limited term appointment authority These and other suggestedflexibilities for DHS should be viewed in the context of howsimilar flexibilities have been exercised by other agencies withsimilar missions such as the Transportation SecurityAdministration TSA the DOD the FBI and the CIA Congressshould also note that as GAO has indicated in the past agenciesare already accorded in law significant flexibilities especiallywith respect to human capital issues but for a variety of reasonsthey do not always take advantage of them DHS should use thethese existing flexibilities and be given others in areas whereCongress has done so with other agencies eg TSA InternalRevenue Service DODIn requesting human capital flexibilities questions have beenraised about whether they would result in eroding merit principlesveterans preferences whistleblower protections collectivebargaining and other basic civil service provisions Recenttestimony to the Congress by Governor Ridge has clarified

Homeland Security July Page  GAOTRequest for Increased BudgetFlexibilityOther flexibilities such as ones for acquisitions andcontracting are included in the Presidents proposal Carefulanalysis is needed to determine the need for additionalflexibilities Congress may want to consider not expresslyproviding certain flexibilities in the initial legislation butrather providing a mechanism for expedited consideration offlexibilities should the new department request them in the futureFor example the Congress might wish to agree on rules specifyingprocedures for consideration of proposed changes time limits ondebate or requirements that any amendments to future legislationbe strictly related to DHS This would not be the blanket grant ofauthority envisioned in the original Freedom to Manage proposalbut it would permit both the executive branch and the Congress tofeel confident that proposed changes would receive timelyconsiderationThe Administration has suggested that it needs a special grantof budget flexibility for the Department of Homeland Security GAObelieves that Congress should be careful to distinguish betweenthose flexibilities that will solely enhance the operations of DHSand those that might simultaneously raise other concerns includingconcerns about the constitutional responsibilities and prerogativesof the legislative branch For instance the Presidents proposalpermits the Secretary to allocate funds as he sees fit withoutregard to the original purpose of the appropriations Moreoverthere must be a system to identify homeland security funds acrossthe wide range of existing budget accounts and program activitiesThis is necessary not only for the budget resolution andappropriations process but also for tracking budget execution andfor accountability to CongressThe Congress through its appropriations subcommittees hasproven quite adept at creating and granting the kind of flexibilityit sees as appropriate to any given agency Congress gives agenciesflexibility over the timing of spending by varying the period offund availability agencies may receive oneyear multiyear andnoyear permanent funds Congress has granted agencies varyingdegrees of transfer or reprogramming authority These flexibilitiesare generally provided as part of the appropriations process andconsider the balance between accountability and flexibility toensure that Congress is a partner in the spending of taxpayerfundsOver the longer term the creation of the new Department may alsobe an opportune time to review the account structure of theDepartments component entities Should the orientation of budgetaccounts be shiftedDHS Transition Issuestoward the strategic goals defined in plans Such areorientation might facilitate the process of linking resourceallocation to results consistent with GPRA Efforts designed torationalize the number of budget accounts within the new departmentcan serve to provide flexibility while ensuring accountabilityThe creation of the Department of Homeland Security will be oneof the largest reorganizations ever undertaken and the difficultyof this task should not be underestimated Under the Presidentsproposal  existing agencies and programs and  peoplewould be integrated into the new department in order to strengthenthe countrys defense against terrorism With an estimated budgetauthority of the component parts of the new department of billion successfully transitioning the government in an endeavorof this scale will take considerable time andmoney Careful and thorough planning will be critical to thesuccessful creation of the new department While national needssuggest a rapid reorganization of homeland security functions thetransition of agencies and programs into the new department islikely to take time to achieve At the same time the need forspeed to get the new department up and running must be balancedwith the need to maintain readiness for new and existing threatsduring the transition period Moreover the organizationaltransition of the various components will simply be the startingpoint  as implementation challenges beyond the first year shouldbe expected in building a fully integrated department As I statedearlier it could take  to  years to fully implement thisreorganization in an effective and sustainable mannerA comprehensive transition plan needs to be developed Thetransition plan should establish a time table for the orderlymigration of each component agency or program to the newdepartment identify key objectives to be achieved during the firstyear following the transfer and describe the strategy forachieving an orderly transition and sustaining mission performanceMore detailed implementation plans also will be necessary toaddress business system processes and resource issues ThePresident has taken an important first step by establishing atransition office within the Office of Management and Budget The Presidents proposal entitled The Department of HomelandSecurity President George W Bush June Page  GAOTCongress has an important oversight role to play in helping toensure the effective implementation of the new department Inaddition to the transition plans Congress should considerrequiring DHS to submit regular progress reports on implementationfrom the department and should also conduct periodic oversighthearings to assess progress and performance In this regard GAOstands ready to assist the Congress in conducting its oversightroleIncreased cost must also be considered with regard to thePresidents proposal It is likely that over time consolidation offunctions within DHS may reduce costs below what otherwise wouldhave been the case if these functions continued to operateseparately This however is unlikely to happen quickly Moreoverwe should expect that any reorganization would incur start up costsas well as require some funding for redundant activities tomaintain continuity of effort during the transition period TheCongressional Budget Office CBO has estimated that the costs ofimplementing the new department would be about  billion over thenext five years with an annual estimate of  million in FYand  million thereafter However there are other transitioncosts that CBO acknowledges are not included in their estimatesbeyond the cost to hire house and equip key personnel The CBOestimate assumes continuation of the existing multipay andretirement systemshowever unlikely and does not address thepotential need to crosstrain existing personnel Although thepurchase of new computer equipment supplies and compatibleinformation management systems are included no estimates areprovided for the cost to correct existing computer systemdeficiencies nor the resources to support some system redundancyfor a period of time Finally CBO did not attempt to price therelocation of personnel to a central locationThe Administration has argued that CBOs estimates are inflatedIn fact CBO estimates that  percent of the total annual spendingwill be for administrative costs but that a proportionate share ofthe costs to currently administer these agencies will betransferred Depending on the decision to colocate personnel andthe flexibilities ultimately provided to the Administration inlegislationin particular a broad grant of transfer authority andthe ability to staff through nonreimbursable agreements with otheragencies these estimates may well change More important than aprecise cost estimate of the transition however is therecognition that there will be shortterm transition costs and thatthese costs need to be made transparent To fully recognize thetransition costs in fact Congress should consider appropriatingfor them separatelyIn summary I have discussed the reorganization of homelandsecurity functions and some critical factors for success Howeverthe single most important element of a successful reorganization isthe sustained commitment of top leaders to modern effective andcredible human capital strategies and to setting clear goals andappropriate accountability mechanisms Top leadership involvementand clear lines of accountability for making managementimprovements are critical to overcoming an organizations naturalresistance to change marshalling the resources needed to improvemanagement and building and maintaining organizationwidecommitment to new ways of doing business Organizational cultureswill not be transformed and new visions and ways of doing businesswill not take root without strong and sustained leadership Strongand visionary leadership will be vital to creating a unifiedfocused organization as opposed to a group of separate units undera single roof Modern human capital strategies includingimplementing a credible effective and equitable performancemanagement system that links institutional unit team andindividual performance measurement and reward systems to thedepartments strategic plan core values and desired outcomes willbe critical to successMr Chairman this concludes my written testimony I would bepleased to respond to any questions that you or members of theSelect
