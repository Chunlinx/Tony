                    Background        Over the last decade RNA interference RNAi mediated        by short interfering doublestranded RNA molecules siRNA        or dsRNA has been gradually recognized as a major        mechanism of posttranscriptional gene silencing PTGS in        species as diverse as plants         Drosophila and         C elegans     Recently        nucleotide long dsRNA molecules corresponding to        specific mRNA sequences when introduced into mammalian        cells in culture have been shown to be highly effective in        degrading the cognate mRNAs and thus abrogating the        expression of the corresponding proteins     Although        the exact mechanism of PTGS is currently unknown and is an        area of intense research the successful use of this        phenomenon in cultured mammalian cells has raised the        exciting prospect that it can be used as a simple strategy        for phenotypic ablation of mammalian gene function         ex vivo without the timeconsuming        and expensive construction of transgenic animals        So far the genes targeted for siRNAmediated PTGS have        been cellular in origin and thus the mRNAs were        transcribed in the nucleus by cellular DNAdependent RNA        polymerase In contrast the vast majority of RNA genomes        are transcribed exclusively in the cytoplasm For example        transcription of RNA viral genomes with the exception of        retroviral RNA is catalyzed by a virally encoded        RNAdependent RNA polymerase RdRP     It remains        untested whether the siRNAmediated PTGS will work on mRNAs        that never went through the nucleus Interestingly because        of the potency of siRNA in some organisms it has been        proposed that they may be replicated by a cellular RdRP        activity although this has been debated            Furthermore since dsRNA is known to be a potent inducer of        the interferon pathway      it is important to know        whether this also occurs in cells in which antisense dsRNA        has been introduced        To answer these questions we have used a nonsegmented        negativestrand RNA NNR virus as a test target for        RNAmediated inhibition We reasoned that if successful        our studies would additionally contribute a reliable and        simple technology for specific gene silencing in        cytoplasmic RNA viruses Traditionally structurefunction        analyses of RNA genomes including those of RNA viruses        have relied on spontaneous mutants found in natural        isolates or chemically mutagenized stocks     Mutations        in either case are essentially unpredictable and must be        mapped by elaborate techniques such as classical        complementation analyses or direct sequencing of the        genome Since conventional sitedirected mutagenesis        requires a DNA template direct mutational analysis of        selected RNA genes is not an option These obstacles have        been largely circumvented by the use of cloned viral cDNA        that is then altered by standard DNAbased sitedirected        mutagenesis procedures      Originally designed for        influenza virus minigenomes     such cDNAbased        reverse genetics strategy has been adopted in a large        number of NNR viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus        VSV respiratory syncytial virus RSV and measles to        name a few        Recently extension of this        approach has resulted in the cloning of fulllength viral        cDNA capable of producing infectious recombinant virus        particles upon transcription        Despite its revolutionary effect on RNA viral reverse        genetics however the cDNAbased strategy is not without        limitations First as implied above cloning and        recombinant expression of the viral genomic RNA and all the        viral proteins in the right proportion constitute a long        and arduous task daunting to an average laboratory The        problem is particularly acute for NNR viruses which have        large RNA genomes      The  kb long RNA genomes        of these viruses require specific sequences at the  and         termini for transcription and replication and must be        properly encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein N in        order to be recognized by the viral RdRP      Thus        any recombinant technology must be able to faithfully        reproduce these features of the genome Moreover the        functional viral RdRP as detailed later for RSV is a        complex holoenzyme composed of viral as well as cellular        proteins           Second many NNR viral        genomes and proteins are currently expressed from        vacciniabased cDNA clones which generally requires        superinfection by vaccinia virus      Unfortunately        vaccinia virus itself is a major modulator of cellular        signaling including MAP kinase pathways and the actin        cytoskeleton       It is therefore virtually        impossible to study the interaction between cellular        signaling pathways and NNR viruses in cells that are also        superinfected by vaccinia virus       Third        mutations in the recombinant DNA are permanent and thus        the mutational phenotype cannot be switched on at        predetermined time points in infection For example if a        viral gene product has essential roles both early and late        in infection its mutational inactivation will fail to        reveal the late function since the mutant virus will never        proceed beyond the early stage        A member of the         Paramyxoviridae family RSV is a        major causative agent of childhood respiratory disease and        asthma     Pediatric RSV disease claims about a        million lives annually and no reliable antiviral or        vaccine currently exists      A need to understand        the molecular genetics of the virus and the function of the        various gene products has thus been appreciated Since our        laboratory is interested in deciphering the temporal        signaling pathways in hostRSV interaction and the role of        RSV gene products in the process we have sought potential        alternatives to the cDNAbased approach that might allow us        to study the effect of functional loss of a specific RSV        gene product during the course of a standard virus        infection in cell culture Using two different RSV gene        mRNAs as targets and another NNR virus VSV as well as        cellular mRNAs as controls we show that synthetic dsRNA        molecules are highly efficient and specific silencers of        cytoplasmic RNA viral gene expression We also provide the        first direct evidence that the nt long dsRNAs do not        activate a general interferon response Our results thus        offer a mechanism of specific and direct ablation of        RNAbased gene expression and a quicker and simpler        alternative to cDNAbased reverse genetics of RNA        viruses                    Results                  Ablation of viral gene expression by dsRNA against          RSV P mRNA          The RNA genome of RSV is about  kb long and contains           documented proteincoding genes     Three viral          proteins are minimally required to reconstitute the          functional transcription complex of NNR viruses              the nucleocapsid protein N that wraps the          negativestrand genome RNA and its fulllength          complement the positivestrand antigenome RNA thus          converting them into highly nucleaseresistant          chromatinlike templates the large protein L which is          the major subunit of the RdRP and the phosphoprotein          P which is the smaller subunit of RdRP and an          essential transcription factor of L        In          RSV optimal transcription although not replication          additionally requires the transcription antitermination          protein M     In addition cellular actin and to          a lesser extent profilin are also required for viral          transcription               The overall steps of a NNR viral macromolecular          synthesis in the infected cell are relevant for this          paper and are briefly described here     The L          protein is believed to encode the basic RNA          polymerization function and binds to the viral promoter          at the  end of the genomic RNA to initiate          transcription However the P protein is essential for          the RdRP holoenzyme to exit the promoter and to form a          closed complex that is capable of sustained elongation              The preformed RdRP brought in by the infecting          viral nucleocapsids catalyzes the first rounds of          transcription known as primary transcription In its          transcription mode the viral RdRP starts and stops at          the beginning and end respectively of each viral gene          and this results in the synthesis of individual gene          mRNAs Unlike the fulllength genomic and antigenomic          RNA the mRNAs are capped polyadenylated and do          not bind N protein Translation of these mRNAs results in                    de novo synthesis of viral          proteins The availability of large quantities of N          protein then allows encapsidation of nascent leader RNA          by N This leads to the switching of the RdRP to the          replication mode resulting in the synthesis of          fulllength encapsidated antigenomic RNA which is in          turn replicated into more genomic RNA     Thus the          very requirement of N for replication ensures that all          fulllength genomic and antigenomic RNA are wrapped with          N protein ie encapsidated     The new pool of          replicated genomic RNA serves as templates for secondary          transcription It should be obvious from the foregoing          that the           de novo macromolecular synthesis          accounts for the major burst of viral protein and RNA in          the infected cell Specifically if the           de novo synthesis of the essential          subunits of viral RdRP  such as L or P  is inhibited          it will abolish the bulk of viral transcription and          replication and hence viral translation              To test the effectiveness of the antiP dsRNA we          transfected the dsRNA into A cells and infected the          cells with RSV Subsequently the amount of intracellular          P protein was directly monitored by immunoblot analysis          using antiP antibody Results presented in Fig show a          nearly  reduction of P protein using as little as           nM dsRNA Although we have not tested lower amounts of          dsRNA for P the severe loss of P protein at  nM dsRNA          and only a slightly greater loss with higher dsRNA          concentrations Fig  suggest that it may be possible          to cause substantial ablation of P protein at dsRNA          concentrations even below  nM          The phenotypic effect of loss of P was further          examined by measuring progeny viral titer overall viral          protein synthesis and syncytium formation as described          under Materials and Methods Yield of progeny virus in           nM dsRNAtreated cells was found to be reduced by           fold and was reduced by at least  fold at  and           nM dsRNA data not shown           De novo viral protein synthesis was          measured by metabolic labeling with S MetCys followed          by immunoprecipitation As shown in Fig  all viral          proteins detectable in the precipitate were drastically          diminished in the dsRNAtreated cells as would be          expected in the event of a loss of the P protein The          inhibition of viral growth was further reflected in the          essentially complete loss of cell fusion syncytia in          the treated cells Fig  In fact the RSVinfected          antiP dsRNAtreated cells were morphologically          indistinguishable from control uninfected ones even at           days postinfection which was the longest time period          for which they were observed The presence of equal          amounts of actin in all the samples confirmed that the          observed inhibition of viral proteins is not due to a          general degradation of proteins          The specificity of dsRNA activity was further tested          by using a dsRNA against cellular lamin AC that was          earlier shown to specifically abrogate lamin AC          synthesis in a variety of cultured cell lines     As          shown in Fig lane La the antilamin dsRNA while          abrogating lamin protein data not shown had no effect          on RSV protein synthesis Furthermore a mismatched          antiP dsRNA in which the lowercase AU base pair see          the dsRNA sequences in Materials and Methods was altered          to a GC pair also failed to inhibit viral translation          data not shown confirming that a perfect match is          needed for the dsRNA effect hence its extreme          specificity of action                          Lack of syncytium in RSVinfected cells treated          with antiF dsRNA          Fusion of the infected cells is a hallmark of all          Paramyxoviruses including RSV as also in some other          viruses such as HIV and the resultant mass of fused          cells is referred as a syncytium from which respiratory          syncytial virus derives its middle name The fusion          protein F is by far the most important viral glycoprotein          that is central to the cell fusion activity              Since the P and F proteins have such diverse roles in          viral life cycle we decided to investigate the effect of          dsRNA on F as a second test gene and also to compare and          contrast the two respective phenotypes          First to test the effectiveness of the antiF dsRNA          intracellularly we probed the infected cell monolayer          with antiF antibody by indirect immunofluorescence Fig           Results clearly demonstrated the abundant synthesis          of F protein as cytoplasmic fluorescence in cells that          were not treated with dsRNA the nuclei of the same cells          could be visualized by staining with DAPI In contrast          cells treated with just  nM antiF dsRNA showed a          substantial loss of F stain At  nM dsRNA F protein          was undetectable          Second immunoblot analysis Fig  top panel          revealed that antiF dsRNA at concentrations as low as           nM produced a severe reduction in F protein levels          Again no effect was seen on cellular profilin ruling          out a general protein loss The antiF dsRNA also had no          effect on P protein levels suggesting that such dsRNAs          do not activate a general antiviral response that might          abrogate all viral mRNA translation This was further          corroborated by the direct measurement of           de novo viral protein synthesis by          metabolic labeling Fig  bottom panel Results showed          that the synthesis of F only was affected while all other          viral proteins were translated in normal amounts which          is in agreement with the notion that F has little or no          role in intracellular viral macromolecular synthesis          Finally the phenotype of F protein loss was tested by          examining syncytia formation and as presented in Fig           no syncytia could be discerned in antiF dsRNAtreated          cells Panel B However a cytopathic effect was still          visible which is most likely the result of intracellular          replication of the virus This demonstrates an          interesting contrast with the antiP dsRNA Panel C          which inhibited all viral gene expression and therefore          the resultant monolayer exhibited essentially the same          appearance as the uninfected one Panel D          Direct measurement of intracellular F mRNA by          semiquantitative RTPCR showed a nearly fold loss          caused by antiF dsRNA Fig  top panel Similar          RTPCR of viral genomic RNA viral P mRNA or cellular          actin mRNA revealed essentially no reduction suggesting          that the dsRNA did not activate a general antiviral          response and did not directly target genomic RNA          Together these results directly demonstrate that the          dsRNAs promote ablation of the specific mRNA target          which most likely underlies the loss of the respective          proteins                          AntiRSV dsRNAs do not activate an interferon          response          As mentioned before cytoplasmic dsRNA can trigger a          series of signaling reactions that lead to interferon          IFN synthesis      In the interferon response          dsRNA molecules activate protein kinase PKR and          oligonucleotide synthetase One of the effects of          PKR is to phosphorylate the  subunit of the general          translation initiation factor eIF which constitutes a          major mechanism for global translation arrest The           oligonucleotide synthetase activates RNase L that in          turn catalyses nonspecific degradation of mRNA Since          NNR viruses coopt the cellular translation machinery          the interferon response thus causes severe inhibition of          viral translation Interestingly the IFN response          requires long dsRNA      and it has been conjectured          that the improved specificity of the nucleotide long          dsRNA in cultured mammalian cells is probably due to          their inability to activate the IFN response     We          provide several lines of direct and indirect evidence          that the dsRNAs described here did not activate a general          IFN response First the inhibitory effect of each dsRNA          was genespecific Figs    Second growth of VSV          is known to be highly sensitive to IFN however its          replication in A cells was not affected by any of the          dsRNAs described here data not shown Lastly elevated          phosphorylation of eIF has been used as a diagnostic          marker of IFN response     We therefore examined          the phosphorylation status of eIF in A cells          following transfection with these dsRNAs Results Fig           bottom panel showed no increase in phosphorylation          In positive controls A cell treated with calcium          mobilizers thapsigargin or A did increase eIF          phosphorylation as has been shown earlier     These          results provide the first direct evidence that the nt          long doublestranded siRNAs fail to trigger interferon          response in mammalian cells and hence can be used as          specific antiviral agents                            Discussion        In this communication we establish nucleotide long        doublestranded interfering RNA as a viable tool to ablate        specific cytoplasmic RNAs as exemplified by the mRNAs of a        RNA virus The major findings are i The ablation is        highly efficient nanomolar concentrations of dsRNA can        lead to a  fold reduction of the corresponding        protein The two RSV mRNAs that we have targeted here        namely P and F are relatively abundant viral mRNAs In        fact they respectively represent the  thand  thmost        abundant viral mRNAs in the infected cell Thus we predict        that an even lower concentration of dsRNA perhaps in the        subnanomolar range might be able to destroy NNR viral        mRNAs that are rarer such as those of RSV M and L        proteins This is currently being tested It is to be noted        that a chemical is generally considered a promising        pharmaceutical if it is effective at submicromolar        concentrations ii The effect is highly specific dsRNA        against one viral mRNA did not affect other viral mRNAs or        the cellular genes tested here In this regard dsRNA        generally surpasses the standard antisense technology based        on oligodeoxynucleotides ODNs whose specificity has        often been debated Moreover since the most potent        antisense ODNs rely on the degradation of target RNA by        RNase H     which is a predominantly nuclear enzyme        this mechanism is not available to RNA viruses that are        strictly cytoplasmic iii Lack of interferon response We        provide direct experimental evidence that the nt dsRNA        does not trigger an IFN response which is an advantage        because an IFN response would have caused a general and        nonspecific inhibition of all capdependent translation            iv Regulation any time Although we have not tested        this specifically one can in principle transfect the        virusinfected cell with dsRNA at any time point during        infection This will allow ablation of a specific protein        at different times in infection and allow one to determine        if the same mutation may have early and late phenotypes        In addition this will allow mutational analysis of        essential genes genetic deletion of which may result in a        nonviable virus In this regard the dsRNA technique is        akin to a temperatureshift experiment using a        temperaturesensitive mutant virus however as implied        earlier conditional lethal mutations are not available for        the vast majority of viral genes v Ease of use The        dsRNA approach is relatively simple to design and its        application in cell culture only requires the standard        transfection technology that already exists vi Multiple        targets It is also possible to deplete multiple cellular        or viral gene mRNAs in any combination either        simultaneously or in a temporal order and thus ask        questions about the interaction between the phenotypes        vii Normal infection environment As we have contended a        major benefit of this approach in viral reverse genetics is        that one can start with standard wild type virus or even a        relatively uncharacterized field isolate with no        requirements of recombinant expression and thus the        cellular milieu is only minimally perturbed if at all        Lastly the lack of effect of the antiF dsRNA on viral        genome replication deserves special attention As described        earlier in the beginning of the Results section        intracellular NNR viral replication generates both        negative and positivestrand fulllength genomic RNA each        of which should find complementarity to the appropriate        strand of the antiF dsRNA In general genomelength RNAs        of both positive and negative sense could therefore be        potential targets for RNA interference resulting in severe        inhibition of replication We speculate that the genomic        and antigenomic RNA of NNR viruses escape the onslaught of        dsRNA because they are tightly wrapped with the        nucleocapsid protein N which makes them inaccessible to        the dsRNA andor the RNAi silencing complex RISC As        mentioned before the Nencapsidated genomelength RNAs are        indeed extremely resistant to nucleases to the extent that        formation of such nucleaseresistant RNA products is in        fact considered a defining criterion for viral replication         in vitro and         in vivo     While the resistance        of the viral genomic RNA to dsRNA has important        ramifications for antiviral therapy it is also clear that        the dsRNA approach cannot be used against         cis acting NNR viral genomic        sequences such as the intergenic regions for which the        cDNAbased approach will continue to be the method of        choice     It is obvious that a creative combination        of the two techniques will lead to exciting possibilities        in the reverse genetics of RNA viruses and in the antiviral        regimen                    Conclusions        Properly designed synthetic nucleotide long        doublestranded RNA dsRNA molecules can effectively and        specifically abrogate translation of target RNAs without        activating a general interferon response When applied        against mRNAs of cytoplasmic RNA viruses the dsRNAs caused        degradation of the specific viral mRNA and resultant        ablation of the specific viral protein The technique is        quick simple and can be used against wild type RNA        viruses in standard tissue culture at any point in the        infection cycle Posttranscriptional gene silencing by        such dsRNA molecules should facilitate the reverse genetics        and functional genomics of RNA genomes                    Materials and methods                  Doublestranded RNA          The following dsRNA sequences with dT extensions          were synthesized against RSV P RSV F and cellular lamin          AC mRNA sequences Accession numbers Ml M and          X respectively following the design          recommendations of Tuschl and coworkers              P  CGAUAAUAUaACUGCAAGATT            TTGCUAUUAUAuUGACGUUCU           F  UGCUGUAACAGAAUUGCAGTT            TTACGACAUUGUCUUAACGUC           Lamin  CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACATT
