                    Background                  Significance          Except for small unpublished pilot work by Smith N               this investigation is the first to assess and          compare the Galinstaninglass thermometer device in          humans A true need exists to compare this mercury          substitute thermometer with the mercury device This need          is especially critical because these lowtech mercury          free devices are ideal additions to hazardous materials          HAZMAT units emergency and law enforcement          vehicles                            Methods                  Sample and Setting          A convenience sample N   of adult inpatients in          a rural pacific northwest accredited hospital and medical          center was obtained Participants were Englishspeaking          currently hospitalized men and women who were at least           years of age mentally competent and willing to          participate Participants had palpable femoral pulses and          competent rectums Oral temperature assessments occurred            minutes post oral foodfluids     This was          assessed by asking participants when did you last eat          or drink anything Data collection took place from          August to October                           Human Subjects          In addition to Oregon Health  Science University          approval IRB approval was also obtained through the          active medical center review board All participants          signed informed consent documents prior to data          collection A copy of the consent form was given to          participants immediately following written consent A          copy of all temperature data was handed to participants          after their temperatures were assessed                          General Procedures          All temperature measurement devices were assessed for          accuracy prior to study use A swirling water bath was          used with identified temperature levels and controls          consistent with procedures used by previous researchers                        An ASTM mercuryinglass thermometer with traceable          certification of accuracy against NIST standards was          used to assess water bath temperatures All devices used          read within  F at three different temperature          settings range between   F An ambient          temperature thermometer with NIST traceable certificate          of compliance was also used A countup timer for precise          time intervals was employed                          Instruments          Temperatures were simultaneously measured at two oral          and four skin sites immediately followed by rectal          sites Four each individual sheathed mercuryinglass          and Galinstaninglass thermometers were used for these          temperature measurements Environmental air temperature          was recorded All temperature readings were reported in          degrees Fahrenheit An equal dwell time of ten minutes          was used for each measurement to control time as a factor          affecting instruments and sites                            Between use thermometers were cleaned as follows           Cool soap and water bath with twominute agitation          and cold rinse times three           Soak in  mixture of bleachwater minimum of           hours followed by cool soap and water bath with two          minute agitation and cold rinse       The          Australian Resuscitation Council has accepted that bleach          can be used for cleansing of resuscitation equipment                        Soak in full strength isopropyl alcohol minimum of           hours followed by cold water rinse times two           Dry on clean dry towel                          Procedure          The principal investigator and a trained research          assistant performed all procedures Right and left          readings for oral temperature oral axillary          temperature axilla groin temperature groin and          rectal temperature rectal were taken using sheathed          oralskin mercuryinglass thermometers and sheathed          rectal or oralskin or rectal Galinstaninglass          thermometers respectively Participants were instructed          beforehand to keep lips closed once oral thermometers          were in place Rightleft device type locations for oral          axilla and groin were random           Oral readings were simultaneous Galinstan on one          side mercury on the other bilateral measures at the          location of the sublingual artery pocket of tissue at          the base of the tongue just above the sublingual artery                         Axillary readings were simultaneous mercury on one          side Galinstan on the other bilateral measures deep          into midaxilla apex       with clients arms          adducted Axillary and groin site thermometers were          placed immediately after placement of oral           Groin readings were simultaneous Galinstan on one          side mercury on the other bilateral at the location of          the femoral artery The technique for          groinfemoralinguinal temperature readings involved          gentle slight abduction of the patients leg location of          the femoral pulse placement of the sheathed thermometer          on and lateral to the pulse site and slight adducting of          the leg to create a seal                Technique for rectal included two sheathed          thermometers one mercury one Galinstan with          watersoluble lubrication inserted together to a depth          of five cms       Once the rectal thermometers          were inserted the principal investigators gloved thumb          and forefinger held the top safety grip on the mercury          and top  cm of the  cm long Galinstan All          thermometers began at a reading below F This reading          was chosen because the mercuryinglass thermometers were          not calibrated below F Prior to recording both          observers agreed upon all measurement readings          Upon completion of temperature assessments the room          temperature was assessed and recorded and the patient was          returned to a comfortable resting position A carbon          copy of temperature readings was given to each          participant                            Results                  Description of Sample          Although  individuals participated in this study          not all paired readings were possible for all          participants because mercuryinglass thermometers were          calibrated only as low as  degrees F When temperature          readings fell below this level no evaluation could be          recorded and thus paired readings and difference scores          were not possible          Participants averaged  years old SD  and           pounds SD  they were  female Eightyfive          percent selfreported as having a White racial heritage          NativeAmerican was the second most commonly reported          racial heritage at  followed by Hispanic  Asian           and Black  These percentages are consistent          with the racial mix within this rural community More          females than males volunteered as research participants          see Table                           Comparing temperature sites          For both the mercuryinglass and Galinstaninglass          thermometers temperature readings by site were as          follows R  O  Skin axilla and groin That is          withinsubject temperature assessments were highest          rectally followed by oral and then groin or axillary          skin sites This result was as expected                          To examine samedevice temperature reading differences          across body sites mean difference scores were calculated          along with standard deviations see Table                           Comparing temperature devices          See Table for a description of within site          differences between the two devices          As suggested by Bland and Altman    to further          examine variability of mean temperature differences          between devices a box plot diagram was formulated see          Figure  The question is Do measurements from          different devices sufficiently agree and how different          are the two methods     Thus a scatter plot of          devices by site was devised see Figure  followed by          plots of the difference between devices by site against          their means see Figures   and  According to          Bland and Altman    this method of plotting          differences  allows us to investigate any possible          relationship between the measurement error and the true          value We do not know the true value and the mean of the           measurements is the best estimate we have p                    Further examination of differences included          repeatability analyses If differences were normally          distributed the expectation was that  of all sample          means of differences based on this sample would fall          within this confidence interval An analysis of the          limits of agreement was computed based on the mean and          two standard deviations precision of the difference          between devices by sites     According to Gardner          and Altman    confidence intervals are a more useful          and informative approach than P values because they          present a range of values For confidence intervals of          difference scores see Table  However caution is          expressed due to the skewed histograms of difference          scores Thus the assumption of Normality may be invalid                        Correlation is a quantification of the linear          relationship between variables and does not examine the          question of agreement Often used to analyze thermometer          reading accuracy correlation is an estimate of how much          two variables change in relation to one another Perfect          correlation does not mean perfect agreement              Altman and Bland    identified this as a favorite          approach to the comparison of two methods of measurement          Therefore correlation statistics were established for          the purpose of literature comparisons Furthermore human          body within and between site agreement cannot be assumed          Thus relationships between and among variables are          represented with a correlation table see Table           No statistically significant correlations were found          between difference scores and mean temperatures at each          site That is variability of difference scores was not          correlated with lower or higher temperature readings                          Comparing demographic variables          No statistically significant correlations were found          for temperature readings and variables such as gender          weight random rightleft placement of devices oral          axilla groin and room temperature          Race significantly correlated with age and mean          temperature readings for each site Age correlated          significantly and negatively the higher the age the          lower the weight with weight and race nonwhites tended          to be younger as well as oral axillary and rectal          mean temperature readings the higher the age the lower          the reading                            Discussion                  Discussion of site comparisons Contradictions to          the one degree Fahrenheit rule          Tradition has dictated to lay and professional          caregivers the one degree Fahrenheit rule Many remember          learning about the one degree Fahrenheit estimated          difference rectal site temperatures are about one degree          higher than oral which is about one degree higher than          axillary sites As noted in Table  this estimate rule          could not be applied to either device For the          mercuryinglass device rectal was F higher than          oral which was F higher than groinaxillary sites          Rectal readings were only about one degree Fahrenheit          higher than skin sites not two degrees as the rule          would imply          Importantly the Galinstaninglass readings also          represented site differences that were different from the          onedegree rule Though rectal site temperature          assessments were slightly less than one degree higher          than oral F above oral skin sites were only about          F below rectal readings not the expected two degree          estimate                          Discussion of device comparisons          When comparing withinsubject mean differences between          the two lowtech temperature devices BD mercury and          Geratherm Galinstan the smallest differences occurred          at the rectal site the largest differences were recorded          at skin sites Skin site variability concurs with          findings from other studies       Skin          temperature sites by their very nature have innate          differences even with simultaneous sidetoside use and          identical dwell times Macro and microcirculation fatty          layers muscle mass and skin pockets may differ          bilaterally Unless the same site and time are measured          body temperature gradients become confounding factors              As expected simultaneous insertion of both          thermometers into the moist and protected rectal cavity          created a near identical temperature reading match          Prior to data collection thermometers were swirling          waterbath tested and those with readings greater than           F from water temperature were eliminated from the          study Thus difference scores at or less than this          measure can be deemed to be clinically insignificant As          noted in Table  only axillary readings had a difference          mean of greater than F and this mean difference was          F All mean difference scores were less than the          described C level reported by Fallis and Christiani             to be clinically significant Mean difference scores          were also less than the F deemed clinically          insignificant by authors Stephen and Sexton    and          C deemed clinically insignificant by Fulbrook             when he compared axillary and pulmonary artery          temperature readings All but the axillary mean          difference scores were at or below the F accepted          variability for inclusion of human temperature assessment          devices in clinical investigations                 Variability among mean difference scores was assessed          in several ways A box plot showing mean temperature          reading differences and variability between          mercuryinglass and Galinstaninglass devices at four          sites was constructed see Figure           Standard deviations were identified for difference          scores by site Table  along with a  confidence          interval of the mean of difference readings between          devices see Table  The greatest variability between          device readings by site occurred at the two skin sites          This greater variability at skin sites corresponds to          findings from other researchers                Ninetyfive percent confidence intervals for the mean of          difference readings were smallest at the rectal site and          largest at the groin skin site          Correlations between the two thermometer types by site          were strong and statistically significant The strongest          correlations were again as expected at the rectal and          oral temperature sites Human body asymmetry must be          considered as a possible variable for groin and axilla          sites Room temperature was not a significant variable          This result is different from the work of other          researchers who found that ambient temperatures          significantly affected readings at various sites in          infants    and various temperature levels in adults                                       Discussion of demographic variables          With these study participants the fairly          insignificant role played by gender differs from the work          of Nagy     Nichols and Kucha    and Gillum              In contrast race was a significant variable for this          study Nonwhites were more likely to be younger and have          higher temperature readings at each site and with each          device Because subjects were all inpatients in an          acutecare hospital setting and the number of nonwhite          subjects was small N    of total no conclusions          should be made regarding this finding However the          influence of race concurs with other investigations               race may have a significant influence on body          temperatures and needs to be studied further Though the          variable of weight was insignificant age remained an          important factor for temperature readings both devices          at the oral axillary and rectal sites The greater the          age the lower the temperature readings This finding is          consistent with the work of Frankenfield et al             and Howell                                Conclusions        For both mercury and Galinstan glass thermometers        rectal readings were higher than oral and oral readings        were higher than skin site temperature assessments This        finding further verifies similarities between mercury and        Galinstan and remains consistent with findings from other        studies               Mercuryinglass fever thermometers are no longer        available in many regions of the US and world For this        study and with these hospitalised participants the        mercuryfree Galinstaninglass thermometer correlated        strongly with the mercury thermometer and may be a        practical alternative to mercury filled thermometer        products        For adults and with careful consideration of site        differences and site competence temperature sites to be        considered include all investigated sites  rectal oral        axillary and groin With proper use noninvasive        nonmucus temperature sites may be safe alternatives to        more invasive less acceptable sites        Limitations of the study include an unblinded        convenience sample of hospitalised patients although        participants demonstrated a wide range of age weight and        temperature readings A further limitation is the small        number of nonwhite participants and the greater number by        percent of female and older volunteers                    Implications                  Further Research          Study findings draw attention to needed areas of          research for better understanding of the influence of          variables such as device site race and age on body          temperature assessments Because comparisons of lowtech          Galinstaninglass and mercuryinglass body temperature          devices are not well described in the literature it will          be essential to replicate this study for comparison of          bias and  CI of the bias between these two devices by          site The recording of temperatures using all four sites          over time with a sample of ill and well individuals          would add to knowledge of how different variables affect          temperature readings          The issue of race must be addressed as a potential          body temperature variable Furthermore age as          identified in this study may be a critically important          indicator relative to how healthcare professionals define          and treat body temperature alterations The groin          temperature site though demonstrating greater mean          difference variability and not well studied in adults          may be a good alternative to rectal site temperature          assessment This conclusion however cannot be made          without further investigation          Use and study of lowtech Galinstaninglass          thermometers during biological epidemics would provide          additional information regarding the practical          application and efficacy of this device during times of          extreme international need                            List of abbreviations        Oral temperature site Oral        Axillary
