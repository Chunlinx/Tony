                                 DOA            Among the last budget issuessettled by the president and Congress this week was the extension of federalhealth insurance to uncovered children Although the two branches were stillsquabbling over the details at weeks end they agreed to establish a billion program financed by a  cent hike in the tobacco tax            The most surprising thingabout the deal is that it comes three years after the Republican defeat ofClintons health care reform plan took the issue off the table Fulldisclosure I was a Clinton health care policy adviser from  to  HillRepublicans began warming to the idea of expanding health care coverage in when Sen Nancy Kassebaum and Sen Ted Kennedy proposed a measure thatwould ban insurers from excluding preexisting conditions and dropping coveragewhen people changed jobs The bill passed in  and as the roaring economyfilled government coffers with revenues conservative Sen Orrin Hatch teamedwith Kennedy in the spring of  to cosponsor his insuranceforkidsprogram            Onereason the Republicans agreed to the deal was that it appealed strongly towomen not a natural GOP constituency Another is that insuring children ismuch cheaper than insuring adults            But the success of the program will ride on the detailswhich remain unclear Of the  million people in the United States who donthave health insurance  million are children Ninetenths of these childrenhave parents who work and twothirds of them have parents who work full timeAbout a third of the uninsured children hail from families with incomes belowthe poverty line roughly  for a family of four Another third are fromfamilies between  and  percent of poverty earning between  and and the last third from families that earn more            For the poorest kids thestaterun insurance program Medicaid helps In  Congress required Medicaidto phase in coverage of all children below the poverty line along with ahodgepodge of other kids by  As of  all impoverished children underage  qualify But about  million of them havent been signed up All of thenew proposals include  million for aggressive outreach            Despite the offer of matchingfederal dollars many states dont try to cover more children Only RhodeIsland Vermont Minnesota Hawaii and Washington subsidize coverage forchildren up to  percent of poverty or more            Congresscould have filled the gap by ordering the states to cover uninsured kids to thehigher income level But given the current deference to states this was neverseriously considered Another option would have been for the federal governmentto cover poor and uninsured kids with a program like Medicare but this was waytoo radical for Republican contemplation            Instead Washington agreed to dispense billion in block grants to help the states insure children But will the statesspend all the money on insurance for children Its not clear The Senatewanted rules that would prevent governors from substituting the federal moneyfor existing state spending But the governors convinced House Republicans tonegotiate for looser guidelines that let the states pay for unpaid emergencyroom and hospital billswhich the states already coverout of the blockgrants The final budget deal allows states to divert up to  percent ofchildinsurance funds to these other purposes            In the budget negotiationsnearly everyone agreed on providing health insurance at low or no cost touninsured children whose family incomes dip below  percent of poverty Morecontentious was what the insurance would actually cover House Republicanswanted skimpy coverage while Senate Republicans and the White House wantedcoverage at least as good as the highquality benefits enjoyed by federalemployees            To holdcosts down the  billion program doesnt cover kids who are currentlyinsured This of course is a formula for failure If the government givesinexpensive firstclass insurance to the uninsured children of lowwagefamilies lowwage families enrolled in lousy insurance programs will rightlyfeel cheated Many insured families have inadequate child benefits excessivecosts or periods without coverage To make matters worse many employerslooking to save money and please their employees will drop dependent benefitsif states provide better coverage than the private plans now do            What should the government do If the primary goal is tomake certain that families with uninsured children have a fallback then weshould keep the program cheap and cover just the services children dont getwithout insurancelike physician and preventive services Such safetynetinsurance could provide good outpatient coverage and minimal hospital coverageThis scheme is far from perfect but uninsured kids already get the hospitalcare they need when theyre sick because hospitals pass unpaid costs along tostates and private insurers            But if the primary goal is afuture where all children are well covered Congress should stick with theSenates broad insurance benefits but open the program to all childrenbelow  percent of povertyeven the currently insured Because the newbudgets  billion is only enough to cover  million children a moreambitious program that covered all of the uninsured and underinsured childrenin the nation would cost much much more            The budgetnegotiators essentially punted on the issue The plan gives states some murkycoverage options and rules limiting the program to the currently uninsured            Many will decide on safetynet child coverageIt would assist millions although a working family earning  still couldface huge hospital bills that they will have to renege on Other states willchoose comprehensive benefits restricted to the uninsured To discourageemployers from simply dropping coverage the recently uninsured cannot becovered Families and employers paying more for less insurance will yell andscream Support will wither And states will scale back benefits            Alternatively states withthe best child benefits may go ahead and let the poorly insured switch to theprogram Lowwage workers will flock to the program and federal money will runout States will come begging Then Congress must either ante up or shut off apopular new workingclass benefit            Who said health care reformis dead Congress may be unwittingly creating the thin edge of the wedge thatbrings major health care reform for children
