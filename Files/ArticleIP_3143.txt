                                 Goldhagens Willing Executioners            Last year while browsing atone of those sadly disappearing Upper West Side bookstores I ran into NormanFinkelstein a member of the sadly disappearing tribe of leftwing gadfliesFinkelstein said he was working on a book about Harvard Professor Daniel JonahGoldhagens Hitlers Willing Executioners Ordinary Germans and theHolocaust  Goldhagen he declared was a fraud crying out to beunmasked            Thiswasnt surprising Goldhagen made a lot of people angry with that bookClick here for a quick refresher on why Finkelstein a politicalscientist bills himself a forensic scholar Hes fashioned a career out ofdemystifying what he deems pseudoscholarly arguments It also made a kind ofpoetic sense that Finkelstein would become obsessed with Goldhagen Like himFinkelstein is the son of Holocaust survivors and a strident commentator onJewish affairs He just comes at them from the opposing side            Finkelsteins reputation rests on his refutation of JoanPeters  From Time Immemorial  a book purporting to provePalestinian Arabs had no claims on the land that is now Israel having beendrawn to it only by reports that Jews were making the desert bloom Petersbook was lavishly praised by American Jewish organizations novelists andscholars But when Finkelstein showed that Peters had manipulated Ottomandemographic records to make her case the books supporters attacked him as anantiZionist By  though Zionist scholars having published articles thatbolstered Finkelsteins case his version was the conventional wisdom            Finkelstein told me Goldhagen was just another Peters That struck me asdubious After all Goldhagens book wasnt a hoax It was a troublinginterpretation But Finkelstein insisted that whatever the reviewers said thebook had been a megapublishing event and for one simple reason It was usefulto Zionist Jews who believe that all nonJews are potential Jew killers andthat Jews therefore are justified in using whatever means are necessary todefend themselves            Calling Goldhagen a Zionist propagandist seemedan act of provocation to say the least and so it was taken Last summerFinkelstein published an article with the lurid title Daniel Jonah GoldhagensCrazy Thesis in the British New Left Review  Shortly afterward itwas excerpted in the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and in ItalysPanorama  Goldhagen promptly denounced Finkelstein as asupporter of Hamas a radical Islamic Palestinian group MetropolitanBooks an imprint of Holt decided to publish a revised version ofFinkelsteins essay along with a no less hotly contested attack on Goldhagenby the Germanborn historian Ruth Bettina Birn that was first published in theCambridge Historical Journal             Severalmonths before the publication of Finkelstein and Birns book A Nation onTrial The Goldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth  Finkelsteins opponentspressured Metropolitan to cancel it Leon Wieseltier the literary editor ofthe New Republic  got on the phone with his friend Michael Naumann thepublisher of Holt and a German to express his outrageThe AntiDefamation Leagues Abraham Foxman wrote to Finkelsteins editor SaraBershtel calling the writers views beyond the pale            Finkelsteins coauthor took even worse flak Goldhagenaccused her of having defamed him in her Historical Journal articlethen assembled a team of lawyers in Britain to demand a retraction and anapology In Canada the Canadian Jewish Congress is trying to have Birn removedfrom the governments war crimes division where she helps build cases againstNazi war criminals on the grounds that by publishing with Finkelstein shehas demonstrated insensitivity unbecoming a public servant            Theprepublication attack almost worked Istvn Dek a Columbia Universityhistorian who agreed to write a preface backed out He didprovide a blurb as did seven other distinguished academics including theHolocaust experts Raul Hilberg and Christopher Browning the French Jewishintellectual Pierre VidalNaquet and the eminent Marxist historian EricHobsbawm Click here to read what some of them say and here to read why they say it Now that the book is out thegrand irony is that Goldhagen should consider himself lucky to have Finkelsteinas his adversary Not that it isnt a good dissection of Goldhagenscontradictions and distortions Finkelstein handily refutes Goldhagens claimthat German antiSemitism is all thats required to explain the HolocaustClick here to read how he does this Checking Goldhagens assertionsagainst his citations Finkelstein demonstrates that the scholars use ofsecondary sources is untrustworthy Click here for anothertelling example And yet Finkelstein turns out to be a kind of doppelgnger ofGoldhagens equally biased and inflammatory            First Finkelstein makes much of the point thatthe majority of Germans did not cast their lot for Hitler Technicallytruebut a plurality of Germans did No party received as many votes in theMarch  election as the Nazis percent Finkelstein acknowledges theNazi state was a brutal dictatorship but he glosses over its disturbinglypopular character            SecondFinkelstein echoes conventional historical thinking when he says Nazisms mainappeal lay in Hitlers promises to restore order in postWeimar Germany endunemployment and make the country an international power But antiSemitismpermeated Nazi ideology and Finkelstein is deaf to its nuances He writesNot the Jews but Marxism and Social Democracy served as the prime scapegoatsof Nazi propaganda during their rise to power Also technically true But theNazis perceived Social Democracy as a Jewish party and Marxism as a Jewishcreed when they rallied against Bolshevik enemies their audiences did notneed to be told that these enemies were if not actual Jews then spiritualJews If Finkelstein were to apply his logic to Lee Atwaters Willie Hortonstrategy hed have to write Not race but crime served as the prime scapegoatof George Bushs  campaign            Third Finkelstein deduces from some Germans disgust atthe destruction of Jewish lives and property during Nazisponsored pogroms suchas Kristallnacht that Germans overwhelmingly condemned the NaziantiSemitic atrocities If they did they gave new meaning to the termsilent majority The Germans he writes displayed the callousness towardhuman life typically attending war  Hardened and bitter in search of ascapegoat they occasionally lashed out at the weak The first adverb casuallybanalizes German brutality the second diminishes its extent together theycome dangerously close to apologia            The mostcontroversial part of Finkelsteins book though is the last chapter in whichhe sets out to explain why the Goldhagen book was such a big deal Finkelsteinobserves that after the  ArabIsraeli War there was a boom in the kind ofHolocaust literature that portrayed the catastrophe as the natural culminationof millennial Jewhatred Where some Holocaust experts such as Hilberg andMartin Broszat depicted it as a complex and contingent event other writerssuch as Lucy Davidowicz found it more politically expedient to focus onantiSemitism especially as Israel came under increasing censure Clickhere for Finkelsteins explanation of why this logic isexpedient According to Finkelstein Goldhagens claim that all forms ofantiSemitism tend toward a genocidal solution  is expedient in this wayand therefore popularthough Finkelstein says Goldhagen adds no more than aveneer of social science sophistication to this reductionist point of view            Finkelstein is not breaking new ground hereIsraeli intellectuals such as Amos Elon and Tom Segev and the Holocausthistorian Omer Bartov have made similar points about ideologicalsubtext of Holocaust writing But they also take pains not to dismiss thetrauma the Holocaust visited and continues to visit upon Jews By contrastFinkelstein adopts an ugly conspiratorial tone when he attributes the bookspopularity in the United States to its Zionist message This is nonsense Thebook owed its commercial success to its soothingly simplistic thesisand toastute marketing At times Finkelsteins tone even veers toward the jocularas when he makes fun of Elie Wiesels racist remarks about ungrateful blackpeople One is reminded of Gershom Scholems remark to Hannah Arendt at thetime of Eichmann in Jerusalem  This is not the way to approach thescene of that tragedy            Its too bad that the noiseabout Finkelstein has drowned out his cowriter Birn She knows the archivesbetter than anyone and she has come up with more quietly damning observationsBirns experience as a prosecutor gives her a radically different take on thelegal testimony Goldhagen bases much of his book on for the most partconfessions of death squad members Goldhagen seems to have difficultycomprehending that when perpetrators claim to have been motivated by Nazipropaganda it need not be sincere she writes Click here to see how these statements could instead form part of alegal defense Birn also shows how Goldhagens insistence on German complicityleads him to softpedal the antiSemitism of the Germans collaboratorsreferring obliquely to the pressures operating on the Ukrainians that did notexist for the Germans This is flatout Eastern European revisionism youcould easily imagine some Ukrainian nationalist writing it            But theweightiest of Birns accusations is that Goldhagen glosses over atrocities inwhich the victims werent Jewish Goldhagen recounts the tale of a witness whosaw a Russian man beaten to death because his name was Abraham he does notreport the same witnesss account on the next page of testimony of thesexually sadistic murder of a young nonJewish girl by one of the officersIn the end this may be one of the most compelling condemnations of Goldhagenyet that his focus on Jewish victims leaves him indifferent to the fate ofnonJews from that young girl to the millions of Soviet POWs who were starvedand worked to death in the camps Without minimizing the significance ofantiSemitism Birn provides an eloquent rejoinder to Goldhagensbloodthinking Her essay radiates a dignified humanism that both Goldhagen andFinkelstein lack                           Endnotes                        Note  Holocaust historians have traditionally offered avariety of reasons why Germans followed orders to exterminate the Jews Theseinclude antiSemitism the culture of German military units the pressures oftotalitarian rule the hysteria of wartime mobilization and the effects ofNazi propaganda Goldhagen by contrast offers a singlebullet explanation Heposits a society of ordinary Germans bred like attack dogs to despise Jewsand unleashed by a regime that shared their bloodlust Germanys uniquelyantiSemitic history had in his view made most of them assenting massexecutioners  who considered the slaughter to be just The book had itsdefenders but the reviews were mostly scathing Hitlers WillingExecutioners was dismissed as fundamentally ahistorical inCommentary  of all places and as a bizarre inversion of the Nazi viewof the Jews as an insidious inherently evil nation in the NewRepublic Back            Note  This was an unfair characterization of Finkelsteinsviews on the Oslo accords Like Edward Said who regards the Oslo accords as aPalestinian Versailles he is opposed to them That doesnt make him a Hamassupporter Back            Note  According to Finkelsteins editor Sara Bershtelwho was in Naumanns office at the time and heard Wieseltier on the speakerphone he said Michael you dont know who Finkelstein is Hes poison hesa disgusting selfhating Jew hes something you find under a rock Wieseltiertold me he wasnt trying to silence Finkelstein The idea that anyone istrying to suppress the lonely prophet in the wilderness called Finkelstein iscomical Virtually every scholar has attacked Goldhagens book including Imight add our critic in the New                Republic  Finkelstein is justplaying this game of pater les juifs  Back            Note  Dek who was so impressed by an early draftFinkelstein sent him that he wrote him praising his efforts now says Ididnt read the article very carefully I made the mistake of giving my consenttoo early and then had second thoughts Back            Note  All readers of Goldhagens controversial book should take noteof these muchneeded studies which in line with serious historiansconvincingly and authoritatively dismantle its arguments             EricHobsbawm author of The Age of Extremes A History of the World            In this important volumeFinkelstein and Birn demonstrate that Daniel Goldhagens study of the Judeocideis monocausal teleological and severely blinkered Finkelstein carefully setsforth Goldhagens distortion and disregard of the secondary literature Birnmasterfully lays bare his gravely flawed use and interpretation of archivalsources Both authors also raise hard questions about the political reasons forthe inordinate promotion and reception of Goldhagens book No serious studentof history can afford to ignore these wellreasoned and withering reflectionson the perils of pseudoscholarship             ArnoMayer author of Why Did the Heavens Not Darken The Final Solution inHistory            Finkelstein and Birnprovide a devastating critique of Daniel Goldhagens simplistic and misleadinginterpretation of the Holocaust Their contribution to the debate is in myview indispensable             IanKershaw author of Hitler            Among the dozens ofreviewers of Hitlers Willing Executioners  Ruth Bettina Birn and NormanFinkelstein stand out for the seriousness and thoroughness with which they haveundertaken their task Even if I do not embrace every aspect of Finkelsteinsconclusions concerning the politicization of Holocaust historiography I amgrateful for these writers courageous conscientious and laborintensiveefforts             Christopher Browning author of Ordinary Men Reserve Police Battalion and the Final Solution in Poland            Is Daniel GoldhagensHitlers Willing Executioners the definitive work on Hitlers JudeocideThe authors of this volume express serious doubt which I share To reduce aphenomenon of this scale and complexity to the antiSemitism which permeatedGerman society as it also permeated other societies is to be simplistic and toshow contempt for the reader This book rights the balance             Pierre VidalNaquet author of The Jews History Memory and thePresent            Highly recommended to themany readers of Goldhagens controversial book especially those who weremesmerized by its hypotheses Fortunately in an open society all scholarshipis subject to public scrutiny and the advance of historical knowledge cannotdo without rigorous criticism of the kind provided in this important andcourageous collection             Volker R Berghahn JP Birkelund distinguished professor of Europeanhistory Brown University                        Birns and Finkelsteinsessays constitute a sharp rebuttal provoked by the publics and the pressslove affair with a book that casually dismisses excellent work done by othersthat contains many contradictions and that upholds dangerous myths regardingthe existence of national characteristics              Istvn Dek author of Beyond Nationalism A Social and PoliticalHistory of the Habsburg Officer Corps Back            Note  Christopher Browning told me Whats importantabout Finkelsteins critique is that he has traced the inconsistencies andcontradictions in Goldhagen and no one else has taken the time to do thatIts not my style of writing But I dont think hes gone beyond the bounds ofpolemic in replying to Goldhagens polemic In interviews Holocaust scholarssounded grateful that someone had stood up so boldly to Goldhagen who inHitlers Willing Executioners  had dismissed the work of virtually everyscholar who came before him Two of the blurb writers have quite understandablegrudges Goldhagen has for years been railing against Brownings emphasis onpeer pressure in explaining why German soldiers participated in genocide in aNew                Republic review he accused another endorser Arno Mayer ofbeing a Holocaust revisionist In any event these blurbs often appear to bemore the expressions of wellwishers than of close readers Hobsbawm is notalone in saying he didnt read Finkelsteins essay linebyline Back            Note  Finkelstein notes that antiSemitism in othercountries was often worse there was in preHitler Germany no equivalent ofthe riots that attended the Dreyfus Affair in France or the pogroms in RussiaIn the Weimar period moreover the Nationalist Socialists found they couldntget much mileage out of raw appeals to antiJewish prejudice and often toneddown their antiSemitism around election time Back            Note  Footnoting historian Peter Pulzers sober studyJews and the German State  Goldhagen asserts that only the core of thesocialist movement its intellectuals and leaders opposed antiSemitism Infact Pulzer says no such thing He found little evidence of antiSemitismamong Social Democrats intellectuals or workers Back            Note  Thus interpreted the Nazi extermination bothjustifies the necessity of Israel and accounts for all hostility directed atit The Jewish state is the only safeguard against the next outbreak ofhomicidal antiSemitism and conversely homicidal antiSemitism is behindevery attack on or even defensive maneuver against the Jewish state TheHolocaust is in effect the Zionist account of the Nazi holocaustBack            Note  Among other things they warn against the dangerof removing the Holocaust from history and turning it into a sort of secularreligion the central symbol of Jewish identity They also deplore theinvocation of the Holocaust as a justification for policies that most Jewswould deplore if they were implemented in their own countries Back            Note  Goldhagen asserts the German police battalionsknew of the planned destruction of the Jews before entering the Soviet Unionrather than two months after as most historians believe He bases this claimon the conclusive statement of two former storm troopers In fact theirstatements about extermination orders from above evolved over time Birnexplains as part of a defense focused on superior orders as anexcuseBack
