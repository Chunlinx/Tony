                                 Hollywood Party            The party for the GoldenGlobe nominees was high up in Beverly Hills I had been invited by a woman whohas lived in Los Angeles for almost  years and is now a noted Hollywoodanthropologist As we rounded a turn a pair of big metal gates appeared beforeus Behind them set on the crest of a hill was a large white house in thecontemporary Californian style In front of the gates a dozen or so young menstood around in dark uniforms            I thoughtfor a moment that they were a brass band but they turned out to be the valetparkers I was just realizing why the Californian unemployment rate is so lowwhen a dark Ford Windstar minivan pulled up next to us We climbed in and weredriven approximately  yards to the steps of the house where we got outagain The front door was opened by yet more valets and we were biddeninside            The hosts veteran studio executive Mike Medavoy and hiswife Irina were there to greet us Mike a black Vneck jumper andopennecked shirt covering his ample torso looked like he had just stepped offthe  th green Irina it must be said didnt A striking blondeshe was wearing high heels velvet trousers and a black cardigan that myescort helpfully described as a peekaboo top As I struggled manfully toavoid staring at her cleavage she explained that the house had been built fouryears ago and that she had redecorated it throughout            What shedidnt say understandably was that the house had been built for her husbandsprevious wife Patricia Duff who had used it to throw fundraisers for herpowerful friends in the Democratic Party Then Patricia left Mike and took upwith Ron Perelman the Republicanleaning financier At about the same timethat Mike lost Patricia he also lost his job as head of TriStar Pictures Evenhere where the locals are used to ups and downs of a personal and businessnature that was considered quite a twofer            According to my date the real purpose of theparty was to mark Medavoys return to the big leagues As chairman of thesuitably named Phoenix Pictures he is once more making films including onethat might win an Oscar The People vs Larry Flynt  And in Irina hehas a new wife who while she might not have his exs political clout has justas much glamour and sex appeal            Ifprestige in Hollywood is measured in pulling power then Medavoy is definitelyback on top Looking around the first person I saw was Sean Penn He wasstanding alone in a corner clad in black jeans black Tshirt and blackleather jacket I was thinking what a good job he was doing of playing up tohis image as a brooding misfit when a bathroom door opened next to him and ayearold girl walked out and jumped into his arms He smiled broadly mumbledfatherly nothings into his daughters ear and carried her upstairsHollywoods gone baby my date whispered            Moving further into the house I felt the same sense ofsurprise that I always feel in the presence of movie celebrities surprise thatthey look so familiar Here was James Woods talking a million miles a minuteto Anthony Minghella the director of The English Patient  and appearingfor all the world like he was playing the manic Richard Boyle inSalvador  There was Gabriel Byrne nursing a Heineken every inch thehandsome villain of The Usual Suspects  And here was Jeff Goldblumangular and geeky looking like he had just stepped out of that helicopter inJurassic Park  He was just back from Hawaii where he had been filmingThe Lost World  the sequel to that monster smash            Whats the plot Jeff Iasked casually as if I had known him all my life            Its a big secret hereplied            Oh come on my dateinsisted            Well they tempt me to goback to an island where there are more dinosaurs            What sort of dinosaurs            Stegosaursthe fat ones with ripples on their back            The Medavoys house is beautiful with largeairy rooms and white walls covered with modern art On virtually every surfaceare photographs of the Medavoys with famous people Mike in the Oval Officewith Bill Clinton Mike with Ronald Reagan Mike with Richard Nixon withNelson Mandela with Al Gore with Barbra Streisand with Henry Kissinger Theonly notable absentee was his former wife            In the drawing room we raninto another tall actor James Cromwell who recently appeared in The Peoplevs Larry Flynt  When he heard I was a writer Cromwell told me that he hadjust finished writing a novel            Whats it about Iasked            Contact he replied            Pardon            Contact  the shadow what separates us from our destiny             Contact You mean aliencontact            He nodded            The spaceship in the NewMexico desert and all that You think we have been contacted by life from otherplanets            He nodded again andsaid            YesRegularly Ever since  You just have to look on the Internet There are or  sightings a month            Iwent outside for a drink The stoneflagged veranda wasroughly the size of a baseball diamond and it seemed to overlook the whole ofLos Angeles which was a mosaic of orange and white lights At the bar I foundmyself next to two nondescript youths who were chugging down a couple ofbeers            Youre really popular inEurope man one said to the other            Yeah the English and Frenchreally like me            Japan too            Yeah Japan too Im a bigstar in Japan Ive won lots of awards and shit over there Its reallyweird            My eavesdropping wasinterrupted by a loud cry from inside the house When I got there I foundmyself next to the hostess            What happened sheasked            Somebody ran down the stairson their hands came the answer from the crowd            My Godsomebody ran down the stairs on their hands in my house she shrieked clearlydelighted            The party was now in full swing Belatedly Irealized that a lot of people in the house were foreigners My date explainedthat this is always the case at awards parties these days She said theHollywood studios have largely given up producing serious movies so they haveto rely on Europeans and antipodeans to make films that wont embarrass theindustry when the Oscars come around Unfortunately many members of theacademy have never heard of a lot of these foreign movies so there is an eventevery January called the Golden Globe Awards to tell them what films to watchbefore they vote            Scott Hicks the director ofShine  is one of the beneficiaries of this shift Having just got off ahour flight from Adelaide the longhaired Aussie seemed somewhat bemused byall the fuss Im trying to figure out what it is about Shine thatappeals to people so much he told me I really dont know I asked Hickswhether he was planning to move to Hollywood but he said he was wary ofrepeating the experiences of other young foreign directors who have tried itsuch as Neil Jordan and Mike Figgis They tend to have a huge cockup andleave Hicks said For now he added he was determined to enjoy themoment            So were Alan Parker thedirector of Evita  and Mike Leigh the director of Secrets andLies  When I ran across the two Brits they were knocking back the whitewine and discussing that most English of subjects the class system Parker andLeigh are both selfmade men and supporters of the British Labor Party butParker has worked primarily in Hollywood for almost two decades whereas Leighstayed in London to make his lowbudget films Although they admire eachothers work this was clearly a point of some tension between them            Mike Leigh knows sodallabout the working class Parker said to me apropos of nothing            Fortunately Leigh didnthear that slur I asked him how much money it took to produce Secrets andLies             Threemillion quid he said proudly            By this stage the belle of the ball had finally arrivedCourtney Love who stars in The People vs Larry Flynt  At least I thinkit was Courtney Love To be honest she didnt look anything like the grungesinger I remembered from MTV She was thinner some of her facial featuresappeared to have changed shape her blond hair was curled and she was wearinga beautiful white maxi with a flowered pattern on it I vaguely recalledsomething about her appearing in Vogue recently but this was less afashion makeover and more a transmogrification            I was too frightened toapproach Courtney but Mike Leigh wasnt He walked around in a circleinspecting her as if she were a prize steed            Whats this he askedpointing to a dramatic redandblack tattoo that covered most of her rightshoulder            Oh its from my deathrockphase she replied            The restof the evening is something of a blur to me At some point my date appearedand said it was time to go It was almost midnight which is considered late inLos Angeles On the way out we passed Mike Medavoy He was sitting on thestaircase with Irina on one side of him and Julia Ormond the beautiful Britishactress on the other Way to go Mike
