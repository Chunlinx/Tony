                            Over the last hundred years there have been major triumphs in medicine related to        public health vaccination and the introduction of new medicines However over the same        period several diseases have increased in prevalence andor severity In some cases the        causes of the increase have become obviousthe increases in lung cancer coronary artery        disease and type  diabetes for example are not considered to be a mystery On the other        hand a large group of diseases related broadly to inflammation have also increased For        these a wide range of hypotheses about causation have been proposed Type  diabetes        rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease have increased since   Some        analyses of the increase in hay fever and asthma would suggest a similar time course and        this parallelism of the time frame has been taken to suggest that there could be a common        cause Indeed there is a proposal that these diseases are all related to some changes in        cleanliness or hygiene that have resulted in decreased activation of a common control        mechanism Specifically this control has been ascribed to T regulator cells which produce        interleukin IL or transforming growth factorbeta                    Change in Living Conditions        The major changes in rural areas tropical villages or in Europe pre that could be        related to the change in immune responses include decreases in helminth infection        physical proximity to farm animals  exposure to those mycobacteria that are commonly        found in the soil bifidobacteria colonization of the gut as well as decreased prevalence        of Hepatitis A infection  The implication in each case is that asthma has increased        secondary to an increase in inflammation or an increase of the allergic response that is        closely associated This assumes that hay fever asthma and other diseases have increased        in parallel which is probably not true        Hay fever became a problem in Northern Germany and England as early as  Clear        evidence for this view comes from Noons description of the development of immunotherapy        for hay fever in  the studies on hay fever prevalence by Ratner and Silverman in New        York in  and the recognition that hay fever was a major community problem in New York        in  More recently Harold Nelson analyzed all the studies on hay fever published in        the United States and found a prevalence of  in  with no convincing evidence of an        increase since then H Nelson personal communication        If seasonal hay fever was epidemic in  then the subsequent increase in asthma has        to be seen in a different light The best estimates for the start of the asthma epidemic        are around  for such diverse populations as army recruits in Finland  school        children in Birmingham in the United Kingdom and African American children in Charleston        South Carolina United States  In each of these studies the increase in asthma        symptoms or disease has been greater than tenfold However the absolute values of the        change have been dramatically different in New Zealand and Scotland from  up to         compared with Finland from  to   Furthermore some countries have experienced        much greater increases in hospitalization than others Clear evidence for increases in        mortality has only come from the United Kingdom New Zealand and the United States        countries with a high prevalence of symptoms and hospitalization        Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the increase in asthma Box  At this        point our questions about the increase in asthma are  Is an increase in allergy or hay        fever a necessary precursor for the increase in asthma a parallel event or separate         Why did the increase in asthma have such a consistent time course throughout the Western        world in countries where changes in infectious diseases have occurred very differently and         Why is asthma more common and more severe in some countries than in other countries that        have had an equal scale of increase ie tenfold over the same time course                    The Persistent Association between Specific IgE Total IgE and Asthma        Long before the first case control or prospective study the association between allergy        and asthma was obvious in case series These earlier studies reported skin testing with an        amorphous extract called house dust but it was not until the identification of dust        mites that the association was clarified  Indeed as late as  there were        significant doubts that allergens played a role in asthma Using extracts of         Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus dust mites the strong        association between this allergen and asthma was established in many parts of the world        with odds ratios as high as  or even   The possibility of a causal relationship        was further supported by bronchial challenge studies and avoidance experiments  The        cohort in Poole Dorset was until recently the only study with household measurements of        allergen and the results strongly suggested that exposure in the childs own house was the        primary determinant of sensitization  Subsequently studies from other parts of the        world provided evidence about other indoor allergens particularly cats dogs and the        German cockroach  These studies showed that perennial exposure to allergens was an        important cause of inflammation in the lungs and associated nonspecific bronchial        hyperreactivity Figure  In most of the casecontrol and prospective studies        sensitization to seasonal pollens has not been significantly associated with asthma         This is an important issue if allergy is associated with asthma for genetic reasons or        because of some common immunological feature it is not clear why the association should be        with perennial allergens only        Since assays for total serum IgE became available in the s it has been clear that        patients with asthma have on average higher total IgE than patients with hay fever or no        allergy Indeed by  this was considered an established fact in textbooks of        immunology It was assumed that the increased total IgE related to allergenspecific        responses However in some studies the association between total IgE and asthma was        stronger than the association between asthma and specific IgE In  Burrows et al went        further and suggested that specific IgE correlated with hay fever while total IgE        correlated with asthma  The implication was that IgE has a complex relationship with        asthma that is not dependent on specific allergens        The strength of the association between asthma and total IgE raises questions that have        not been resolved Do specific IgE antibody responses contribute to or even push total IgE        If so do the IgE antibody responses to some allergens have more effect than others This        question is relevant both to attempts to explain major differences in total IgE between        countries and to studies on acute asthma In emergency room and hospital studies the        geometric mean total serum IgE of patients with asthma is often greater than  IUml        higher than values found in populationbased studies Recent work from Heymann et al and        Green et al on patients hospitalized for asthma has suggested that the interaction between        rhinovirus and allergy occurs predominantly among patients with total IgE   IUml         Thus the different properties of allergens could influence both the prevalence and        severity of asthma However the properties of the dominant allergens do not explain the        overall increase in prevalence which has occurred in countries with very different houses        climates and traditions of domestic pet ownership                    The Paradoxical Relationship between Cat Ownership and Sensitization Significance        for Prevalence or Severity        Antigen exposure is considered to be a primary requisite for immune responses and        allergenspecific responses are no exception There are many examples of allergens that are        not significant in areas where the allergen is not encountered For example the pollen of        olive trees is not relevant in northern countries dust mite allergens are not significant        in the northern part of Scandinavia or the mountain states of the United States and        cockroach allergens are not significant in suburban areas of the United States the United        Kingdom or New Zealand        For dust mites there is a wide range of evidence that increased exposure increases        sensitization Homes in Sweden Berlin the United Kingdom and New Zealand have        progressively higher concentrations of mite allergen and progressively higher prevalence of        sensitization to mite allergens  But there is now evidence that increasing exposure to        cats does not lead to a higher prevalence of allergy  On a population basis the        effect may be profound sensitization to cats among schoolage children is generally         while mite sensitization is often as high as  Figure  This effect cannot be ascribed        to inadequate exposure since all estimates of the quantity of cat allergen inhaled are        higher than for dust mites Furthermore the quantity of cat allergen found in schools or        even in houses without cats is sufficient to sensitize atrisk children         In fact children raised in a house with a cat were less likely to be sensitized to cats         Initially it seemed possible that the effect was an example of reverse causation        However the effect has been observed in countries where a large proportion of families        keep cats and very few families report choosing not to own a cat because of asthma in the        family Furthermore the presence of a cat in a house in New Zealand does not decrease IgE        antibody response to dust mitesin other words tolerance to cats can be catspecific         Understanding how the response to cat allergen is controlled could provide an insight into        how both the prevalence and the titre of IgE antibody responses in general are or should        be controlled It seems inevitable that the primary control is by T cells specific for cat        allergens Indeed there is already excellent evidence that injection of peptides derived        from the cat allergen Fel d  which give T cell responses can be used for immunotherapy         Studying overlapping peptides of Fel d  we identified a striking response to two        peptides at the terminal end of Chain  Furthermore both allergic and tolerant        individuals respond to these peptides by producing IL and interferon gamma  The        implication is that Fel d  inherently induces control and that this control influences        both allergic and nonallergic responses to cat allergen Figure  In keeping with this        IgE antibody responses to cat allergen are not quantitatively as high as those to dust        mites         One of the central assumptions of the cleanliness hypothesis is that regulation of        immune responses is at least in part nonspecific It is assumed that helminth infection        mycobacteria Hepatitis A endotoxin and earlylife infections can create a milieu that        leads to a decrease in allergic responses in general Likewise we might expect that        exposure to high concentrations of cat allergen which can induce IL producing cells        should have a general effect There is some evidence for this hypothesis In Detroit the        presence of two or more animals in the house tended to reduce allergy in general In        Sweden the presence of a cat in the house is associated with decreased sensitization to        cat and also to birch and dog However in the United States and New Zealand the presence        of a cat in the home has no effect on the prevalence or titre of IgE antibody to dust mites         Thus it is clear that under some circumstances the tolerance to cats can occur in        highly atopic individuals and be catspecific This phenomenon is not in keeping with any        version of the cleanliness hypothesis It has been proposed that animals in the home could        have a nonspecific effect because they shed or encourage endotoxin However recent        studies on airborne endotoxin found that the presence of cats had no effect and that there        were significantly lower endotoxin levels in houses with cats compared to dogs                    The Possible Role of Lifestyle Changes        Over the last half of the th century there have been major changes in diet and        physical activity The most obvious result of these changes is an increase in obesity        which has reached epidemic proportions in the United States Since  there have been        multiple reports of an association between elevated body mass index BMI and asthma         In  we suggested that changes in physical activity could be related to bronchospasm         Thus there are three distinct but strongly interrelated aspects of lifestyle that        could be relevant to the prevalence and severity of asthma diet physical activity and        obesity        It is much easier to document BMI than diet or physical activity and although some of        the obesity data are convincing they are not consistent and certainly not comparable to        the association between obesity and diseases such as type  diabetes in childhood In a        typical study Camargo et al found that the prevalence of wheezing was  among the        heaviest quintile and  among the lowest quintile for BMI  Comparable values for type         diabetes would be  and         Studies using questionnaires have attempted to ask whether there is a relationship        between wheezing and physical activity However the track record for questionnaires on        this subject is very poor Westerterp and his colleagues have reported two observations        first that general activity contributes more to energy consumption than aerobic exercise        does and second that many subjects who initiate an exercise program such as a twice        weekly visit to the gym overcompensate so that they actually decrease overall activity         Recently we have documented a decrease in activity among children age  years in        the United States Head Start program a childdevelopment program that aims to increase the        schoolreadiness of young children in lowincome families who have a history of wheezing         Although there are several possible explanations for this result it seems clear that        decreased activity can be present before elevated BMI        The next question to ask is whether physical activity would have a beneficial effect on        asthma Fredburg concluded that full expansion of the lungs had a more potent effect on        bronchial smooth muscle than isoprenaline  Togias and his colleagues have shown that        prolonged shallow breathing  minutes can lead to increased nonspecific bronchial        reactivity  It is obvious that expansion of the lungs is decreased during prolonged        periods of sitting down However periodic expansion of the lungs occurs with sighs Recent        data from our group shows that sigh rates while seated are very variable but are        significantly lower when watching a video than while reading  Thus there is a real        possibility that some forms of childhood behaviorTV videos computer games etcmight be        associated with sigh rates low enough to increase nonspecific bronchial        hyperreactivity        A different explanation for the effects of physical activity comes from evidence that        physical activity can be antiinflammatory This evidence relates to several different        models though not at present to the lungs In some studies obesity appears to be a risk        factor for wheezing among nonallergic children However in most studies the association        between allergen sensitization and asthma has been found in obese and nonobese children        equally  Obviously some obese individuals are unfit and become breathless on        exercise In addition these individuals may have sleepdisordered breathing Thus there        are other conditions that are easily confused with exerciseinduced asthma or nocturnal        asthma Taken together there are excellent reasons for asking whether lifestyle changes        have contributed to the increased prevalence or severity of asthma However it seems        unlikely that this effect occurs on normal lungs so the hypothesis has to be that        decreased physical activity in patients who are allergic can allow persistent or increased        severity of wheezing                    Conclusions        Although the explanation for the increase in asthma is not yet clear it is possible to        put forward a model that includes elements of each of the three main hypotheses Children        raised in the tropics on farms or in villages such as those in Africa or Papua New Guinea        have exposure to endotoxin or infections sufficient to interfere with the development of        allergenspecific IgE antibody responses Once water supplies are clean and major        infectious diseases have been controlled allergic diseases will appear        However asthma appears to be associated with perennial ie indoor exposure and may        be more common or more severe in countries where mites or cockroaches are the major source        of allergens Even with indoor allergen exposure wheezing may remain transient or mild        provided prolonged outdoor play is normal It is the combination of the control of        infectious diseases prolonged indoor exposure and a sedentary lifestyle that is the key        to the asthma epidemic and in particular the key to the rise in severity Using this        analysis the severity of asthma in North American cities becomes much easier to explain        Children in New York Atlanta Philadelphia and Washington DC spend long hours indoors        have high exposure to mite cockroach andor rodent allergens and have very low levels of        physical activity        In conclusion it appears that these combined factors are the key to the asthma epidemic        and in particular the key to the rise in severity We clearly need to develop ways to        increase prolonged physical activity both among patients with asthma and in the general        population We also need to investigate whether prolonged moderate activity is beneficial        in the treatment of asthma andor is antiinflammatory What is equally clear is that the        current obsession of the medical profession with the pharmaceutical management of asthma        as well as other lifestylerelated diseases does not address the reasons why the disease        has become so common and so severe
