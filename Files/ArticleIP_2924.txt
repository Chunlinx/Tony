                                 Post Camp            When youhear the term Socialist Realism you probably see in your minds eye a largedetailed canvas A sweating laborer goggles pushed back on his foreheadstands by his red tractor and shakes hands with Stalin in a white uniform whosmirks under his mustache Behind them is a chorus line of muscular women inbabushkas behind them in turn a rising sun Or something like that Nineyears after the collapse of the Soviet empire the genre is now referred toprimarily in vodka ads as stock imagery of a comfortably camp sort It is agrotesque relic of a defused threat and we can feel good knowing that we havetriumphed over its implications            So what could be thepurpose of this massive book You pick it up expecting counterpropaganda runrampant But this is no mere coffee table decorationalthough it weighs atleast  pounds and contains  reproductions it is textladen far beyond thenorm The next thing that makes an impression on leafing through it is theunfamiliarity of the images Tractors and babushkas and Stalin are accountedfor but very few of the many pictures fit the conventional mold The paintingschosen as illustrations tend to be darker less academic more complicated Thetone is very different from for example that of the show of Socialist Realistpaintings I saw a few years ago at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Brusselswhich approached the subject in the usual popcamp waynearly every picturelooked like a parody and any of them could have been hung very nicely next toAndy Warhols Mao  But the paintings in Matthew Cullerne Bowns bookgrave and dignified and often eager to claim descent from the likes ofRembrandt would be affronted by the pairing            As I continued secondguessing my way through my initialencounter with the book my next thought was that it must surely represent aperverse but fascinating phenomenon a defense of Socialist Realism from theposition of aesthetic conservatism After all there exists a tendency thesedays that is eager to reclaim the likes of Norman Rockwell while consigning tohis former cell Clement Greenberg and his exemplars Since a loss of faith inthe Modernist canon often seems to be paired with a disillusionment withcommunist teleology wouldnt championing the essential conservatism of allthose Zhdanovists make a dandy short circuit Indeed the Western artist whomost consistently comes to mind when you look at the pictures in Bowns book isAndrew Wyeth But there are also a considerable number of works illustratedthat do not fit the bill that refer neither to old masters nor to magazineillustration Again I was guilty of trying to boil Bowns argument down to aformula            His argument is not asimplistic one in fact it is an argument against simplification Bown proposesthat we in the West have ignored if not actually betrayed the great body ofpainting made in this century in the former Soviet republics We have chosen torepresent Socialist Realism in terms of its most moronic and craven examplesand we have instead upheld the banner of the left artists the Futurists andConstructivists who were marginal at best in their time and place            He does not dismiss the latter recognizing the originalityand strength of Kazimir Malevich Aleksandr Rodchenko El Lisitski and theircolleagues but he wants us to pay attention to those other artists many morein number who do not fall seamlessly into the Modernist continuum but whooften had to pay as harsh a price for their independence as their betterknownavantgarde counterparts For nonspecialist readers the book is a journey intothe unknown            Bown described in pressmaterials as an independent scholar has absorbed a vast history largelyunreported outside the Soviet republics It is seldom easy going Acronymsbristle on the page as he records internecine warfare in various Sovietartists leagues The readers mind throbs as he dissects minute shifts inofficial thinking and individual temper and conducts tours of the diverse artscenes in farflung provincial cities But there is always a point It isfascinating for example to note the many swings of the official pendulumbetween the two cardinal sins of naturalism meaning grim subject matter andformalism denoting any sort of aesthetic deviation At various times invarious cities war or peace ruled as themes women were seen as strong or asfragile colors were to be bright or dun Small revolutions took place whensay failure was accepted as a subject or national costume permitted There wasno single Zhdanovist tank that rumbled down the street but a plethora ofdaytoday changes both in official policy and in artists decisions            For that matter Socialist Realism was no monolithicinvention of the Soviet state As Bown takes pains to point out it descendedlargely intact from the artistic currents of the  th century andhad its roots both in classic Western art and in much older local traditionsincluding the work of such Russian masters as the  th century monkAndrei Rublev And Bown has unearthed a tremendous number of strong paintingslargely from private collections that defy all our notions of what Soviet artlooked like even at the height of Stalinism Who would have expected that in Petr V Vilyams could have been making such a rarefied Vuillardlikecanvas as Nana  with its profusion of sensuous patterns and textures apainting that just reeks of sex Or that in  Georgi I Rublev behind theunpromising subject of A Factory Party Meeting  could have been up tosomething that looks simultaneously back to rural primitivism and forward toLarry Rivers You get the sense continually of various fallen reins pickedup of artists in remote mining towns discovering Courbet or Whistler orLger or reinventing Impressionism or Expressionism as if they had never heardof those schoolsas indeed they might not have            If there is a singlethrobbing star in this show it is Aleksandr A Deineka whose extraordinarywork really does not look like anyone elses Building New Factories and Female Textile Workers  and The Defence ofPetrograd  take the conventional subjects their titles indicate andmake them new setting human figureswhich are somehow at once photographicand iconbasedin fields of geometric patterns that are neverthelessrecognizable as industrial landscapes Deineka whose career endured into thes despite intermittent castigation for aestheticism represents a missinglink connecting Socialist Realism with the collages of the Constructivists andthem with the icons of Rublev He may be the major revelation here but hisneglect in the West is just one indication of the giant iceberg of unknown artwhose existence below the surface Bown spotlights explains and places incontext
