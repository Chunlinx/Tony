                                 The Firmness Factor            The Senate hearings oncampaignfinance irregularities conducted since July by Sen Fred ThompsonsGovernmental Affairs Committee have eased finally into insentience As with somany political efforts the committees most lasting achievement is likely tobe linguistic Much as the one tangible consequence of Jimmy Carters famousmalaise speech in  was that it taught millions of Americans a newFrench word which Carter in his speech in fact never uttered the word waspicked up from prespeech spinning by Carters political adviser PatrickCaddell so too a consequence of the Thompson committee hearings has been togive wide currency to the term soft money  in the sense of money thatcan be collected for use in political campaigns but which enjoys an existenceoutside the rules the oversight and the control of the Federal ElectionCommission Specifically soft money can be contributed in unlimitedamounts so long as it is ostensibly spent on vague partybuilding activitiesrather than on behalf of or at the direction of particular candidates            At onepoint in late October as the committee hearings neared their end Sen CarlLevin a Democrat from Michigan sought to emphasize that it was not only theDemocrats who relied heavily on soft money The softmoney cake was eaten byboth parties Levin said This is what Congress permits folks Heck we notonly permit it we thrive on it A week later as if to underscore Levinspoint or at least to carry the culinary metaphor a little further along theNew York Times headlined a story about a Republican fundraising dinnerwith Menu at GOP Feast Soft Money for Appetizer and Dessert            There is no deep mystery about the proximate origins of theterm soft money In its current sense it came into use almost as soon as thepresent contours of campaign law were established in the late s            Beginningin the  th century hard money and soft money came torefer to metallic money and paper money respectively Because hard money wastied intrinsically to the value of precious metals the term was soon appliedmore generally to currencies of enduring and robust value currencies that wereunder tight control and backed with ample amounts of metal Hardcurrencies arent pegged to metals any longer but in casual political andmacroeconomic parlance softmoney                people are those who take anoptimistic and permissive attitude toward control of the money supply andhardmoney                people are those who take a grouchy and restrictiveone            It is the control rather than the valueaspect of the modern hard moneysoft money dichotomy that makes the terminologyapplicable to campaign contributions The immediate linguistic conduit throughwhich it arrived was probably the language of Wall Street in which softmoney may refer to payments made in the form of noncash goods and servicesIn  a Washington Post story described an operative for WalterMondales nascent presidential campaign overseeing a vast proMondale mailingone that wouldnt count toward the campaigns spending limits because it waseducational material technically being sent out by a labor union Ah thesound of soft money the operative said In business terms hard moneymay refer not just to real moneyie hard cash but also to realmoney obtained on hard terms            All thisis straightforward enough But lets not lose sight of a larger phenomenon Itis said that the human tongue naturally distinguishes among four types oftastes sweet sour salty and bitter Similarly the human mind is alwaysready to divide the world roughly into two conceptual categories OliverWendell Holmes thought that all people could be classified according to whetherthey were psychologically internal or external The late Isaiah Berlin ina famous assessment classified people according to whether they were hedgehogsthose who know one big thing or foxes people who know many little thingsAs I have noted elsewhere other twokindsofpeople categoriesmight include dogs vs cats savers vs tossers deciduous vs evergreenstandard vs automatic Somehow though the qualities soft andhard never made it onto this original lista significant omissiongiven the prominence they are coming to enjoy in the public arena oflanguage            The softness and hardness at issue here arenot of course the words having literally to do with the physical propertiesof the same name but rather the higher metaphorical qualities associated withthe words that is hard in the sense of stern uncompromisinggrim tough realistic verifiable or physically palpable andsoft in the sense of moderate subjective subject to emotionsimple idealistic weak or physically immaterial In religious termshard can often be thought of as Calvinist soft as UnitarianTaking these attributes together we thus have hardliners andsoftliners  hardcore pornography and softcorepornography  hard sell and soft sell  hard numbers andsoft numbers  hard drugs and soft drugs  hardliquor and soft drinks  hard sciences and softsciences  hardhearted and softhearted  hard rock andsoft rock             Keep aneye out or an ear cocked today for the hardsoft distinction and youprobably will encounter examples within just a few minutes not counting theubiquitous hardwares and softwares  hardballs andsoftballs  On the BBC World Services main

soft separatists are those who simplyseek ever more cultural and political autonomy for the Francophone provincewhereas hard separatists demand outright sovereignty Political theorydistinguishes between a hard state a state with a relentlesslyefficient perhaps authoritarian central government and a high regard forDarwinian market dynamics and a soft state which features messypluralism and aggravating domestic politics in an environment of at leastintermittent concern for the general welfare            Such hardsoft terminologyis one could argue ideally suited to a postideological age in which otherkinds of distinctionsliberal vs conservative right vs wrong nature vsnurtureseem increasingly tiresome or obsolete For the most part hardand soft carry no troubling value judgments They merely express anattitudea stance a pattern of behavior or of thoughtand their meaning inalmost any context is intuitively clear The hard truth I would argue is thatthis way of seeing the world is itself distressingly soft
