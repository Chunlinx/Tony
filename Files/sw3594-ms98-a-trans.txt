            well i tell you what uh my my uh notion of camping is uh uh well i havent been very far out see ive been in the uh hill country thats about as far as ive gone as far as camping so i havent done any really really rough rugged camping but uh yeah to me its the uh pitching a tent and i mean we were talking real roughing it no cabin no johns nothing just being out there in the woods yeah thats it exactly no uh i dont     Boy Scout huh yeah do you do you backpack car camp   no actually the only camping i ever did was was when i was a scout and uh as much as i would like to you know to do it i you know dont really have the time right now but ive got two young boys and im waiting for them to get a little bit older then well start doing some camping   my sons twelve and hes in the Boy Scout and he went on his first backpack five miles ive gone with him on uh some other things where we   oh great   we kind of called it car camping where the car is you know a hundred feet away or something   umhum   but i did not go on the backpack im uh my back wouldnt allow me to  carry that so   oh i see   he got the backpack in and carried the whole thing and do it the Boy Scout way and he came back tired and wore out but what i didnt my scouting was not as involved as id want i got the star and that was it   umhum   yeah   but im hoping hell go all the way his troop is very active and theres about as many dads involved as going out camping and canoeing as there are boys so   thats great yeah thats great   its an important part are you involved in Indian Guides or Indian Princess with your children   no not yet but ill tell you i i know i was when i was smaller i started out Indian Guides and then went into Cub Cub for a very short time   umhum   and then we kind of i kind of got away from it for a while and then uh when i got back into it again i was ready for for Boy Scouts and i joined joined the Scouts but i tell you i i sure uh recommend it for any any any young boy girl too i mean i i really enjoyed my time in the Scouts   does weve done rent a tent in Arkansas once where it was a state park and they have very nice manicured   uhhuh   well paved park and beautiful uh uh bathrooms within walking distance and you rent a site and they rent a tent thats and you put your tent well one tents already up   umhum umhum   and thats not very rough at all you have electricity and running running water right there but uh   yeah i think for a family outing its good uh but you know if youre with a bunch of uh preteen and and young teenagers who really want to rough it yeah i id recommend going the old backpack method   you mentioned the word rough my idea of rough my wifes idea of roughing it is if the town only has one Holiday Inn to choose from and she just feels like shes being imposed upon     yeah   uh i kind of at my age i kind of like the car car car uh camping   yeah i can understand that   uh uh my sister and her husband uh their children are out of college by gosh theyre already into this uh well car camping plus they will leave the car a few miles away   umhum yeah   and uh but theyre theyre theyre enjoying that so uh weve gone cabin camping in Colorado   yeah umhum   uh where theres a uh you you uh have all the conveniences but you camp in the cabin and thats not camping at all in your opinion   uhhuh yeah   well i hope you find more places to go camping   yeah im really looking forward to it you know i i really did enjoy my experience and i im hoping my boysll enjoy it as much as i did   have you checked checked into the State Park system   no not yet but i tell you i i know my wife she hasnt she really wasnt uh well her family they used to go camping quite a bit when she was younger then as she got older they kind of stopped going and and shes expressed interest in going and doing some camping so   sleeping on the ground that whole bit huh   but probably yeah probably not that rough were probably talking probably tents   screened in shelters work her up to screened in shelters thats a good place to start from in a yeah a cot and then slowly break her in i dont think my wife would even consider going to a tent camp again at all its just   yeah with cots with with cots yeah and     one time we did go that thing uh there we came back from an event and turned the lights on around the camp site and theres a skunk right   umhum oh no   and without thinking i picked up a stick and threw it at it as it as it was starting to voluntarily walk away why i didnt let it but i threw a stick at it     uhoh   it turned around and if a skunk give you a dirty look it did and i said i done made a mistake         i said please skunk go on and he looked looked at me a little bit more then wandered on off very very slowly as my wife and children headed for the nearest tent to         uh people wed go down to the coast every now and then and weve noticed some people camp out on the beach on public beaches and uh   yeah really i didnt know you can do that   uh public beaches State of Texas beaches not where its city owned property   oh oh not like Corpus
