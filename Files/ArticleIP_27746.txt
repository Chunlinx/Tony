                                 Thats a Wrap            If the rowdy and facetious new film TheMummy suggests anything its that weve come to what Francis Fukuyamamight call the end of horror movies The horror genre lost its lifes bloodwhen filmmakers began to worry about being laughed at by teenagers whod seenit all before and to incorporate kids imagined responses into theirpicturesso that you got the movie and the Mystery Science                Theater burlesque of the movie at the same time Forget about the vague fearof the nameless otherwise known as dread Forget about awe too unless itsshort for Awesome dude in response to some pricey special effect Bring onthe ironic oneliners and the slapstick ghoulbashing kung fuand letsparty            Postmodern jokiness can only undermine the mummysubgenre which has at its heart the most ancient of scary ideas If youpresume to violate an alien culture and make off with its sacred objectsyoure going to be visited by a monster thats beyond the power of your ownculture to combat Theres a big dollop of xenophobia hereold mummy picturesare full of stilted English actors pretending to be icily vengefulEgyptiansbut theres also a less chauvinistic implication a rebuke to ourWesternimperialist sense of entitlement For all its nonsensical trappingsthe mummy narrative is serious business because when other peoplespassionately held taboos are casually flouted it is serious businessJust ask Salman Rushdie The invasion of a mummys tomb results in afatwa made fleshor if not flesh then bandages and bones renderedreally really nasty by righteous wrath            Some of these ideas canbe found in the new The Mummy  but they have been stripped of theirweight and cultural resonance In their place is a lot of sub Raiders of theLost Ark swashbuckling plus sight gags pilfered from Sam Raimis Army of Darkness the last of his The Evil Dead trilogy andgenredeflating banter thats like an untalented sophomores stab at ButchCassidy and the Sundance Kid  The juvenile script is by thedirector Stephen Sommers There isnt a mummy at the center of TheMummy  exactly but a mutating Industrial Light and Magic Special EffectUnder it supposedly is Imhotep Arnold Vosloo an ancient priestdiscoveredin the movies prologuein a compromising position with thePharaohs mistress who kills herself in an act of feminist defiance My bodyis no longer his temple            When Imhotep goes to Hamunaptrathe City of the Deadtorevive her he is stopped by the Pharoahs guards shorn of his tongue thenwrapped in gauze and buried alive with a swarm of scabrous beetles Legend hasit that if hes ever revived hell visit the  plagues of Egypt upon theworld Legend has it right as it turns out but its a long hour beforeroguish adventurer Brendan Fraser can transport dimwitted s Pandora heroineRachel Weisz to Hamunaptra so that she can open the Book of the Dead and startstupidly incanting It takes another hour to search for the Book of the Deadsopposite number which will theoretically send Imhotep back to the cosmic soupfrom which he sprang before he can transfer the heroines soul to the embalmedremains of his lady love            The Special Effect a k athe mummy reminded me of the Ghost of Christmas Future in the Bill Murraycomedy Scrooged  Its tall and mottled and has a wiggly mouththat can suddenly distend itself and emit a Jurassic Park style roar Ithas all manner of superpowers turning itself into a puff of smoke ahurricane and a swarm of ravenous locusts It can appropriate pieces of itsvictims anatomies in an effort to reconstitute itself an idea cribbed fromClive Barkers  Hellraiser but less gorily executed for the sakeof a kiddiefriendly PG It can also revive its mummified fellow priestsand send them into battle against our heroes The Special Effect can do almostanythingexcept look scary Its not solely the fault of Industrial Light andMagic Slapstick and horror arent an easy mix Sam Raimi might be the only onewho can pull it offwhen his spastic hyperkinetic ghouls come at you theyseem genuinely invasive The ghouls of lesser artists just bash into oneanother like Keystone Korpses            T he Mummy isnt as inept as last yearsGodzilla it more or less hits its marks and some nonindustry people atthe preview I attended claimed to have been entertained The cast is certainlygame Fraser has a long rangy body and a geewhiz openness that makes himperfect for a comicbook hero and the lovely Weiszwhose eyes are so farapart that theyre almost in different time zonesbrings a screwball aplomb tothe dizzy distaff Egyptologist As her brother John Hannah Gwyneth Paltrowslovestruck Scottish lapdog in last years Sliding Doors  is toostridently the Comic Relief in a movie in which the hero and heroine arealready busy comedically relieving themselves but hes a hard chap to dislikeThe villain is another kettle of leeches I adored Vosloo as Lance Henriksensblackgarbed femininely insinuating henchman in the John WooJean Claude VanDamme action picture Hard Target  But Vosloo doesnt have thephysiognomy for a role incarnated variously by the gaunt Boris Karloff and the totemic Christopher Lee  Bald and roundheaded hes about asimposing as Curly of the Three Stooges            T he Mummy is a debauchery but not a truedefilement Mummy movies dont constitute an especially glorious cinematiclegacy Only the Karloff original directed by Karl Freund qualifies as aclassic with its sleek EgyptianDeco dcor and its matchlessly eerie scene ofthe mummys awakening Bramwell Fletchers hysterical laughter in thecreatures wakeHe went for a little walkechoes in the annals of horrorfilm history Still I have a soft spot for all those dreary Lon Chaney Jrsequels that ended with the lurching halfblind golem lugging a slack blondethrough the swamps while George Zucco in a turban hisses something likeFaster Kharis Before the torchwielding infidels converge on the sacred tombof Ananka I cant make a case for the dim Hammer Films remakes eitheralthough its always fun to watch Peter Cushing get strangled by ChristopherLee No Sommers hasnt blasphemed He doesnt deserve to have his eyes andtongue sucked out his brain dashed against the side of a tomb or to beconsumed by scarab beetles or flayed by locusts But he has put another nail inthe horror genres sarcophagus He should at least lose a hand            In some cultures they cut off hands and even morevital body parts when they find out youre gay Steven Carter BenSilverstone the stringy English hero of Get Real  merely facesparental disapproval social ostracization and a dishy jock lover BradGorton who doesnt want to acknowledge him in the halls of their high schoolStill its enough The strength of this agreeable comedy directed by SimonShore from a screenplay by Patrick Wilde is that it makes even the tiniestsexual encounters seem emotionally momentous They would be anyway at thisage but Steven has fewer avenues for selfexpression than his heterosexualpeers and the pressure builds Despite its gay subject matter Get Realis rather wholesome and didactic Steven writes an essay for the yearbookcalled Get Real and the film climaxes with a speech about wanting to berecognized and loved for who you really are Theres nothing glib aboutSilverstones performance though At times hes believably stricken atothers believably affectlessas if every emotion has been wrapped up sotightly for fear of discovery that theres no such thing as a naturalresponse Hes in danger of becoming a true mummy
