                    Background        Cell migration is one of the most important and complex        cellular behaviors It is essential for animal development        immune system function and wound repair Defects in cell        migration can lead to human diseases such as birth defects        and failure to control cell migration is an important step        in tumor metastasis        We currently believe that migrating cells extend and        retract actin rich protrusions lamellipodia and filopodia        into their environment Protrusions that adhere strongly        enough are stabilized and fail to retract In this way        cells or cell processes can follow adhesive guidance        cues While this model has been around for some time          we are only now beginning to understand the molecular        signals that cause cells to initiate movement how cells        move the signals that guide the cell migrations and the        signals that stop cells at their appropriate positions        Recently progress in understanding cell migration has        come from studies of         Caenorhabditis elegans and         Drosophila   Most cell migration        genes identified in these simple invertebrates are        conserved in vertebrates which confirms the efficacy of        these genetically tractable systems for studying cell        migration                C elegans is a particularly        attractive system for the study of cell migration These        animals are transparent and anatomically simple so cell        migrations can be followed in the living animal at all        stages of development by fluorescence microscopy of GFP        fusion proteins or by Nomarski microscopy Both the cell        lineage and the cell migrations are invariant from animal        to animal so migration defects can be easily        identified        Several genetic screens performed with         C elegans have identified mutations        that interfere with cell migrations for reviews see           Some of these mutations affect all cell migrations        whereas others only affect the migrations of a limited        subset of cells Not surprisingly many of these mutants        also show defects in axon extension bundling and        pathfinding The genes identified by these mutations encode        extracellular proteins cell surface receptors fibroblast        growth factorlike proteins and their receptors adhesion        molecules small GTPases nonmuscle myosins and        transcription factors        In         C elegans  three genes         unc          unc  and         unc  guide cells and processes        along the dorsalventral axis   All of these genes are        conserved across broad groups of animals from         C elegans to man UNC protein a        lamininlike protein that is located in the ventral region        of the animal is a homolog of the vertebrate protein        netrin UNC and UNC are cell surface receptors that        interact with UNC UNC promotes dorsal migrations        whereas UNC promotes ventral migrations both in        response to UNC signals Based on studies in other        species the difference in how UNC and UNC guide cells        and axons lies in their intracellular domains           Mutations in         unc  a member of the        transforming growth factor  TGF superfamily were        identified as genetic suppressors of ectopic UNC        signaling           unc is expressed dorsally and        loss of UNC function disrupts dorsal axon migrations        In         Drosophila  TGF family members are        also involved in controlling dorsalventral migrations          It appears therefore that the UNCnetrin and TGF        guidance systems act redundantly and are conserved across        species        The guidance of cells and axons along the        anteriorposterior axis of         C elegans is not as well understood        Two genes involved in anteriorposterior cell migration are                vab  and         mig  VAB is a kinesinrelated        protein that acts cell autonomously and is involved in        posterior cell migrations    Therefore VAB is        probably involved in the cellular response to guidance        cues MIG is a novel transmembrane protein that acts        noncell autonomously and is involved in anterior cell        migrations    The dose of MIG appears to affect        the extent of anterior cell migrations   MIG may        therefore signal to cells their direction and extent of        migration        Chalfie and colleagues have identified a transcriptional        cascade that leads to the activation of touch        neuronspecific genes UNC is a POU homeodomain        transcription factor needed to activate the         mec gene             mec in turn encodes a LIM        homeodomain protein that is expressed in the six touch        receptor neurons two FLP neurons and two PVD neurons        MEC and UNC proteins form a heterodimer that binds to        and activates the         mec promoter and the promoters of        touch receptorspecific genes such as         mec and         mec     In this way        MEC activates its own transcription which probably        prevents the dedifferentiation of the touch neurons Later        in development         mec also contributes to the        maintenance of         mec expression          We show here that a sequence upstream of         mec  when transformed into         C elegans in high copy arrays        altered the extent and direction of ALM touch receptor        neuron migrations This sequence also disrupted extension        of the PLM touch receptor axon These defects did not        result from RNA interference RNAi the heavy genetic load        of carrying a transgenic array the expression of GFP or        the         rol marker gene used to make the        transgenic arrays The ALM migration defects were due to a        specific DNA sequence and only occurred when there were        many copies of that sequence in the array This sequence        did not affect all cell migrations the ALMBDU cell        division or the positions of the BDU cells We conclude        therefore that the sequence is sequestering a factor that        helps control ALM migrations and PLM axon outgrowth We        also suggest that this factor may be differentially        segregated into touch receptor neurons and that it may help        specify the touch receptor neuron cell fate                    Results                  ALM migration and PLM axonal morphology          defects          Figure shows fluorescence micrographs and bar graphs          of the positions of the ALMs from strain TU which          has an integrated           mecgfp equivalent to pJC in          Figure  and strain EA which contains a high copy          extrachromosomal array made from plasmid pJC see Figure          and Materials and Methods In strain TU the ALMs          migrated close to their normal positions the average          position was  n on the scale described above In          EA the ALMs were usually anterior to their normal          positions the average position was  n on this          scale          Strains that showed the ALM migration defects also          showed defects in another pair of touch neurons the          PLMs Figure shows an example of a normal PLM in strain          TU and several examples of PLMs with axonal defects          in strain EA All of the  PLMs scored in TU had          normal morphology whereas  of the  PLMs scored in          EA had defects in axonal morphology In EA the PLM          axons were often short misdirected and had extra          branches          Axonal defects in the ALMs were less common than in          the PLMs In EA  of  ALMs scored had normal          axonal morphology whereas in TU all of the  ALMs          scored had normal morphology The majority of ALMs with          abnormal axonal morphology were in positions  with a          few as posterior as position  All ALMs located          posterior to position  had normal axonal morphology                          The ALM migration defect was due to a specific DNA          sequence          To determine whether the ALM migration defect was due          to the presence of a specific DNA sequence in the          extrachromosomal arrays we generated           mecgfp deletion constructs          containing various portions of the           mec upstream sequences Plasmids          pJC pJC pJC pJC pJC and pJC were made as          described in Materials and Methods and plasmid pPD          was a gift from A Fire We transformed these plasmids          into wild type animals as described in Materials and          Methods and screened for transgenic lines All of the          resulting strains expressed           mecgfp in the ten cells where           mec is normally expressed We          measured the ALM positions in  animals from each          strain          Figure shows the region of           mecgfp included in each of the          plasmids the combined distribution of ALM positions from          three strains transformed with each construct the          percent of ALMs that showed migration defects those          located anterior to position  and the total number of          ALMs scored Strains transformed with pJC pJC and          pJC showed strong ALM migration defects but strains          transformed with plasmids pPD and pJC showed few          ALM migration defects The region from           Pst I to           Bbs I appeared to suppress the          migration defect compare pJC to pJC The  bp          region from the  end of the           mec clone to the           Pst I site appeared to most          strongly affect ALM migrations compare pJC and pJC to          pPD and pJC Further deletions of this region          pJC and pJC resulted in less severe migration          defects These data and results described below are          consistent with the hypothesis that this sequence          contains multiple binding sites that titrate out a cell          migration factor or factors Below we refer to this          sequence as the titrating sequence                          The migration defect was not due to nonspecific          effects of carrying an array expression of GFP or the          rol transformation marker gene          The above data also show that the ALM migration and          PLM axonal morphology defects are not due to nonspecific          effects of carrying an extrachromosomal array Some          arrays such as those made with plasmids pPD and          pJC had little effect on ALM migration and PLM axonal          morphology          There have been reports that expression of GFP in          neurons can have toxic effects    The above          results however show that neither the migration defects          nor the PLM axonal morphology defects resulted from          expression of GFP Some arrays such as the integrated          array in strain TU and the extrachromosomal arrays          containing plasmids pPD and pJC express GFP yet          had few ALM migration or PLM axonal morphology defects          The lines transformed with pJC had especially bright GFP          fluorescence yet had few ALM or PLM defects          All of the lines shown in Figure were made by          coinjection of the plasmid of interest and the plasmid          pRF which contains the           rolsu marker gene Because          some of these arrays and others described below did not          induce ALM migration or PLM axonal defects these          phenotypes were not due to the           rol marker plasmid                          The ALM migration defect was not due to RNAi          In           C elegans  the presence of double          stranded RNA that corresponds in sequence to a gene will          usually result in silencing of that gene   This          effect is referred to as RNA interference or RNAi In          several cases where transgenic arrays induced odd          phenotypes the authors attribute this to RNAi effects          resulting from cryptic promoters on either side of the          transformed gene   In the case described here it          seemed unlikely that RNAi was inducing the ALM migration          or the PLM axonal morphology defects because there is no          predicted proteinencoding gene in the titrating          sequence It was conceivable however that a small          undetected gene was present in this sequence To test          this possibility we generated double stranded RNA that          corresponded to the sequence  of the           Pst I restriction site and injected          it into TU animals TU was chosen because it          expresses GFP in its ALMs and these neurons migrate          normally          In strain TU the average ALM position was  In          two separate experiments TU injected with double          stranded RNA containing the           mec sequence  of the           Pst I restriction site also had          average ALM positions of  n and n These RNA          injected animals also had normal PLM axonal morphology          Therefore the ALM migration and the PLM axonal          morphology defects were not due to RNAi                          Many copies of the titrating sequence were required          to induce the ALM migration defect          To determine whether the migration defect resulted          from having many copies of the titrating sequence we          made transformants with different mixtures of plasmid and          genomic DNA Kelly et al   have shown that blunt end          cut plasmids injected with blunt end cut genomic DNA will          form complex arrays that contain genomic DNA intermixed          with a few copies of the plasmid To generate arrays with          different numbers of copies of pJC we coinjected pJC          plasmid DNA with pRF and genomic DNA as described in          Materials and Methods We measured the positions of the          ALMs in  animals from one transgenic strain made with          each DNA mixture          Figure shows a plot of the average ALM position          versus the concentration of pJC in the injection          mixture The ALMs were close to their normal positions in          the strains made with     and  gml of pJC          but showed a clear migration defect at  and  gml          of pJC                          Having a promoter near the titrating sequence did          not enhance the ALM migration defect          All of the plasmids shown in Figure contained both          the           mec promoter and the GFP encoding          sequence We reasoned that pJC may have caused more          severe migration defects than pJC and pJC because in          pJC the titrating sequence was closer to the promoter          and was thereby more accessible to binding factors To          determine whether having a promoter present increased the          effectiveness of this sequence we made two plasmids          shown in Figure  Plasmid pJC had the region upstream          of the           Pst I site fused to the region of          the           mec promoter whereas pJC had          just the           mec region upstream of the           Pst I site We transformed TU          with these plasmids and generated transgenic lines          Because the extrachromosomal arrays did not contain           mecgfp  we first picked rollers          and then scored them for ALM position Due to the mosaic          inheritance of extrachromosomal arrays some of the ALMs          scored may not have contained the array          Figure shows the regions of           mec included in each plasmid and          the distribution of ALM positions from three separate          strains made with each plasmid On the right are listed          the percent of ALMs that showed migration defects and the          total number of ALMs scored from the three strains          transformed with each construct Plasmids pJC and pJC          appeared to be equally capable of inducing ALM migration          defects                          What is the sequence          To further refine the region responsible for inducing          the ALM migration defect we generated plasmids          containing further deletions of the  bp           mec region upstream of the           Pst I site We transformed these          plasmids into TU and analyzed the ALM positions in          the resulting lines as we did for the lines shown in          Figure  Figure shows the results of this experiment          Arrays containing pJC induced migration defects less          effectively than arrays containing pJC Fig  so          sequences within the           Pst I to           Bgl II region appear to contribute          to the migration defect However the pJC data show          that arrays containing this sequence by itself induced          few migration errors pJC arrays and pJC arrays          induced similar migration defects so the sequence from          the           Bgl II to the           Hpa I restriction sites did not          appear to contribute to the migration defect pJC          arrays induced fewer migration defects than pJC arrays          and pJC arrays induced fewer migration defects than          pJC arrays so there appeared to be multiple sequences          between the           Hpa I and           Bsa BI restriction sites that          contributed to the migration defect                          Does this sequence affect all cell          migrations          The QRp neuroblast is generated in the posterior of          the animal    As shown in Figure A it migrates          anteriorly to the middle of the animal where it stops and          then divides One of the resulting cells QRpp          undergoes programmed cell death while the other QRpa          migrates forward to about position  and again stops and          divides QRpa gives rise to two neurons SDQR and the          AVM touch receptor neuron Thus if the transgenic arrays          containing the titrating sequence affect all cell          migrations the AVMs should also be misplaced          To test this idea we measured the AVM positions in          TU and EA Figure Bshows the distributions of AVM          positions for these two strains The average positions of          the AVMs in EA and in TU were both  As shown          above the ALMs in TU were near their normal          positions whereas the ALMs in EA were grossly          misplaced Clearly the migrations of the QRp neuroblast          and its daughter QRpa unlike the ALM neurons were not          affected by the extrachromosomal array in EA                          The ALM migration and the PLM axonal morphology          defects are highly correlated          Strains that had many ALM migration defects also had          many PLM axonal defects The correlation coefficient of          the average ALM position versus the percent of animals          with PLM axonal defects was  This correlation          between the ALM defects and the PLM defects is consistent          with both defects resulting from the titration of the          same factor or factors                          The titrating sequence did not affect the ALMBDU          cell division or the positions of the BDUs          In strains containing these arrays some of the ALMs          that were anterior to position  had an axonal morphology          similar to their lineal sisters the BDU neurons We          wondered whether in these animals the ALMBDU cell          division was not occurring and the progenitor of these          neurons was taking on some of the character of both          cells This ALMBDU cell might migrate anteriorly like a          BDU and express           mecgfp  like an ALM To address          this we asked whether the BDU neurons were present in          animals where the ALMs were displaced anteriorly We took          advantage of the fact that in           pag mutants           mecgfp is expressed in both the          ALMs and in the BDUs McDermott J et al unpublished          results We crossed the pJC array in EA into a           pagls genetic background to          generate strain EA As a control we crossed the          integrated array in TU into a           pagls genetic background to          generate strain EA In these strains we measured the          positions of the ALMs and BDUs In a           pagls background the BDU          neurons have a lower level of           mecgfp expression than the ALM          neurons so these neurons can be easily distinguished In          EA the BDUs were present even in animals with ALMs          anterior to position  and they were located in their          normal positions The average position of BDUs in EA          was  n The average position of BDUs in EA was           n Thus the ALMBDU cell divisions were taking          place and the BDUs were migrating normally in these          strains                          The migration defect was cold sensitive          To determine whether the ALM migration defect was          sensitive to temperature we grew EA and TU at          C C and C We then measured the positions of          the ALMs in each strain grown at each temperature EA          a strain transformed with pJC was chosen because it          showed an intermediate distribution of ALM positions at          C see Figure  so either an anterior or a posterior          shift would be apparent TU was chosen because its          ALMs migrated close to their normal positions at          C          Figure shows the distribution of ALM positions for          each strain at each temperature The temperature at which          the animals were grown affected ALM migrations in both          EA and TU ALMs were located more anteriorly in          both EA and TU grown at C TU grown at C          had fewer ALMs anterior to position  than TU grown          at C                            Discussion        We have identified a sequence in the         mec upstream region that when        present in high copy extrachromosomal arrays caused the        ALM touch receptor neurons to migrate aberrantly and caused        PLM touch receptor neuron axonal defects These defects        were not due to RNAi nonspecific effects of carrying a        transgenic array expression of GFP or the marker gene        used to make the transformants Rather these defects        resulted from transgenic arrays containing many copies of a        specific sequence from the         mec upstream control region        Figure Ashows the direction and extent of the ALM and        BDU cell migrations ALMs that failed to migrate would        remain around position    In strains transformed with        the titrating sequence the ALMs often migrated anteriorly        rather than posteriorly and were located anterior to        position  Thus the arrays appeared to be sequestering a        factor that controls both the direction and extent of ALM        migrations Presumably the BDU neurons normally inherit a        small amount of this factor and migrate anteriorly while        the ALMs inherit a larger amount of this factor and migrate        posteriorly        All ALMs that showed defects in axon morphology were        anterior to position  Perhaps ALMs positioned anterior to        position  sometimes fail to find their normal axon        guidance cues Interestingly some of these anteriorly        positioned ALMs had axon morphologies similar to BDU        neurons These cells being deprived of their own axon        guidance cues may have followed the BDU axon guidance        cues        Figure shows that the sequence upstream of the         Pst I restriction site appeared to        contribute strongly to the ALM migration defects Plasmids        containing this sequence pJC pJC and pJC induced many        ALM migration defects whereas plasmids lacking this        sequence pPD and pJC induced few migration        defects Figure shows that this upstream         mec sequence alone pJC was        sufficient to induce migration defects Smaller pieces of        the sequence upstream of the         Pst I site are also sufficient to        induce ALM migration defects Fig  The smallest        sequence tested that caused the migration defects pJC        Fig  contained only  bp upstream of the         Eco RI restriction site        These conclusions assume that the arrays generated for        each construct have roughly the same number of copies of        the titrating sequence We controlled for straintostrain        variability in the array size by discarding strains with        low transmission frequencies see Materials and Methods        and by combining the data from at least three independently        generated strains transformed with each construct Because        the straintostrain variability was small this assumption        is probably valid        Other sequences around the titrating sequence appeared        to facilitate the binding of the factor or factors involved        in controlling ALM cell migrations For instance plasmid        pJC which contained more surrounding sequence was more        effective than pJC These surrounding sequences may        contain additional binding sites for this factor or the        migration factor may interact with other proteins that bind        the         mec upstream sequences Thus the        binding of one factor might cooperatively facilitate the        binding of other factors Li et al   identified a        sequence upstream of         her that phenocopied an         sdc mutation when transformed into         C elegans in high copy arrays They        too found that several regions of the         her upstream sequence contributed        to the effect        The results shown in Figure suggest that a  bp        sequence        AAATCTCAATCTAAAAACATTTTTAGAACTTTTTCAAAGA        TATGTTGAATTCTGGCAACTTTAGGTAGTTTTAAATTTTC        CACGAAATTTCAAATCAAATGTTA  contributed        strongly to the ALM migration defects The region from        nucleotide  is a degenerate palindrome Within this        palindrome there are two more levels of nested palindromes        For instance the  region is palindromic and within        the  region the  region is palindromic        Some of this interesting sequence structure may result        from the juxtaposition of transcription factor binding        sites For instance the sequence from  would be an        excellent binding site in both its forward and reverse        orientations for the         Drosophila STAT transcription factor        DSTAT   There are two proteins with homology to the        STAT family of transcription factors in         C elegans  This sequence is        followed by the repeated sequence caaatcaaat which would        provide two good binding sites for the mammalian brain POU        transcription factor Brn   Brn is related to        UNC which is required to initiate and sustain         mec expression        The titrating sequence is located between two genes that        are positioned headtohead         mec and FD which encodes a        UDPglucoronosyltransferase The titrating element could be        regulating either neither or both of these genes Because        this element appeared to sequester a factor involved in ALM        migration and PLM axon outgrowth it is probably a         mec control element                mecgfp fusion genes that lack this        element appear to be correctly expressed What aspect        then of         mec expression is affected by this        control element         mec is activated by UNC protein            Once MEC protein is made UNC and MEC        form a heterodimer that more effectively activates         mec  Perhaps the titrating element        is involved in the initial         mec activation This role would not        be apparent in         mecgfp fusion genes because they        would be activated by the endogenous UNCMEC        heterodimer Alternatively this element might help sustain                mec expression Finally this        element might modulate         mec expression in a way that is not        evident by looking at the MECGFP fluorescence        Figure demonstrates that the ALM migration defect        arises due to having many copies of the titrating sequence        Arrays made with few copies of pJC did not induce ALM        migration defects whereas arrays containing many copies of        pJC did thus suggesting that the arrays that altered ALM        cell migrations acted by titrating a control factor        It is somewhat surprising that high copy arrays could        titrate this factor to low enough levels to induce        phenotypes Transgenic arrays in         C elegans contain about         copies of the plasmids used to make the array          Assuming that each copy of the titrating sequence bound        only one molecule then shifting the concentration of this        DNA binding factor by as few as  molecules caused the        ALM migration defects Because this factor is titratable        it may be present at low concentrations and bind with high        affinity to the         mec upstream sequence        Perhaps this factor is present at low concentration        because it is part of a mechanism for sensitive regulation        of a cell state The relative level of a factor present at        low concentration should be easier to change than that of a        factor present at high concentration These results suggest        that ALM migrations are carefully regulated by the        concentration of a specific DNA binding protein that is        present in the cell in only a few copies        The need for an allornothing response could also        explain why there appear to be multiple sequences that        contribute to the titration One mechanism for steepening        the response of an effector molecule is to require that        more than one molecule bind to the target to induce a        response Perhaps the migration factor binds to several        sites in both         mec and in the cell migration        genes and multiple sites must be bound to affect        expression        The factor sequestered by the titrating sequence does        not affect all cell migrations The AVM touch receptor        neurons in EA a strain which showed a strong ALM        migration defect were located in the same position as the        AVMs in TU a strain which showed few ALM migration        defects Fig  The AVMs lineal mother and grandmother        both migrate anteriorly and if either of these migrations        were defective the AVMs would be mispositioned We do not        know whether other cell migrations were affected by the        titrating sequence but no other phenotypes were observed        in animals with severe ALM migration defects        The incidence of PLM axonal defects correlated well with        the ALM migration defects We believe therefore that the        PLM defects were induced by titration of the same factor or        factors that control ALM migrations In both cases the        cells failed to correctly interpret anteriorposterior        spatial information However the ALMs migrated to more        anterior positions whereas the PLMs axons often terminated        at more posterior positions        Temperature had a strong effect on the ALM migration        defects Fig  In cells grown at lower temperatures the        titrated factor may be less active it may be produced at        low concentrations it may bind to arrays more tightly or        it may interact with its ligand less effectively The cold        sensitivity of the ALM migration defect may be useful for        identifying genetic suppressors of the migration        defect        The factor titrated by this sequence may also be        involved in differentiating ALMs and BDUs It may be        present in ABarpppapp and ABarppaapp the progenitors of        ALMRBDUR and ALMLBDUL respectively When these cells        divide to generate ALMs and BDUs the factor may        differentially segregate into the ALMs A high        concentration of this factor may direct the ALMs to migrate        posteriorly while a low level of this factor may direct the        BDUs to migrate anteriorly Furthermore this factor may        help activate         mec expression and thereby cause        the ALMs to differentiate into touch receptor neurons        As was true in sea urchin embryos    titration        of transcription factors with high copy transgenes may be        useful for characterizing control elements in         C elegans  The ALM migration defect        should be useful for identifying optimal conditions for the        titration of DNA binding protein with high copy arrays We        do not know at this point how often transcription factors        will be present at low enough concentrations and bind DNA        with enough affinity to apply this approach Because others        have also reported competitive titration by transgenic        sequences in         C elegans    we expect that        it will not be uncommon Certainly some of the artifacts        associated with transformation of         C elegans with high copy arrays may        result from titration of DNA binding factors          Transformation of         C elegans with low copy arrays made        with complex carrier DNA prevented the titration effects        so the use of low copy arrays may be prudent where        titration effects are not desired        Kelly et al   found that inclusion of complex        carrier DNA in         C elegans transformation experiments        improves the function of certain coinjected reporter        constructs These effects include both increased expression        and improved uniformity of transgene expression Figure        shows that including complex carrier DNA may also prevent        transformation artifacts resulting from titration of        transcription factors                    Conclusions        The experiments described here show that transformation        of         C elegans with many copies of a        specific sequence located upstream of         mec induced cell migration and        axonal guidance defects This         mec upstream sequence appeared to        be sequestering a factor involved in controlling ALM        migration and PLM axonal outgrowth This factor may also        regulate         mec and thereby control touch        receptor neuron fate Titration of transcription factors        with high copy arrays may become widely applicable in         C elegans once conditions that        optimize this effect are found The ALM defect described        here may be useful for finding these conditions                    Materials and Methods                  Worm culture and strain methods                    C elegans were maintained as          described by Brenner   Animals were grown at C          unless otherwise stated The wild type strain was
