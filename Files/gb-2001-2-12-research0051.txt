                    Background        The availability of a large number of protein sequences        including complete protein sets encoded in diverse genomes        and the rapidly growing database of protein structures have        already greatly impacted on our understanding of the        evolution of protein structure and function    This        process has been aided by the development of powerful        algorithms and sensitive computational tools for detecting        sequence and structural similarities between proteins In        particular methods that extract information from multiple        alignments to construct various types of sequence profiles        and use the resulting sequence profiles for iterative        database searching such as PSIBLAST and        HiddenMarkovModel HMMbased approaches have        substantially improved the detection of subtle similarities        between proteins that previously were amenable only to        direct structural comparison    The sensitivity and        accuracy of these methods have been extensively tested and        statistical approaches for validating the observed        similarities are available                Despite these achievements detection and interpretation        of relationships between homologous proteins that have        limited sequence similarity remains a major challenge Such        studies typically require a casebycase approach that is        guided by a detailed understanding of protein        sequencestructure patterns and is rooted in the biology of        the proteins analyzed Prediction of structures and        functions of uncharacterized proteins is one of the        principal outcomes of these analyses and experimental        verification of such predictions tends to increase        confidence in the validity of sequencestructure        comparative approaches The negative feedback from        experiments that failed to confirm a computational        prediction is potentially even more important because it        could result in revision and refinement of the        computational methods        When examining cases of reported prediction followed by        experimental validation however we encountered several        paradoxical situations In each of these a prediction that        has been reportedly confirmed by experiment was        incompatible with results obtained with several standard        computational procedures More importantly alternative        predictions supported by statistically significant        sequence andor structural similarity were made in some of        these cases Here we present several such mysteries        describe the refutation of the original predictions and the        new predictions wherever feasible and discuss the        discrepancy between the computational and experimental        results The choice of the cases was not systematic        rather those chosen were notable because they relied on        novel computational techniques exploited particularly        subtle sequence or structural motifs and dealt with        crucial biological problems                    Results                  MJ a predicted archaeal cysteinyltRNA          synthetase          AminoacyltRNA synthetases aaRSs specific for  of          the  amino acids are universally present in cellular          life forms The three exceptions are GlnRS AsnRS and          CysRS GInRS and AsnRS are missing in many bacteria and          archaea because glutamine and asparagine are incorporated          into proteins through transamidation of glutamate and          aspartate respectively CysRS is missing in two archaeal          methanogens whose genomes have been sequenced            Methanobacterium          thermoautotrophicum and           Methanococcus jannaschii   No          alternative mechanism for cysteine incorporation into          proteins is known hence the absence of CysRS in these          organisms was an enigma          Two solutions to this puzzle both unusual have          recently been proposed and experimentally validated One          involves nonorthologous gene displacement a situation          in which the same essential function is carried out by          distantly related or even unrelated proteins in different          organisms    It has been shown that           M jannaschii ProRS a class II          synthetase that is unrelated to the class I CysRS          substituted for the missing CysRS activity              The other solution involved a new candidate for the role          of CysRS the MJ protein from           M jannaschii This protein and its          orthologs direct evolutionary counterparts related by          vertical descent from a common ancestor from the          bacteria           Thermotoga maritima and           Deinococcus radiodurans were          identified as distant orthologs of the           Bacillus subtilis CysRS by using a          computational method specifically designed to detect          distantly related orthologs   The method is based on          application of discriminant analysis to alignment scores          in order to separate the scores for pairs of functionally          identical proteins from different genomes from the scores          for proteins with different functions This prediction          was then validated experimentally by showing that MJ          had CysRS activity           in vitro and that an ortholog of          MJ from           D radiodurans DR          complemented a CysRS deficient temperaturesensitive          lethal           E coli mutant strain   An          important corollary of these surprising findings is a          rapid divergence of the MJ family from CysRS such          that all the catalytic and otherwise functionally          important residues characteristic of this enzyme and          also present in other class I aaRSs have changed          Furthermore MJ and its orthologs do not have the          accessory domains found in all known CysRS namely the          DALR domain named after a distinct aminoacid          signature which is shared by aaRSs of several          specificities and another domain specific to CysRS                     We examined the protein sequences of MJ and its          homologs using more traditional computational techniques          Almost all these proteins contain aminoterminal signal          peptides readily identifiable by using the SignalP          program   but do not contain any predicted          transmembrane segments and accordingly are predicted          to be secreted from the cells Figure  Furthermore          iterative database searches using the PSIBLAST program            showed statistically significant sequence similarity          between these proteins and an experimentally          characterized endo polygalactosaminidase from           Pseudomonas species   For          example in a search initiated with the sequence of          MJ and a profile inclusion cutoff of  the          polygalactosaminidase sequence was retrieved from the          database in the second iteration followed by other          bacterial proteins predicted to possess the same          activity This protein family has several conserved          motifs including a characteristic Dxhp signature h          hydrophobic residue p polar residue in which the          conserved aspartate is likely to directly participate in          catalysis Figure  The hybridfoldrecognition method          which combines sequenceprofile analysis with          alignmentbased secondarystructure prediction   and          the DPSSM method   both suggested a likely          amylaselike triosephosphate isomerase TIM barrel          structure for this protein family Thus although the          identification of MJ as a secreted          polygalactosaminidase or a related polysaccharide          hydrolase with a different specificity awaits          experimental verification it shows all the signs of a          correct computational prediction statistically          significant similarity between the analyzed protein and          an experimentally characterized enzyme conservation of          distinct motifs implicated in catalysis potential          presence of a structural fold compatible with the          experimentally demonstrated enzymatic activity and          confident prediction of the extracellular localization          that is again compatible with a polysaccharide          hydrolase activity involved in environmental carbohydrate          utilization or capsular metabolism None of this evidence          is offered by the analysis that led to the CysRS          prediction for MJ          Therefore we are forced to conclude that MJ and          its homologs are not related to CysRS and there is          nothing in the computational analysis of these proteins          that would point to an aaRS activity In contrast we          predict these proteins to be extracellular          polygalactosaminidases or similar polysaccharide          hydrolases The polysaccharide hydrolase and aaRS          functions seem to be essentially incompatible First a          secreted enzyme is unlikely to function as an aaRS whose          site of action is by definition intracellular Second          even if an entirely new class of aaRSs is postulated the          reaction catalyzed by this new aaRS does not resemble          polysaccharide hydrolysis or its reversal AminoacyltRNA          synthetases catalyze a succession of reactions which          involve hydrolysis of the  phosphate bond in ATP          condensation of AMP with the cognate amino acid          resulting in the formation of an aminoacyladenylate          displacement of the AMP moiety of the aminoacyladenylate          with the cognate tRNA producing aminoacyltRNA Even if          the two condensation reactions in very general terms          could be considered a reversal of the polysaccharide          hydrolysis reaction there is no indication that          polysaccharide hydrolases could bind and hydrolyze ATP          and the multiple alignment of the MJ family did not          include any conserved signatures typical of potential          phosphatebinding loops Figure  Neither does this          family contain any recognizable RNAbinding domains          Finally           M thermoautotrophicum does not          encode any homologs of MJ ruling out the possibility          that this family encompasses CysRS of both archaeal          methanogens Taken together these observations appear to          effectively refute the prediction of a CysRS activity          thus pitting computational results against experimental          data                          MJ a predicted dihydropteroate synthase          Dihydropteroate synthase DHPS catalyzes the          condensation of           p aminobenzoic acid with          dihydrohydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphate to give          dihydropteroate an intermediate in folate          metabolism The protein from           Staphylococcus a Grampositive          bacterium has been crystallized and shown to adopt a          TIMbarrel structure   Although it has been          indicated that no DHPS could be detected in archaeal          genomes   orthologs of bacterial DHPS are readily          identifiable in all archaea this enzyme is missing only          in animals and in several intracellular bacterial          pathogens such as           Rickettsia prowazekii spirochetes          and mycoplasmas COG in the database of Clusters of          Orthologous Groups of proteins COGs   Most          archaea have a distinct version of DHPS that shows          relatively low sequence similarity to the bacterial          orthologs and contains an additional uncharacterized          carboxyterminal domain This previously undetected          domain is also present in some other enzymes of pterin          biosynthesis such as          tetrahydromethanopterinSmethyltransferase from           Streptomyces LMI LA and          EVK unpublished observation Some archaeal species          including           Thermoplasma and           Halobacterium have the          bacterialtype DHPS which was probably acquired by          horizontal gene transfer and displaced the original          archaeal version Despite the relatively low sequence          similarity to bacterial DHPS all archaeal orthologs have          the conserved catalytic residues identified in DHPS          Figure  and are confidently predicted by the          hybridfoldrecognition method to assume the same fold          as DHPS from           Pneumocystis carinii and           Staphylococcus aureus whose crystal          structures have been determined          An analysis using ORF a program developed to          recognize folds by comparing predicted secondary          structures of proteins   we are unaware of a          published detailed description of this method          identified MJ as a homolog of DHPS although given          the low sequence similarity a convergent origin of the          relationship between MJ and DHPS was deemed likely          there seems to be a terminological confusion involved          here but we are quoting the results of the original          computational analysis of this protein as they have been          presented It was acknowledged that MJ a member of          COG could be identified as a possible homolog of          DHPS by sequencebased methods and this protein was          assayed for dihydropteroate synthase activity but none          was detected   In contrast DHPS activity albeit          relatively low was shown           in vitro for the partially purified          MJ protein   However MJ has been shown to          belong to the metallolactamase superfamily of enzymes          and in the evolutionary classification of          metallolactamases belongs to an archaeaspecific          family Figure  COG   Metallolactamases          encompass a wide range of metaldependent hydrolytic and          oxidoreductase activities with a variety of substrates          and are particularly abundant in archaea where some of          them are involved in RNA processing   None of these          enzymes catalyzes a reaction resembling the condensation          reaction catalyzed by DHPS The characteristic motifs of          metallolactamases which mostly include metalbinding          histidines are highly conserved in MJ and its          orthologs Figure  In contrast most of the MJ          residues described as equivalent to the functionally          important residues of           Escherichia coli dihydropteroate          synthase are not conserved even among the archaeal          orthologs of this protein Finally the lactamase fold          consists of two subdomains of the  topology whose           sheets are sandwiched against each other in structural          terms these domains are completely different from the          TIMbarrel with which the ORF program matched the MJ          structural prediction Taken together these observations          are sufficient to reject the proposed relationship          between MJ and dihydropteroate synthases                          MJ a predicted thymidylate synthase          Thymidylate synthase is a central enzyme of pyrimidine          metabolism that catalyzes the formation of deoxythymidine          monophosphate dTMP from deoxyuridine monophosphate          dUMP by transfer of a methyl group to its pyrimidine          ring This reaction is catalyzed by at least two          unrelated enzymes The canonical thymidylate synthase          TS such as the           E coli ThyA is a protein with a          distinct fold that transfers a methyl group to dUMP          from methylenetetrahydrofolate   This classic          TS is readily identifiable in many but not all          bacteria eukaryotes and three archaeal species           Archaeoglobus fulgidus M          jannaschii and           M thermoautotrophicum COG          The archaeal members of the TS family share with their          bacterial orthologs all the conserved residues involved          in catalysis Figure           An alternative TS or its subunit is predicted to be          encoded by a gene from           Dictyostelium that rescues a slime          mold mutant auxotrophic for thymidylate   This          protein is not homologous to the canonical TS but its          orthologs in bacteria and archaea show an almost perfect          complementary phyletic distribution COG          In a screen for the TS in           M jannaschii the ORF method          picked the MJ protein as the most likely homolog of          the canonical TS family   In the validation          experiment MJ overexpressed in           E coli was shown to possess TS          activity   Sequence searches show that MJ          belongs to a small family of euryarchaeaspecific          proteins of uncharacterized function COG Of the           residues reported to be conserved between MJ and the          TS family only seven were conserved thoughout the MJ          family Figure  Moreover a comparison of the          secondary structure elements derived from the reported          threedimensional model of MJ   and those derived          from a prediction generated using a multiple alignment          query with the structureprediction program PHD such          predictions typically exceed  accuracy showed an          overlap of just two of the  or so secondary structural          elements Figure  Conversely several sequence motifs          that are characteristic of the MJ family did not          overlap with the conserved regions in the MJTS          alignment Figure  Furthermore some but not all          members of the MJ family contain an aminoterminal          insertion of a small metalchelating module Figure           which was used to improve the alignment with the           E coli TS   although this          region was variable even within the MJ family itself          On the basis of these observations a relationship          between MJ and the canonical TS has to be rejected          The actual fold and function of MJ and its homologs          cannot be predicted at present However these proteins          have several features that suggest that they might be          metaldependent enzymes potentially involved in redox          reactions These suggestive features include the fusion          with a ferredoxin domain seen in the           M thermoautotrophicum member          MTH the insertion of the metalbinding module in          certain members including MJ see above and the          presence of three cysteines that are conserved throughout          this family                          Cmpp a plant paralog of plant viral movement          proteins          Viral movement proteins MPs are encoded by diverse          unrelated families of plant viruses such as          positivestrand RNA negativestrand RNA singlestranded          DNA and doublestranded DNA viruses and are essential          for celltocell movement of all these viruses             To isolate potential host homologs of the red clover          necrotic mosaic virus RCNMV MP antibodies to this          protein were used to screen phloem extracts of           Cucurbita maxima resulting in the          detection of a protein designated Cmpp This protein          was identified as a paralog generally this term          refers to homologous genes related by duplication within          the same genome of the viral MPs on the basis of          sequence similarity detected using the Megalign program            Subsequently Cmpp was shown to bind RNA which is          a common property of viral MPs and to induce an increase          of the sizeexclusion limit of plasmodesmata also a          mechanism associated with the MPs            However computational analysis of the Cmpp sequence          reveals a picture that is incompatible with a homologous          relationship with MPs Cmpp consists mostly of a C          domain that is readily detected by PSIBLAST or by          profilesearching engines such as the CDsearch            The Cmpp sequence contains all critical residues of the          C domain Figure  C domains bind a variety of          substrates such as Ca  phospholipids inositol          polyphosphates and other proteins but apparently not RNA            There is no detectable similarity between C          domains and the MPs and conserved motifs in the          published alignment of Cmpp and the RCNMV MP do not          correspond to those in C domains moreover many of the          residues described as conserved in Cmpp and MP are not          conserved within the viral movement protein family          itself Thus we conclude that viral MPs and Cmpp a          Cdomain protein are not homologs Subsequently a          similar methodology has been employed to detect a          relationship between Cmpp a cytochrome B reductase          Cmpp and the RCNMV movement protein   As in the          above case of Cmpp this relationship of a cytochrome          B reductase with the viral movement proteins appears to          be spurious data not shown                          Human activating transcription factor ATF a          predicted histone acetyltransferase          Histone acetyltransferases HAT are key regulators of          eukaryotic transcription GCNlike HATs which modulate          chromatinassociated transcription belong to a vast          superfamily of aminogroup acetyl and          myristoyltransferases with extremely diverse functions            ATF is a basic leucine zipper bZIP family          transcription factor that binds to cyclic AMPresponse          elements CRE and activates transcription            Vertebrate ATF also has an aminoterminal zinc finger          which is involved in transcription activation            Nonvertebrate orthologs of ATF in           Drosophila Caenorhabditis          elegans and yeasts lack the zinc finger In          experiments designed to isolate ATFassociated HAT          ATF alone was shown to be sufficient for the          acetyltransferase activity Examining the region of ATF          that showed HAT activity the authors found some sequence          similarity and at least one motif resembling the          acetyltransferase superfamily and concluded that ATF          contained a GCNlike acetyltransferase domain            Subsequent sitedirected mutagenesis supported the          importance of the reported acetyltransferase motifs for          the HAT activity of ATF          However profilebased sequence searches and attempts          at fold recognition failed to detect any relationship          between ATF and the acetyltransferase superfamily The          region designated as having HAT activity and containing          the acetyltransferase domain shows poor conservation          between orthologs and closely related paralogs of the          ATF family especially in the sequence identified as          the most prominent A motif of the acetyltransferase          family Figure  Furthermore complexity analysis using          the SEG program with the parameters adjusted for          decomposition of a protein into globular and nonglobular          regions   predicted that the entire region of the          ATF protein between the aminoterminal zinc finger and          the carboxyterminal helical bZIP was unstructured This          is consistent with the structural prediction derived          using the PHD program that indicated no regular secondary          structure in this region Thus the relationship between          ATF and the GCNlike acetyltransferase superfamily          seems to be invalid leaving the structural basis for the          reported acetyltransferase activity of ATF an open          issue                          Predicted PAS domain in the phytochromeinteracting          transcription factor PIF          PAS domains are sensory modules in various signal          transduction proteins from all major lineages of cellular          life   PAS domains are typically implicated in          sensing oxygen redox potential light and small ligands            In addition PAS domains are sites for          proteinprotein interactions and are responsible for the          formation of homo and heterodimers in several signal          transduction pathways that involve transcriptional          activation A PAS domain has been reported in the          transcription factor PIF from           Arabidopsis which interacts with a          phytochrome photoreceptor and transduces light signals to          photoresponsive plant genes   It has been          hypothesized that the purported PAS domain of PIF          directly interacts with the PAS domains of the          phytochrome   This hypothesis was later tested          experimentally and evidence was presented that the PAS          domain of PIF indeed was a major contributor to the          interaction between the two proteins            PIF belongs to a plantspecific family of basic          helixloophelix bHLHdomain containing proteins that          in addition to the bHLH domain have an uncharacterized          conserved domain at the amino terminus present in single          or duplicate copies LMI IZ LA and EVK          unpublished observations The PIF family currently          consists of about eight paralogous proteins in           Arabidopsis and an ortholog from          rice The region predicted to be a PAS domain is poorly          conserved in the rice ortholog of PIF and the paralogs          from           Arabidopsis An alignment with the          rice ortholog indicated that the proposed PAS domain was          a rapidly diverging compositionally biased sequence          Figure  Complexity analysis using the SEG program          showed that the reported PAS domain mapped to a region          that was predicted to be entirely nonglobular All          attempts to objectively detect a PAS domain in PIF using          sensitive profile methods based on PSIBLASTderived          scoring matrices or Hidden Markov Models HMM failed          Additionally secondarystructure prediction for the          proposed PAS region using PHD indicated that this region          is largely unstructured These observations appear to be          sufficient to reject the presence of a PAS domain in PIF          although the region thought to be a PAS domain could          indeed be involved in the interaction with          phytochrome                            Discussion and conclusions        In the six cases described above we provide evidence        for rejecting the homologous relationships and functional        predictions inferred for the proteins in question by using        computational methods The number of examples in this        category could be increased and some have already been        considered in the literature for example the spurious        discovery of a functional PDZ domain in the molecular        chaperone ClpA   see refutation in   or the        finding of an ATPase domain and death effector domains in        the apoptosisassociated protein FLASH   see        refutation in   The common and most striking aspect        of all these cases is that the predictions based on        apparently erroneous computational analysis were supported        by experiments What are the solutions to this clash        between computational and experimental evidence        We envisage three main possibilities The first        experimentcentered view would hold that experimental        evidence always has the upper hand and that even if the        alternative computational solutions that we describe here        seem more plausible than the original predictions the        latter are correct insofar as they are supported by        experiment Epistemologically this argument is not sound        because hypotheses computational predictions in this case        cannot be proved by the success of the experiments they        prompt They can only be falsified by experiments producing        results incompatible with the predictions   Simply        put the experiments could have worked for a wrong reason        For example this seems particularly likely in the case of        the sitedirected mutagenesis of the transcription factor        ATF discussed above The mutagenized residues probably        are indeed important for the function of this protein but        not because they are part of a GCNlike acetyltransferase        domain which this protein does not contain Similar logic        applies to the case of the predicted but apparently        nonexistent PAS domain in the transcription factor PIF        More important however computational predictions are        falsifiable within the realm of computational analysis        itself Falsification is offered by alternative        unequivocally supported predictions that are incompatible        with the original ones In four of the six cases described        CysRS DHPS TS and MP such evidence was obtained by        computational methods        The second possibility is that although the        computational predictions described here are correct        whereas the original ones are wrong the experimental        evidence is also solid In each of the described cases        this would elevate the biochemical activities identified        through these experiments to the status of major        unexpected discoveries because the chemistry underlying        them would have to be extremely unusual In particular if        the identification of the         M jannaschii cysteinyltRNA        synthetase is indeed correct this enzyme would have to be        a derivative of a specific family of polysaccharide        hydrolases containing a signal peptide but no recognizable        ATPbinding or RNAbinding domains        The third explanation is that the original computational        predictions triggered overinterpretation of the        experimental results that in reality might have been        obtained as a result of nonspecific activities        contamination or other artifacts In this regard it is        important to realize that not only computational        predictions but biological experiments also are        intrinsically errorprone and open to conflicting        interpretations The probabilistic nature of computational        analyses is well realized and at times perhaps        overrated by most researchers probably because explicit        calculation of probability or likelihood is at the core of        most widely used computer methods for sequence and        structure analyses In this regard it is prudent to note        that the alternative computational predictions presented        here should be considered to be more likely than the        original ones rather than to contradict the latter in an        absolute sense As we attempted to show above however the        difference in the likelihood of two mutually incompatible        predictions can be overwhelming with one supported by        multiple lines of evidence as opposed to the other In        contrast to computational studies experimental ones are        often consciously or unconsciously treated as        demonstration of final truth In reality however        probabilistic inference is inherent in practically any        interpretation of experimental results when questions are        asked such as How likely is it that the protein under        study has a particular biochemical activity         in vivo  or How central is this        activity for the         in vivo function of the protein under        study given the results of a surrogate         in vitro assay Thus certain        experimental designs may not be appropriate to ascertain        the actual         in vivo biochemistry of a protein        Furthermore even if the particular activities detected        under these conditions are genuine the likelihood of these        being relevant         in vivo needs to be additionally        assessed Accordingly when strong computational        predictions seem not to be borne out by experiment the        conditions and design of the experiments deserve special        scrutiny they might have given a negative result for a        wrong reason A case in point is the MJ protein the        apparent archaeal ortholog of DHPS which failed to show        dihydropteroate synthase activity   We strongly        believe that this issue needs to be revisited All this        considered the results of independent application of        computational and experimental techniques tend to be        complementary and useful in adding or reducing confidence        in the biological conclusions of a particular study        Finally it should be emphasized that these cautionary        notes on application of computational methods in protein        function prediction in no way suggest that new        computational approaches that depart sharply from more        established ones are doomed to failure Indeed the most        popular advanced search methods based on sequence profiles         PSIBLAST and Hidden Markov Model HMM search  are        rather recent innovations     Furthermore        methods based on a different principle such as protein        sequencestructure threading have a recent history of        success despite uncertainties in their statistical        foundations       It does seem however        that when a structurally and functionally plausible        prediction is produced with a high confidence by a well        tested statistically sound computational method an        incompatible prediction yielded by a new method without a        clear statistical foundation is most likely to be        incorrect
