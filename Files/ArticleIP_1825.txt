                                 Marilyn Manson            Every few years likeclockwork the popmusic industry presents to the American public for itsdelectation a rock star so base so vile so offensive to common decency thathe must be stifled Once upon a time the monster was Ozzy Osbourne bat eaterMore recently it has been Twisted Sister  Live Crew Snoop Doggy Dog andNine Inch Nails But this summers designated villain outdoes them all MarilynManson who lends his adopted name to his band is a minister in the Church ofSatan the selfproclaimed Antichrist Superstar and the perfect cartoonfiend Already this year concert halls in Alaska Idaho Texas andMassachusetts have canceled Manson shows while South Carolina has paid Manson not to play In recent weeks the band has had to threaten alawsuit in order to perform in Richmond Va and has filed a lawsuit in orderto perform in New Jersey Utah has blacklisted Manson because he once shreddeda Mormon Bible onstage and Christian groups picket outside every venue heplays            They havepicked an easy target Marilyn Manson plays music that is called depending onwhos doing the calling death metal industrial gothic glam metalshock rock or sleazy industrocrunch Or perhaps most accuratelyYearOld White Boy musicthe kind of sonic pollution that no one but a boyhigh on testosterone could enjoy What this means is huge distorted guitarnoise a thumping backbeat lots of screechy fuzz and vocals that are usuallydroned occasionally screamed or hissed It also means ferocious lyricsMansons songs are a foul stew of obscenity violence Satanism scatologyantiChristian invective sadomasochism and suicide For example            I amthe god of Fuck Cash in hand and dick on screen who said god was everclean Biblebelt round Anglowaste  sic  putting sinners in theirplace Yeah right great If youre so good explain the shit stains on yourface            The yearold Mansons public image is as creepy as hismusic He and fellow band members have adopted female pop icons first namesand murderers last names my favorite Madonna Wayne Gacy Manson whosegiven name is Brian Warner cakes his face with alabaster makeup and wearsandrogynous ragged leather clothes He looks like the Grim Reaper after anasty motorcycle accident His concerts are frenzied He lacerates his chestwith broken bottles rips Bibles apart and uses an American flag as toiletpaper The bands videos are filled with freakish images of medical odditiesIts Tshirts are decorated with pentagrams and slogans like Kill God KillYour Mom and Dad Kill Yourself Needless to say kids eat this up The mostrecent album Antichrist Superstar  debuted at No  on the Billboardcharts and has sold more than  million copies The album was released byofcourseInterscope Records the label that brought you Snoop Doggy Dog TupacShakur and Nine Inch Nails Any male under  knows of course that MarilynManson isnt the first band to combine horrormovie imagery crudetheatricality and antisocial lyricsBlack Sabbath did it in the s andMtley Cre did it in the s But Manson is more horrible more crudemore theatrical and more antisocial than any of its antecedents            And moreridiculous You wouldnt think that anyone could take this kind of rockgrandiosity seriously after seeing This Is Spinal Tap  but they doRolling Stone champions Manson as the conscience of American musicNever has there been a rock star quite as complex as Marilyn Manson NeverManson is lionized for speaking the truths that no one wants to hear thatChristianity is false that conventional morality is stifling and so on Noone takes Mansons philosophizing more seriously than Manson himself Rock nroll was dangerously close to becoming completely boring until Marilyn Mansoncame along he said in a recent interview            Unlike earlier shock rockers such as Dee Sniderof Twisted Sister or Gene Simmons of Kiss Manson isnt a jokester He honestlybelieves himself to be Marilyn Manson the embodiment of the worlds greatoppositesman and woman icon and villain Christ and Satan He believes toothat his music has deep social significance He cites his intellectualinfluences to reportersNietzsche Darwin Roald Dahl Dr Seuss the BibleAnton LeVayand delivers the kind of muddled rants that adolescents mistakefor wisdom In his newsletter for example he writes We are Americas shitand they should be ashamed of what they have eaten Fortunately you havereceived this in time to escape the encroaching HOLOCAUST of fascist christian sic  morality            Notsurprisingly the Christian Coalition the Catholic League and the AmericanFamily Association have taken up arms against Manson The silly juvenilerocker vs the prudish humorless censors You want both sides to lose            Earlier battles over offensive music were fought ontelevision and in print But the Manson fight is shaping up as one of theInternets first great Kulturkampfs  The Gulf Coast branch of the AFAposted affidavits about Manson concerts on its Web site The affidavitsclaimed that Manson passes out bags of drugs to his audiences that he raped adog onstage had anal and oral sex onstage threw puppies and kittens into thecrowd to be torn apart and led Satanic services that included a virginsacrifice The affidavits also attest that he watched friends stab a woman todeath and bathe in her blood Emailed around the country the affidavitsgalvanized ministers and Christian Coalition members to organize protests anddemand concert cancellations            The Mansonband and its fans have retaliated in kind The band is threatening to sue theAFA for libel and defamation The Gulf Coast AFA has yanked the affidavits offits site Manson fans have parodied the Gulf Coast page and organized theirown online Portrait of an American Family Association which takes its namefrom a Manson album There are dozens of POAAFA chapter Web sites some ofwhich counteract the false affidavits by publishing concertgoers accounts ofManson shows glass laceration no sex            The Manson fight is a morality play in whicheveryone wins The decency folks get to make headlines shock consciences andstop concerts Manson gets to paint himself as a First Amendment martyr andkeep selling records The good times wont last The shelf life of preteenbands is measured in months When the censors and parents stop complaining thekids will stop listening and the band will fade away            But there may be someconsolation for Marilyn Manson himself Here it is instructive to rememberAlice Cooper the musician to whom Manson owes most A quarter century agoCooper sold the same kind of horror show to his teen fans as Manson does now agenderbending female name pancake makeup raucous music an onstageguillotine and preposterous grossout legends Cooper allegedly filledballoons with live worms released them above the audience then popped themshowering fans with night crawlers Cooper was condemned reviled and for abrief time incredibly popular In recent years hes made a revival He playedhimself campily in Waynes World  He draws thousands of fans to hisgoofy selfconsciously bombastic concerts Marilyn Manson is darker moreserious and more vicious than Alice Cooper was Even so you can imagine acomeback in  shredding Bibles to a laugh track
