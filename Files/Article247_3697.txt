                                 Two Cheers for the SAT                        Dear David            I do look forward to your book some of which or atleast some of the research reports for I have been reading in theWeekly Standard and elsewhere It is a strangesituation we have with our current elite as you point out In some othercountries where there is affirmative action it is a majority that imposesaffirmative action for itself for example the Malays in Malaysia Here wehave it for a small minority the key beneficiary is the black population percent of the total and university presidents almost all major foundationheads etcdefend this system vigorously even though it reduces perhaps onlyminimally its own advantages You point out quite correctly that at the verytop levels the resentment is very muted and hardly visible see the hugemajorities of students in elite colleges who say diversity is a good thing andwe should have more in the Bowen and Bok book TheShape of the River  Its the people educated at Yale in Lemanns accountwho are the most vigorous defenders of affirmative action in California Thereis not only Molly Munger but also Bill Lann Lee now the assistant attorneygeneral in charge of civil rights The resentment seems to be somewhat greaterat the University of Texas and the University of Michigan which are certainlyelite within their states but fall short of the very top national elite levelAnd as you point out it is the middle classes and I would add the upperworking class that seem most resentful even though the children of the latterwill go neither to the Ivy Leagues nor the flagship state universities At theplaces their children will go to racial preference doesnt play much of arole Clearly selfinterest is not playing the decisive role in the struggleover affirmative action I would suggest it is ideology that makes for thedivision and yes the ideology of the elite is equality and that of themiddle classes is opportunity There are some oddities here not the least ofwhich is that the struggle over affirmative action is waged most vigorouslyover admissions to colleges and universities and one hears less and less aboutimportant cases in the area of employment But it is there I would think thatthose who voted against CCRI would feel the bite of affirmative action morebecause of its commonness in employment for policemen firemen and much otherpublic employment and its prominence in the hiring and promotion policies ofbig corporations            In view of the fact that the present system forselecting elites selects one that is critical of the system concerned aboutinequality and greater opportunity one wonders why Lemann is complaining Hewrites that the most unfair system of distributing opportunity would be one inwhich all roles were handed down explicitly by inheritance But then thesecond most unfair system  could well be one that allowed for competitionbut insisted that it take place as early in life as possible and with school asthe arena His discomfort with the SAT is that its an intelligence test thatprimarily selects people who are good at testtaking and school His realproblem is to define a less unfair system            As a matter of fact he is unfair in describing thepresent system It is not totally dependant on the tests There are theathletes and the alumni children and the occasional student who is very good atsomething even though his test scores are not at the top And of course thereis affirmative action in most selective institutions and that may be as manyas  percent of all colleges and universities for blacks and Hispanics andAmerican Indians So it is a meritocratic system considerably modified            So what is the problem Unfairness because of earlyselection Actually if we made the selection even earlier the differencesbetween the majority and minority students would probably be smaller And byinternational standards we dont make the selection so early In England thereused to be maybe there still is an plus exam that makes the selection at avery early age on the continent too students are divided between secondaryschools that lead to university and those that do not at an earlier age than or  Secondly there are opportunities here to get into the system laterThere are community colleges from which you can transfer all the way to theelite campuses of the state university Few do but there is theopportunity            Is the problem that the arena is school Here Lemannhas a stronger point but no society has been able to figure out a betterarena even though school is not the best place to learn how to become anentrepreneur or a politician run a business or a country become an artistetc How the school system became the great selector even though it selectspeople on the basis of talents that are not directly related to many importantsocial roles is a mystery to me But its happened everywhere in the mostdiverse cultures I recall that even in ancient China administrators of theempire were selected on the basis of competence in the ancient classics Theonly justification for the present system is that intelligence is useful in anytask and that the only fair and systematic way we have of determiningintelligence is by way of a uniform test poor as that may be Lemanns task isto define the alternative            At the end of his account of Molly Mungers fightagainst the CCRI and her deflation when after all her efforts it succeedsLemann tells us that she has left civilrights work and has started a neworganization devoted to improving education for the poor Lemann while he isonly reporting this seems to approve So maybe the only problem or the mainproblem is not the test not selection on the basis of verbal and mathematicalcompetencewhich is all the test doesbut trying harder to get those whoordinarily do poorly on such tests to do better But that opens another can ofworms and Lemanns stab at the enormously difficult problem of improvingeducation at the lower levels is not too encouraging We should adopt the goalof sending most people all the way through college  To get more peoplethrough college we shall have to establish greater national authority overeducation High schools should  teach a nationally agreed uponcurriculum One wonders if he has been following the efforts to createnational standards Of course this is only a somewhat tackedon addendum towhat is on the whole a good book but it does confront us with the questionWhat is the alternative to the present system            This has not been much of a debate I realize We seemto agree that whatever its flaws in logic and in practice we cant think of aclearly better system I have the impression if we had a talk with Lemann hemight agree and we wouldnt disagree with him when he insisted that the mainthing to do is to improve education But we would probably disagree over thespecifics as to how one does it            Nat
