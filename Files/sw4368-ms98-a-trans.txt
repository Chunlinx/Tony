        what do you do in terms of exercise if anything      exercising exercising um i play wally uh wally ball are you familiar with that   no im not   i belong to a club uh uh near where i live or uh actually where i work uh in Salem New Hampshire and they uh its on a racquet ball court and you set up a net and you play wally ball its just like volley ball but with some of the rules of racquet ball in that you can use the walls to help put the ball over or that type of thing   wow   uh so its its kind of more fast paced than uh volley ball     how many people play   uh you can play up to uh four or five on each side which is quite a few people in such a small space   i bet   um uh but we usually play two and two uh sometimes three uh three and three depending on how many people are willing to get up that early since we play before work       uh so we play that a couple of times a week and then i also play pick up games of basketball basketball in the mornings as well so uh thats usually the extent of my exercise       its kind of crazy   well i take a an aerobics class three nights a week   huh   and its at the fitness center i actually work for an electronics company but we have a a fitness center at there at the building   oh really   and i take uh this aerobics class which is a great class its what they call a circuit class where you do a few minutes of aerobic exercise and then you break and do some weight work   yeah   with hand weights and then back to the aerobics and then maybe back to the elastic bands or whatnot but its its broken up for an hour   now are these is this what they call high impact or is this   no no this is low impact this is safe stuff     now is the high impact really that dangerous for you   i i think it is um i took a a high low impact class at the local Y a couple of years ago and it just seemed like i was on the verge of getting hurt in terms of knees or back or something like that   wow   uh   that thats amazing id taken some dance courses in in uh school and i dont know it uh they seem like they would be classified as high impact but maybe there was more flow to it so it wasnt so jarring   yeah well i think the trouble with high impact aerobics is that its so jarring and you dont with the low impact you always have one foot on the floor   oh okay   you can get pretty strenuous doing that sort of stuff     well see thats the thing i see some of these people doing low impact and im like whats the difference  these people are really working up a sweat   yeah well i think it has to do with number of feet on the floor and how much bouncing around you do and that sort of thing like the class im in now does not do jumping jacks   right huh okay   but we   cause both feet cant be on the floor at one time   right but but we certainly get our heart rates up   huh   just from the the marching and and all that that we do so   which is i guess the whole point of it   yeah i think so   now they you say do this at work   it its at a fitness center thats associated with the company where i work yes   do you have to pay to do that or is it part of your benefits   uh no i have to pay to join   oh okay   uh but it runs oh i think the class is lets see i pay about ten dollars a month to be a member of this fitness center   huh   and and there are all sorts of opportunities available there in term you know any anything from chess clubs to flying clubs  you think       and uh then its an extra forty dollars for an eight weeks aerobics class and i think its pretty competitive with most health most health centers and they they have a swimming pool and a gym and all kinds of   huh oh yeah   of all kinds of the Nautilus equipment   i was going to say do they have the free weights circuit and the Nautilus circuit and all those things   yes i i did some of that but it the time it takes is just   exactly   it uh i dont know once i i get through with the aerobics session im ready to go home and eat dinner or something     so you so you exercise in the evenings   yes   thats interesting uh i i dont know it my schedule i guess is more i get up at about uh five thirty and then i go and play wally ball from six thirty to say eight and then i uh shave and shower and do that stuff uh at the gym and then im at work at eight thirty   uhhuh   so its all kind of in the in the in the morning but by the end by mid afternoon im like ugh         or depending on how the game went it could be like that right after uh right in the morning getting to work   yeah well   so it its interesting a different schedule um uh you dont feel more tired toward i guess well i guess you would uh going home for dinner and then youre uh and then youre uh i im sure zonked   well the advantage is sometimes im too tired to eat         now i mean they really offer classes in the mornings and theres even one class at noon but i cant really see breaking up the middle of the day going off and doing aerobics taking a shower getting back to work   yeah no i know some people who do that as well and i cant understand that either i mean you know i in the morning i come to uh uh work with uh wet hair and you know and kind of uh not breathless but just
