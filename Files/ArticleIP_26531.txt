The strong USpublic support for NATOs intervention could weaken in the face ofindecisiveness it said If Mr Clinton is to avoid a groundswell of get outhe must show that he is prepared to go in with

theIndependent  carried no war editorials Monday but theGuardian ran one in praise of the Rev Jesse Jackson whose triumph ingetting the three servicemen released has been greeted with cynicism by theUS political establishment Saying it was time for such cynicism to stop thepaper claimed that for all his media grandstanding and his repeated failureto see major projects through he remains an inspiration for millions ofAmericans not least in motivating them to vote Moreover he continues toadvocate the integrationist ideal of his mentor Martin Luther King it saidThe picture of him linking arms with the white and Hispanic soldiers willexert great power in the United States and Jesse Jackson should be applaudedfor making it happen it added            The Independent ran a bitter commentary byits veteran war correspondent Robert Fisk comparing the attention paid to therelease of the three soldiers in Belgrade to that of the deaths of  civiliansin a NATO bomb attack that destroyed a bus last Saturday Noting that NATOsonly comment on the latter event was the passive phrase it is regrettedFisk said NATO wants us to believe that it has reserved its sorrow for theAlbanian refugees expelled from Kosovo But personally he didnt believe thatNATO feels this sense of outrage as strongly as it claims He compared NATOsattitude to that of a person who crosses a city street to help an innocentcivilian who is being attacked What NATO has donefaced with the atrocitiesof Kosovohas been to stay on the other side of the road to make a note ofthe criminals address and to throw stones through the window of his homelater that night he wrote Not a single NATO life has been lost in fiveweeks of war in the Balkansbecause we do not regard the catastrophe of theKosovo Albanians as worth a single NATO life Its as simple as that            In an interview with the French Sunday newspaperLe Journal du Dimanche  Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov saidMoscow would be willing to

Repubblica of Rome Monday one of its correspondents inBelgrade reported that Politika  the most widely read newspaper of theYugoslav capital has maintained its circulation during the war despite beingdespised as a Milosevic mouthpiece This was entirely due to its daily fivepages of death announcements the correspondent Biljana Sbrljanovic wrotealthough the number of these announcements has not grown since the NATO bombingstarted For the Serbs these illustrated death notices were more importantthan death itself because if Politika doesnt publish your photographit is as if you havent died The regime is now censoring the deathannouncements in order to conceal the number and the identities of the victimsof NATOs bombs she wrote but Sunday one notice slipped past the censors ayoung woman employee of the bombed Belgrade TV station whose body had only justbeen found The announcement said enigmatically that she had been a victimof the assassins who came from the sky and of those who came
