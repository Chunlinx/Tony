                                 Policing and the Crack Epidemic                        Dear George            Its too bad that lifes daily routine has to interrupt our correspondenceI am sure that by the time we get the rhythm our week will have ended While Ihave read some of your work and even used it in classes clearly I should havegot to know you before this week            One of the most disturbing trends in public policy has been the distortionof socialscience research to support an ideological agenda As you point outthis abuse has been practiced on the left and the right Criminaljusticepolicy and urban policy have been two big targets of the ideological wars inAmerican politics I dont know if you saw the article in Dissent inwhich Michael Tomasky maintained that liberals disagreed with your brokenwindows theory and that the policies of liberal mayors caused the increase incrime in Americas cities between  and  I had a piece in the sameissue that pointed out that your theory was not ideologically based Youmentioned that you were asked to help reduce subway crime in New York duringthe s While the MTA runs the subways in New York the mayor Ed Koch aprogressive Democract was directly involved in funding and implementing yourstrategy Also it was Mayor David Dinkins who found the money to hire more police officers in New York under his Safe Streets Safe Cities programIn fact most people who give Giuliani all the credit for New Yorks decliningcrime rate dont know that crime started to drop during the last two years ofthe Dinkins administration Moreover as you know crime has been declining inevery major city in the country While Giulianis policies may have providedvalue added for New York its hard to argue causation for local policies whenthere is a national trend at work            This actually brings me to an article on the front page of SundaysSeptember  New York Times  The article is about crack use in poorcommunities in the inner city A recent study by the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention in Atlanta is cited by the Times  The study foundthat diminished gang warfare related to crack has been the major reason for thesharp drop in violent crime nationwide At the same time the annual survey ofdrug use by the National Institute for Justice shows a change in attitude bythe young They are simply not using crack even when they are using otherdrugs I cite all this evidence because I cant help but take social scienceseriously The conclusion of the article is that the decline in urban crime isprimarily due to the decline in crack use and not changes in policing Italways struck me as strange that in the period when crime was increasing incities politicians blamed the problem on the pathologies in the innercitycommunities However once crime declined it was the police who got all thecredit No one bothered to check until now whether something might havechanged in these communities I know this is your terrain What do youthink            Warmest regardsEster
