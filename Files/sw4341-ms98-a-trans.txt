        okay looks like were ready to go capital punishment uh the problem i have with capital punishment is that uh uh its supposed to be a deterrent to crime but i dont think that it really actually does that i dont think it deters anybody because most of the time crimes are uh are committed without without any thought to the consequences and they dont think that uh stop and think and say well maybe i shouldnt do this uh because uh i might get the gas chamber or something like that they worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it and uh how about you   well i think that in some cases it is warranted especially   uhhuh i do too yep   and i dont i think in some cases it doesnt matter if its a deterrent or not   uhhuh yeah you still have to do it i i   i mean i mean im thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer or   umhum so youre in youre in favor of capital punishment then   well for some things i think for serial murderer it is warranted because if a person   right umhum   who would do something like that in cold blood   umhum needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society   i mean you cant guarantee that they wouldnt escape from prison   right and then do it all over again umhum   and do it again and i dont think that that rehabilitation is effective   right have to agree with you and im kind of in in favor of capital punishment also i just dont think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes but i tend to agree with you that uh we should have it  i just i dont know that its always effective  but i guess we uh were kind of stuck with it its its a difficult uh problem isnt it to determine how youre going to punish somebody for a particular crime uh   but then you know i think that that some murderers dont really warrant capital punishment you know just like for example um   umhum   you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them and i dont think that would really warrant capital punishment   umhum right umhum umhum huh do you think they should be punished at all or uh  like go to prison uh because theyre not really a danger to society it was almost really self defense isnt it in a case like that   um it is to a certain extent but   umhum   i think i dont know because   i know they put uh put them in jail sometimes i guess uh   i think in certain and it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available   umhum umhum um umhum you know now i wonder what you think about this and uh unfortunately we we dont get to do it but uh it used to be a long time ago i guess in Biblical times  when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment so if somebody killed somebody in your family  then you had the right to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person and i know that uh if somebody had done something to my family i would feel that i had the right to to get revenge on them and uh  but i i dont think thats done much anywhere  thats kind of drastic punishment   well i think that would be kind of drastic punishment   right   and   might make you feel better but   but one thing i think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation   umhum   then that chance should should be investigated   right   but like i said if if someone is is just pathologically   umhum   going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society   right uhhuh right because they are a danger to everybody else huh thats interesting i have to uh agree with that theres a lot of folks probably that are in prison that uh that arent really a danger to society huh and uh   but and a lot of people that are a danger to society that arent in prison   right right probably more of them then the other way around huh interesting i dont i dont not sure i im in Washington D C or at least very close to it im not sure what kind of uh capital punishment we have here   well i know in North Carolina we do have capital punishment and im really im from South Carolina   umhum
