                                 The C Word            Cynics think postelectionspin is just a onedimensional game of manipulating expectations and persuadingthe media that you surpassed them For the most part thats true But spin canalso be profound It can address more than whos up and whos down It canredefine people issues and events by rotating their facets so that people seethem from new perspectives For this reason the contest of interpretation thatconsumes the  hours after an election is as important as the election itselfIt defines the election and its mandate            This iswhats happening to Newt Gingrich and the Republican Party in the wake ofTuesdays elections Gingrich has built a career and a movement by manipulatingterms such as liberal and welfare state to caricature and marginalize hisenemies Now the tables are turned The word conservative is beingmanipulated by Gingrichs enemies and the media to caricature and marginalizeRepublicans If Gingrich isnt careful the C word could go the way of the Lword and conservatives could go the way of liberals            Around  on Election Night under fire from journalistsover the GOPs mounting disappointments Republican flacks began falling backon their safest success story the victories of George W and Jeb Bush in theTexas and Florida gubernatorial races This defensive maneuver quashed onedangerous story lineWhy are all the Republicans losingat the expense ofopening another Why are all the Republicans except the Bush boys losing            The mediatook up this question and over the next two hours hammered out a consensusModerate Republicans were winning while ideologues were losing The Bushboys became Exhibits A and B As network anchors and analysts batted around andrefined the theory the previously sacrosanct C word began to creep into thediscussion alongside rightwing and extremist Bad night forconservatives declared ABCs Peter Jennings CNNs Bill Schneider contrastedthe success of the GOPs moderate governors wing with the defeat of thecongressional wing thats been dominated by conservative ideologues ByWednesday morning reporters such as Bill Plante of CBS were recycling theconventional wisdom that the losers were Republican conservatives            Political factions on all sides encouraged thistheory Moderate Republicans such as New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani angling foradvantage within the GOP touted the Bush brothers as evidence that the partyshould spread a broader tent Gloomy conservative pundits eager to fingerculprits accused congressional Republicans of having provoked needlesshostility            The threemost accomplished spinners of the Clinton White House egged on the conflict OnCNN Mike McCurry predicted that rightwing Republicans in Congress wouldnttake kindly to George W Bushs conservatism with a compassionate face Thisdeliciously backhanded phrasean allusion to Czechoslovakias socialism witha human face which was crushed by Soviet tanks in conveyed threecorrosive messages that conservatism lacked compassion to begin with thatconservatives couldnt tolerate compassion and that for this reasonconservatism like socialism was doomed On ABCs Nightline  GeorgeStephanopoulos predicted a civil war between the conservatives and themoderates citing the Bushes and other Republican governors as leaders of thelatter faction Rahm Emanuel predicted that the extreme right would tightenits control over the GOPs moderates Before the night was over Jennings wasasking whether were going to see a real power struggle now between moderateRepublican governors and the leadership in Congress and ABC analyst GeorgeWill was predicting a showdown in  with moderates rallying around GeorgeW Bush            If the consensus interpretation of the  elections isthat moderates won and conservatives lostand that the Bush boys representwhat moderates are and what conservatives arentthen conservatism as a wordand as a philosophy is in deep trouble This is what happened to liberalismtwo decades ago It became associated with everything on the left that seemedimmoderate If conversely conservatism were to become associated witheverything on the right that seems immoderate today the list would include theStarr investigation moral intolerance racism and disregard for the materialconcerns of ordinary people            These wereprecisely the associations pasted on conservatism in the decisive hours afterTuesdays elections TV reporters and analysts repeatedly identifiedconservative ideologues with the impeachment inquiry They portrayed theChristian Coalition as conservatisms standardbearer declared the coalitionscandidates losers and contrasted this with the success of the centristpragmatic Republican governors They exalted the Bush brothers outreach toblacks hispanics and women and implied that other Republicans had writtenoff these groups Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah agreed on Nightline that theGOP had neglected women and ethnic minorities By Wednesday morning NBCs TimRussert and ABCs Cokie Roberts were chiding the GOP for confining its appealsto white men            Just as liberalism was reduced to a synonym forweakness conservatism is being reduced to a synonym for meanness Even thedefeat of Sen Al DAmato RNY who was renowned for gobbling up federalpork and was endorsed by the nations leading gay rights group is beingcelebrated by the New York Times as a public verdict on thebareknuckle style of Republicanism that has become the fashion in Washingtonin contrast to the conciliatory style of moderate Republicans Worse yetconservatives enthusiasm for the impeachment inquiry and for moral issues ingeneral is being framed as a distraction from material concerns such as healthcare education and retirement security On NBCs Today show Wednesdaymorning Russert declared the gubernatorial contest in Alabama a veryinstructive race The Republican Fob James according to business leaders downthere emphasized prayer in school rather than jobs for kids who graduate fromschool Russert concluded The perception is that House Republicans aremore interested in cultural issues in philosophy and ideology than they arein the pragmatic performance of Republican governors            Gingrichthe maestro of demonization recognizes this unfolding catastrophe and isdesperately trying to avert it He appeared on every network Tuesday night toinsist that the Bush brothers and other victorious Republican governors such asGeorge Pataki New York John Rowland Connecticut Tommy ThompsonWisconsin and John Engler Michigan were conservatives He argued thatthese governors shared the congressional Republican agenda enshrined in the Contract With America Every single one of them is a taxcuttingreformthegovernment conservative Republican Gingrich declared on ABC Thenext morning at his postelection news conference Gingrich accused the mediaof misrepresenting the victorious governors as moderates rather thanconservatives And he pointed out that indisputably conservative candidates hadwon contests such as the Senate races in Illinois and Kentucky            Gingrich has a point In their haste to proclaim Tuesdayselections a repudiation of conservatism the media have oversimplified somewinners as moderates and some losers as conservatives Results that dont fitthe theory such as the defeat of Matt Fong in the California Senate race havesimply been ignoredas has the fact that the Republicans retained theirmajorities in both houses Meanwhile plenty of other good explanations havebeen offered for the GOPs setbacks Some analysts think Senate Republicansalienated conservative voters by giving up on tax cuts and caving in to Clintonin the budget negotiations Others blame Republicans for muting substantiveconservative issues such as education reform in a misguided wager that theLewinsky scandal would bring conservative voters to the polls Others blame theGOPs scandal ads for stirring up Democratic voters            Poor Newt Whats being doneto him and his conservative allies this week is just as unfair as what theyvespent their careers
