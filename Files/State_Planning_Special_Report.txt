is bipartisan no more than sixmembers can be of the same political partyLSC was created by Congress in  and continues to play acentral role in providing lowincome Americans with access to legalassistance and information concerning critical civil legalproblems LSC isguided by its congressionally mandated mission spelledout in the LSC Act of  to provide equal access tothe system of justice in our Nation for individuals whoseek redress of grievances and to provide high qualitylegal assistance to those who would otherwise be unableto afford adequate legal counselLSC funds local legal services programs to servediverse clientele in every state county and congressionaldistrict in the United States as well as in Puerto Ricothe Virgin Islands Guam and Micronesia As one of the primaryfunders of civil equal justice in every state LSC has a duty tostimulate the most effective means of delivering legal services tolowincome individuals LSC is committed to meaningfulpartnerships with our grantees and the broader civil equal justicecommunity LSC is also obligated to ensure that the federalinvestment promotes efficient and effective client service andcomplements the efforts of other providers of civil legalservicesIn  Congress passed a major overhaul of LSCs grantmakingand regulatory structure that included three major reformsimpacting the legal services community First Congress adopted anumber of new accountability requirements governing what servicesLSCfunded programs may provide what they may do with nonLSCfunds and whom they may represent These new guidelines haverefocused the LSC delivery system on serving individual clientswith particular legal needs Attorneys working for LSCfundedprograms may no longer for example initiate or participate inclass action lawsuits collect courtawarded attorneys feesrepresent prisoners or certain categories of aliens or take casesinvolving political redistricting abortion or drugrelated publichousing evictions Another major reform of  instituted acompetitive bidding process for LSC service contracts requiringprograms to demonstrate results and progress as a condition ofcontinued federal funding Finally in  Congress approved aonethird reduction in LSCs annual appropriation from million to  millionIn July  in anticipation of the funding cutbacks LSCinitiated the broad outlines of its state planning process tohighlight strategies by which programs could stretch scarce federaldollars to help ensure that all lowincome clients have an equalopportunity to receive the most accessible effective legalassistance possible After three years of development in the fieldLSCs State Planning Initiative was formally launched in  Inthe ensuingLSC Annual AppropriationFiscal YearII LSC CONVENES RECONFIGURATION TASK FORCEThis document the LSC Special Report to Congress  StatePlanning and Reconfiguration was prepared in response to a requestmade by the US House of Representatives during the FYAppropriations process in which the House AppropriationsSubcommittee on Commerce Justice State and the JudiciarystatedThe Committee supports LSCs efforts to streamline its servicearea configurations through the State planning process Howeverthe Committee has been made aware of concerns that LSC hasattempted to impose its own reconfiguration plans on certain Stateswithout clearly articulating standards for such decisions Inseveral instances the Corporation rejected reconfiguration plansdeveloped and approved by all relevant stakeholders within a Stateand provided no opportunity for the State to appeal that decisionThe Committee expects LSC to review the State planning process andthe concerns raised and report back to the Committee by no laterthan September   with a proposal that articulates thereconfiguration standards and process for States to appeal LSCsdecisions The Committee intends that LSC consult with appropriatestakeholders in developing this proposalSince implementation of the State Planning Initiative in LSC has sought to apply a set of detailed criteria in making alldecisions on whether a given service area arrangement is optimallyconfigured to provide highquality legal services to the greatestnumber of eligible lowincome clients These criteria were createdto complement the goals of State Planning and to guide staff inevaluating the efficacy of service area plans submitted byrecognized stakeholders in each state These guidelines wereconveyed to LSCfunded programs through the release of a series ofProgram Letters and other field correspondences Furthermore asof July   all recognized stakeholders have a right to a denovo review of service area decisions by both the LSC VicePresident for Programs and the LSC President when LSC decisions runcontrary to stakeholders proposed configuration schemesIn response to inquiries from the legal services community andMembers of Congress the LSC Board of Directors on June  established the LSC Task Force to Study and Report on Configurationof Service Areas The Task Force was charged with reviewingexisting policies standards and procedures governing stateplanning and for defining service areas and any revisions toexisting policies standards and procedures which the Task Forceconcludes to warrant serious consideration by LSCCochaired by two LSC Board members New Hampshire Supreme CourtJustice John T Broderick and Ernestine Watlington the Task Forceconvened the first of several meetings on August   inWashington DC Representing the Task Force were Hulett H Askewand Maria Luisa Mercado of the LSC Board James Head of theNational Legal Aid  Defender Association MelvilleD Miller Jr of Legal Services of New Jersey Jonathan Rossofthe American Bar Associations Standing Committee on Legal Aidand Indigent Defendants Faith Rivers of the South Carolina BarAssociation and Jeanne Charn director of Clinical Legal Educationat Harvard Law SchoolJustice Broderick delivered an interim report from the TaskForce to the LSC Board of Directors at the Boards meeting onSeptember   in Alexandria Va Broderick reported that theTask Force has made considerable progress in examining concernspertinent to service area configuration and the right of designatedstakeholders to appeal decisions with which they disagree Hestated that broad consensus exists on a majority of issues beforethe Task Force and that remaining areas of disagreement areexpected to be resolved in short order One specific area ofconsensus among Task Force members was that all LSC reconfigurationcriteria should be codified into one document The current LSCreconfiguration standards which are under review by the TaskForce are compiled and discussed in Section IV of this SpecialReport to CongressA final report from the Task Force is expected to be presentedto the LSC Board of Directors for consideration in October The LSC Board will give due consideration to any and allrecommendations embodied in the Task Forces final report In theinterim the Board believes it crucial to relay to Congress LSCscurrent standards governing state planning service areaconfiguration and review processesIn this report the LSC Board of Directors is pleased to provideinformation addressing Congresss three principal concerns  A Review of the State Planning ProcessA Report on LSCs Reconfiguration StandardsandThe Process to Appeal LSCs ReconfigurationDecisionsIII AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATE PLANNING PROCESSLSCs State Planning Initiativeembraces a new vision for legal services in which eligibleclients in every state would be afforded an equal opportunity toavail themselves of highquality civil legal assistance In aneffort to foster more consistent levels of statewide service and to eliminate service gaps that leave clients in geographically remote areas underrepresented compared to their urban counterparts LSC has asked its grantees to undergo a fundamental paradigm shift in their program visions Program leaders have been instructed to abandon the parochial thinking of Whats best for clients in myservice area and asked instead to consider Whats bestfor clients throughout my stateLSC initially stressed the importance of state planning in  when it asked its recipients in each state toparticipate in the development of plans for the design configuration and operation of LSCfunded programs in theirstates The  Program Letters containing this directivealso enumerated the issues and criteria that state planningshould addressLaunching the State Planning Initiative LSCstaff developed and issued Program Letters  and which directed programs to plan for the creation of comprehensiveintegrated clientcentered legal services systems and defined theterms of such systems Grantees were required to submit reportsoutlining their state plans by October   Their plans were toinclude responses to the seven central tenets of State Planning development of intake advice and referral services effective usage of technology  increased access to legalselfhelp and prevention information  coordination of legalwork training information and expert assistance  engagement of pro bono attorneys development of additional state local and private resources and optimal configuration of service areasIn designing state plans LSC instructed its programs tocollaborate with a range of local state and nationalstakeholders including state and local bar associations InterestOn Lawyers Trust Account IOLTA administrators state judiciariesclient groups pro bono commissions state legislaturesnonLSCfunded legal services programs and a host of others LSCrequires its grantees in each state to work with each other andequal justice stakeholders to develop justice communities that bestrespond to clients most compelling needs ensure the moststrategic and costeffective use of all available resources andmaximize the opportunity for clients statewide to receive timelyeffective and appropriate legal servicesGuided by the belief that access to quality legal services iscritical to a fair adversarial justice system and committed tomaking significant improvements in their delivery the LSC Board ofDirectors approved and enacted Strategic Directions  inJanuary  Its twin objectives are to dramatically increase thenumber of lowincome Americans who can access the civil justicesystem and to ensure that all clients receive quality legalservicesIV REPORT ON LSCS RECONFIGURATION STANDARDSCongress has vested in Legal Services Corporation theresponsibility of specifying the service areas for which it willoffer grants for the provision of legal services LSC awards oneservice contract per delineated service area Some states likeCalifornia and New Jersey comprise multiple service areas andtherefore feature multiple LSCfunded grantees Others likeIndiana and Colorado have one service area encompassing the entirestate and one corresponding statewide programEach state is different and in some states intrastate regionsdiffer significantly as well As LSC has stated in numerous lettersto the field there is no magic number of legal services programsfor a given state or a single delivery model that fits every stateEach state plan must be viewed based on the totality of thecircumstances with the bottomline consideration turning on LSCsstudied determination as to whether a given service areaconfiguration inures to the benefit of the greatest number ofclients in the most costeffective wayAs a general rule service area configuration decisions areevaluated against one overarching principle Program configurationshould occur in a manner that maximizes the effective and efficientdelivery of high quality legal services to eligible clientsthroughout the state within a comprehensive integrated deliverysystem In some states it may be possible to develop and implementstatewide initiatives to improve service delivery increaseresources and enhance the capacity of the system to meet the civillegal needs of all lowincome people without altering service areasor historical relationships In other states the very developmentand implementation of such initiatives may require overhauling orestablishing new organizational relationships and serviceareasIn the vast majority of cases LSC has agreed with therecommendations of state planning groups throughout the country andhas configured service areas accordingly However LSC in theproper exercise of its statutory authority may sometimes reject astate plan as insufficiently responsive to the tenets of StatePlanning and substitute a reconfiguration plan adjudged to bettermaximize effective and efficient delivery of high quality legalservicesIn deciding to accept or reject a proposed state plan LSC mustultimately determine whether when taken together with strategiesoutlined in the plan in question the proposed configuration isbest calibrated toUntil the implementation of the State Planning Initiativedetermining service areas in a given state was more a product ofgeographic and historical happenstance than a reasoned judgmentabout the precise configuration that would yield the best legalservices system for the greatest number of clients But Congress reform replacing presumptive refunding of grantees withcompetitive bidding for LSC service contracts coupled with budget cuts of the same year  necessitated athoroughreexamination of the efficacy of existing service areaarrangements in each state With fewer resources to expend and agrowing client base to serve LSC has embraced service areareconfiguration as one important way to insure that grants andcontracts are made so as to provide the most economical andeffective delivery of legal assistance to persons in both urban andrural areas Rather than viewing service area reconfiguration asa punitive measure against underperforming programs currentlyreceiving federal funds LSC instead considers statewidereconfiguration to be one of several tools to ensure that federaldollars are being spent in the most efficient costeffectivemanner possible in a way that will result in the best service tothe most lowincome clientsV RECONFIGURATION REVIEW PROCESSOn July   LSC implemented a Reconfiguration Review Process establishing an official framework by whichdesignated state planning bodies may seek review of LSCreconfiguration decisions This formal Review Process guaranteesrepresentatives of every designated state planning body the rightto direct communication with LSC officials at the highest level inseeking reconsideration of an LSC decision The objective of theReview Process is to maximize the potential for full communicationbetween stakeholders and LSC officials before any configurationdecisions are made final and effectiveCentral to the Review Process is the right of designatedstakeholders to de novo reviews of all configuration decisionsfirst by the LSC Vice President for Programs and then by the LSCPresident whose decision is final and binding The Review Processguarantees DSPB representatives a facetoface meeting with theVice President of Programs to make their case If the stateplanning body disagrees with the Vice Presidents decision theymay then request a facetoface meeting with the LSC President toseek reconsideration of the Vice Presidents recommendation Afterdue consideration of the stakeholders ultimate appeal the LSCPresident will promptly advise the state planning body of a finaldecision on configurationLSC is committed to effective communication and coordinationwith designated state planning bodies DSPB on matters in whichdecisions are likely to have a direct impact on other civil equaljustice planning initiatives in a state LSC recognizes theincreasingly active role that state planners have assumed inoverseeing state civil equal justice delivery activities LSCfurther recognizes that its decisions have the potential todirectly affect state funding resource allocation and otherconsiderations In recognition of this crucial symbiosis LSCsReconfiguration Review Process prescribes a clear review mechanismthat guarantees recognized stakeholders a full opportunity to maketheir case At the earliest possible time LSCs state planning team willadvise the DSPB in each state of any issues of concern with respectto service area configuration and provide guidance on how toaddress those concerns consistent with the enumeratedreconfiguration standards To the extent reasonably practical LSCs state planning teamwill work with the DSPB grantees and other stakeholders to fostertimely and effective consideration of issues relating to servicearea reconfiguration LSC will identify in which states if any it proposes todefine new service areas at least sixty  days prior topublishing those service areas in the Federal Register At thattime LSC also will notify the relevant state planning bodies ofpending service area changes If the LSC state planning team recommends a service areaconfiguration that differs from that proposed by the DSPBauthorized representatives of the DSPB may seek a meeting withLSCs Vice President for Programs to ask for reconsideration Therepresentatives will be asked to articulate in writing theirconcerns and objections Upon such a request the VP for Programs will convene afacetoface meeting with the authorized representatives of theDSPB As soon as practical thereafter the VP for Programs shalladvise the DSPB of the service area configuration recommendation tobe forwarded to the LSC President In making the recommendationthe VP for Programs shall be guided by state plannersresponsiveness to the enumerated reconfiguration standards theanalysis and recommendations of the LSC state planning team thearticulated concerns of the DSPB and any other information deemedto be relevant by the VP of Programs If the DSPB is not satisfied with the VP for Programsrecommendation it may seek a meeting with the LSC President to askfor reconsideration The DSPB will be asked to provide anyadditional written information it wishes to be considered to assistthe LSC President in fully and fairly entertaining all concerns andobjections Upon such a request the President will convene afacetoface meeting with the authorized representatives of theDSPB As soon as practical thereafter the LSC President willadvise the DSPB of the final decision on service area configurationin the affected state or territory In making the decision thePresident shall be guided by state planners responsiveness toenumerated reconfiguration standards the analyses andrecommendations of the LSC state planning team and the VP forPrograms the articulated concerns of the DSPB and any otherinformation deemed relevant by the PresidentVI CONCLUSIONCongressional reforms passed in  necessitated a fundamentalshift in how LSC apportions federal dollars to legal servicesproviders across the country The shift to a competitive biddingprocess coupled with sizeable reductions in Legal ServicesCorporations annual budget compelled the LSC Board of Directorsto adopt a new approach to allocating Congress annual investmentin civil equal justice for the poor The expectations underlyingthis new approach have been spelled out in considerable detail inProgram Letters issued broadly to the field and in statebystatecorrespondences between LSCs state planning team and various equaljustice stakeholdersIn the current climate of scarce resources LSC must remaincommitted to pursuing bold new approaches that foster effectivelegal assistance to lowincome clients including overhaulingservice areas adjudged to be insufficiently responsive to thetenets of State Planning In an overwhelming majority of instancesLSC has used the competitive bidding process to forge deeper bondswith its grantees and stakeholders allowing LSC to serve as anactive partner in planting the seeds of comprehensive integratedstate justice communities nationwide In fact stakeholders indozens of states have embraced the new approach fully and reportedback enthusiastically on their progress since initiating their ownstate planning processesLSC understands that organizations can be reluctant to embracemajor change LSC also recognizes that opinions may differ as tothe most appropriate configuration of service areas and thatgrantees and other stakeholders may have a better perspective onhow to best serve clients and enhance access in their states Inrecognition of these tensions LSC has worked diligently since to convey the expectations of the State Planning Initiative and toestablish meaningful partnerships with stakeholders aimed atfostering a new symbiosis between the federal provider andrecipients of legal services funding However if an impasse isultimately reached in a particular state it is critical that LSCmaintain its statutory right to decide the configuration of serviceareas in order to foster greater access and service for alleligible lowincome clientsENDNOTES Legal Services Corporation Act of  as amended   USC  c  LSC Act of   Id at   USC    Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions andAppropriations Act of  Pub L No   Stat  These new LSC
