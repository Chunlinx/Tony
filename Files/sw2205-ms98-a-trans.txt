        well i really enjoy reading the newspaper we get the daily and Dallas Morning News and i try to look at it if i get busy  i dont get a chance to pick it up like this week i noticed several copies have been untouched havent been touched but uh   well do you have time to read the paper in the morning   well not in the morning but um if the well i have two son children and if they uh go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so ill you know maybe go outside and read the paper while theyre playing or  sit in a chair by the window or something   you know a lot a lot of people dont take newspapers at all we we took the Morning News for a while and then uh well weve been taking the Times Herald for ages and then   umhum   uh dog just ran off with my shoe thats off the subject       went outside picked it up and ran off anyway um and then we switched the Morning News but we found we couldnt read enough of it and by the time i got home and had time to to read some but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines   well we i dont take like Time or Newsweek or anything like that but i do like to watch um CNN i have several chores and things to do so it comes on at like the  nine oclock PM and so i will turn that on while im doing some work and i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it   did did you did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about uh Pete Arnett and uh the the news coverage   well  he didnt have too good of opinion of it no i mean yes i did hear that and so um i do try to keep that in mind that whenever youre reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor   well any you know Time magazine and even the news that sometimes that thats why i like some diversity the idea that i we have Time which which we we take from time to time and we the problem is they call up and make this deal you know and well were taking that and and we also hit the Garland   uhhuh   Garland Daily News i guess its it comes out sporadically like twice a week or something but i think whats interesting is that if youre that there uh this   uhhuh   as difficult as he is or as as much as they try they put some bias i had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group and it was interesting that they think that theyre basically impartial   hum   and that but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we dont control the news we just report it the way we the way it is and   uhhuh well i wouldnt think that i would really say that thats not true because um it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates   yes   and so um news stations always tell the story from a certain angle and thats why its a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions you may never get the truth but youll have a variety to choose from   yes and i i thought that was particularly interesting in the the Gulf War that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a a ploy which was um i i find that fascinating that uh   umhum yeah i do too do you ever listen to the radio or any   i listen to KRLD and uh KLIF the news talk radio and i actually listen to CNN radio do you know it was on radio now   umhum no i dont   its on eleven ninety   hum i really um have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of even music and um     well when i go to work i listen   yeah my husband does and its how come he usually calls me sometimes and says oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if its something really interesting and and then ill know to   yeah   to keep an eye out for it but ive got out of the habit of listening to the radio   well with with your you know if youre around the home though and and and can watch TV and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is and then they start repeating everything   umhum   and and so its kind of a oh thats whats interesting is the CNN uh i dont think im trying to think if its much local i listen to a little of that and i listen to a little of ninety point one i im im inveterate switcher   uhhuh   that ninety eight point seven im im eclectic approach   do you have a particular local channel that you watch on television   well i watch channel five but that has to be thats another bias that has to do with the weather reporting im not sure that actually i think channel eight is probably but i know Dave Fox he goes to our church so   umhum um well i am were fairly new to the area and so were still shopping for a favorite channel   well the channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together uh from Oklahoma City and apparently channel eight was way down and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job and then   umhum   theyve been some people move around and uh John Chriswell is anyway the i i dont know do you do you do you seem to can you tell much difference between the local radio TV stations   well i really think so i noticed on channel eight that theres all of the um anchors are seem to be like White Anglo Saxon Protestant type people and they all seem to be you know fairly similar and i kind of prefer a you know some females i dont recall that they have any female anchors and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people   i think that adds to the diversity i think that uh i like that uh there i know you know John Wylie Price i dont know if you kept up but hes been protesting that   umhum yes i have and um i prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because i think youre more more likely to get   yeah and i think he has legitimate argument i mean you can uh i i i grew up in Alabama and so i i have some prejudices   umhum   but i think that i think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station uh im not sure i im   umhum   totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs but i think that uh in some cases there there should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and   yeah   and this kind of thing and i think that Dallas it turns out though from what i understand has quite good i occasionally go to Saint Louis and uh there for a few days and watch the news and and i think Dallas really does have   umhum   have quite good news i think channel eight is the number one uh ABC affiliate in the US i think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he course he pumping his own   oh really well we you know like  all of the stations seem to be pretty good its just we havent found one that weve snuggled into Houston so we had a   whered you move from   a favorite or i did have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news i guess because you get use to you like the anchors and you feel comfortable with them and   yeah it is interesting though it becomes a little of personality in fact the the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me oh long time ago twenty years or so even longer than that twenty one twenty three years ago or so   umhum   twenty four anyway long time ago and and shortly after i got we got here fourteen years ago and uh they had they had fired him uh because he was too  anyway didnt he didnt have the personality and wasnt drawing the crowds and thats interesting is thats thats what the TV stations do theyre trying to get ratings   umhum thats true their job   and i think if we remember that that theyre out after the ratings   thats true so that really effects how they report the news   and some well its like the the Dale Hansen on channel eight little is a sometimes a little too cutesy but i wonder if were coming up on ten minutes have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes   with is he the sports yes i guess it is time to close now so i can run go help put the kids to bed but i have yes its nice byebye   okay well good talking to you good night
