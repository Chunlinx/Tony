                 ive done more painting than i want to talk about in my uh in my time i had a uh um three bedroom two and a half bath two story town house in Atlanta about ten years ago that i started i was just going to touch up paint in a couple of rooms before it was over i wound up painting the entire thing because the more i did it the worse it made everything else look   the rest look   so anyway but that included ceilings walls woodwork and everything and and you know i found out number one i can do it you know and i was i was really pleased with the results after it was finally finished but gosh it was a lot of work   yeah but you feel good about it when youve done it yourself and you do save a lot of money   yeah you really do yeah   but its a mess and its hard to find the time   uhhuh it is and well i was fortunate at the time i had a job that uh i uh   yes   it was restrictly an eight hour job and uh so i but that really cut my social life out for gosh i dont know about a month and a half it seems like all i did i mean every spare minute i had a paint brush in my hand or a roller   uhhuh       but like you say it it made a difference and it really increased the value of my property when i sold it im sure   oh yeah oh yeah it does yeah ive painted inside i havent painted outside and thats what i need done now   yeah well my brother and sisterinlaw in Austin uh are just finishing painting the entire outside of their house their house is almost all wood   but um   and what a lot of work that was and they had to scrape it and then   yeah thats the work yeah thats it   yeah and then putty and caulk and paint and i was up there about a month ago and what they had done looked marvelous but i mean the work was tremendous   yeah yeah i dont think ill attempt that myself i i know i wont  yeah ill hire somebody to do that but in fact i had a workman here for a leak that he had to fix and   yeah   for ten dollars he was willing to paint my daughters ceiling so i said go ahead you paint the ceiling and then ill do the walls and that was that was nice   listen you got a great bargain for ten  for ten dollars  let   yeah for ten dollars  he was saying he was chatting and we were having a good old time so he just said all right ten dollars ill do the ceiling   uhhuh i thats incredible i because painting the ceilings is absolutely the worst thing and and especially     yeah it is   especially so so many ceilings have this horrible you know this horrible texture thats just like you know popcorn blown   right right well hers didnt it was just a smooth ceiling but   yeah but but the place that i had in Atlanta that i wound up painting the ceilings everywhere it had a pretty pretty much a lot of texture on and it just was a nightmare to paint and i just you know i   yeah   just i i got it now i accumulated a lot of drop cloths and i had my painting gear that you know the same clothes id just throw them in the washer and you know wear them again and pretty soon they were just you know tiedyed with paint   yeah   but you know painting the ceiling if its not smooth can really be a nightmare   oh yeah i have that in my living room and dining room but we had a leak and the insurance companys gonna pay to do the whole area   wow thats good   so thats gonna be a good deal i wont have to worry about that   yeah what was so funny with my my brother and sisterinlaw in in Austin when they started uh  talking about you know they knew they needed to paint their house and they got some estimates and they were just you know exorbitant so they started going around and and looking at paint colors and they must have looked at five hundred different paint chips and then they finally settled on white   white oh no  oh no   uh but you know there again i you cant go wrong with your good basic white   yeah i guess i i think ill go with an offwhite   uhhuh   im changing everything so   well that was the other thing too after i painted  then i had to go in and uh  change the window treatments because i you know got rid of some old uh uh wallpaper and you know so it went you know not only the paint but i wound up doing quite a few things so uh and changed out some lighting and and so forth and so on put some dimmers in   umhum yeah yeah its all challenging thats for sure ive the whole year its taking me to redecorate my bedroom and my daughters bedroom   umhum   but its pretty i love it ive upholstered walls and made curtains and   who did did you do the walls   i did yeah umhum   did you really im impressed   and it looks so nice because you just take sheets and then everything can match   huh   and it looks really pretty i love it its just real feminine and just real pretty   yeah i like wall upholstery but uh thats something i would never even dream of   so oh its easy oh if you can do all that you could do walls oh theres nothing to it   really huh   you can do a wall in half an hour   youre kidding   huhuh staple gun is all it takes   oh okay did you put anything behind the sheet   i did i put the batting uhhuh and just staple it up there and staple your sheets up and then   yeah uhhuh and thats all it is to it   yeah and then you can glue a little edge around if you want to like i took some eyelet lace and i just hot glued it around the edge   yeah well   but its nothing and its just beautiful i love it   well ill be well ill have to keep that in mind i i just i dont   after just do the rest and
