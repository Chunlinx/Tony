                       WhatsNot to Reich                        With regard to Robert ReichQuote Doctor Jonathan Rauch is either mean foolish or both Most of usin literate America know better than to buy read or in any other way attendto Washington memoirs Such books are produced at a networkmovieoftheweekpace I doubt Reich had time to unpack before his book appeared and are meantto polish up whatever glossy finish the author thinks he or she had left uponcrossing the Beltway It doesnt hurt when journalists talk up otherwiseunremarkable volumes positively or negatively Workaday facts routines thesame old office coffee or the unvarnished truth are precisely not thematter of these books            Rauch naively or cruellyand sanctimoniously skewers Reich for doing exactly what is expected of himReich in his response is only too happy to put on a display of wittywoundedness Rauch strikes back gleeful in his further discovery of docudramaticdistortion in Reichs backhanded selfaggrandizement            On netno pun intended Reich sells a few more novels  I mean books and Rauchrests easy knowing he has done his part                           Robert CCook Evanston Ill

larger pictureReich was painting That picture still seems pretty accurate to me As I readthe transcript of the disputed congressional hearing and then read Reichsaccount of it I could see how Reichs account could be essentially accurateReich may have actually done a better job of painting a picture of the emotionspresent in the roomemotions the transcripts failed to capture Althougheven in the transcripts you could see some definite hostility and sarcasmwhich Rauch seemed to pointedly miss As a working professional journalist Ilike accurate quotes But space should be allowed for a memoir that may not beas accurate in the smallest sense as a daily newspaper As Chief said inOne Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  Its the truth even if it didnthappen             AlexMarshall Norfolk Va                           We Gotthe Beats                        While reading Allen GinsbergsSecret by Paul Berman regarding the poets confession of altering a poemNorman Podhoretz had submitted to the Columbia Review  I was struck by adark thought What if Allen Ginsberg and Norman Podhoretz were the same personWerent both of them noted for taking long sabbaticals They were writers andtherefore in a position to arrange their own schedules correct And Ginsbergwas noted for unleashing many of his more notable works in marathon sessionsunder the influence of controlled substances while Podhoretzs work divergedso far from the liberal mainstream that one could argue it could only haveemerged using similar means            I thinkit behooves Slate in its effort to take over the publicopinion

Beltsville Md                           ApplyLiberally                        I wasenjoying reading Karen Lehrman in the Dialogue on revisionistfeminism until I came across the statement that feminismlikeliberalismrequires equality of opportunity not equality of result Perhapsthat is an accurate description of Ms Lehrmans view of feminism but it isludicrous to apply that description to liberalism Modern liberalism sad tosay has strayed far from the libertarian philosophy of classical liberalismIt is the left after all that continues to defend incomeredistributionprograms regardless of the evidence on their failure It is the left thatcontinues to resist an end to governmentimposed racial and sexualdiscrimination It is the left that props up our loopholeridden tax system byopposing reforms such as the flat tax that are based on treating allAmericans equally Those of us battling for freedom long for the days whenliberalism was based on equality of opportunity instead of equality of resultThat day unfortunately ended a long time ago                           Daniel JMitchell The Heritage FoundationWashington                           In HisElement                        After reading DavidEdelsteins review of The Fifth Element I had decided not to waste my timeseeing such an illogical mess But then I read a rave review in a major paperwhich seemed to agree on every point about the movies plot save onethe otherreviewer thought it was intentionally funny instead of unintentionally dumbSo I went to see it wondering which of these two reviewers had so totallymissed the point Twenty minutes into the film Iand everyone else in thetheaterwas laughing uproariously  The Fifth Element is one of thefunniest most visually stunning satires in years            The problem with Edelsteinsreview is summed up in this observation A good half hour is spent getting thecouple past the flight attendants Its as if Luke Skywalker had to wait aroundfor his billet to be stamped before he could fly off to destroy theDeath Star This is actually an accurate description Imagine various rabidmass murderersand a priesttrying desperately to fool an irritatedbureaucrat into believing theyre legitimate passengers on the last flight outto the resort hotel where the Ultimate Weapon of the Universe has been left ina room Now have them all try to be the same legitimate passenger whohas already boarded Add in some slapstick with one killer getting catapultedinto a massive mountain of garbage How could anyone see this and take itseriously            Now that his column is aregular feature perhaps Edelstein can amuse us with reviews of some oldermovies            The director expects us tobelieve not only that Gene Kelly would dance in the rain while using anumbrella as if it were a cane but also that a symphony orchestra convenientlyhidden from view and under some shelter just happens to be playing a tunewhile he does so            Or perhaps            In an astonishinglyillogical script Mr Allen expects us to believe among other stupiditiesthat a nose flattened by a steamroller would be flexible and bloodless andthat a Volkswagen Beetle would start up after being neglected for  yearsEven minimal research should have informed him that no leadacid battery couldsustain a charge for more than a fraction of that time            I lookforward to reading his future nitpickings I just hope that somewhere along theway he develops a sense of humor                           DanSchwarcz Sharpsburg Pa                           Economists Are People

providing a powerfulcommentary on the sad position of contemporary feminism by publishing HerbertSteins awful fancies Watching the Couples Go By in the same cyberspace as thatspat between Susan Faludi and Karen Lehrman RevisionistFeminism            In a magazine which waswritten by Jacob David Nathan Herbert Bill Paul Ross David StephenMichael John William David Michael Franklin Robert and Mark I was lesssurprised by Steins musings than by your publishing any women at all I dofeel however that his article might more appropriately have been placed underthe Diary heading allowing those of us who dont want to read eroticconfessionals to have neatly avoided it            My real quarrel however iswith Steins contention that I have written these views entirely from thepoint of view of the man That is only natural for me Well sure but only ifit is biologically predetermined that men are incapable of understandingperspectives different from their own My sense based on reading StendhalsOn Love and a number of extraordinarily psychologically astute literaryworks by men is that such a narrow perspective is most assuredly less naturalthan acquired And it is acquired by the perpetuation of precisely the sort ofonesided public conversation as is found at your site            Karen Lehrman indeed seemsof a feather with Herbert Stein She too believes that womens understandingsare naturally biologically bounded by their own limited experiences andbodies and that feminism must therefore focus only on that narrow swathdictated by such bodies The most frightening thing to me about all this talkof nature and biology is that what is really being naturalized is themarginality of female voices If men must naturally write only of men andwomen only of women then feminism and femininity become the only naturalsubjects for women writers and reporters Hence Anne Hollander on fashionSusan Faludi and Karen Lehrman on feminism and a Diary entry by NancyLemann            And therest of politics

Jacob Weisbergs assertion in SpinOut that by employing renowned attorney Robert Bennett to defend himagainst sexual harassment charges President Clinton has lent credence to thosecharges            By hiring an obscureattorney in Arkansas Weisberg contends or by letting his regular lawyerhandle the case Clinton would have sent a compelling signal that the storywas a fantasy Perhaps But that strategy might best have served the presidentin the court of public opinion rather than in a court of law And it wouldcertainly not have served him adequately in the present political climate Keepin mind that this isnt the simple case of a wronged woman quietly makingallegations against a powerful man The presidents accuser Paula Jones hasallowed herself to become a weapon in a much larger and wellknown politicalbattlethat of rightwingers bent on destroying Clintons reputation andcareer The conservative journalists and other reactionaries who have shovedher story onto the nations front pages hope not only to cripple thepresidents ability to control the Republicanled Congress but weaken hissupport among women voters who backed him overwhelmingly for reelection andwill be equally instrumental in promoting Al Gore to the Oval Office in            Clintonhas a plateful of historic tasks ahead of him in the next four years He canill afford the politically motivated distractions posed by Jones and othersHed have been foolhardy not to trust his defense in this case to anexperienced big gun such as Bennett                           J KingstonPierce Seattle
