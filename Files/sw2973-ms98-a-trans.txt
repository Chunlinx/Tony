                    well where what whats good in Washington DC to eat   well i think were very fortunate because um in the past twenty years Washington has really developed a a good number of quality restaurants um mostly although you have your normal continental weve gotten the excellent excellent ethnic restaurants um we have Ethiopian restaurants we have Latin American restaurants um you know besides the normal range of French and Italian and things like that so uh we try to experience because i am Italian background and my husband is Chinese we really try to uh experience quite a bit of difference in cooking styles   well you have a lot to thank your husband for noodles   oh God yeah  but     i live in a great place i live in Berkeley California in what they call the gourmet ghetto its uh   uhhuh   its its its got every well its its a very uh polyglot community you know got every every kind of ethnic background you can think of but   umhum   just up the street is one of one of one of only two five star restaurants on the east coast less than a block i mean on the West Coast i think theres only like four in the US but   oh my well what uhhuh is it continental   uh well no its French actually   it it is French uhhuh   it she uh yeah yeah the the name of it is Chez Penny you may have heard of it but they uh they they  they specialize in flower salads actually   uhhuh and im sure its quite im sure its quite pricey   and they got you know well actually its like thirty five dollars for the meal and thats you know and each night is a different that that theres never the same meal twice   oh so its a price fixed and you go in for the menu that they have   they yeah and you go in you know and of course its booked for months on end   yeah yeah   but they also have a um a uh i understand a buffet or something that you know people can just walk in   oh thats interesting uhhuh   you know combination this is like during the day   what kind of food do you like   oh good     any specific any specific time   oh no no no im one of those people that as long as its good it really doesnt matter   and and youre adventuresome   oh extremely yeah i was one of those kids that would go into a menu go into a restaurant when i was a kid and and and would not order unless i had never had it before   umhum uhhuh uhhuh       well were very fortunate we have we have two sons and ever since they were even even very little they we very adventuresome i mean they tried frogs legs an and they tried rabbit and all sorts of things so uh weve never had to have the problem of picky eaters   well its oh i was a i was a picky eater when i was real young but then i got to the point where i discovered that you know   and umhum   there was something other than than Twinkies in the world     oh well they theyve been theyve been adventuresome since they were i mean even preschoolers theyll they tried anything   oh thats great   yeah so um  its been fun its been great and uh of course in the area of Maryland where we are of course crabs are one of our big delicacies   oh i know i know i i used to live back in North Carolina and i remember going to up to to Richmond James River and wed get  and and flounder you dont we dont get flounder out here on the West Coast   and uhhuh uhhuh oh i know but you get some other kinds of fish that are just wonderful i know that you have abalone out there   yeah thats thats true thats true   and fresh i theres nothing to rely i mean fresh abalone is wonderful   yeah it really is a lot of work but its its good really is   yes yes but uh you know Baltimore also is a wonderful eating city   uh yeah Baltimore Baltimore i saw a movie about Baltimore recently Abalon thats right   im okay okay and Baltimores got some great dining areas its got little  ethnic communities little pockets of ethnicity in the city and its absolutely marvelous the  its sort of one of these underrated cities and theyre some great restaurants there   uhhuh     um it there are mostly um besides the little ethnic things youve got your great seafood places and theres one great German restaurant there called Hausners the owners of which um traveled all over the world and this place is room after room of art so that you feel youre in a museum except its completely over done and its its a real place to bring people for something to talk about and its a very German restaurant theyve got the whole gamut of German dishes   huh   so uh when we go out i guess we look as you said you like to try when you were young something different we try to go out for either two things something to make it a festive occasion and to try something very unusual  or else we go back to a few of our uh for Chinese restaurants we usually follow the chef if we know the chefs in a restaurant and what their specialties are so there are certain Chinese restaurants this is something i learned from my husband where you only eat certain things   sure   and uh other things that they dont produce in you know in quality but other aspect other Chinese restaurants you would eat other things so uh we we do tend to eat out at least once a week sometimes more although with two sons in college now that may be it may be a little less   yes well  uh uh of of course without two two sons its its its also easier to go out isnt it i mean   yes   really you know i mean   it certainly is       so uh whats whats your major consideration when you go out to dinner   well uh basically it its its its its good food and and uh price comes into it some you know not not   umhum yeah which would so its fun to find good food for a reasonable price too   yeah well thats whats really great about where i live here its in in an area thats within you know four or five blocks there must be forty restaurants im not kidding its just uh   umhum oh thats oh well how tempting   its in you know its just just down from the from um University of California Berkeley and uh and its   umhum   and that thats whats good about it is that the the the the prices are extremely reasonable and the competition is so keen that the food really is good so you know you   yeah yeah we have to we have to drive  any restaurant where were not in walking area of any even a store so we do have to drive but within you know within a um fifteen twenty minute drive we have a whole span of of restaurants that we can chose from and unless you go into downtown Washington and the elegant areas uh even the some of the areas in Washington you can get very reasonable and very tasty meals and uh   one one more time what was the name of that restaurant in Baltimore the German   Hausners   Hausners ill   Hausners H A U S N E R S umhum   have to remember that well Linda its been a pleasure talking to you   yeah if you ever get out there well i enjoyed talking with you too all right byebye   all right you have a good one byebye
