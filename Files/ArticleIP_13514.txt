                                 Panetta quotIts All Dick Morris Faultquot            In an interview Monday withthe Corriere della Sera of Milan Italy Leon Panetta the formerWhite House chief of staff lashed out at former Bill Clinton adviser DickMorris and blamed him squarely for Clintons troubles Asked if impeachment hadbeen avoidable Panetta replied Of course All Clinton needed to do was totell the truth at once instead of listening to the advice of hisdoublecrossing exconsultant Dick Morris It was Morris immediately after thescandal exploded a year ago who explained to Clinton that America would neverforgive him for his escapades with Monica I had warned Clinton from thebeginning about the bad influence of that man who cares only about opinionpolls bends with the wind of the moment and doesnt give a damn about moraland political principles            Panetta said Clinton isin a state of enormous anxiety because he knows he has damaged the historicalinheritance which he valued more than anything else His mental equilibriumis preserved by his powers of work and concentration and his ability toseparate problems into categories choosing which drawer to open at a time But grief and rage are eating his liver out Panetta said In reply to aquestion about Hillary he said that she is such an inexhaustible source ofinner strength that it was unthinkable to imagine that she could abandon himjust at this most crucial moment He added Nobody knows how the crisis mayhave affected their marriage but those who know the first lady well know thatshe is a woman of great strength with very broad shoulders            The same Tammy Wynette qualities cannot be credited to theexwife of British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook who left her to marry hisdiary secretary In a new book serialized in the London Sunday Times Margaret Cook excoriates Cook as a serial adulterer liar and drunk Britainsbestselling tabloid the Sun  made the most of the scandal Monday witha frontpage headline asking Would YOU sleep with this mancomplete withphone numbers that allow readers to offer a Yes or No response Robin Cookis frankly no Brad Pitt it said He has been likened in the past to agarden gnome and even a prawn  And the Sun would dearly love to knowthe secret of his pulling power But in an editorial the Sun said heshould not be fired because he performed well over the bombing of Iraq and hasbuilt up a solid relationship with his American opposite number MadeleineAlbright            Both the Sun andthe Sunday Times are owned by Rupert Murdoch who was condemned Mondayin an editorial in the liberal Guardian of London for intrusion into the sad sorry livesof others It said An uncomfortable pattern is beginning to emerge  InBritain Rupert Murdochs News International puts politicians on alert whetherby outing British Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown in the News of theWorld or dishing the dirt on Robin Cook in the Sunday Times  In theUS the Murdochowned New York Post runs later disproved hokum about aBill Clinton lovechild as if doing its bit to drive the president fromoffice            The Guardian concluded that perhaps its timeRupert Murdoch was held to accountnot for his private life as he insists ondoing with politicians but for the poisoning of public life across the globeIn another Murdoch newspaper the Times of London columnist William ReesMogg wrote anoped piece Monday comparing the cases of Clinton and Cook Cast both storiesas novels and ask what is the core of the plot he wrote A mature woman ismarried to a man who is a perpetual

would have otherwise been an excessively visible Americanisolation He wrote To pretend that this was done to strengthen Americanconfidence in Europe and faith in its credibility is frankly to expect too muchof our credulity            In France SundayLe Monde devoted afull page to the alleged role of UNSCOM as a toy of the American espionageservices in Iraq and carried a report from Jerusalem about the decisive roleof Israel in eavesdropping on Baghdad In Israel itself the daily Haaretz led Mondaywith a report that former Foreign Minister Moshe Arens who appointed BenjaminNetanyahu as his
