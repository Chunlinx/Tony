                all right Rob what do you think about uh choosing choosing a college   yeah what should i tell my parents huh   yeah   not being a parent but being a student uh i guess id say theres theres a lot of things   yeah   uh i think they need to provide a lot of guidance during high school   right   preparing them for the college they want to go to and then its a tradeoff between what you know what you got to find out what a kid wants out of college you know is it uh a a social thing or is he looking to make big bucks later with a with a name brand college so to speak   uhhuh   things like you know do you go to S M U you want to spend all that money and get that name or do you you know you you just kind of wasting your time to spend all that money if youre not going to use the degree for something   yeah do you think a child in high school could know what they want in a college   i dont think in high school you know but i think thats when you should start being exposed to the ideas and start asking some questions   uhhuh   having the having you know somebody thats been to college needs to sit down and explain these things to you you know i went in not knowing anything and if id a had a little better idea what was going on id a probably made a lot of decisions differently   in what way   oh id probably started sooner and taken courses in high school that would have prepared me better for for what i was going to see   yeah would you have uh went to the name college or   probably not in my situation i dont have the money for it but uh      yeah   then again        its kind of hard to say where i would have gone had i been thinking about it back in high school   yeah   so   uh   i think i dont know to me college was a was a i knew nothing about what it was going to be like its its a whole different thing than high school you know just go up and show up and stay up all day   yeah      and you know they tell you what to do and you do it its kind of a you drop in a couple times a week and its up to you to to learn it and get it done   right   so i think those are the kinds of things that parents should should let their kids know if they know themselves yeah college is a whole different ball game   yeah did either of your parents go to college   no   yeah neither did mine so i wasnt really didnt know what to expect so uh   so yeah   yeah it sounds like uh like you said sometimes the the name colleges the the large major universities carry the big name and uh if theyre private you know like a Harvard or something theyre big bucks sometimes fortunately though uh some of the big name schools are in state   right   and theyre state universities like uh Michigan or you know Purdue or something like that and you can get uh a good education at a good cost you know if if youre in state   decent price yeah   but if you know if your kids are out uh uh they want to go to college out of state you know you have to look like you said is the are you are they going to get the education thats going to balance out like here in Sherman theres Austin College and im from up north i never heard of Austin College but its well respected in this area its private its very expensive and just talking to people that go there it is uh you know you you know the professors on a first name basis you go over their house quite often and eat and spend time with them and at the major universities you just dont do that   yeah thats   you know theres thirty thousand people there and theres couple hundred people in each of your class and and i remember one professor wanted to have people over but people were you know just kind of scared to go over and are they going to be called brownnoser when uh so its just sort of unaccepted you just kind   right   go to class and you dont usually use the office hours i mean theres not the the relationship you get the degree with the big name on it but you know you dont build that theres a lot of learning that you dont get   right   as opposed to thats what i like about Austin College i didnt know that because id never been around any small colleges but uh but there again like you said the big name the big bucks you know you can go anywhere with a   that   a degree from Stanford you know and people turn heads but you know a degree from Austin College or something you know wheres that well you know its not really well known and unfortunately sometimes that has to do with their sports program you know   right right   if uh you know well some schools maybe not like U N L V you know people kind of think thats a joke you know and you know its big name and everybody knows about it and everybody wears U N L V shirts but you know what kind of education are these people getting but you know some of the other schools like uh you know North Carolina and Duke you know while theyre successful in like basketball i mean people know that theyre really good in academics   right a lot of the schools i think i think i dont know for sure but i think the schools up in the northern states are generally provide a better  education i could be wrong about that but my experience with Texas schools has not been all that great   yeah yeah ive never been to school down here so i really dont know uh i guess there again i mean theres the good and the bad like um   yeah   there seem to be a lot of junior colleges and community colleges down here and up north there arent i mean pretty much you either go to a technical school out of if you go to further schooling you go to like a technical school like a DeVry or something like that   right   or you go to a university or a major college there are no  there as far as i know there are very few
