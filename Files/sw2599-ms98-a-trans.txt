        uh i dont know im not a real uh great football follower i guess there are two basic teams that i seem to follow every year one is the Dallas Cowboys and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners   oh okay   uh being a a native Okie i uh i like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing uh   i see so you make it uh to that Longhorns Sooners game every year   no no its funny uh i got out and got my bachelors degree in uh seventy three and uh never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since   how about that   but i always enjoyed watching them i just growing up in Oklahoma there it was always the home team kind of like Dallas is around here   yeah yeah   and theres always been an interest there   well its kind of same for me i i grew up in southern New Jersey and the local team was Philadelphia and they were like thirty miles right up the river   yeah   and im still pretty much an Eagle fan i guess   i guess you keep those things you grew up with i worked in uh Missouri for a while and uh i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on TV when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals and i was rooting for the Cowboys   yeah yeah   but they were kind of closer to home when when i struck up with them i really dont know whats going to take place with the Cowboys this year uh everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction theyre going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year in a way that happened this past season and i think theres quite a bit of optimism around here that still theres a chance that maybe uh these guys are right maybe they will come through and and do something this year i look for it to be a pretty good year   boy they uh they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago   they did uh they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we werent werent familiar with some of them turned out to be pretty good players uh some of them didnt and you know maybe the stuff that uh Jerry Jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off at least we hope it will   yeah im i keep waiting for the Eagles to get over the hump they make it to the playoffs it seems for the last few years but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there and you know theyve got a lot of the tools to do it but doggone if they cant just put it together uh you know they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham whos just you know phenomenal but he hes too streaky it seems   yeah but they have always been a really strong team   yeah yeah and with without a whole lot of big name players they have got a few anchors on offense and defense and you know they theyve managed with those guys and i dont know   once the pressure gets turned on they they seem to loose it see thats the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys and and the Oklahoma Sooners its funny over the years   i guess yeah yeah i guess since Staubach left they havent been able to keep it going yeah   its its been a rough tow a rough road to hoe ever since he left i dont know why its so hard to find uh a good quarterback these days   yeah well that that says a lot for the for his ability though i think for Staubachs i mean you know   well yeah you know he was one of the few whove come through in history that can really perform uh we hope every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through in a way Aikman has done some of that   yeah   but uh the guy winds up getting hurt every other game   yeah i i tell you its difficult in that guys position coming into that because there he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things you know   yeah they did they put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside uh its funny watching them them play hes probably like a lot of quarterbacks uh when the pressure is really on when its down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best   uhhuh   and i havent quite figured that out if they figure they have got it won or if theres no real hurry because the first three quarters or uh if uh if something happens that that adrenaline starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now and then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes   yeah   so i dont know im looking for for a good year i guess were always looking for a good year   so obviously though do you think theyre going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the Super Bowl this year or who do you who do you like to do that this year   uh no i dont think the Cowboys have got a chance i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year and theyll get close to it theyll probably get everybodys hopes up and blow it toward the end   so whos going to beat them who are they going to blow it to   uh thats a good question uh im figuring either one either the Eagles or possibly San Francisco im not real sure   boy theyd some big changes speaking of them   they did so i dont know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team sometimes it brings in new motivation and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come   yeah im sure you know my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia but i i sure am scared of them Giants     well thats true   those guys are tough   they are tough and theyre big theyre mean and they are going to come right through you if you dont do something   yeah now that that sure was a fun Super Bowl to watch this year i mean i wasnt pulling for either team but that was just a good football game   oh yeah yeah no no and its funny you know You like to pull for the underdog and for a long time i was pulling for Denver   uhhuh   uh Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does but hes a good quarterback hes got a good arm sometimes its too good because he throws too hard   LA you mean   i mean LA sorry   yeah boy speaking of Denver on another subject ive been up there like five times in the last three four weeks           oh yeah   yeah weve trying get this new DNB two thousand printer up and running   had been uh snowing up there   oh boy i was just up there i just got back last night around eleven thirty or so and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground and it snowed all day   wow well that will make the skiers happy   oh yeah yeah if if it snowed that much in Denver you know they got that much up in the mountains you know just west of there     oh you bet oh yeah up around the Keystone and Copper Mountain those guys will love that well good to talk to you   yeah enjoyed it Bob   you guys have a good time keep those printers coming   hey well do it   all right bye     byebye
