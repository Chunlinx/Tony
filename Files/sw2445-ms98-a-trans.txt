        i dont know um do you do a lot of camping   well my husband and i havent done a whole lot of camping we but we bought a van last year and we were hoping to to do some camping in the van   yeah   um we did go camping in Arkansas not Arkansas Oklahoma uh last year in we camped in a tent and uh there were two other couples with us and there was uh state park   oh so  yeah um up here some of the state parks are really nice and some of them arent some of them are pretty rough   and it was really nice really   um yeah they they just have like outhouses they dont have like a shower room or anything yeah but some of them are really nice they have showers and full bathrooms   um   um but i dont know i ive been camping a couple times but im not a real avid camper uh a lot of people i know are but um i dont i dont know that   i i dont like really camping in the rough i like the the the little niceties like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that   yeah in fact we went we went once to a leanto and it um i mean there wasnt any electricity on the camp site but it was all right but we only spent two nights there i wouldnt want to spend more than two nights i wouldnt want to go for like a week  but um   yeah that would that would be much     two nights is good um especially there was a little store close by so it was pretty nice   yeah the campsite that we went to was an area that its right on a big lake and theres a lot of boating out there and we we went up there uh to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit but it was still uh it was still too cold   oh really oh   yeah it it was pretty early in the year   um yeah up here you got to wait till August August till the water warms up well its not that bad but its still pretty chilly   yeah   um i dont know i was i have a tent and i slept out in it in the backyard and stuff but the thing thing about camping that bothers me is youve got to pack everything and another thing is the thing seems to get its dirty  you know so you cant keep the dirt out of the tent and   yeah   i dont know we have a seven year old its pretty funny like stay out   yeah we we have a we have a dog and thats just about as bad as a kid   yeah boy he he doesnt go in and out of the tent a hundred times   umhum   and use it as a play uh they they like to play in them   yeah i dont know how you can really keep uh the inside of a tent clean other other than you know taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something   yeah i dont know   and and sweeping it out everyday its really hard to to keep the sand and dirt out of it   yeah well what what we were doing we were just going to say were just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night so you know no going in and out and or what he wants to do we had brought his friend along was play in the tent it was like no this is not working  you cant do that you get tent all dirty plus you get it all wet because we were at a beach site too   did umhum um did you have another a big tent like uh um for like a looks like a sitting area type you know like a two room type tent   no no but you know i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they they are really nice and um up here we have uh we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime   yeah yeah we dont really have a problem with that um in these areas um and even even when in Oklahoma when we camped i really didnt notice a problem with bugs and i noticed that i know that i said thats ive ive lived back east before um and   yeah theyre terrible  theyre really terrible uh but there is this one campsite that it that some of them are known that there is one thats out in this big lake and its its its mosquitoes are terrible and then this uh theres this other one thats more up in the mountains but it surrounds a manmade reservoir and theres no bugs thats the whole thing that everyone told me oh im i was going to go to Little Little River State Park they go oh that place is great theres no bugs  but oh okay because uh we were having a big a really big problem up here in certain areas we were really affected that bad   hum   but really bad it um almost destroyed the  the tourism in one town because of the mosquitoes theyre so bad yeah that was its a really nice area ive been there before and its   really   i i couldnt imagine get living just sixty miles north of them but they were plagued they were plagued with them with mosquitoes and you can go out outside in the daytime all right but the minute the sun went down  thats when it seems like the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out   hum   i mean just the very second its really strange they uh they must uh work on that you know the the it gets cooler when the sun sets and then they all come out   well have you ever have you ever taken any of those um what do they call this citronella lights have you ever used those   oh oh yeah yeah i never really noticed how effective they were but um because that wasnt really i i bought them and i didnt really get to use them like oh theres mosquitoes lets turn them we just sort of lit them   umhum   and um we werent bothered that much by mosquitoes so we didnt really contribute it to that but um i think in an area thats really thick with mosquitoes i cant see all this little uh smoke buckets i call them how they work but they theyre suppose to work really well   yeah   oh im in my paperwork here thats what i do when i wait for a phone call i get in my paperwork   hum   oh to find my most important parts but i dont know i dont know if im going to go go i wish was an avid camper and i could really talk about like gardening or something i can talk about that a lot but um   umhum   i do want to go again we just moved to a new house into a house so i dont see camping maybe in the backyard but i dont see going on a camping trip probably till next summer   yeah id id like to go camping cross country um i just got married less than two years ago so we dont have any any children yet um   so its easy for you to go   and yeah so its easy to pick up and go and so we have a van and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it   um oh God   so its its not really i guess camping the way people most people picture camping in the tent but   i dont know but that sounds like my kind my kind of camping it really does yeah okay um well um that that is the best way to do it is to have a a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent   yeah or or get my brother has a real nice popup   yep   and he just he just tows it behind his truck   um   and he hes got three kids so his kidsll sleep in the truck in the in the back of the bed um and they sleep in the popup   well those theyre kind of nice but theyre also um flimsy when you really look at them but then when you get inside theyre really nice you know   yeah   everythings really nice but then when you look underneath it its just got these little wheels and this just this uh little axle its like oh my and then a big windstorm it would pick you up   yeah he did have a problem uh when he went camping last year in uh Beavers Bend Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma um a storm a storm came in and it started raining really heavy and they were all everybody was trying to flee the campsite and everybody was getting stuck in the mud   oh jeez yeah what do you what do you do when you get a i mean like a really violent storm like a tornado just stay in your truck   and the   i i mean i wouldnt stay in the um   well theirs was so bad and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up and they had to get out of there   oh so did were they successful   yeah they yeah they were   but it took them a little while   but yeah they  they decided that that was enough camping for the weekend   yeah so did they get stuck   no they ended up getting out they ended up helping several other people though that were that were stuck   yeah huh wow so they evacuated it   yeah yeah they the whole the whole campsite was evacuated i mean some i think some people that had fairly sturdy um   wow   vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water i think they stayed   yeah   but everybody that was real close to the water ended up it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream   i know i i always i like to like to get right on the water yeah where the campsite its so it well like i dont know we have leantos up here i really like them like they say theyre kind of   yeah   its kind of more dirty than anything you know just just   they have them right at the campsites   yeah theyre theyre leantos theyre um yeah theyre pretty nice theyre theyre uh   wow   its like a little house except the whole face is open and the one time that we went we got one it was overlooking the water but it was a big embankment i wanted to get one right on the water that was then when we had uh an electrical storm too and it was really it was neat sitting there watching it i mean it was raining when we called in home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm
