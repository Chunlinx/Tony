                    Background                Bacillus thuringiensis Bt has been        sold commericially and used as a biopesticide worldwide for        over half a century However growing public concern        surrounding Bt use has sparked worldwide debate over        current policies     For example in India fear over a        potential         Bombyx mori silkworm epizootic or        microbial pathogen outbreak inspired a governmental ban on        the use of Bt despite the nations continuing use of        traditional chemical pesticides            While pest control with Cry toxins that possess low         B mori activity          ie  CryAc is a viable solution in        affected countries it is worthwhile to investigate the        specific molecular mechanisms that make CryAa highly        active Early work took advantage of the fact that CryAa        but not CryAc is toxic to         B mori  For example Ge         et al    exchanged hypervariable        regions between genes encoding the two toxins and localized        the toxicity specifying region of CryAa to residues         in domain II A followup study demonstrated the        toxicity specifying residues were involved in binding         B mori brush border membrane        vesicles     More specifically alanine substitution or        deletion of residues  to  removed nearly all toxicity        and binding to         B mori BBMV            Recently research on         B mori has focused on purifying and        cloning the midgut epithelial receptors targeted by CryAa        toxin The first toxinbinding receptor purified from         B mori was a kDa aminopeptidase        N APN which appears around kDa on SDSPAGE gels when        preparative conditions are used that cleave its        glycosylphosphatidylinositol GPI anchor This receptor        was shown to bind CryAa with a  nM affinity as        determined by Scatchard analysis with ELISA binding assays            The APN was cloned and expressed in         E coli and demonstrated to bind        CryAa toxin on ligand blots     These results indicate        the CryAaAPN interaction was specific and that APN        glycosylation was not required for CryAa binding This is        not altogether surprising because CryAa binding to         Manduca sexta APN has not been found        to be modulated by sugar binding    and the         B mori APN sequence is         identical to         M sexta APN Sequence alignments        with         Plutella xylostella APN receptor        indicate that a highly conserved region of APN likely        functions as the toxin binding site     By testing for        toxin binding to lysylendopeptidasedigested         B mori APN fragments the toxin        binding site was suggested to be between Ile and Pro        A later study by these authors identified kDa and        kDa APNs coeluting from an anionexchange column that        together yielded a CryAa affinity of  nM     These        APNs eluted just prior to a  kDa APN with  nM        affinity It is unclear whether the  and kDa        proteins represent uncleaved and cleaved GPIanchor        isozymes Interestingly this study also showed that CryAc        toxin binds to the  kDa APN fraction with equal        affinity as CryAa and only fold reduced affinity to the        isolated kDa APN Nonetheless CryAa is  times more        toxic than CryAc to         B mori     As a whole         B mori APN research indicates the        presence of at least three genetic isoforms              with toxin affinities ranging from nanomolar to none at        all        In addition to APN a completely different toxin        receptor class has been affinity precipitated by toxin from        solubilized         B mori midgut proteins In this        manner Nagamatsu         et al    purified a kDa        glycoprotein BtR that bound CryAa toxin        Interestingly these authors did not observe binding of        CryAa to APNsized bands in ligand blot studies with BBMV        Antibodies produced to BtR blocked toxin binding to the        receptor in BBMV The antibody serum also reduced CryAa        activity against         B mori when it was fed to larvae        prior to toxin addition to the diet     The same group        cloned and introduced the BtR gene with a baculovirus        vector into         Spodptera frugiperda Sf cells        Addition of CryAa caused swelling and lysis of only the        Sf cells expressing BtR Based on sequence analysis        the receptor was characterized as a cadherinlike        glycoprotein containing nine cadherin repeats a membrane        proximal region one transmembrane region and a small        cytoplasmic domain     Ihara         et al    also purified and        partially sequenced what was presumed to be the same        cadherinlike receptor Binding studies indicated that the        affinity of the cadherin for CryAa is equivalent to that        of the brush border membrane vesicles from         B mori     an affinity that is        substantially lower than the APN affinities reported        Recently cDNA variants of BtR have been discovered        showing at least three alleles of the cadherinlike        receptor are found in         B mori     It is likely that        glycosylation plays a major role in cadherinlike receptor        isoforms as well as glycosylation has been observed        previously for the         M sexta cadherinlike receptor BTR                     Progress in research on silkworm receptors for Bt toxins        has provided a means for assaying mutant toxins with        potentially altered binding and activity In this study we        tested the hypothesis that CryAa binds to both the kDa                B mori APN and the kDa         B mori cadherinlike protein Based        on the previous work of Ge et al    and Lee et al            we also postulated that domain II of CryAa is the        significant binding domain These hypotheses were tested        for the first time in studies with purified native         B mori receptors rather than BBMV        under realtime nonlabeled toxin binding conditions                    Results                  Bombyx mori aminopeptidase N and cadherinlike          receptor purification          To investigate the specificity of Cry toxins for           B mori receptors the two known           B mori midgut receptors were          purified from           B mori BBMV Solubilized           B mori BBMV proteins were          separated by Q Sepharose anionexchange chromatography          and all eluted fractions were tested for APN enzymatic          activity Additionally CryAa toxin binding capability          was assayed by slot blotting all fractions and probing          with biotinCryAa The chromatogram in Fig displays          the separation of cadherin and APN from BBMV proteins          APN isozymes of  and kDa were detected that did          not show CryAabinding in slot blot assays Fig           fractions  and  Such isozymes have been          reported previously      In addition a kDa          APN was detected with CryAabinding capability Fig           fractions  As expected fractions were also          observed that exhibited no APN enzymatic activity but          bound CryAa on slot blots Fig  fractions           Initially these fractions were predicted to contain the          cadherinlike CryAabinding protein       The          candidate receptor fractions for APN and cadherin were          separately loaded on a sizeexclusion column for further          purification Fig Aand B A protein with APN          enzymatic activity eluted  minutes after injection          Fig A fractions  approximately  minutes after          the kDa           L dispar APN elutes on the same          column     The candidate cadherinlike receptor          fraction eluted in fractions  at around  kDa Fig          B                          Analysis of receptor purity          The pooled and concentrated candidate receptor          fractions were examined by SDSPAGE before and after          sizeexclusion purification to assess purity Fig           The putative cadherinlike receptor material appears at a          molecular size around  kDa both before and after          secondary purification Lanes  and  respectively          Several BBMV proteins appear present in the          APNcontaining fraction prior to sizeexclusion          purification Fig  Lane  The molecular weight of          the final purified APN was estimated to be  kDa          Fig  Lane  It is not known whether the GPI anchor          is still intact on the APN receptor however in the          current study phosphatidylinositolspecific          phospholipase C PIPLC was not used during BBMV          preparation It was shown previously that APN may be          purified with intact GPIanchors if PIPLC is omitted from          the preparation buffer     It is likely that our APN          has similarly retained the GPI anchor          In view of the fact that           B mori BtR possesses sequence          similarity to           M sexta BTR             the candidate fraction was probed          on a slot blot with antiBTR            polyclonal antiserum A weak to          moderate crossreactivity with antiBTR            was observed for           B mori BBMV as well as the          putative cadherinlike receptor fraction providing          strong evidence that the material is a cadherinlike          protein Fig  AntiBtR            antibody recognition was not          observed for fractions eluting before and after the          cadherin material nor for the purified APN Fig           Similar antibody assays were not performed to          substantiate the identity of the purified APN because it          clearly displayed strong characteristic APN enzyme          activity          The purity of both receptors was further examined by a          CryAa toxin ligand blot Fig  Both APN and the          cadherinlike receptor fractions bound biotinylated          CryAa No other toxinbinding bands were apparent and          neither purified receptor sample was visibly          crosscontaminated with the other receptor Fig                           Affinity estimation by surface plasmon          resonance          Cry toxin binding studies have been reported          previously for           B mori that used BBMV assays or          used purified receptors in ELISA assays or blots          however no Cry toxin studies concerning           B mori have been published          employing SPR analysis The affinity of CryAa binding to                    B mori APN and           B mori cadherin receptors was          evaluated by realtime kinetic analysis on a BIAcore           Simple bimolecular binding of CryAa was observed          to both           B mori APN and cadherin Fig          Aand B Toxinreceptor onrates for association            k           a  offrates for dissociation            k           d  and overall binding affinity            k           d            k           a  or           K           D  were calculated for toxin binding          The apparent rate constants for wildtype CryAa and           B mori APN were           k           a     M s                         k           d     s               and           K           D   nM To           B mori cadherin significantly          tighter affinities were obtained           k           a     M s             k           d     s                K           D   nM This apparent offrate          clearly accounted for CryAas higher affinity for          cadherin than for APN The cadherin offrate observed in          this study could have significant consequences in vivo          slow toxin dissociation may enable protracted lingering          near the brush border membrane surface greatly          facilitating toxic domain I insertion and subsequent          pore formation The overall affinity determined in the          present study for CryAa to BtR  nM agrees well          with the findings of Ihara           et al    by a different assay           nM          We also explored the specificity of CryAa for the          native           B mori receptors by comparing the          binding response of CryAa with the binding of CryAb          CryAc and domainswitched toxin  Fig Aand B          Hybrid toxin  is particular useful in this context          because it is comprised of domains I and II from CryAa          and domain III from CryAc AaAaAc              Hybridtoxin  binding to both receptors was not          noticeably different from CryAa for APN binding           k           a     M s                         k           d     s               and           K           D   nM for cadherin binding           k           a     M s                k           d     s               and           K           D   nM In stark contrast CryAb          and CryAc showed no apparent binding to either receptor          Fig Aand B These results are entirely consistent          with the hypothesis that CryAa domain II alone is          essential for binding to both the APN and cadherinlike          receptors as purified in the present study                            Discussion        The dissociation constants presented are the first        determined for         B mori Cry receptors by the use of        SPR technology Additionally the apparent affinity of        CryAa for the cadherinlike receptor is the highest        observed affinity to date for Cry toxin binding to purified        receptors using SPR This finding emphasizes the important        biological role that this receptor class plays for Bt        toxins Recently using phage display technology a scFv        molecule with short sequence homology to         M sexta and         B mori cadherinlike receptors was        shown to bind domain II of CryAa CryAb and CryAc        toxins     In the present study only CryAa shows        measurable binding to the purified native cadherinlike        receptor from         B mori  This finding may be the        result of purification of a particular receptor variant        with CryAa specificity eg one of potentially several        glycosylated isoforms Alternatively it may reflect        greater specificity of CryAa domain II for neighboring        residues on the         B mori cadherinlike receptor beyond        the conserved CryAtoxin binding segment which might be        absent in smaller peptide sequences        The apparent CryAa affinity for purified APN measured        in this study  nM is fold higher than the value        reported by Yaoi         et al    for purified kDa APN        using a separate technique  nM In the aforementioned        study an ELISA assay was used to indirectly calculate        affinity by incubating receptorbound toxin with a        peroxidaseconjugated antiCryAa antibody over  hours        at C It is possible that the difference in binding        constants reflects our condition of more direct        receptorbinding measurement in realtime as well as the        different binding buffers and temperature used        Yaoi         et al    estimated the        toxinbinding region of         B mori APN to be between Ile and        Pro based on toxin blot overlays with proteasedigested        APN fragments BLAST sequence alignments    yielded         identity and  similarity between this  residue stretch        and the homologous region of         M sexta APN which also binds        CryAa toxin Jenkins unpublished observation        Interestingly in         L dispar APN which does not bind        CryAa the same stretch is only  identical and         similar  unaligned gaps These results appear to        support the findings of Yaoi         et al     However         Heliothis virescens tobacco budworm        APN is only  identical and  similar to         B mori APN yet it binds CryAa        toxin with high affinity     Moreover sequence        alignments with APN from         Lactobacillus          Streptococcus          Saccharomyces          Arabidopsis  rat pig yeast and        human yielded more similarity than         H virescens APN to the putative        CryAabinding region of         B mori APN It is likely that as the        Xray crystal structures of APNs are solved structural        alignments of APNs will help resolve the        specificitydetermining regions more accurately        Additionally structural information will aid in the        rational construction of toxins with reduced binding for        beneficial insects without losing activity to target pests        In this context a unique CryAa binding epitope within        domain II has been identified that when mutated results        in specific reduction of toxicity to         B mori You et al unpublished        manuscript The application of protein engineering to         B thuringiensis insecticidal        proteins is entering a new era of tailoring pesticides with        reduced activity to beneficial insects as well as        increasing activity against pest insects                        Conclusions        Domain II of CryAa is both necessary and essential for        tight binding to two         B mori midgut receptors the        cadherinlike and aminopeptidase N receptors a finding        that correlates with biological activity data The CryAa        binding affinity as well as the dissociation rate for the        cadherinlike receptor are the lowest measured using the        surface plasmon resonance technique The SPR method        presented here may be useful for screening other Cry toxins        or Cry toxin variants specifically engineered to reduce or        eliminate specificity for receptors from this nontarget
