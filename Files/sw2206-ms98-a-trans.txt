        have you been having any uh good weather lately   well today was really nice the past few days have been rather chilly uh we had a lot of rain recently im in Texas where are you   oh im in Texas Plano uhhuh   oh you are do you work for TI oh i see   yes i do   yeah so then weve been having just about the same weather   yeah it was pretty nice today but i stayed inside i came up with a cold couple days ago so im taking care of that but uh yeah its nice and sunny out   yeah have you been doing anything outside in this great weather   uh not lately  but uh yeah there was a little bit of rain couple days ago and they had tornados up in uh Oklahoma and i guess in Wichita Falls too   no yeah i know we had a tornado watch watch a couple of days ago but nothing really happened   uhhuh   are you originally from uh Texas   no im from Wisconsin originally uh i dont know what the weathers been like up there but uh typically in March its still uh kind uh kind of like winter uh very cold   the umhum well i lived in New York for a long time so Texas is Texas weather is quite uh different for me   well we had a real mild winter here though   yeah we did we uh theyre always mild to me compared to New York winters have you have you ever been to New York in the winter   okay i can believe that uhhuh no ive well Wisconsin gets pretty bad sometimes too but uh probably not near as bad as New York uh im sure   uhhuh   i think it depends on what part of the state   right   but this winter here i think we only had one instance of ice one weekend   right   and uh other than that uh it was uh maybe just uh three real cold spells i dont have too much uh shrubbery damage from that but uh still some didnt manage to survive   yeah the only thing i dont like about uh Dallas weather is that it gets a little bit too hot sometimes in the summer   yeah it gets it gets uh hot but uh its not very humid and theres always a nice uh breeze blowing   yeah yeah like New York was really humid you know you but you could you could walk around outside in New York you could just stay outside in in it you know because it was i guess the average summer temperature is about eighty uh you know in the eighties   yeah   and it was pretty pleasant except for the humidity   you know ive been here about thirteen years and ive gotten quite quite acclimated to the weather i the summers dont bother me anymore at all i dont mind when it gets over a hundred degrees   uhhuh well at least you can plan you can say well uh im going to go to the beach next Wednesday and youll know that its going to be hot enough to go     yeah   but in in New York you really never know you can plan  to you know to go up to the beach on the Fourth of July and then you know it might be seventy degrees or something   sure   uhhuh   i dont know what kind of a summer were expecting this year i imagine its going to be hot again   yeah yeah im sure it will in Dallas Texas     well thats pretty typical though uh i dont uh i dont guess its going to be any much different uh than than it has been in the past so i expect uh July and August well see our  or uh share of hundred degree days   right have you ever been to Canada   no i never have   um   ive been close uh was in Detroit one time just right across the river from Windsor   uhhuh uh thats supposed to be really cold weather in the winter thats why New York gets so cold because its so close to Canada   yeah i believe that i was in Wisconsin over uh the Christmas holidays and it was about uh twenty below zero when i got up there   uhhuh goodness   they uh they had a high of i think eighteen degrees during the week that i was there   uhhuh   so its stayed cold for the entire week   was it snowing snowing   um we got one day of snow and one day of ice other than that it was pretty good just cold   um you know uh Christmas really doesnt seem like Christmas to me unless i do see the snow and the ice   we dont get too much snow here   it uh its just really pretty with the snow and the ice and all of the lights not necessarily not the ice i should keep leave the ice out of it but the snow is real pretty   well i can live without ice yeah the snow is nice doesnt usually last too long here   uhhuh i remember i know one Christmas when i was in Dallas it snowed it snowed and and there was a white Christmas but i dont i guess its been about five or six years ago   yeah i remember maybe uh maybe three winters where we had a white Christmas here   umhum   other than that its uh the snow usually doesnt last more than a day or two   yeah i just think its really really pretty   we   i remember one Christmas here it was sixty degrees  that was so strange to me having lived in New York you know   uhhuh yeah well thats not uncommon whats really bad here in winter is when we get uh ice on the roads and the temperature doesnt get above freezing there is no uh ice removal equipment   yeah yeah and people drive like the street street is dry   yeah that is if if the businesses are all open uh lot of them close down   yeah i dont think TIs closed down in a couple of years for bad weather   thats right we didnt close at all this past winter   oh i look forward to one of those days   yeah well we usually have to make them up though so   not now thats true  did you say you work in Plano   uh well i work at the main set in Dallas  yeah uhhuh   oh you do i do too   i well did uh did you get much rain two days ago   did i get what   much rain   two days ago   yeah Thursday   uh i know it sprinkled some   i didnt get much rain here in Plano but i guess it really poured in Richardson   uhhuh i believe it it it uh  it rained at night or something because i saw puddles of water outside but i didnt   yeah i dont think we got uh i dont think we got it near as bad as uh Oklahoma and i guess Fort Worth had high high winds in fact uh the wind was responsible for knocking down a light pole at the Water Gardens that killed two people   uhhuh uhhuh umhum   so they usually get uh worse weather  than we do   yeah   in winter too   well March is the the month for high winds   yeah   and its been rather windy here too   and we get a lot of tornados too this is the time of the year   uhhuh have you heard the forecast for the week coming up   no i sure havent its i think its supposed to be nice though   yeah i havent either yeah its probably going to start getting summer hot   seventies eighties i guess   yeah well thats nice   ive been checking on my plants seeing the the roses bud out already   oh you plant oh   yeah somewhat uh have to kind of watch watch the weather make sure everything is going the way its supposed to   uhhuh   waiting for the waiting waiting for the weather to get nice out so i can go ahead and uh replace some of the some of the dead shrubs from winter         uhhuh   but uh like i said i stayed in today because i picked up a cold the other day so didnt feel like going outside and doing much   yeah well it probably theyll probably do okay now i have a friend thats planted some uh planted a garden some things like collard greens and cabbage   uhhuh   and uh theyre coming up really pretty you just need a just need a good rain   yeah we we really havent didnt get enough rain the other day to uh do much good for uh things growing just a lot of weeds right now  and theyll come up whether we get nice weather or not   umhum yeah yeah well i live in an apartment so the only thing i grow are plants inside and i dont do very very well with those i think the temperature in here   uhhuh well youve got a lot more control over the inside temperature than you do than you do outside   yeah but i guess i just dont know what im doing   okay   sometimes i id sit the plants outside on the patio and and id forget about them and it gets too hot out there and and they you know burn up and so forth thats happened to quite a few of my plants   yeah i dont do well with potted plants outside i tend to neglect neglect them and they sit in the sun too long and dry up or uh if i dont put them in the sun they dont grow   yeah umhum   i dont know but uh yeah i guess next weeks supposed to be real nice outside i hope it is anyway because uh softball season starts and were ready to to go outside and do some outdoor activities   uh uhhuh well good i hope hope its nice too   okay well uh i havent heard the forecast for the next for uh  coming up for this weekend or next week so im not sure what to expect i can only guess that its supposed to be nice   yeah i hope its as nice as it was today   uhhuh   seems like it was extra cold last night though   im not sure what the overnight low was   but i know it was cold i had turn on the heat and get quilts yeah   oh yeah guess ill have to turn on the weather on the news tonight see what were supposed to expect   yeah   anyway i guess everythings been pretty typical for March   uhhuh   have to see what uh April or May have to offer   you know the summer really starts in Dallas that i remember one one year seems like it started about the end of February yeah hot   sometimes it does uh sometimes itll get in the eighties uh as early as uh January February   umhum yeah but it up in New York its cold till about June   well they still have snow on the ground through March and probably part of April sometimes   um yeah one thing about the snow in March it at at least itll melt it melts quickly up there   well it leaves a mess then when it does melt  everything thaws out   thats true   lot of mud
