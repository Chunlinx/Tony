                because uh discuss crime in America and what we might be able uh do to uh help stop it   oh okay um well youre in quite a um interesting city for um crime drugs and all kinds of things that we hear about arent you   oh yeah well actually i i i live in Houston im in Miami on business   oh i see uhhuh   uh but ive ive been down here quite a bit for the past oh six months on and off   uhhuh i see   and yes there is plenty of crime in Miami uh  but you know um i dont know that its any worse than Houston   um yeah well its probably each city i guess has its own specific type of difficulty   and i know theres plenty of crime in Dallas too   oh theres a lot of homicides in Dallas that seems to be   yeah   uh well a lot of it is drug related but i i think that there is just an excessive homicide rate and an excessive amount of arms bearing uh you know personal arms bearing uh and it it seems to just lend itself to instantaneous um  if youre dont feel good about a certain thing there you go and the crime is committed so uh   yeah i have uh i was talking with some with with a friend of mine not too damned long ago and ill tell you it its you know i dont expect this would ever happen in the United States but im almost of the opinion that the only way that a change is going to come about is if uh we really put some teeth into the law and and make it such that uh the punishment fits the crime and uh   um   have a a swift and and sure justice that uh you know do away with some of these automatic uh appeals when uh i think that guilt is proven   umhum oh i see umhum im not sure i know sufficiently about the ins and outs of the law to um know exactly what that brings about you know the the appeals and things like that as far as the people being um retrialed and maybe get an alleviated sentence it does seem though that the jail capacities are stretching to the fullest and uh   well in in Houston its absurd they are letting uh uh people that have been convicted three times for armed robbery   umhum   for example and this was they had a big article in the Houston newspaper about it because of the overcrowding theyre being released from Huntsville theyre given two hundred dollars and put on a bus for Houston with instructions to turn themselves in to a parole officer less than twenty percent or twenty ten percent it was a ridiculously low low number actually do ever report to a parole parole officer and the vast majority of them are then caught again go through the courts back to jail well its ludicrous and absurd   umhum oh umhum   and i i just dont think that you know we as a society can afford to continue to have these people that are repeat offenders being paroled after serving   umhum umhum   a a fraction sometimes you know a quarter of their sentence   umhum thats right   but uh i i dont know its uh i dont own a gun   um uhhuh   and uh  i you know i believe and i adhere to the thought that you know if you so often i mean its its having a gun leads to tragedy   thats right i believe that   and at the same and at the same time i think i have thought before what would i do if i were accosted   umhum umhum   you know a a fellow i work with uh in Houston he told me uh just this past week his wife was walking out of a mall ten oclock in the morning in Houston and was robbed   oh my in the parking lot oh yes uhhuh um   broad open daylight in the parking lot so anyway it it is its a scary situation and i really dont know what this what the answer   um its very difficult to know what the answer is and uh along with that theres a lot of poverty poverty a lot of homeless and and a lot of um i guess um discrimination is still around and i i suppose until somehow or another we can straighten out all of those things people are just going to take an extreme  uh measure and um uh protect themselves in one way or the other   yeah ive im im a firm believer though that uh  our justice system has has no teeth any longer that the idea of getting a sentence   umhum uhhuh   uh and and knowing that the parole uh will come uh uh just in a short matter of time not only that we have people in jail now that i mean had a program on Sixty Minutes i mean that they have telephones   oh   in their jail cells its absurd   oh i didnt know that   yeah so i mean i dont know   oh thats very strange   yeah i dont know its yeah
