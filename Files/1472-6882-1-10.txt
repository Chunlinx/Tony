                    Background        The aim of this paper is to evaluate the ethnoveterinary        remedies used by certain hunters in Trinidad Plants are        used to treat snakebites and scorpion stings and for        hunting success During the research some hunters claimed        that their dogs either started hunting or hunted better        after they had treated them in various ways with medicinal        plants This study has evolved out of an interest in a        nonexperimental evaluation of Trinidad and Tobagos        ethnopharmacopoeia This evaluation establishes whether the        plant use is based on empirically verifiable principles or        whether symbolic aspects of healing are more important            Hunters are principally interested in the following        game animals agouti          Dasyprocta agouti  matte          Tupinambis negropunctatus  tatou          Dasypus novemcinctus  deer          Mazama americana trinitatis  lappe                 Agouti paca  manicou          Didelphis marsupialis insularis         wild hogquenk          Tayassu tajacu  The hunting season        lasts from October st to February  then there is a        closed season for the rest of the year There is no        comprehensive published information available on the number        of hunting dogs in the country Hunting dogs are typically        foxhounds  inch and  inch beagles coonhounds all        original stock imported and mixed breeds These dogs are        usually scent and not sight hounds                    Methods                  Data collection          The research area is located in Guayaguayare on          private land belonging to a Stateowned oil company This          area also has a protected animal reserve where in theory          no hunting is allowed From    the authors          conducted research with one group of seven hunters based          in south Trinidad on this private land not in the          protected animal reserve One of these hunters was          IndoTrinidadian the others were AfroTrinidadian or of          mixed race This research included participant          observation     which involved taking part in five          hunts over the three years going into the forest          observing the chase and capture sharing a meal and          sharing of take home game One veterinarian served as          the linkage and provided entrance to this group and          facilitated the participation in the hunting activities          Hunts started thirty minutes after this veterinarian          arrived with the first author and either one or both of          the two female veterinarians typically between  am and           am Hunts ended when at least one agouti was caught          The earliest occasion being  hrs After the return          to the camp cooking would take place Stories would          continue until  to  hrs The ethnoveterinary          remedies were written up into a handout The authors          joined in two social occasions in which each hunter in          turn sat with the first author and added details to          information already documented in the handout and          confirmed his remedies These social occasions lasted          from  am to  hrs          Unstructured interviews were also held with four          individual hunters in North Trinidad Paramin and two in          Central Trinidad Talparo and four in Mayaro South          Trinidad The interviews were an hour long in Paramin          and Mayaro Three eight hour days were spent talking to          the Talparo informants while they worked on a cocoa and          coffee farm Paramin and Talparo retain Hispanic          traditions either from the original Spanish colonists or          from continuous smallscale immigration from Venezuela              Many of the original Spanish colonists intermarried          with Trinidads original Amerinidian inhabitants Two of          the four hunters in Mayaro were AfroTrinidadians the          other two were of mixed race The following information          was collected from all respondents the popular name          uses parts used mode of preparation and application          The ethnoveterinary handout was given to two hunters          These two hunters then used the documented information to          provide  of the plants A third hunter provided the          plants that he used to bathe dogs for quenk hunting The          author collected the other  percent of the documented          plants from the informants in Mayaro Talparo and          Paramin and on one occasion when the hunting camp was          being dismantled by three of the hunters for the closed          season The use of the plants was only reported not          observed One plant bath was shown already prepared in          Mayaro All the plants were identified at the University          of the West Indies Herbarium but no voucher specimens          were deposited                            Results                  Environmental hazards          The following section outlines environmental hazards          to hunters and researchers which may explain some of          their bush medicine remedies One research hazard was the          presence of a mite infestation           Trombicula species in the area          These mites are called bte rouge locally because of          the orange colour of the larval cluster seen on the skin          The mites affect game animals like agouti and can attack          man since they attach themselves to all mammals and          vertebrates The author can confirm that depending on the          sensitivity of the individual a larval infection produces          slight or extreme irritation Lesions may persist after          the larvae have left to begin their adult stage however          the dermatitis disappears The adult mites are free          living on vegetation and are found in fruit growing          areas on chalky soil              Yellow fever outbreaks in the past have affected          howler monkeys            Alouatte seniculus insularis  and          can spread to any mammals since these monkeys are          susceptible to sylvan forms of the human disease              Another occupational and research hazard is the presence          of constricting and venomous snakes Belle chemin            Liophis melanotus nesos  is a          constrictor The huile            Boa murina  eats all vertebrates          There are two families of venomous snakes Within the          Elapidae family in Trinidad there are two poisonous coral          snakes            Micrurus lemniscatus            Micrurus circinalis  which rarely          bite dogs or humans since they are small rare and have          retracted fangs               Micrurus venom has moderate effects          on blood coagulation and tissue integrity however victims          rarely survive because the potent neurotoxin in the venom          causes a postsynaptic blockade of neuromuscular          transmission     The neurotoxin can cause cranial          nerve paralysis leading to neurotoxic facies or          respiratory paralysis and death              Some harmless snakes in the Colubridae family like           Leptodeira annulata ashmeadi            Leptophis ahaetulla          coeruleodorsus            Clelia clelia clelia            Helicops angulatus            Liophis species           Oxybelis aeneus            Pseudoboa neuwiedii            Thamnodynastes species and           Tripanurgos compressus            Erythrolamprus species           Siphlophis cervinus            Oxyrhopus petola petola  may bite          and cause a reaction or mild envenomation     The          last three are called false corals since they mimic true          coral snakes for protection Bites from false corals are          more common than those of true corals              Snakes in the Viperidae family are locally called          mapepire These pit vipers have long hollow fangs The          mapepire zananna or bushmaster            Lachesis muta muta  and mapepire          balsain or ferdelance            Bothrops atrox atrox  are large          and poisonous           Lachesis muta can inject a large          dose of venom in a single bite     These snakes have          front fangs and bitten areas show severe swelling and          necrosis of tissue due to haemorrhagic myotoxic          necrotizing defibrinogenating coagulant caseinolytic          proteolytic oedemainducing coagulant and neurotoxic          venom activities              Hunting dogs may be stung by scorpions of the Buthidae          family            Tityus trinitatis  The effects of          the sting can be severe           Tityus trinitatis accounts for           of the scorpion population but there are six other          species which are all venomous      Signs would be          swelling pain and limping in dogs There are          approximately  stings by           Tityus trinitatis and eight human          deaths annually     In humans acute symptoms are          convulsions nausea vomiting drowsiness sweating          dyspnoea and localised burning     Of all scorpion          sting victims  developed acute pancreatitis and in           of these cases there was no abdominal pain                       Conventional treatment in Trinidad for snakebites and          scorpion stings in dogs makes use of steroids          antibiotics and the ananase enzyme from the pineapple           Ananas comosus  and needs to take          place within  hours of the bite Conventional treatment          would include analgesics and antiinflammatory drugs              The snake bite site typically is a necrotic area the          skin sloughs off due to the proteases in the venom and          the area looks dark and bruised     The ananase          enzyme reduces the inflammatory response and helps the          breakdown of necrotic tissue It is felt that dogs bitten          on the head have a better chance of survival since there          is less vascular absorption of the venom                          Hunters ethnoveterinary medicines          Several plants are used in an attempt to improve          hunting success For this purpose the odour and other          physical characteristics of the plant are very important          Plant use for hunting success has been divided into four          categories The first is called steaming and these          plants are usually administered in baths and are          considered mental andor physical stimulants Steaming is          also carried out with one type of insect an unidentified          solitary wasp that hunts spiders Both the wasp and its          spider prey are put into rum with guinea pepper            Aframomum melegueta  on a Friday          This solution is then given to the dog or included in          the bath water and it was claimed to have a stimulant          effect on the dog          The second category comprises plants placed in the          dogs nose Here it is expected that this action will act          as a nasal and chest decongestant and the dog will          subsequently have a better sense of smell and improve its          ability to follow a scent          The third category is based partly on the Doctrine of          Signatures in which a plant characteristic is considered          to have a desirable quality or to have a physical          property that resembles the desired game This desirable          quality is claimed to be transferred to the dog after the          plant is used in a bath The plants used in this category          are also chosen in recognition of animal behaviour For          example one respondent claimed that after the hole of an          agouti was dug out           Piper marginatum was found in the          hole and it was claimed that it was being used as a bed          Therefore hunting dogs bathed with this plant would          recognise the smell of the agouti which would carry          traces of the strong smell of           Piper marginatum           The fourth category is called cross In this          situation the hunters complain that the dog goes in the          opposite direction from the game The dog is faced          upstream and bathed in a river and rubbed with the          crushed leaves of seven different plants sometimes the          plants used have no other distinguishing characteristic          The dog is then turned to face downstream One respondent          claimed that when dogs are crossed and seem to be          climbing trees they are really chasing spirits in the          forest          One hunter who hunts quenks claimed that dogs are          trained to hunt small game first For example the dog is          bathed with congo lala            Eclipta prostrata  and it will          start hunting matte            Tupinambis negropunctatus  then          it is bathed with caraaili leaf            Momordica charantia  and barbadine          leaf            Passiflora quadrangularis  so that          it will hunt larger game Eventually the dog is bathed          with the plants for quenks          Plants are also used for emergencies such as          snakebites Plants used for snakebites are typically made          into tinctures with alcohol or sweet oil olive oil and          kept in  ml flasks called snake bottles Snakes          bottles contain one or more plants and or insects These          tinctures are also used against scorpion stings            Tityus trinitatis  Plants used in          snake medicines are often collected during Lent or          specifically on Good Friday In normal years this period          corresponds to the Dry season and the concentration of          plant chemicals may differ from other times of the year          Tref            Aristolochia trilobata  has to be          rewarded with silver coins as a symbolic payment before          removing some of its parts or the respondents claim that          the entire plant or clump of plants will die This          payment was supposed to be placed in the hole from which          the root was dug The only explanation given for the          payment was that the plant was not a simple plant          Several of the plants have one local name for several          closely related species For example Candlestick is the          name of           Piper hispidum            Piper marginatum species          collected           Piper amalgo and           Piper dilatatum  Monkey step          refers to either           Bauhinia exisa or the more commonly          found           Bauhinia cumanensis  All closely          related species will be dealt with in the ethnomedicinal          literature review          The plants used to influence success in hunting are          presented below in Tables and  The plants used for          snakebites mange and other skin conditions and injuries          are listed below the tables Tables and to be put          here                          Plants used for snakebites          If dogs are bitten by snakes the injury is usually on          the nostrils forehead or front shoulder For snakebites          of hunters and their dogs a piece of the woody flexible          vine called monkey ladder            Bauhinia cumanensis or           Bauhinia excisa  Fabaceae is          pounded and put on the bite It is claimed that this          stops the flesh around the bitten area from dropping off          Alternatively a tincture is made with a piece of the vine          and kept in a snake bottle Tinctures are also made with          single or multiple ingredients and plant parts A typical          tincture would contain one or more of the following          plants mat root            Aristolochia rugosa  cats claw                     Pithocellobium unguiscati           tobacco            Nicotiana tabacum  snake bush            Barleria lupulina  obie seed            Cola nitida  and wild gri gri          root            Acrocomia ierensis  tentative ID          Some snake bottles also contain the caterpillars            Battus polydamus  Papilionidae             that eat tref leaves            Aristolochia trilobata  The leaf          juice of           Eclipta prostrata is used for          scorpion stings Emergency snake medicines are obtained          by chewing a threeinch piece of the root of bois cant                     Cecropia peltata  taken from the          east part of the tree and administering this chewedroot          solution to the dog Alternatively four or five berries          of mardi gras            Renealmia alpinia  are crushed          with the juice of wild cane            Costus scaber  and the dog is          given two spoonfuls of the resulting solution All the          respondents claimed that their snake medicines were          effective against bitesstings of mapepire One          respondent who used mardi gras            Renealmia alpinia  for his dog          claimed that the dogs throat became swollen after the          snake bite After he gave the dog the medicine it stood          up and it was completely recovered hours later                          Plants used for mange and other skin          conditions          The leaves and vine stem of wild caraaili            Momordica charantia  are crushed          in water and used to bathe dogs with mange The pulp of          the fruit of the cannonball tree            Couroupita guianensis  is rubbed          on the infected skin of mangy dogs A frothy solution is          obtained by crushing the leaves of syrio            Sambucus simpsonii  in water This          is used to rub dogs with mange It is claimed that when          the dog licks its skin this medicine will also work          internally Dogs with rashes are bathed with St Johns          bush            Justicia secunda  Acanthaceae It          is claimed that this plant imparts a red colour to the          bath water                          Plants used for injuries          Dogs may get trauma damage during the hunt but may          have insufficient contact with game animals to pick up          any diseases directly from them Mardi gras            Renealmia alpinia  is used to          bathe dogs who have strained a limb Leaves of physic nut                     Jatropha curcasgossypifolia  are          boiled and the decoction used to clean sores Other          injuries that hunting dogs are susceptible to would be          nail breakage lameness and shoulder injuries injuries          caused by running into an object or the dog may be kicked          by a deer                          Dosages          Dosages were imprecise but hunters claimed to know          what would happen with some cases of overdosing For          example an overdose of ruckshun            Vernonia scorpioides  would          overexcite the dog to the point where it would even bark          at snakes If a dog is given a tincture made with          puncheon rum  proof it is claimed that the dog may          become temporarily crazy Based on experiences like          these some hunters have switched from alcohol to olive          oil for their tincture solution Additionally alcohol          tends to evaporate Lipophilic compounds are not          extracted in alcohol that would be extracted by olive          oil          One respondent claimed that pot bush            Ottonia ovata  gave his dog a          headache it shook its head continuously and there is no          sign of anything in its ear and it made two          respondents tongues numb This respondent then put          Vicks in his dogs nose as an alternative Another used          vinegar as an alternative to the scratchy pot Another          respondent claimed that dogs had a stronger constitution          than humans and should be given the equivalent of twice          the human dose per body weight                            Discussion                  Amerindian conceptualisations of nature          The following section attempts to reframe the          ethnomedicinal data in terms of bioscientific concepts          and methods or to establish whether symbolic aspects of          healing social support belief systems are of greater          relevance      The symbolic aspects of the plant          use are very similar to those of the South American          Amerindians and modern hunters may be unknowingly using          the traditions of the original Amerindian inhabitants of          Trinidad and Tobago These Amerindian traditions are          related to those previously practiced in South America          For example the claim that dogs that are crossed are          chasing spirits in the forest rather than prey may be          related to the belief of theTacana in Bolivia that          malevolent spirits dwell in canopy trees such as           Dipteryx odorata and           Ceiba samauma     The Caribs          in Dominica used leaf baths against bad luck              From the VenezuelanSpanish or Amerindian tradition comes          the belief in plants called turals in Venezuela and in          Spanishspeaking Trinidad These plants bring good          fortune and have silver coins planted at their roots               The belief that plants can bring luck may explain          their use for hunting dogs These beliefs may have          originated in the Amazon where baths are a frequent way          to utilise traditional remedies     Absorption          routes of active compounds are the respiratory tract          volatile substances carried by water vapour and the          skin     It is also practical to use baths if the          intention is to disguise the smell of the hunting dog so          that the game animal does not recognise it              The use of hallucinogenic and other plants to improve          hunting success is documented in the literature               Waorani in the Ecuadorian Amazon feel that the          characteristics of one entity or object may pass to          another     These beliefs may lie behind the use of          plants for hunting success Various rituals were          performed by the Amerindians in Guyana before a hunt              These rituals included plants called beenas which          acted as charms to entice any object or desire wanted          including making the capture of game certain Each beena          usually had a specific purpose Beenas were used for          dogs which were made to swallow specific pieces of roots          and leaves for specific game animals              Beenas were used because there was an ancient almost          forgotten belief that plants possessed associated spirits              In addition to the plant use of the Guyanese          Amerindians ants and other insects were made to bite the          nostrils of the hunting dog Plant leaves and other plant          parts including peppers were then rubbed into the wounds          on the noses of the dogs     This was done on the          assumption that the power of scent in dogs was improved          by these practices since the nasal mucous membranes were          cleaned the perceptions were sharpened and the dog          would keep its nose to the ground when hunting               There seemed to be a mental connection of success in          acquisition of game with pain previously inflicted on the          hunter and his dog     The nervous system of the          dogs was irritated to such an extent that it was          responsive to even the slightest external stimulus and          therefore more likely to be successful in hunting              There was also the belief that inflicting pain was a          means of preparing to meet without flinching any pain or          danger that could arise during the chase     This          preparation was not illadvised since           Lachesis muta muta often lives in          the burrows of lappe and tatou     Each hunting dog          was trained to hunt one sort of game              The use of the solitary wasp in the steaming process          can also be linked to Amerindian traditions Firstly the          Amazonian belief that the characteristics of one entity          or object may pass to another     could explain the          use of a wasp that hunts successfully in baths or          decoctions to make dogs better hunters Additionally          there are records of a specific ant that was given to          dogs by Guyanese Amerindians in order to make them good          hunters     Amerindians also named their hunting          dogs after ants and a wasp called warribisi that caught          prey           Costus species is called poivre          ginet in Dominica while           Aframomum melegueta is called          guinea pepper in most of the Caribbean It is not known          if the original Amerindian practice was for both plants          to be used for hunting dogs          Plants are given symbolic payments if they are          considered to have supernatural owners who require such          payment     The payment is placed on the ground near          the plant before it is picked and can be recovered later          by the person who picked it     Much of the plant          use is based on the Doctrine of Signatures which claims          that plant morphology suggests the medicinal use for a          plant One example is the use of leaves from various          species of           Aristolochia to treat snakebites               The triangular head of a           Bothrops viper is similar in size          and shape to many           Aristolochia species leaves              The serpentine coloration of the flowers of the           Aristolochia vines also suggests          the use as tourniquets to prevent the spread of snake          venom and the use of the leaves in antisnakebite potions              The Doctrine of Signatures is also seen in the          plants used as beenas or turals which are supposed to          have patterns on their leaves resembling different forest          animals     The beena for lappe had typical white          markings similar to those of the lappe while the beena          for quenk had a leaf with a small secondary leaf under          the surface that resembled either the scent gland of the          quenk or its nostril tip     Medicinal plants are          collected on Good Friday in Almera Spain                              Hunting success          The characteristics that dogs need for hunting success          are scentaccuracy speed enthusiasm and stamina          However several of the hunting dogs observed by the          authors were in poor condition Medicinal properties in          the plants used for baths may help alleviate any          subclinical infections these dogs might have due to their          poor condition          Agouti feed by day on fallen fruits     During the          hunts they were observed to be running within particular          territories when chased but had a habit of running and          doubling back or crossing water to disguise their scent          Dogs pursuing this game have to have their wits about          them be fit and be persistent The hunters chose          smaller dogs as agouti dogs so that they could follow          agoutis through dense bush to their hiding places The          hunters reported that deer ran straight for miles until          they lost their pursuers Deer hunters were reported to          spend days searching for their lost dogs Deer dogs were          chosen for endurance Deer are also solitary and          nocturnal and enter water when chased     They are          also adapted to swampy areas and are good at camouflage              All these characteristics are considered by the          hunters when choosing deer dogs Lappe tatou and manicou          are nocturnal living in hollow fallen trees during the          day and they forage at night     Dogs pursing this          game would ideally have good night vision a good sense          of smell and cannot be afraid to dive into hollow logs or          into water since lappe often enter their burrows from          under water     Lappe have four longitudinal rows of          white spots     Hunters claim that the plants used to          bathe dogs so that they will hunt lappe have similar          markings Hunters also claimed that dogs hunting tatou          may have to dig to unearth their prey          Wild hogquenk can be very aggressive especially in a          group of five or six     They live in swampy parts of          the forest and will cross water during the day              The bristles on the middorsal line from crown to rump of          the quenk raise when the animal is excited and the musk          glands emit a musky odour     Quenks eat succulent          tubers and fallen fruits and nuts     The bravery          dogs need to hunt quenk has been documented     Of          an original pack of nine native curs trained in quenk          and lappe hunting two received deep flesh wounds          inflicted by the tusks of two quenks during a hunt Four          others were bitten by a           Lachesis muta muta that one dog          pulled out of a hollow tree     Two of the bitten          dogs ran off before they could be treated and died within          fifteen minutes The two other dogs bitten by his          snakeship  ft  ins on the neck and paw were held          and treated with the local folk medicine of roots barks          and seeds in a tincture with rum     These two were          carried home and recovered in three days The author did          not indicate if the three uninjured dogs of the nine were          the bravest least brave or the most alert agile          or lucky                          Olfactory considerations          There is literature establishing that native          Amerindians participated in hunts with Creole hunters              This may explain not only the symbolic aspects of          the plant use by modern hunters discussed above but also          the olfactory considerations discussed in this section          Both sections show parallels between the practices of          current Trinidad hunters and the indigenous knowledge of          native South American groups          The Mixe in Mexico consider that the odour and taste          of a plant are important criteria in deciding what plants          to use for an illness     The Waorani in Amazonian          Ecuador consider that plants with strong or repulsive          odours will force symptoms to flee from the body and this          belief guides their use of           Renealmia alpinia and a           Philodendron for snakebites              The Warao in eastern Venezuela consider bad air to be          pathogenic and good or perfumed air to be therapeutic                       The acute sense of smell in dogs is due to a large          area of olfactory epithelium     Smells have the          advantage of remaining in the environment for a long time          and are a useful means of communication in dense          vegetation where verbal and visual communication is          impaired When hunters bathe dogs with strongly smelling          members of the           Piper species they may be imitating          animal behaviour or trying to mask the individual body          odour of their dogs so that they remain undetected by          game animals Dogs show a form of behaviour called          rollingrubbing in strongly smelling objects     The          intention of the dog may be to eliminate or dilute the          odour since this type of rolling is frequently associated          with sneezing and running     In other cases the dog          may roll in an odour that is considered unpleasant by          humans There are two plausible explanations for this          last behaviour One is that the dog is attempting to take          on the odour like a perfume the other is that the odour          is too strong to cover with a urine mark so the dog tries          to cover it with its entire body surface              There are indications that South American Amerindians          were aware of animal behaviour in relation to smells For          example the bristles on the middorsal line from crown          to rump of the quenk elevate when the animal is excited          and the musk glands emit a musky odour     Quenks          maintain odour homogeneity within the herd Each animal          rubs the lower portion of its jaw on a gland in the          others middorsum If a veterinarian removes a quenk          from the herd for treatment it will be killed when it is          replaced since it will no longer have this herd odour          Dr Gabriel Brown Department of Clinical Sciences          University of the West Indies pers comm  If          hunters bathe dogs with a plant that quenks eat the          temporary smell dogs obtain from this bath may be similar          to the smell of a quenk that feeds on this plant          Roucouyennes Caribs rubbed their dogs with           Hibiscus abelmoschus with the          expectation that its pungent smell would prevent jaguars          from biting their dogs     Tukanoan tribes in South          America also believed that deer had an inoffensive body          odour that was linked to their diet of pure foods such          as fresh sprouts young green leaves and sweet fruits              Tukanoan tribes also believed that people and          animals have smells related to the food that they eat and          the environment that they lived in     This          association of animal smells with their environment is          perhaps what the informant was referring to in his          reference to an agouti and the smell of its           Piper marginatum bed There is          evidence that some of the plants used by hunters are          eaten by deer and possibly by other game animals these          are           Costus species           Eschweilera species           Piper species and           Pithecellobium species              Tukanoan tribes also recognise the complex pheromonal          system of chemical communication that deer and other          animals use For example they claimed that when          whitetailed deer are frightened suddenly from close by          they run off and repeatedly break wind These tribes          interpret this behaviour as an attempt to mask the odour          trail left by the deers interdigital glands and thus          mislead predators and hunting dogs                              Poisons          Caterpillars may accumulate chemical compounds from          the plants that they feed on which may explain their          usefulness as part of a remedy Some hairy caterpillars          have urticating hairs which can cause severe skin          reactions and pain     It is not known what effect if          any the caterpillar venom has on the snake bit remedy          Any effect of the plants claimed to be efficacious          against scorpion stings may be due to symptomatic relief           analgesic antiinflammatory antipruritic effects in          addition to other biological activities              While proteases phospholipase A            and nucleotidases are responsible          for the haemorrhagic lesions induced by           Bothrops jararaca venom most          crotalid myotoxins are phospholipases and some exhibit          proteolytic activities     Crotalid snakes have a          wide geographical distribution this may contribute to          differences in their venom composition              Differences in venom composition may play a role in the          effectiveness of the medicinal plants used for          snakebites Unfortunately no research on the venoms of          Trinidads snakes was discovered so the following review          is of the closely related South American and Caribbean          snakes and scorpions Phospholipase A            was purified from           Lachesis muta venom in Brazil the          venom also showed procoagulant and proteolytic activities              High proteolytic activity was found in venom of           Lachesis muta and no platelet          proaggregating activity low inhibitory effect on          platelet aggregation and low procoagulant proteolytic          and phospholipase activity for           Botrops atrox in Brazil                       Studies in South America detail the pain and oedema at          the bite site and manifestations of autonomic nervous          system stimulation vomiting diarrhoea sweating          hypersalivation bradycardia that may be attributed to          serine protease in           Lachesis muta venom which causes          hypotension by releasing kinins from plasma kininogen              There are also cases of bleeding distant from the          bite site such as gingival haemorrhage epistaxis          haemoptysis haematuria uterine bleeding soft tissue          haematomas and very infrequently intrathoracic or          intrabdominal bleeding     Complications in the          bitten limb can include secondary infections by          Gramnegative organisms and acute renal failure among          others     There is a bothrojacarinlike  kDa          protein in           Bothrops species venom              Bothrojacarin forms a noncovalent complex with thrombin          blocking its ability to induce platelet aggregation and          fibrinogen clotting      Haemostatic effects in           Lachesis muta venom are          attributable to an alphafibrinogenase and haemorrhagic          metalloproteinases LHF and LHFII which have          alphafibrinogenase activity              The severity of envenoming depends on the species and          length of the snake the toxicity of the venom and the          amount inoculated     Also important are physical          activity after the bite and the physical characteristics          of the victim     The severity of bites from           Bothrops laceolatus in Martinique          is increased due to the primary bacterial infection from          bacteria present in the oral cavity of the snake            Aeromonas hydrophila            Morganella morganii            Proteus vulgaris and           Clostridium species     This          means that antibiotic treatment is sometimes necessary                       Scorpion venom when injected exerts a strong          inflammatory response     Many plant species used          against stings contain compounds with antiinflammatory          properties flavonoids rutin hesperidin quercetin          coumarins bergapten coumestans wedelolactone          triterpenes sterols and saponins      The          mechanism of action of the flavonoids is based on the          inhibition of enzymatic steps in the arachidonic acid          cascade     Plant compounds that are          immunostimulants at very low doses are some alkaloids          quinones isobutylamides phenolcarboxylic acid esters          and terpenoids     Other plant compounds with          immunostimulatory effects are sesquiterpene lactones              Many polysaccharides and glycoproteins enhance the          unspecific immune system by activating the phagocytotic          activity of granulocytes and macrophages or by inducing          cytokine production or influencing complement factors                       Some compounds from plants used for general          inflammation also inhibit enzymes like phospholipase A             from snake and scorpion venom                Some of these plant compounds are          hypolaetinglucoside and related flavanoids          Stimulation of the immune system might also contribute to          reducing the effects of snakebites and improvement in          recovery from envemomization by contributing to a more          rapid removal of the venom     Chlorogenic acid acts          as an antidote by binding to proteins through hydrophobic          interactions and hydrogen bonds     It presents          anticomplementary action at the classical pathway              Analgesic properties like those provided by tropane          alkaloids would also lessen the pain of the bite as          would compounds that act as sedatives and tranquilisers                       Several pharmacological properties of plants reputed          to be snakebite antidotes include antimyotoxic          antihaemorrhagic analgesic and antiedematogenic          blockage of cutaneous and intraperitoneal capillary          permeability activity caused by the venom and protection          from its lethality     A more direct antivenom          activity would involve complexation of the compounds with          venom constituents thus rendering them unable to act on          receptors or to act by competitive blocking of the          receptors     Phenolic compounds especially complex          polyphenols like some tannins can bind with proteins              Alternatively the catecholamines released as a          result of venomreceptor interaction may be antagonised          or metabolised more quickly              Plant extracts            Mucuna pruriens var utilis that          produce a doserelated increase in the clotting time of          blood induced by carpet viper venom            Echis carinatus  would be useful          against bites from           Bothrops species that cause          haemorrhage at the point of injection due to the          inhibition of the clotting mechanism     Antivenom          compounds so far isolated from plants include          protocatechuic acid a catechingallocatechin tannin          caffeic acid derivatives chlorogenic acid cynarin          coumarins bergapten flavonoids rutin          isoscutellarein kaempferol quercetin hesperidin          arturmerone alkaloids aristolochic acid          triterpenoids triterpenes coumestans wedelolactone          sterols sitosterol stigmasterol betaamyrin          triterpenoid glycosides alkaloids allantoin and          lignoflavonoids        Many relevant compounds          are widely distributed nitrogenfree low molecular          weight compounds except aristolochic acid an untypical          nonbasic nitroderivative     The structural          similarities of certain plant chemicals found in plants          used for snakebites are an isoflavone skeleton acidic          nature and dioxygenated functionality              One study found total inhibition of           Bothrops asper haemorrhage with the          ethanolic ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of plants          containing catequines flavones anthocyanines and          condensated tannins These compounds may have played a          role in the inhibitory effect observed probably owing to          the chelation of the zinc required for the catalytic          activity of venoms haemorrhagic metalloproteinases              Reduction in the intensity of the effects of          envenomation could also be achieved by a neutralisation          of the venom peptides polypeptides proteins and enzymes               There are plants used for snakebite that act          by inhibiting the proteolytic activities of the venom and          antagonising crotoxininduced haemolysis myotoxic and          haemorrhagic activities of crotalid venoms                        Tityus trinitatis toxic fraction          was recognised by the antiserum of the Venezuelan          scorpion           Tityus discrepans which has a          type toxin     The onset of symptoms from the          time of evenomation is generally between five and thirty          minutes Local evidence of a sting is often minimal or          absent but several patients report severe pain or a          burning sensation with intense pruritis and local or          general hyperesthesia     Symptoms may last from          seven days to several weeks Redness inflammation and          local oedema at the sting site are evident              In Trinidad the following clinical features have been          seen tachypnea restlessness vomiting increased          salivation cerebral oedema pulmonary oedema          hypovolemic shock and convulsions with myocarditis and          pancreatitis being major complications     Scorpion          venoms may cause these symptoms through release of          catecholamines from the sympathetic nervous system              The venom exerts its effects primarily to the          cardiovascular and respiratory systems but there is also          stimulation of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic          peripheral activities     The venom is a complex          mixture of phospholipase A             low molecular weight proteins          acetylcholinesterase hyaluronidase toxic polypeptides          amino acids serotonin and neurotoxins      Two          fatal cases suggested toxic myocarditis                              Review of the known biological effects of the          plants and their constituents          This section reviews available literature on the          plants identified in this study and compares their          Trinidad and Tobago ethnoveterinary use to the          folkmedicinal use in other countries mainly Latin          America and the Caribbean All folkmedicinal uses are          human uses unless otherwise specified Plants used to          achieve hunting success including those chosen according          to the Doctrine of Signatures will be treated here as          medicinal plants since supernatural emic can occasionally          suggest etic efficacy     For each species or genus          a summary of chemical constituents will be given in          addition to active compounds if known This type of          ethnopharmacological review and evaluation is documented          in the literature     The plants below are listed in          alphabetical order                    Acrocomia ierensis tentative ID          No research was found on the compounds in the root                    Aframomum melegueta has been          previously recorded as a stimulant     Caribs of          Dominica used           Aframomum granumparadisi leaves on          their bodies while they were bathing and the plant was          also given to their hunting dogs     Seeds were put          into rum as a chauffe to excite dogs               Aframomum granumparadisi contains          alkaloids piperine essential oils and resins                                 Aristolochia rugosa and           Aristolochia trilobata are recorded          in a list of plants used worldwide and in the West          Indies Venezuela South and Central America against          snakebites and scorpion stings                   Caribs in Guatemala use           Aristolochia trilobata root and          tuber decoctions for stomach pains and use leaf tinctures          for diarrhoea     Aristolochic acid inhibits          inflammation induced by immune complexes and          nonimmunological agents carrageenan or croton oil              Aristolochic acid inhibits the activity of snake          venom phospholipase PLA             by forming a  complex with the          enzyme       Since phospholipase enzymes play a          significant part in the cascade leading to the          inflammatory and pain response their inhibition could          lead to relief of problems from scorpion envenomation                                 Barleria lupulina is well known in          Thai folk medicine as an antiinflammatory and is used          against snakebites and varicella zoster virus lesions and          showed activity against five clinical isolates of herpes          simplex virus type      Compounds found in the          leaves of           Barleria lupulina are barlerin          acetylbarlerin shanzhiside methyl ester          acetylshanzhiside methyl ester ipolamiidoside and          iridoid glucosides     An antibiotic and          immunostimulant protein was reported from the plant and          other species and patented                        Bauhinia excisa vine decoction has          been used for snakebites and pain and the root decoction          is used for scorpion stings in Trinidad              Indigenous Mayans and inhabitants of Eastern Nicaragua          use           Caspicum frutescens for fever          respiratory problems and infections               Capsaicinoids are powerful skin irritants              Capsaicin is a vanillylamide with hyperemic and          anaesthetic properties      It causes          vasodilatation enhanced permeability and has          antiinflammatory and neurotransmitter activation          properties     Capsicum species have inhibitory          effects on           Bacillus species           Clostridium species and           Streptococcus pyogenes              Capsaicins use in the treatment of chronic pain is          due to an analgesic effect that is explained by          capsaicins action of depletion of stores of substance P          from primary sensory neurons as a consequence of the          reduced production of prostaglandin               Capsaicins antiphlogistic activity is due to the          counterirritant effect which means that a local          irritant effect exerts an additional more remote          antiinflammatory effect     This is explained by a          liberation of corticoids under the influence of certain          cutivisceral reflexes     The counterirritant          effect on the gastric mucosa also occurs because          capsaicin stimulates production of the cytoprotective          prostaglandin E                Capsaicin produces          analgesic and antiinflammatory effects because it          inhibits both lipoxygenase and cycoloxygenase              A  g human ingestion of red pepper stimulated          carbohydrate oxidation     This may explain why the          Choc Indians used it to give their hunting dogs more          energy                        Cecropia peltata leaves boiled in          water are used in a bath for rheumatism

        Eclipta prostrata or to          wedelolactone stigmaterol and sitosterol Stigmaterol          and sitosterol were less effective than wedelolactone          but interacted synergistically with it     These          effects were interpreted as consequences of          antiproteolytic and antiphospholipase A            activities of           Eclipta prostrata and its          constituents     These three plant compounds have          antiinflammatory properties and are recognised          antivenom compounds                   Ethanolic extracts of the aerial parts of           Eclipta prostrata Asteraceae          neutralised the lethal activity of the venom of South          American rattlesnake            Crotalus durissus terrificus  as          well as the myotoxic and haemorrhagic effects of           B jararaca            B jararacussu and           Lachesis muta snake venoms when          mixed           in vitro before ip injection into          adult Swiss mice      Three plant compounds          wedelolactone sitosterol and stigmasterol were able to          neutralise lethal doses of the venom Aqueous extracts of          the plant inhibited the release of creatine kinase from          isolated rat muscle exposed to the crude venom              Wedelolactone reduced the myotoxic effect of crude venoms                    Crotalus viridis

from them     Empirical use of           Eclipta prostrata alcoholic          extracts to treat crotalid envenomation are supported by          these studies                        Eschweilera subglandulosa is a tree          with smooth leathery leaves about  inches long              The fruit is well liked by agouti     This fact may          explain its use since after a bath the smell of its          leaves may stay on the hunting dog                    Jatropha curcas latex is applied to          external wounds in Per and Indonesia      The          leaf bath is used for rash
