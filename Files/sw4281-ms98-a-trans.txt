              well yes   so so  do you do much exercising   uh only for fun i really enjoy it though so uh lets see what do i do in the winter i play volleyball   yeah what do   and i go skiing thats about it   oh you go skiing eh yeah well out here in the west youve got some nice places to go skiing   well i must admit that Utah has the best snow on earth     anyway um i havent been in a regular exercising program do you have a regular program that you actually you know stick to or   uh   do you have it planned out or is it just you do exercise for recreation recreation   yeah it you know i do it for the fun i cant stand say stationary bicycle   umhum   gets pretty boring or like uh you know lifting weights because i cant count more than to three before i get bored and then i lose track of the repetitions but uh the uh you know the the gyms open say for volleyball on every Wednesday so so thats regular   so you go so you like regularly do volleyball yeah i used to i used to regularly run and then about a year and a half ago i had some back problems   yeah   and i havent been able to get out and run and i have really noticed it in a year and a half ive gone from being fit to being a vegetable i feel like such a vegetable now but   so you must be over twenty then   yeah im im over twenty im going down the gentle slope   yeah when youre about when youre under twenty five you can pretty much get away with uh doing nothing and then when you want to get do something something athletic you just get up and do it otherwise i find youve got to every week everyday   yeah   if you want to have any sort of shape   yeah so anyway im looking forward to the Spring as it comes around to trying to get back into running now that im   running that doesnt bother your knees at all   no   great   no ive never had problems with my knees at all um uh the thats not not at all a problem its more just uh the other thing i do is i run with my wife and so we go kind of out together and we dont run hard like like we jog and like kind of just go see places and kind of run around together and its not like we go real hard or anything but its enjoyable   well its hard to get no exercise while running i mean you pretty much got to move dont you   oh yeah well you do i mean its its really jogging but i mean you can push yourself at different levels how hard you run   well even just walking well but you know like say riding a bike where if you go really slow its pretty much coasting youre not even doing anything and just to move while running youve got to move your legs every single step   hm   so you dont you dont feel youre getting a good exercise when you go out uh jogging   oh i do but i dont feel that its that hard  i  its not that stressful you know youre asking about how it was on the knees or on the body and that stuff and its not   oh okay   its not really stressful at all in any i mean its its fun and its enjoyable and its good exercise but   all right yeah its not supposed to hurt i just find that it really pounds because im in particular running   you you do you run      no no thats i and id like to because i think itd be fun i run in connection with you know in case i accidentally play basketball or uh       so you know football you know something theres all sorts of activities where you end up running        its just sort of a natural thing   um   but i dont do it just for the sake of running   how about swimming for a while i used to swim   yeah you know swimming is something ive gotten to the point where i action actually can do laps now   uh uhhuh   that used to bore bore me to tears you know id love to swim if it was water polo or you know splashing about or you know if there was some diversion just uh but but thats good exercise   um   yeah im looking forward to that its i can   does this extend out from like high school or something like that athletics or anything that you used to do in high school   uh   i used to run some cross country in high school but   yeah see that that gets back to this lack of discipline and training i i would never join a team because theyd want you to do these repetitions or something   uhhuh   rather than let just play the game
