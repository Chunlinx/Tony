                                 TVs Mysterious Fascination With Young Adults                        The successful debut of Once and Again  the new drama from thecreators of thirtysomething  no less about having a love life as adivorced parent has drawn plenty of hosannas from TVwatchers who feared thatthe tube had forever been given over to Dawsons Creek and its myriadclones Once and Again s success has been taken as a sign that a showdoesnt have to appeal to that desperately soughtafter to demographic inorder to be a hit            As it happens Once and Again s success doesnt necessarily show thatat all because it is in fact a huge hit with the to audience Its shareof TVwatchers in that group is as large as its overall share and larger thanthe share received by new shows such as Freaks and Geeks and Now andAgain  In fact Ed Zwicks show about yuppie parents is proving morepopular with the younguns than his show about yuppie kids My SoCalledLife             Whats weird though is the assumption Once and Again had to combatin order even to get on the air that nothing is more desirable than thoseto viewers This is not an assumption unique to television Itscertainly at work in movies and has also been propelling changes in themagazine world most notably in the ascent of pseudolad magazines likeMaxim and in the pressure thats being felt by older magazines to makethemselves more youthfriendly But the fact that the assumption is ubiquitousdoesnt necessarily mean that it makes sense            Now Im part of this fabled demographic albeit at the high endchronologically and in a lot of wayswillingness to consume love of newstuff appetite for pop culture of all kindsIm an ideal target foradvertisers So I have no problem with TV programmers Hollywood execs andmagazine editors trying to appeal to me But I am perplexed by the avidity withwhich I am being courted because of one simple fact There arent that many ofme            I dont mean that Im unique I mean that literally there are fewermanyfewerpeople in my generation than in the generations ahead of and behind usAnd while its certainly true that people in their late s and early satleast in cities where those people are less likely to have familieshave alot of disposable income it cant compare in absolute terms to that stillwielded by the baby boomers Even in the New Economy earning power rises withage Most people make a lot more when theyre  than when theyre             So why do advertisers think were the ideal audience Partly because of ourability to spend without worrying about our childrens education partlybecause some advertising is aspirational so that you push products that peoplewill want to buy when they can afford to and partly because of illconsideredassumptions about brand loyalty in particular the idea that if you hook me ona particular kind of car or suit or beer at  youll have me for life            But surely an important reason for the hegemony of the youngadult audienceis simply that young adults tend to be the ones who are buying advertisingtime designing the ads and increasingly writing and programming the showsand films that we see I become the ideal consumer because my friends are theones selling me the products            The picture is more complicated than this of course There arent manyyearolds even today writing ads for Chiat Day or programming for NBCThough I suspect there are a lot of yearolds doing those jobs who thinktheyre still  And Im not sure if Dawsons Creek andFelicity are really targeted at yearolds In fact I pray theyarent Finally at the bottom end of the demographic there a lot more peoplethan at the top end Those are the oldest Echo Boomers and advertisers shouldreally want them            The point is not that the tos should be disregarded Its just thatfrom a purely economic point of view they shouldnt be regarded with suchfascination Last week the combined ratings of Buffy the Vampire Slayerand Dawsons Creek added up to just  percent of all the people whowere watching television while those shows aired And even a very stylish percent of all the customers you could be reaching is still just in the end percent
