                                 The Conformists                        Dear Chris            A Beatles biographer I forget which one once said that Sgt Pepperbrought the world closer together than any event since the Congress ofVienna Whatever that means Maybe monoculture is too strong a wordfor this way of thinking maybe not But youve certainly hit on something byfocusing on Millers partiality to music that brings us all together Hes ane pluribus unum man            Miller quotes Ed Kelly one of the interchangeable dancers on Dick ClarksAmerican Bandstand  as saying The craziest part of it was that many ofus became these instant celebrities yet none of us really had any talentThere is an implicit criticism here of rocks role in creating todaysproblematic to put it mildly celebrity culture            But Miller is not awfully concerned about authenticity For him rock is                           the product of the coldest sort of commercial calculation truebut also embodying a not ignoble vision of an America transformed of Mind andBody Black and White dancing the same dance moving to the same beat askids en masse joined in their own brand of Dionysian revelry watered downand trite but genuinely uplifting all the same                        But this is ignoble This is where rock turns into thefeedbagformorons the opiate of the masses that its harshest critics havealways condemned Once rulers understand the political implications ofDionysian revelry it gets turned to rotten ends Merengue is terrific musictoo but when half a century ago Trujillo ordered that sound systems be setup to play it all over the Dominican Republic it wasnt to uplift people butto render them passive            Rock has its roots in the Cold War it is at least in part the musicalexpression of outrage at the uniformity and boredom of American suburbia Butlike so many protest movements it partakes of the very vices it purports tocritique Rockat least the canonical line of it that Miller describesherehas been a greater force for unthinking conformism than anythingLevittown wrought            Kids understand this Miller doesnt always Thats why he gets blindsidedby punk and disco The Sex Pistols of course are incomprehensible without aglance at the twotrack uniformity of midtolate s music lugubriousminutelong navelgazing guitar dirges by the Eagles and Jackson Browne onone hand ad jingles like Undercover Angel and HeartbeatIts a Love Beaton the other Not that there werent a few truly emetic songs that united thevices of both Gerry Raffertys Baker Street Walter Egans was that hisname Magnet and Steel            But what is disco Since I know little about it and since you make bigclaims for it I would love to hear more At the time it seemed like a bid byout classesboth urban blacks and the last of urban working class whitestopartake of the license and selfexpression that rock had provided to privilegedclasses Since disco came precisely at a time when the privileged classes intheir political incarnation were busily pitting workingclass whites againstblacks through such innovations as forced busing this seems like an oddalliance to say the least Unless the white participation inand enthusiasmfordisco was a mirage But it didnt seem like it at the time            Maybe youre right that Miller is not listening to much modern rock I dontlisten to much either and most of its poppy stuff I hear on the drive towork I too find a lot of whats come out of the s derivative SherylCrows guitar licks seem so familiar that I have often suspected theyre simplymixed out of Stuck in the Middle With You Smashmouth makes me certain thatwhile Jim Morrison may be dead Ray Manzarek is not The New Radicals soundlike Todd Rundgren has just emerged from the cryogenics lab where hes lainfrozen since  Beck whom I find a consistent delight seems to draw fromless mainstream stuffa hybrid of Prince and that terrific hightech Britishduo Godley Creme who had a pop incarnation as cc            Im sure these are fogeyish and undiscriminating sentiments My point isthat any casual acquaintance is bound to lead to similar ones because thesurface of rock is exciting only at rare and lucky moments            BestChris
