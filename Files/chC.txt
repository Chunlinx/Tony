Cabeza de Baca Fabiola Born in northern New Mexico on May   although some sources give her birth date as  Fabiola Cabeza de Baca became a famous home economist teacher folklorist and writer She was one of several New Mexican women such as Cleofas M Jaramillo and Nina OteroWarren who wrote of the culture and heritage of their Hispano ancestors Her parents came from longestablished Hispano families who had been in New Mexico for over  years Her grandparents raised her from the age of four after her mother died leaving Fabiola with one brother and two sisters She attended the Loretto Academy in Las Vegas and after graduating from high school became a teacher in a rural area six miles from her fathers ranch in La Liendre In  she received a BA degree from New Mexico Normal now New Mexico Highlands University and in  a BS in home economics from New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts now New Mexico State University In between she also spent one year studying in SpainFor over thirty years she worked as an extension agent teaching the traditional ways of preparing foods and emphasizing the nutritional value in the native diet Two of her books Historic Cookery and The Good Life depict the way of life of the Hispanos in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries In We Fed Them Cactus she presents a biography and ethnography of her family especially her grandmother a strong woman and a curandera and retells the stories narrated to her by her father She depicts the arrival of the Hispano pioneers on the llano plains of western New Mexico in the s and also that of the Anglos in the s the loss of land the fencingin of the plains and the end of the era with the death of her father The title of the book refers to the custom in New Mexico of feeding cattle cactus to keep them alive during droughts In The Good Life not a long book Cabeza de Baca creates a fictional family the Turrietas and uses their story to narrate the rituals customs food and culture of New Mexico The customs of Christmas Lent marriage and a funeral are presented along with many recipes of the foods prepared for these celebrations She wrote many articles for various New Mexican publications In  she retired but continued to work giving lectures writing and acting as a consultant to the Peace Corps She died at the age of ninetyseven on October  Genaro Padilla refers to her writing as folkloric autobiography a significant genre since it is one of the few kinds of writing by Hispanos that depicts the life they either experienced or learned from their ancestors at the turn of the century Her folkloric work is extremely important because she wrote about women and how their complicated and elaborate daily work so profoundly maintained the culture and traditions of the Hispanos Cabeza de Baca was an active member of many community organizations and was president in  of the New Mexico Folklore SocietyReferences Cabeza de Baca   Padilla  Perrigo  Ponce  Rebolledo  Calavera SkeletonA bony skeleton andor the skull of a skeleton The calavera has become the symbol of the downtrodden who must laugh at life in order to survive it It is also used to mean a drunkard or a very stupid person During the celebrations of the holy day Da de los Muertos candy skulls are made and sold in bakeries throughout Mexico and the United States These skulls may be placed on home altars or given as gifts to children family and friends The Mexican artist and printmaker Jose Guadalupe Posada started drawing calaveras during the late nineteenth century to coincide with this holiday Their popularity is primarily attributed to him and his work His images of calaveras have been reproduced thousands of times and can be found yearround but especially during celebrations of Da de los Muertos Posada printed many calaveras during the period of the presidency of Porfirio Daz and during the Mexican Revolution He introduced the humorous satirical calavera that showed the objectionable side of life that engaged in regular daily activities such as eating dancing drinking fighting enjoying life and being a regular Mexican The Mexican concept of death is exemplified in the satiric antics of the calavera and this perspective is also found in the art literature and performance arts of Chicanos Calaveras are depicted dancing drinking in cantinas bars crowding and falling out of buses and playing instruments in musical groups El Teatro Campesino in its performances always has a calavera character that either represents La Muerte death or typifies a disturbing alter ego of one of the main charactersA Mexican tradition of the late nineteenth century was the publication of a poetic broadside that was called a calavera Published before or during the festivities of Da de los Muertos these calaveras carried poems that poked fun at socially prominent people such as politicians and the very wealthy Some calaveras such as the poems were printed in newspapers but most were small pamphlets or single sheets that were sold on the street For a small fee people could hire a composer to write a calavera for them and draw a skeleton to go with it According to Tinker their main functions are to remind us in a goodhumored way that we all are mortal and to poke fun at friends and attack public officials These last are supposed to take it all in good grace Calaveras are still published every November  in many cities of Mexico and in some cities in Texas notably San Antonio Tinker   The calavera is now an integral element of Mexican and Chicano folk art and it adorns murals stationery postcards party invitations and decorations and even religious artSee also Da de los Muertos La MuerteReferences Carmichael and Sayer  Da de los

official documents Not infrequently the return address on an envelope will be Califas AztlnSee also PachucosReferences Barker  Braddy California FolkloreThe settlement of California by Spanish colonizers happened much later than in New Mexico and Texas The first Franciscan mission was established in San Diego in   years after the exploration of New Mexico A second great difference was that many of the Spanish settlers came by way of Mexico so many of them represented a mestizo mixedrace culture rather than a purely sixteenthcentury Spanish culture as the earlier explorers had Many were Mexican Spaniards and of course did not bring the Spanish language and culture of the Golden Age of Spain with them Their Spanish language and culture had evolved into a slightly New World variantThe population of California did not grow much during the eighteenth century and after the independence of Mexico from Spain in  Spanish culture quickly declined in the region Many Spaniards left the region and the great migration of thousands of Anglo American gold seekers took place so the Spanish culture and language could not survive in California as it did in Texas and New Mexico By  the Mexican or Californio inhabitants of the state represented  percent of the total population At the turn of the century the Chicano population in Los Angeles was only  percent It wasnt until  with the beginnings of a revolution in Mexico that the first large wave of Mexican immigration was felt in CaliforniaIn discussing Hispano folklore Aurelio M Espinosa the foremost Mexican American folklorist of the early twentieth century delineated three generations of Hispanics in California First were the Mexican Spaniards who settled the region in the eighteenth century and their descendents called Californios who represented the California Spanish traditions that Espinosa most wanted to study Second were the Mexicans who continued to migrate into California during the nineteenth century and these people as Espinosa delicately put it were gente de mas baja condicin y cultura people of a lower condition and culture   And third as he wrote his study in the s he found many Spaniards who had recently immigrated to California from Andaluca in Spain and who represented a Spain from a different era and not that of the Spanish Californios As he states he collected romances from the true Californios mostly from the Monterey region In addition he collected folktales proverbs ballads and other lore which were published in the California Folklore Quarterly in the sA renowned proponent of Mexican Spanish folklore in the Southwest and California was Charles F Lummis  a selftaught photographer ethnologist musicologist journalist and the founder of the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles Lummis discovered the Mexicans in Colorado New Mexico and California in the s and s and became enamored of the Mexican way of life especially of their hospitality courtesy and respect for age Heisley  He collected oral traditions specifically Spanish folk songs from Mexicans in New Mexico and California and felt an urgency to record them before they disappeared The Southwest Museum holds hundreds of songs he recorded on wax cylinders songs in Spanish and in twentyfour Indian languages from southern California He equated Spanish folk songs with the romantic past of the Californios and Mexicans and felt almost a nostalgic fascination for early California history and the era of the large ranchos In his own words The Romance of California is Spanish Romance Everybody knows that who knows anything b Although not a trained folklorist Arnold Rojas writes of the vaquero cowboy culture of California especially in the San Joaquin Valley at the turn of the century and into the first third of the s He describes the life of the Mexican vaqueros how their lives were spent working on large ranches like the Tejon Ranch and the Kern County Land Co Their lives were very narrowly focused on cattle and ranch life and they all spoke mostly Spanish In his reminiscences of vaquero culture and of the impact Mexican Sonorans had on California Rojas shows a side of Chicano culture not commonly known Born in California where his mother and grandmother were also born it is clear he loved the life he lived He writes of La Llorona and Joaqun Murrieta and of Tiburcio Vsquez who once gave food to his grandmother and mother when they were fleeing from the gringos in Los AngelesThere are no overall written accounts or collections of the oral traditions and folklore of the early Californios as we have of the Hispanos of New Mexico In Angustias de la Guerra Ords Occurrences in Hispanic California she describes some customs but her work was not intended to preserve for history the way of life of the Californios Glimpses of customs games dances theater and other traditions can be found in the writings of early western travelers although these were often depicted prejudicially and with a lack of historical context Spanishlanguage newspapers from the late nineteenth century exhibit folk customs and traditions The folklore collected from Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the twentieth century even if its from a third or fourthgeneration Chicano generally will be folklore from Mexico transplanted to California since the turn of the century by immigrants fleeing a revolutionary war or those coming to work in the agriculture fields Of course it could also originate in New Mexico or Texas since there has been much migration into California by Chicanos from those states Folktales jests folk songs corridos ballads and customs related to religious and secular holidays foods and other folk traditions found in contemporary California will have a lot in common with those found in other southwestern states and with Mexico Chicano students have taken an active interest in folklore in the last twenty years and archives established at the University of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles hold growing collections of many genres of Mexican American folklore There are published collections from the s and s of folk medicine rituals and folk narratives collected primarily from Mexican immigrants in the Los Angeles area but there is still much fieldwork to be done in this areaSee also Espinosa Aurelio MacedonioReferences Espinosa   Espinosa Jr  Heisley  Lummis a b Miller

including French English Italian Greek and Hebrew and was spoken by the gypsies of Spain It was brought to New Spain by the Spanish conquistadores where it continued to be identified as the language of the poor the uneducated and also the criminal class Cal became the dialect of the underworld of Mexico City and migrated into the Southwest as some believe through the city of El PasoPublished studies of the speech of the Chicano investigate the diverse communication modes by examining the language that reflects the cultural experiences of the various subcultures of Mexican and Chicano communities Some of these idioms are the pachuco dialect Chicano Spanish New Mexico colonial Spanish south Texas vocabulary cal and the argot of the tirilones of El Paso The pachuco dialect has been especially influenced by cal it was and still is primarily a male speech and if used by women they were considered to be street women or girlfriends of gang members Today however many words from cal are fully integrated into the standard vocabulary of Chicano Spanish and writers incorporate it into poetry short stories and novels What makes cal and its appropriation into Chicano Spanish distinct is its use by workingclass Chicanos and Mexicanos It is a shared language across the MexicanUS border equally used on both sidesThe vocabulary of Chicano Spanish is congested with Old World words words from the pachuco era and consequently heavily influenced by cal Chicanos have a sense of pride in being aware of these words and expressions and knowing how to use them There are many studies that examine the Spanish spoken by Chicanos and several published dictionaries of Chicano Spanish and of cal Most of the studies provide examples of the male use of cal but there is recent research that shows that female cholas and pachucas also have an extensive vocabulary in cal Galindos studies of Chicana prisoners show the social importance of cal in conveying a sense of intimacy and camaraderie between women who shared similar life experiences and acquaintances  One published dictionary of cal by Jay Rosensweig presents cal in a rather harsh manner referring to it as gutter Spanish which prompted a reader to take the privilege of writing a comment on the title page of the book This example of book graffiti is presented here because it is an excellent example of the use of Chicano Spanish influenced by cal and used at an opportune momentEste gabacho pendejo y su pinche libro no valen ni un corajeque vaya a agarrar las nalgas a la puta que le pariThis stupid gringo

population of the Southwest Arthur Leon Campa was a pioneer in his study of the folklore of the Hispanic population primarily of New Mexico and Colorado His great achievement and comprehensive work Hispanic Culture in the Southwest was published in  one year after his death Campa was born on February   in Guaymas Sonora Mexico the third of five children His early years were spent mostly in Mexico in Baja California and Sonora His father Daniel Campa was a lieutenant in the Federal Army and was killed in  by Pancho Villa revolutionaries His mother Delfia Lopez de la O Americanborn returned with her children to the United States First they settled in a ranch outside of El Paso and later she moved to Albuquerque where she opened a store and restaurantArthur Campa earned a BA  and an MA  from the University of New Mexico and a PhD from Columbia University  Campa taught at the University of New Mexico from  to  and again after World War II from  to  In  he became the chair of the Department of Modern Languages and Literature at the University of Denver and he stayed there until he retired in  Campa wrote nine books nine bulletins and fortynine articles mostly about folklore but also on the Spanish language He considered Hispanic Culture in the Southwest his most important achievement This comprehensive work is a cultural history of the Hispanic population of California Colorado Arizona New Mexico and the TexasMexico border region Campa presents the salient characteristics of Hispanic culturecustoms language arts and crafts and witchcraftwhile also discussing distinctive character traits such as individualism as well as the right to be and the right to do perspectives on time and remnants of the medieval honor code He married Lucille Cushing in

holy field or field of the saints Although some people use the betterknown term cementerio meaning cemetery camposanto is a word still used in many families Interestingly some Spanish dictionaries define the word as a cemetery for Catholics whereas they define cementerio as an enclosed place for burying the deadCamposantos are important in Chicano families and the concept of death is always present in personal narratives songs and in the religious holy days observed El Da de los Muertos or All Souls Day is a religious and folk holy day that is devoutly celebrated it usually includes a visit to the cemetery The family cleans the grave sites of loved ones sets up flowers and candles and visits with and prays for the departed During the rest of the year attendance to burial sites does not diminish and graves are kept decorated and colorfulDuring the colonial period of New Spain burials were made within the church itself as was the tradition in medieval Spain Spaniards and the clergy were allowed to be buried in the missionary churches whereas the mestizos people of mixed race and Indians were buried in the camposanto located in front or to the right of the church By the late eighteenth century the Catholic Church forbade additional burials inside churches supposedly for public health reasons but the ricos the welltodo continued to buy their way into the churches So the camposantos were still left for the poor mestizos A recognizable sign of a colonial frontier camposanto was a large public eightfoot wooden cross that stood in the front or center of the cemetery Some can still be found today in rural parts of northern New Mexico and Texas Another feature that can also still be found in parts of the Southwest is segregation and isolation from Anglo cemeteries Many were located side by side but were fenced off and had separate entrances The sites chosen for rural camposantos were often on tierra muerta barren land that was too poor to cultivateCemetery and graveyard decorating traditions have been researched and written about as a means of appreciating and understanding Mexican folk beliefs about death and grieving The adornment of grave sites reflects religious folk practices and ethnic and family attitudes about death and remembrance Some of the customs include decorating and designing a space that will be revisited by a family for many generations The intent is to keep the deceased person alive in the familys memory Some design motifs that are distinctive to Chicano cemeteries are the construction and design of crosses Terry Jordans book has an illustration of twelve different subtypes of wooden Latin crosses found on Mexican graves in Texas  In the nineteenth and even into the twentieth century crosses were built of wood but these didnt last long being destroyed either by the elements or by vandalism More common today are crosses made of molded concrete Many grave sites have a cerquito a low wood metal or concrete fence an enclosure that surrounds an individual grave Another common trait is to construct a cement grave marker with a nicho niche built into it so that the statue of a saint La Virgen de Guadalupe or a photograph of the deceased can be placed in it Sometimes a concrete cross will have a nicho built into its base for the same purpose Although fresh flowers are often placed at grave sites paper and plastic flowers are more common Colorful plastic wreaths are sometimes attached to the wooden or cement cross Another distinguishing feature in Chicano camposantos is the wide range of materials used in decorating a grave As with home yard shrines and home altars everyday objects are used as personal and artistic statements It is often in the performance of highly charged personal rituals that people create folklore folk art and folk musicMany grave markers are brightly painted and some even have religious scenes painted on them This tradition has been linked to Mexicos indigenous heritage for as Terry Jordan states Such use of color in a sacred context has ample preColumbian precedent in Mexico where even the huge pyramids once bore bright paints  He goes on to say Hispanic graveyards are places of color where paints flowers and tiles combine to comfort the bereaved and startle the gringo See also Altars Folk Art NichosReferences Barber  Gosnell and Gott  Griffith  Jordan  Sanborn
