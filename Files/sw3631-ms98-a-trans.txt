        you say you taught school for a while   yes its been some years ago i havent taught in the last twenty years   oh what grades did you teach   i taught about half the time at the high school level and about half the time at the junior college level   okay uh and what general subjects   um business subjects   okay okay   do you have children in school   uh not yet uh my first son is uh about two months old now   umhum   none of them presently going into college um   yes   do you see anything in particular do you see you feel is wrong about the school system the way its running now   uh        well other than the fact that it its not difficult enough and it doesnt last us long enough during the school year uh i one of the the big errors uh that was made over the years is passing children along when they hadnt really completed the get grade that they were in   yeah   and allowing children to graduate from high school who couldnt read and write   yeah   and cipher   uhhuh yes   oh when i taught at the uh junior college level um i taught uh business law at the sophomore level and we were on the quarter system so they had this was the last two quarters in the sophomore year so they had to   umhum   think up something for me to teach at the uh front end of the in the fall   yes   so i taught a little course called office machines now if you keep in mind this was long before the days of the hand held computer calculator   yes   so we started off with a ten key adding machine   umhum   and        uh ah one of the first problems was to add three tenths and twenty four hundredths and invariably a substantial proportion of the class would come up with twenty seven hundredths so i would have to launch into a discussion of common denominator and explain that every figure that was entered into that ten key adding machine with two decimal places   umhum   was a number divided by a hundred and in order to add three tenths to anything it had to be changed to thirty hundredths   umhum umhum   and uh the only criterion for getting into the junior college where i taught was being eighteen years of age uh having a high school diploma was not a prerequisite it was for some of the the curricula but it wasnt for the business curriculum   yes huh   so so thats   not not even a GED was required   i beg your pardon   a GED want even required or was that available yet   uh no it was not at that time uh to take courses all you had to be with eighteen years of age   huh      uh so uh the the new math i think ruined our math uh i was teaching at the high school level when it was being introduced to the seventh grade and eighth grade and uh i went to a lecture and the math teacher said well we used to teach business arithmetic at the seventh and eighth grade level but now were going to teach the new math like how to to count in the binary counting system   umhum   and uh uh the base twelve and that sort of thing and uh were gonna teach the theory of mathematics and never mind percentage   umhum yes   so um   hm   i i checked my my son my son was uh lets see when would he have been in eighth grade about oh in the middle sixties he would have been in the eighth grade and i checked his eighth grade math book   so they try to teach a concept      and uh there were no percentage there were two pages devoted to percentage and ratio and proportion   umhum   and in in his algebra book there were no fractions no percentages and course he proceeded on to geometry and um that sort of thing fortunately my boys have a very high aptitude in math   yes   but uh theres a a a great population out there that does not        and uh so i went through this uh lecture of counting in the decimal counting system and i said if this doesnt make sense to you memorize it and learn your twodoms   uhhuh   because its a percentage world out there   oh yeah yes
