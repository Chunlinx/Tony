                    Background        Most eukaryotic mRNAs are translated through a        capdependent mechanism of initiation In this process        eIFE which functions by binding the methylguanosine        cap is the ratelimiting factor due to its low abundance             In normal cells elevated eIFE activity is        associated with proliferation and is regulated by multiple        mechanisms eIFE gene transcription is enhanced in        response to mitogenic stimulation and may be mediated by        cmyc     Phosphorylation of eIFE by the protein        kinase Mnk increases its affinity for the cap and thus        increases capdependent initiation of translation              An inhibitor of eIFE E binding protein EBP is also        regulated by phosphorylation Phosphorylation of EBP        disrupts its ability to bind eIFE freeing eIFE to bind        eIFG which functions to recruit additional components of        the initiation complex      The net result is that        phosphorylation of EBP enhances capdependent translation        initiation EBP phosphorylation is thought to be mediated        by mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR in mitogen        stimulated cells              Numerous studies have implicated eIFE in formation and        progression of tumors Overexpression of eIFE leads to        deregulated growth and malignant transformation of a        variety of cultured cell lines       Moreover        elevated levels of eIFE are commonly found in solid        tumors especially in breast colon and head and neck        tumors     Clinical studies indicate that eIFE gene        amplification and protein overexpression is associated with        malignant progression in these tumors     High eIFE        levels are also associated with a higher rate of cancer        recurrence and cancerrelated death     In contrast to        eIFE overexpression of EBP inhibits cell proliferation           and EBP expression levels are inversely correlated        with the progression of certain types of tumors                   The findings summarized above indicate that elevated        eIFE activity plays a fundamental role in cancer formation        and progression and suggest the possibility that eIFE        could be exploited as a therapeutic target This is        supported by several recent investigations Inhibiting the        expression of eIFE by expressing antisense RNA reverses        rasmediated transformation of cultured cells as indicated        by decreased efficiency of growth in soft agar and tumor        formation in nude mice     Similarly        antisensemediated reduction of eIFE in breast cancer        cells inhibits both their tumorigenic and angiogenic        properties     On the other hand overexpression of        EBP reverses transformation mediated by vsrc            Rapamycin and its analogs are potent inhibitors of mTOR        and lead to cell cycle arrest Thus there is interest in        using this class of inhibitors for chemotherapeutic        treatment of cancer and several phase I trials have been        carried out     Treatment of mammalian cells with        rapamycin leads to dephosphorylation and activation of        EBP which in turn binds to and inhibits eIFE However        several other targets downstream of mTOR are also affected        by rapamycin These include effects on other translational        control proteins including p S kinase pSK eIFG        eIFB and eEF reviewed in     At present neither        the targets that are essential for inhibition of cell        proliferation by rapamycin nor the mechanism by which these        targets mediate cell cycle arrest are completely        understood        In the present study an MCF breast cancer cell line was        developed which can be induced to express a mutant form of        EBP in which five amino acids that are targets for        phosphorylation have been changed to alanines            Since the protein cannot be inactivated by phosphorylation        it constitutively binds to and inhibits eIFE Thus        expression of the mutant mimics the effects of rapamycin on        EBP but does not affect the other targets of mTOR        Induction of the constitutively active EBP leads to cell        cycle arrest which correlates with loss of cyclin D        expression and increased levels of the cyclin dependent        kinase inhibitor p Kip The increase in p Kipis        mediated at least in part by enhanced synthesis of the        protein and corresponds to activation of the p KipmRNA        untranslated region UTR and its ability to mediate        capindependent initiation of translation                    Results                  Expression of constitutively active EBP inhibits          the proliferation of MCF cells          To test the effect of EBP on the proliferation of          human breast cancer cells an expression vector encoding          the constitutively active EBP mutant EBPA was          stably transfected into MCF cells The EBPA cDNA          was placed under the control of a promoter that is          responsive to the insect hormone ponasterone A pon A          an ecdysone analog In the absence of pon A an ecdysone          receptorVP fusion protein actively represses the          promoter leading to very low basal levels of expression          In the presence of pon A the ecdysone receptor recruits          coactivators that lead to elevated expression The stably          transfected MCF line MCFEBPA was treated with          pon A and at various times cells were harvested for          analysis of EBP expression by Western blotting Fig          A Several forms of EBP are present in the stably          transfected MCF cells The slower migrating bands          represent endogenous EBP that is phosphorylated at          various sites The fastest migrating band corresponds to          hypophosphorylated EBP Treatment with pon A leads to          a rapid increase in the intensity of the fastest          migrating band which corresponds to the EBPA          mutated form of the protein which cannot be          phosphorylated In cells treated with pon A the fastest          migrating form of EBP is the predominant band at all          time points Expression of this form of EBP continues          to increase for at least five days after treatment with          pon A In the control cells which were not treated with          pon A phosphorylated inactive EBP is the predominant          form of the protein Fig A Treatment of untransfected          MCF cells with pon A had no effect on expression or          phosphorylation status of EBP data not shown The          expressed EBPA protein is active as determined by a          large increase in the amount of EBP bound to eIFE in          pon A treated MCFEBPA cells Fig B          Expression of constitutively active EBP through          inhibition of eIFE activity would be expected to slow          the rate of proliferation of MCF cells To test this          the growth of MCFEBPA breast cancer cells was          determined by counting cell number in cultures treated          with or without pon A Fig C In the absence of pon A          the cells continued to proliferate for at least five          days However induction of EBPA by the addition of          pon A almost completely blocked cell proliferation There          was no indication of cell death in the pon A treated          cultures and pon A had no effect on the untransfected          parental MCF cell line Fig C These results indicate          that expression of constitutively active EBP leads to          cell cycle arrest of MCF cells                          Expression of EBPA results in enhanced p          Kipexpression and downregulation of cyclin D          Elevated levels of eIFE are associated with          tumorigenic transformation and enhanced expression of          specific cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin          D Expression of constitutively active EBP should          lead to a global decrease in capdependent translation          which could lead to cell cycle arrest However it is          also possible that constitutively active EBP inhibits          proliferation through specific effects on cell cycle          regulatory proteins Therefore a number of G cell cycle          regulatory molecules were examined in MCFEBPA          cells that had been treated with or without pon A          Addition of pon A altered the levels of two critical G          regulatory proteins There was a significant increase in          the level of p Kipobserved at every time point up to          three days after addition of pon A Fig Aand B At          the same time there was a substantial decrease in the          level of cyclin D No difference was observed in the          protein levels of CDK or CDK between pon A treated and          untreated cells Treatment of MCFpERV cells which          express the ecdysone receptorVP fusion protein but not          the inducible constitutively active EBP see Methods          with pon A had no effect on the expression of any of          these proteins Fig B                          Constitutively active EBP does not alter p          Kipand cyclin D turnover rates          The results above suggest that cell cycle arrest of          MCF cells in response to EBPA expression involves          specific effects on expression of cyclin D and p Kip          The most plausible explanation is that the observed          changes are mediated by altered rates of translation          However others have shown that eIFE overexpression          enhances cyclin D mRNA transport from the nucleus to the          cytosol    and it is possible that EBP affects          this process Also p Kipexpression is actually          enhanced while EBP would be expected to inhibit          translation rates Therefore it was of interest to          examine the mechanism by which EBPA expression          modulates p Kipand cyclin D levels          First to determine if EBP led to a change in          degradation of either p Kipor cyclin D turnover          rates were estimated in MCFEBPA cells that had          been treated with or without pon A for  hours          Cycloheximide was added for various times and p Kipand          cyclin D levels were estimated by western blotting Fig           Neither the rate of p Kipturnover nor that of          cyclin D was significantly altered by pon Ainduced          expression of EBPA Thus modulation of p Kipand          cyclin D levels in response to expression of          constitutively active EBP does not appear to be          mediated by changes in protein degradation                          Expression of constitutively active EBP does not          alter p KipmRNA levels but decreases cyclin D mRNA          levels          To examine whether EBP could regulate p Kipor          cyclin D at the transcriptional level or through changes          in message stability the levels of p Kipand cyclin D          mRNA levels were examined by Northern blotting Fig          Aand B There was no difference in mRNA levels encoding          p Kipafter treatment with pon A However pon A          treatment led to an approximately  decrease in the          levels of cyclin D mRNA Fig B This may contribute          to the downregulation of cyclin D protein and is          consistent with a previous report showing an increase in          cyclin D mRNA in cells overexpressing eIFE                              Expression of EBPA enhances de novop          Kipprotein synthesis          The observation that expression of constitutively          active EBP leads to increased p Kip but does not          significantly affect protein turnover or mRNA levels          suggests that synthesis of p Kipis affected          Therefore the effect of EBPA on the           de novo synthesis of p Kipwas          tested by metabolic labeling with  Slabeled amino          acids After treatment of MCFEBPA cells with or          without pon A for  hours the cells were pulse labeled          for  hours Half of the cellular extract was used to          immunoprecipitate cyclin D and the other half to          immunoprecipitate p KipFig Aand B The results          demonstrate an increase in p Kipprotein synthesis of          approximately twofold in cells expressing EBPA          Since no changes in p KipmRNA levels or protein          turnover were observed the increased synthesis of p          Kipmost likely reflects increased rates of translation          In the same experiment a substantial decrease in           de novo synthesis of cyclin D was          observed which could be due in part to lower cyclin D          mRNA levels see Fig  Interestingly total protein          synthesis as determined by trichloroacetic acid TCA          precipitation of total cellular proteins following pulse          labeling was decreased only about  by expression of          constitutively active EBP Fig B This is          consistent with reports that changes in the levels of          active eIFE have a much greater effect on the          translation of specific classes of mRNA than on general          translation rates                               Expression of EBPA leads to inhibition of CDK          activity          A critical factor in p Kipmediated cell cycle          arrest is inhibition of CDK EBPA expression did          not significantly change CDK protein levels see Fig          A However there was a substantial loss of CDK          activity as determined by an immunoprecipitation kinase          assay Fig  This loss of CDK activity correlated          with an increase in the amount of p Kipthat          coimmunoprecipitated with CDK Fig  At the same          time the association of p Kipwith CDK was          dramatically decreased Fig  These results suggest          that EBPdependent cell cycle arrest involves p          Kipmediated inhibition of CDK kinase activity                          Expression of constitutively active EBPA          enhances capindependent translation through the p          KipUTR          A novel finding of the experiments above is that          synthesis of endogenous p Kipis enhanced under          conditions that are expected to reduce capdependent          translation One possibility is that the p KipmRNA is          translated through a capindependent mechanism that does          not require eIFE It was recently demonstrated that          elements within a  nucleotide sequence from the UTR          of the mouse p KipmRNA is able to mediate          capindependent translation of a reporter gene in NIHT          and DPT cells     There is a high level of          sequence homology between the mouse and human UTRs and          the major transcriptional start site is also conserved              Therefore it is likely the UTR of the human p          Kipmessage is also able to mediate capindependent          translation initiation To test this a  nucleotide          fragment representing the fulllength human p          KipUTR derived from transcription initiation at the          major start site was inserted into the bicistronic          expression vector pGLCATLuc     In this vector          the first cistron encoding chloramphenicol          acetyltransferase CAT is proximal to the mRNAs cap          structure and therefore expected to be translated by the          conventional capdependent translation mode The second          cistron encoding luciferase is downstream of the CAT          stop codon and therefore must be translated by a          capindependent mechanism mediated by sequence elements          inserted between the two cistrons Bicistronic constructs          without an insert or with the human p KipUTR          inserted in either the correct or reverse orientation          were transiently expressed in MCF cells The cells were          harvested after one day and both CAT and luciferase          activities were analyzed Fig Aand B Expression of          CAT was nearly identical with all three constructs and          was therefore independent of an insert between the two          coding regions In contrast only the construct carrying          the p KipUTR insert in the correct orientation          expressed a significant level of luciferase The ratio of          luciferaseCAT was enhanced approximately fold by the          human UTR Fig B Thus the fulllength human p          KipUTR is able to mediate capindependent translation          in a manner similar to that previously shown for the           nucleotide sequence of the mouse UTR              The effect of constitutively active EBP on the          activity of the p KipUTR was determined by          cotransfecting the bicistronic construct together with an          expression vector encoding EBPA into MCF cells          Expression of EBPA led to a twofold increase in the          luciferaseCAT ratio Fig C Interestingly this is          approximately the same level of increase that is observed          in synthesis of endogenous p Kipprotein see Fig          B                            Discussion        In normal mitogenactivated cells eIFE activity is        enhanced due to elevated transcription of the eIFE gene a        phosphorylationdependent increase in affinity for the        methylguanosine cap and phosphorylationdependent        inactivation of the inhibitor protein EBP In many tumor        cells eIFE levels are elevated and overexpression of the        protein in normal cultured cells causes transformation        Elevated eIFE levels enhance translation of specific        mRNAs Many of these mRNAs are involved in cell cycle        progression They have long GCrich UTRs that can form        extensive secondary structure and have been classified as        weak mRNAs because they are translated inefficiently when        eIFE levels are limiting reviewed in     It has        been proposed that when eIFE levels are elevated these        mRNAs can more effectively recruit eIFE and its associated        factors including eIFG a scaffold protein essential in        recruiting the small ribosomal subunit and eIFA a        helicase essential for scanning through secondary        structures in the UTR             In the experiments described here we have inducibly        expressed a constitutively active form of EBP in the        human breast cancer cell line MCF This leads to nearly        complete inhibition of cell proliferation which is        associated with an increase in binding of EBP to eIFE        This does not lead to a major drop in total protein        synthesis as indicated by metabolic labeling with Samino        acids However there are major changes in expression of        two cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D and p Kip        Cyclin D levels decline to about  of that observed in        uninduced cells and this appears to be due to a reduction        in cyclin D mRNA levels and protein synthesis since there        was no evidence for changes in cyclin D turnover The        observed decline in cyclin D is expected since        constitutively active EBP should reverse cyclin D        expression mediated by eIFE overexpression Interestingly        others have demonstrated that eIFE has an additional role        in the nucleus A portion of the cellular eIFE is imported        into the nucleus through a mechanism that requires the        protein ET     In the nucleus eIFE is localized to        specific nuclear bodies and associates with promyelocytic        leukemia protein PML     Nuclear eIFE appears to        be involved in export of cyclin D mRNA to the cytosol            Both ET and PML interact with the same domain of        eIFE that binds EBP     Thus expression of        constitutively active EBP may block nuclear functions of        eIFE one consequence being a reduction in cyclin D mRNA        that can be translated in the cytoplasm        In contrast to cyclin D p Kiplevels increase when        EBPA is expressed An interesting note is that the p        KipmRNA has a long UTR that is  GC and is predicted        to form stable secondary structures     Thus even        though it shares these characteristics with the putative        weak mRNAs that require elevated eIFE activity for        efficient translation p Kipresponds in an opposite        manner Part of this can be explained by the fact that the        p KipUTR is able to promote capindependent        translation When placed between the CAT and luciferase        coding regions in a bicistronic mRNA the UTR stimulates        high level expression of the downstream coding region        luciferase This property is shared by the highly        homologous mouse p KipUTR     Coexpression of        EBPA with the bicistronic construct containing the p        KipUTR leads to an approximately twofold increase in        capindependent expression This increase is similar to        that observed for endogenous p Kipin cells induced to        express EBPA The mechanism by which EBPA could        mediate enhanced translation through the p KipUTR is        not presently known One possibility is that binding of        EBP to eIFE releases other initiation factors that are        in limited supply but also required for capindependent        initiation        Inhibition of cell proliferation by EBPA correlates        with a large decrease in CDK activity This is not due to        a decline in CDK or cyclin E protein levels Rather it        corresponds to enhanced binding of p Kipto the cyclin        ECDK complex This is probably mediated by two separate        mechanisms First downregulation of cyclin D leads to        release of p Kipsequestered by the cyclin DCDK        complex This is indicated by a large decrease in        coimmunoprecipitation of p Kipwith CDK upon induction        of EBPA Second         de novo synthesis contributes to the        pool of cellular p Kipthat is available to bind the        cyclin ECDK complex        Given its role in control of cell proliferation and in        tumorigenesis there is interest in targeting the pathways        that control eIFE activity for cancer chemotherapy        Clinical trials using the rapamycin analog CCI show        promise for this strategy     Rapamycin and its        synthetic analogs block mTOR kinase activity leading to        dephosphorylation of EBP and other mTOR substrates MCF        cells are sensitive to rapamycin analogs in the low nM        range     A potential problem with the use of        rapamycin and its analogs is that some tumors are        intrinsically resistant to its effects             Resistance in mammalian cells has been associated with        decreased expression of EBP     mutations in the        ATM protein     and low level expression of p        Kipdue to enhanced turnover of the protein     In        addition it has been demonstrated that fibroblasts from        p Kipknockout mice are more resistant to the effects of        rapamycin than normal cells     Thus p Kipis an        important mediator of cell growth inhibition in response to        rapamycin Many tumor cells express very low levels of p        Kipand this is correlated with poor prognosis If        rapamycin and its analogs are to be developed as useful        antitumor agents it will be important to determine how p        Kiplevels affect responsiveness to these compounds        Rapamycin and its analogs affect all of the downstream        targets of mTOR including p S kinase and other        components of the translation machinery The data presented        here indicate that direct inhibition of eIFE may be more        effective and a more specific means of targeting tumor        cells than treatment with rapamycin It will be important        to determine if direct inhibition of eIFE is able to        arrest the cell cycle in rapamycin resistant tumors If so        it may be possible to develop reagents that target eIFE        activity thereby bypassing the upstream signaling events        in the pathway                    Methods                  Cell culture          MCF cells were cultured in Dulbeccos modified          Eagles medium DMEM supplemented with  fetal calf          serum FCS  Uml penicillin and  gml          streptomycin The inducible MCF cell line expressing          EBPA was established using the Complete Control          Inducible Mammalian Expression System Stratagene          First MCF cells were transfected with the pERV vector          encoding both the RXR protein and an          ecdysoneglucocorticoid receptor fusion protein using          GenePorter Gene Therapy Systems Stably transfected          colonies were selected using G  gml These          colonies were further screened for the ability to          inducibly express luciferase from the pEGSHluc construct          in response to pon A in transient transfection assays A
