                                 Chilling Times            Thereare a lot of chills about this week the greatest being the chill betweenChina and the United States over Chinas massive theft of American nuclearsecrets The Cox report dominated newspapers across the Pacific Wednesday asthey assessed the deteriorating state of USChinese relations In Hong Kongthe South China MorningPost implied that Cox found nothing of importance that wasnt alreadyknown It has been known for years that Beijing has the ability to unleashnuclear weapons and that it regards this as integral to its policy on Taiwanthe paper said in an editorial Beijing hopes to regain sovereignty over theisland by peaceful means but will not rule out invasion as a last resort itadded Under certain circumstances the US probably would help to defendTaiwan rather than let its freemarket democracy be taken by force That iswhere Chinas nucleararmed intercontinental missiles come in This does notmean that China intends to start a nuclear war But it clearly wants a morecredible missile force After the alarms die down SinoAmerican relations mayget back on track However the changing missile equation will make that morecomplicated than ever            TheUnited States wasnt spared criticism in the affair The Sydney Morning Herald in aneditorial Wednesday said it was futile to blame the Chinese for a problem thatwould not be as potentially serious if the Americans themselves had been morecareful Most of all it would be disastrousespecially at this time ofundeniably chillier relations between China and the USto lose sight of thelarger guarantee of security that comes from the present policy course ofengagement with China through trade diplomacy and dialogue it added InLondon a FinancialTimes editorial said the United States has made itself an easy targetfor Chinas ambitious spies because of security failings that are just thelatest symptoms of a deep muddle over the direction of US policy towardsChina The US needs to be straight with China the paper said That meansbeing consistently tough on security and positive on trade Yet Washingtonshows precious little sign of the political leadership needed for thetask            TheIndependentof London said the Cox report exposed an almost inconceivably sloppy attitudeto security by the United States and showed how difficult the West now findsit to deal with an economically and politically resurgent China With Chinasacquisition of the latest American technology the assumption that the UnitedStates will remain the worlds only superpower can no longer be so easilyheld it said The Independent concluded that with China the US mustbe fair but firm if the Pacific century is not to begin with a cold snap            Another chill set in between India and Pakistan where the newspaperDawn led Wednesday withPakistans putting its forces on full alert and announcing its right toretaliate after India launched airstrikes on disputed Kashmir But the Indianpress was more interested in Sonia Gandhis withdrawal of her resignation fromthe leadership of the Congress Party which she had made when some partymembers attacked her for being Italian born The Times                of Indiasaid her reinstatement has given the party a fresh lease of life and has setthe stage for what is going to prove a bitter divisive and issuelesselection            Yetanother chill was between Egypt and Libya whose leader Muammar Qaddafifailed to greet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at the airport when he flew tovisit him in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte Monday On Tuesday the PanArabalQuds alArabi described this as a deliberate snub linked to Egyptsrefusal to join other member states of the Organization of African Unity OAUin defying the air embargo that was in force against Libya for seven yearsuntil last month when the country handed over two Lockerbie bombing suspectsfor trial by a Scottish court in the Netherlands Qaddafi sent two of hislieutenants to receive Mubarak while he waited for the Egyptian president inhis tent not very far from the airport alQuds alArabi noted Takenaback by Qaddafis absence Mubarak stated that he was on abrotherlymeaning unofficialvisit to Libya the paper said            Another icy chill is between Buckingham Palace and the British tabloid theSun  Theres another British royal wedding next monthof
