                you wanna go first   well uh no i dont i dont get as much exercise as i as i should as or or as i would like to uh um these days id seems to be to easy to get busy with other things uh i have in the past uh jogged and and run and every every January and every September i start out again and then it tapers off   really     uh what about you   well yeah i do a lot of exercise right now im into jazzercise which i absolutely love um i started about two years ago because i gained some weight over the past few years and i wanted to get it back off   umhum   and i was going through a divorce and i just found that running really made me feel good got out a lot of aggression i went to the gym every day and i ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and   yeah   um i felt really good i needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time now when i do those things they are boring i would rather be outside than in the gym doing this in one place   umhum   and so i just recently discovered jazzercise about two months ago and im getting to be a good dancer from it and im just feeling really good i love the class its real challenging so im really into that i really like that a lot and it     well now thats thats it it thats related to the the aerobic uh society   it is its aerobics but its with dance steps its an aerobic exercise and its an hour straight and its just um its a lot of fun i feel like im not just exercising   okay yeah yeah   because im dancing and im  im getting much better my staminas getting great for the dance floor  so i mean its just theres a lot of positive things with it so   yeah well uh okay now thats inside again right   it is inside and ive been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather weve been having and i enjoy that much more too than inside   but it do do you like to do it with with other people i mean like the the jazzercise would be   i have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and its nice we get to spend some time together rather than i go to the gym while she does her homework so ive enjoyed that part of it yeah   yeah yeah   and at the gym even in the class uh i we do we its not really a group where you chat a lot everybodys on their way to someplace   right but   and so you know i do have one friend that goes occasionally but basically i do it by myself in a group of maybe forty  so   yeah right right but still there are other there are other people there doing the doing the same thing in that in terms of motivation and incentive yeah   there are there are its more motivating that way i think yeah yeah you could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the TV but you you probably wouldnt   yeah yeah uh that makes a difference doesnt i ive one thing more when i have   so yeah   run and jogged uh ive always enjoyed doing it by myself and and no no not with the sense that was a a chore or something that i was having to do i ive really enjoyed just the activity and and uh i write software uh as far as the job and so getting getting out and being active uh is uh uh helps out the the its a change the change the change of pace and just getting out and around and and i find that i can often you know often uh when i get around to doing it then i i feel better when i get back to work and the and uh   yeah yeah i can see itll be a good break right uhhuh   uh also that that it my subconscious is working on things while im working and i i go back and ive got new ideas but but still   yeah yeah i think you do you feel very good after you exercise i think its worth making the time for yourself you owe it to yourself and i think you do accomplish more after that   yeah yeah yeah   and i think that its just is good for your self esteem for everything because when you look better you feel better and its just uh i think its well worth it i just demand that time for myself now ive learned to do that and it you know and it i think it just benefits you all around   yeah   so   yeah i think thats uh i i think thats a good term demanding demanding the time for yourself but you youve just got to youve just got to prioritize right   you have to because theres always more things to do there is always things that you can make priority to it but i just i dont demand a lot for myself and so   yeah   you know i just feel entitled to it and i take it     well good well good well uh   so   uh have you have you done any jogging i tell you said you you did on the on the bike and on the treadmill in the in the uh clubs   no ive done some walking with friends in the past but i find that when you do that you do more chatting than you do exercise and thats not really beneficial   umhum yeah   so uh   yeah yeah   i dont have time like that and i spend enough time chatting around everywhere you know and the phone
