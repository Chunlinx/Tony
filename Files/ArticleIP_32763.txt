                                 The Avengers             The executionstyle killings of  Serbs byAlbanian Kosovars in midJuly left a tight knot in my gut Not any tighter thanthe knots left by the accounts of Serb atrocities against Albanian Kosovarsjust different For I cant help asking Do these acts of revenge undermine thehumanitarian rationale of NATOs intervention in Kosovo Does the barbarism ofa few of Slobodan Milosevics victims vitiate the justness of the war Can wecontinue to view the Albanian Kosovars as the good guys Although I can arriveat rational answers to these questionsno no and yes the knot doesnt goaway            Postwar acts ofvengeanceranging from isolated killings to the recommencing of fullscalecombatare as historically commonplace as they are morally problematic Theimpulse to avenge is human and the opportunities for it are abundant at theend of a war when law and authority evaporate But that doesnt make them easyeither to condone or to condemn unequivocally            Consider the aftermath of World War II When American andAllied troops rolled into Germany in  a few of them raped and killedGerman citizens In Czechoslovakia and Poland some of those who had sufferedunder Nazi rule turned violently against their oppressorsor their oppressorscountrymenand hundreds even thousands may have been killed Itsimportant however pedantic it may sound to keep stressing that only some ora few partook of such vengeance since even choosing to discuss theseactsand not the vastly more extensive crimes that preceded themthreatens todistort history No one would cheer these reprisals but only the most twistedwould shed their deepest tears for the Nazis and their supporters            Jews though scant amongthe revengetakers did in some cases seek retribution as welland thischapter of the postWorld War II retaliation has been especially problematicas I explain  In a penetrating essay in the Forward last fall HillelHalkin asked whether Jews who pursued extremely drastic retaliation werecourageously honest in seeking to act out what others merely dreamed of or shockingly criminal Or both Or are all such categories simply irrelevantto the experience of people who maddened by the loss of their families andentire worlds might best be considered to have been temporarily insane inthe full and exculpatory legal sense of the term            T he specific group to which Halkin refers is the legendaryor notorious Revenge Group organization founded in  by a youngcharismatic poet named Abba Kovner who is at the center of a fascinatinglittle chapter in the history of revenge killings During the war Kovner hadvainly tried to defend the Jewish ghetto in Vilna Poland and at the wars endhe banded together with other ghettodefenders and partisans They all sharedan apartment in Lublin Poland and one night they were sitting arounddrinking contemplating their next move We sat with our glasses and the ideaflew out of us and suddenly it was no longer in the air but on the tablerecalled one member Pasha Reichman Everyone wanted revenge Specificallythey concocted the idea of a mass murder of their German oppressors As JosephHarmatz one of their number explained they felt the only reason they hadbeen spared death like so many friends and kin was so that they couldadminister revenge            The small group of fivesoon grew in number to almost  according to one of the founders drawing onsurvivors of the death camps as well as refugees from the forests They devisedtwo plans Plan A involved poisoning the water supplies of major German citiesPlan B entailed killing off SS guards held in American POW camps When Kovnertried to enlist support from Jewish authorities they balkedsome out ofhorror some indifference Nonetheless Kovner procured some poison from achemist in the future state of Israel Meanwhile Reichman and othersposingas German engineers or in Harmatzs case a Polish knightgot jobs in thewaterworks of Hamburg Nuremberg and other cities They secured blueprints tothe cities water mains staying up late to memorize every detail They figuredout where to administer the poison as well as how to spare the sectors of thecity where American troops were living            Plan A went awry however when the British arrested Kovneras he attempted to leave Palestine Reichman decided to revert to Plan Bthekilling of SS guards On April   under a full moon a handful of hisgroup broke into a bakery near Nuremberg that provided bread for the AlliesStalag  POW camp A man they had planted in the bakery had managed to hideunder the floorboards several bottles of arsenic which had been tested on acat in Paris The cat died They sprinkled the white powder on the loaves ofblack rye bread that were headed for Stalag  Reichman and his men knew thaton Sundays the American soldiers at the camp received only plain white bread toeat Suddenly hearing the banging of window shutters that had come loosesecurity guards arrived and Reichmans men fled Three thousand loaves wereshipped off anywaythe guards suspected a burglary not a poisoningand as aresult some  of the  prisoners came down with food poisoning Noneapparently died            With the failure of thesetwo plans most of the Revenge group migrated to Palestine A few pursued aPlan C retribution against known Nazi war criminals They were joined in thisdark enterprise by some renegade members of the Jewish BrigadeJews who livedin Palestine during the war and fought with the Allies under British commandSome brigade members had arrived in Italy at the wars tail end and arrivingtoo late for combat vented their revenge impulses by hunting down Gestapo andSS agents around the ItalyAustria border            Eventually these soldiers got hold of a Gestapo officialwho provided them with a list of names of Nazi men their wartime activitieseven their addresses They proceeded to track down some of the SS men who hadparticipated in the mass extermination of Jews and on their own authoritykill them Typically they would dress up as British military policemen driveto the home of the SS man and ask him to come with them on some conventionalbusiness Then they would shoot or suffocate him            The vast majority of Jews of course did nothingof the sortjust like the vast majority of Czech Pole and American soldiersAs the historian Daniel Jonah Goldhagen has written what is striking amongHolocaust survivors was in fact the relative absence of avenging actions Themore common response among Jews was to devote themselves to Zionism as abulwark against future persecution or to engage in symbolic retributionbanning Wagner from Israeli national radio or to pursue justice through theNuremberg war crimes tribunals or other legitimate arenas of justice Likewisemany Nazi war criminals were punished sometimes with death by Polish courtsof law            It is always futile to try to draw practicallessons from history Yet it seems possible that one reason Jewish acts ofvengeance were relatively few was simply that the Nuremberg trials existedJews could take comfort that at least some of the most evil of their oppressorswould be punished by a united world opinion Other efforts to prosecute Naziwar criminalsfrom the apprehension of Adolf Eichmann in  to the ongoingefforts of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the US Office of SpecialInvestigationscontinue the honorable policy of replacing lawless revenge withlegitimate justice Even so its worth considering that a more vigorouspursuit of Serbian war criminals while unlikely to stop every retaliatorykilling might nonetheless send a signal that the world believes justice to bea substitutenot an instrumentfor revenge
