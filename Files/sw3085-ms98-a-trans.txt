        okay   okay i my children as a matter of fact are all grown now so i am assisting assisting uh them with their children in their selections so   uhhuh oh great great well my children are grown but theyre teenagers so i have three children um fifteen ages fifteen seventeen and twenty     umhum umhum   and um about i guess about when the first when the youngest one was in kindergarten i started working working at a preschool and uh you know doing some work and then i i took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool so   uhhuh umhum   so i am around not a day care situation but in the you know in the child care environment   umhum   so um   well i myself really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in todays environment   uhhuh   than  the one on one care is uh when my children were growing up i actually had them up and until they were in the preschool situation i had them in a in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids and i felt like that home environment was very important to them   yes   it was important to me and uh   yes uhhuh   i feel like that they they had that one on one thats so necessary at that age however in todays environment   oh it is uh yeah umhum   it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because thats the way our young people are are dealt with theyre dealt with in packages   yeah in other words therere more people yes yes thats thats an interesting point of view i uh you know seeing the children in the school the way i do i i mean i see the ones that we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds as as opposed to the ones that have been in the program that started at twelve months maybe and were were even in there one day a week   umhum umhum sure umhum   which is all our school provides for the you know for the under three year old but still they have an opportunity an opportunity to be with other children   umhum umhum absolutely   and it is true and uh i but i think that would but as far as looking for a place you know i i the criteria i mean i think its very important to have very caring people you know to take care of the the in a school if youre going to have the structure and youre going to have the large numbers youre going to need really   oh absolutely without a doubt umhum i recently stopped by McDonalds and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center and of course she was she had just gotten her degree and she was so enthusiastic and she was excited about it and she was going to accomplish all of these things   yes yes   however uh when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time the pay is minimal   yes it is   and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really dont want to make a living for themselves   yes thats right that maybe   in order to be in that environment   yeah that maybe have another salary in their family that where they can do that and thats what i had the opportunity of you know doing and and i could concentrate on the creativity and and   absolutely umhum   you know really having a lot of fun with the children and and providing them with a great atmosphere   umhum  well they ask so much of those caretakers for the amount that that they they pay they are to be there ahead of time you know theyre there early to receive the kids   yes and they have to be there at sometimes six oclock in the morning   thats right and then then they have to work until the shop until the place closes at six P M and then its their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they dont have cleaning crews in most of those   which is yeah yes yes thats true thats true   and uh she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary uh and she   yeah yeah because people cant pay to provide and well ours is not you know ours is just is a church and so we   umhum umhum   we dont have the the expenses of a building you know we share the expense with the church but we dont have enough you know taking care of a whole building and that responsibility so uh it is it is a lot different   umhum sure umhum well i know that when my youngsters were small now my older son was adopted so he went into child care at two weeks  and uh my younger son went into child care at six weeks   oh my goodness yeah yeah   so they were in that environment actually up until they became uh seven and nine   uhhuh   and at that point i said look they have been given the custodial care that they need and the after hours care has been as good a quality as i can provide for them however theyre going out into the school environment now theyre under a lot of other influences i need to be here for them i need to be involved in their school because i want to be the one   yes   who influences the way they develop so i quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that i could help direct their their learning experiences and their development   oh you did um yeah yeah   i i felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them   umhum   and hold them but when time came to direct their ability to make choices   yes yes umhum umhum   to develop the kinds of things that that theyre going to need to interact with other people i felt like i needed some strong influence there   yeah well thats different than most people do it i mean a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school you know   so i did i know thats right once they get up in school umhum umhum umhum   but uh   well i just felt very strongly about that and i i did not work as a matter of fact my son was in the second grade and when he started uh at Skyline High School i asked him son when uh you know where do i go to sign up for the PTA and he said mom dont do that to me please dont do that to me so i knew it was time to go back to work but i feel very good about spending those years with my boys   i know yeah yes thats true   uh and i was just really grateful i only had one bad child care experience it was in a home uh the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it she was from um  uh uh Argentina and she was going back home and i couldnt just you know wait for eight three or four months and then bring them back to her so i had to find a new place   umhum yes yes   and i put them in this home the kids cried when i took them the kids cried when i could hear the kids crying when i went to pick the m up they were always cranky and irritable   oh dear oh dear   so i just took off and went there one day and uh the children were left unattended in a room you know they they were not well cared for   oh how awful   and uh so it didnt take me long to take t hem out of that place but thats the only bad experience i had the rest of the time they stayed in La Petite Academy and i was very pleased with their development and their progress   yeah yeah uhhuh uhhuh   they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didnt learn but theyre going to learn it sometime so but for the most part they did have good care   yeah yeah   and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the Y and taught to swim   umhum   which just pleased me to death because ive always been have you know been afraid of the water however my uh older son came home and he said mom i dont like that man   oh yes oh   said he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me i had to get my face wet or id never swim   oh gosh oh dear   boy it didnt take me very long to hot foot it over to the school   yes   and relay that to them and she said well she said you know kids do exaggerate but she said lets go ahead and send him another day or two days and i promise you faithfully i will watch the instructor every minute   oh good yes   and see exactly whats happening
