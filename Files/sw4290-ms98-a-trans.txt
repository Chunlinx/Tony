        i generally uh prefer to do repairs that i am capable of doing myself if it results in significant money savings      yeah um i always used to do the the you know the the fairly simple repairs uh recently i havent because uh uh times become more of a premium for me   yeah yeah im finding that too   uhhuh its also you know its also getting to the point where im sitting there saying well gee unless i am really enjoy doing this this its costing me more money to do it myself then it would for uh i mean thats the reason  i mean it   thats right you better you better enjoy doing it or else its not really worth it   right i   the last one that that i did myself was i was i found that i was backing out of the garage and i got a little too close to the door on the drivers side i was uh watching too closely on the passenger side i guess and i wasnt paying attention closely enough and i ended up whacking my uh side view mirror off the side of my car which kind of uh made me kick myself     yeah the the the other things you always do oh geez shoot   yeah but i looked into getting that replaced and that was going to cost a fair amount of money because i would have to take it to the uh dealer who would put a factory replacement part on and then charge me fifty bucks and hour to do the work   umhum   and so i figured well i can do that myself i ill pick up the mirror myself which alone was more money than i wanted to spend on a just a stupid little mirror but its one of those power ones and its heated heated and and all that   right   and i was going on a trip the next day so i figured id go out and put the mirror on but i ended up i had to take the whole door apart uh to   oh because you couldnt access you couldnt access it   yeah to get the cable where the cable plugged in to the uh to the rest of the system was way down in the door   right so it ended up being a bitch huh   yeah it was more than i really wanted to do and then i got it i finally got it all apart figured out what i had to do and i put the mirror on and i got it plugged in and i put the door back together   right   and everything was fine i also have power windows and i had to have the window down to do what i was doing and oh no im sorry i had to have the window up to do what i was doing and i went to uh no it was down it was down i had to have the window down i went to uh put the window back up it was the middle of winter and the window wouldnt go up because i had the cable yeah   so you had a trip that you had to go to the next day in the middle of winter and your window would not come back up all right   and no i took the door all apart again and i moved the cable over so it wasnt blocking the window but uh i dont know it used to be fun doing those sorts of things and i dont maybe im loosing interest or also cars are getting a lot more complex than they used to be   yeah that thats part of the reason why i have cut down also is that uh same reason uh last thing i did was just replace my uh uh light on uh   yeah uhhuh   you know headlights in the front now that one i you know it actually they actually said to go in and get the service person to do that too and i said well forget that   oh yeah yeah     uh but and it was kind of a a pain   yeah   because you uh you you couldnt really fix it without leaving the lights on   oh   because it i didnt have it doesnt have a uh off yeah its one of those um uh flipping type headlights   oh okay yeah   and you   so you have to have it up so you have to have the light on   right right and some of them you know they have uh uh one click where you where it goes up and its like not on on some of the some but this one did not   uhhuh oh boy   no but i figured a way to get around it but it was kind of a really stupid way to have to do it is you is you get it up in the air and then you turn then you take the battery off and then it then it cant bring it back down  all right     yeah thats one way to do it   right and then but then the lights are still out  so youre not sitting there going i cant see     now i think my mechanic mechanic found a way to do that theres a switch somewhere that you can push that uh pop the light up without turning it on   right   i dont know where that is on my car because i have the flip up type too   umhum   but he did something to make that happen   right i mean there there probably is but they didnt bother to tell me so   yeah right privileged information   thats great uh then thats the other thing is that there always seems to be some really weird tool   yeah umhum   and things like you know oil filters every every car now its so tight in in in the region where where the engines are you can never get to the oil filter   yep thats right   though though i guess its getting a little better again because um what they did is first they used to have the big cars and big engines   yep   then they got the small cars with the not well designed engines now theyre redesigning enough that some that to some extent its its accessible again but i remember a couple of those cars you know youd sit there and say   right   theres no way anyone could get in there unless they could take the car and put it up into the air   yep thats right or unless its high enough off the ground that you can crawl underneath it   right yeah   but thats not usually easy either   and i uh every year you hear somebody gets themselves killed by climbing under a car or under a jack and the only thing you you know i guess you   umhum umhum
