            did women uh have the more variety in this area right   oh i suppose i uh substitute teach in our public schools and what i find out nowadays is people are wearing jeans and and very casual things Polo shirts uh im of the opinion that im not one of the kids and i want them to know that so ill dress a little more formally i mean not a business suit but you know a nice skirt and blouse or   are you saying that the children that the students uh teachers are wearing jeans   well i i should clarify i work in the im an artist and i work in the art department so perhaps they are a little more Bohemian       but  yes yes teachers are wearing jeans and theyre wearing sneakers and kind of upsets me because uh it seems that theyre getting treated as if theyre sloppy and i i like the kids   treated as if theyre sloppy or treated as if theyre uh peers   as if if if the whole situation is too casual i dont get think they get the same respect as if they distance themselves in their behavior from the kids and i think the way they dress says a lot about their attitude   umhum   i think theyre too casual with the kids and the kids kids curse in front of them and   ooh   and and take too many liberties and i think   uhhuh   uh you know as much as im there to be their uh to be there for them but im not their friend im there to teach them something and its its business and its serious and   right of course motivation is everything and i suppose youre striving for intimacy on a intellectual level its really hard to figure out how youre going to do that but of course were trying to talk about dress and not teaching   well i i think im talking about dressing how it conveys a uh       a sense of um casual behavior and you know and and where it goes from there its just a tangent of the same subject   umhum well i am in a much more conventional position i work as a uh white collar worker uh im a senior principal scientist at SRI International uh work with   uhhuh   what is is uh your particular field   speech technology teaching computers teaching computers how to understand the speech   huh oh so you must be very interested in uh Texas Instruments but anyway get off the subject   in Texas Instruments oh yeah i actually used i used to be chief speech scientist at Texas Instruments   oh i see so i i guess youre in a business suit all the time   no actually i try to stay behind the scenes which means i wear slacks and uh   oh   my own personal style and its  its variable and there there are a lot of people thatll wear jeans but i say probably most people uh wear dresses or slacks and um wear the men wear uh um probably most of them wear long sleeve shirts without ties uh its interesting its sort of silly and ironic not ironic but its silly in in a sense that   hm   on visitor days which is are quite frequently people  quite frequently dress up and they wear ties and coats and uh on non visitor days people dress down and they wear just slacks and dress shirts   uhhuh  it it well i guess its silly in that the point is to be there and do quality work and not wonder about what youre wearing too much   right and and it its uh its not one of my dressing is not one of my main obsessions or preoccupations   what uh no i can see how youd say that im not heavily into uh whats in this year or whats out this year i usually i have a certain amount of money that i spend on clothing and i buy things that will last year after year and um   well i i buy a new shirt once a year whether i need it or not   oh do you so i guess youve got a collection dont you     well i dont pay much attention to it   uhhuh well i dont know um   now this this question did it relate to work or did it relate to to uh whatever   i think it was just um clothing and how you feel about it and do you change your wardrobe from season to season um i guess the warmer it gets the less clothing i wear but i dont know that i i change my sense of color or style to to match a season but i do know people who have told me that the different carpets come out and different colors come out because uh the seasons change your mood and and your ideas of color and fashion change with uh   hm   uh you know with your mood and i guess its all kinds of poetic uh   i guess im a typical oblivious male in that respect     ive met males that arent terribly oblivious to clothing its uh   i said typical   oh okay well some guys seem to think its a shortcoming being too involved in their clothing like they have deeper more meaningful things
