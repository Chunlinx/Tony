                    Background        Resistance to acyclovir ACV or penciclovir PCV        generally arises by a single base mutation in either the        HSV thymidine kinase TK or DNA polymerase Pol gene for        a review see reference     Unlike Pol TK is not        essential for virus replication in cell culture            although         in vivo analyses implicate it in HSV        virulence pathogenicity and reactivation from latency               Since ACV and PCV are dependent upon HSV TK for        monophosphorylation an event obligatory for the formation        of the active triphosphate inhibitor     ACV risolates        often exhibit high levels of crossresistance to PCV                    Viral populations are naturally heterogeneous there are        approximately  to  TK deficient variants per         plaqueforming units PFU of HSV laboratory strains        and clinical isolates that have never been exposed to        antiviral selection        Resistance to        nucleoside inhibitors of HSV arises readily in tissue        culture probably by selection of preexisting mutants              Moreover Field         et al    demonstrated sequential        HSV inoculation from mouse to mouse receiving suboptimal        ACV therapy led to the selection and amplification of        resistant virus         in vivo After four serial passages        in the immunocompetent mice the infection became        completely refractory to ACV treatment        Acyclovir has been in part superceded by the oral        prodrugs valaciclovir VCV and famciclovir FCV the        latter being the oral version of PCV      No        comparative studies of the emergence of resistance        following suboptimal VCV or FCV have been reported and        therefore set out to to select for HSV and HSV isolates        resistant to ACV and PCV after using prodrug selection                    Materials and Methods                  Cell lines and virus

Charles River Raleigh          NC were infected intradermally in both ear pinnae with           l of virus suspension containing  PFU of HSV as          previously described     The same viral challenge was          used for each subsequent in vivo passage VCV or FCV were          administered via drinking water at either  mgml a dose          previously shown to be a highly effective     and D          Sutton unpublished observations or  mgml          suboptimal treatment from the time of infection until          day  postinfection No significant difference in daily

respectively          To facilitate processing of blinded samples a coding          system using sample numberpassage number was applied          Virus sample numbers  through  were HSV and           through  were HSV The ears from one mouse were          pooled passage number  inoculation and used to          inoculate the ear pinnae of one mouse passage number           There were five replicate mice per treatment group          either suboptimally treated with  mgml FCV VCV or          placebotreated and isolates from seven serial           in vivo passages examined Five          individual plaques were purified three times to          homogeneity from the single drugresistant virus mixture          identified after           in vivo passage P sample           passage  The clonal purified isolates from this sample          were designated PAE          The           in vivo pathogenicity of selected          virus preparations was assessed in mice by monitoring          lesion severity for  days following inoculation of the          left ear pinna with    PFU Cumulative lesion scores          day  were then calculated from the individual daily          scores                          Virus isolation and in vitro assays          Virus stocks were prepared as described previously              titrated and characterized by PRA and PEA On day           postinfection mice were euthanized and both ear          pinnae removed and pooled in coded tubes one tube per          mouse The code was not broken until all tissue culture          assays had been completed The tissue was homogenized and          virus stocks were prepared in MRC cells from cellfree          supernatants Following virus adsorption onto the MRC          monolayer two washes with phosphatebuffered saline were          performed to remove any residual antiviral drug          Cellfree virus was harvested titrated and characterized          by PRA and PEA prior to use in subsequent passage          experiments Figure  All PRA PEA and in vivo studies          were carried out using virus that had undergone a single          in vitro passage PRAs were performed in MRC cells as          described previously     The plating efficiency of          the virus preparations generated           in vivo was determined according to          the method developed by Hall           et al with minor modifications             as reported previously     Briefly six serial          fold dilutions of virus were inoculated onto MRC          cells in the absence of antiviral drug or in the presence          of either ACV or PCV at a concentration of antiviral           times higher than the average IC            for wild type parental HSV and          HSV respectively The mutation frequency was          calculated as follows mutation frequency  virus titer          in the presence of drugvirus titer in the absence of          drug The frequency is often expressed as a plating          efficiency or percentage of viruses that are resistant          which is calculated as percent resistant  mutation          frequency                            Antibodies and biochemical assays          Western blot analysis was performed as described          previously     Viral TK activity was determined by a          modification of the method utilized by Coen and Schaffer             as described in     Primers utilized for TK          sequencing were described previously                                Results                  Virus yield after antiviral treatment          To evaluate efficacy of prodrug treatment in this          model VCV and FCV were provided in the drinking water at           mgml or at  mgml suboptimal treatment for          mice infected with either HSV SC or HSV SB Titers          day  postinfection of approximately  log            virus per ear were recovered from          placebotreated mice regardless of virus type Table           As expected a significant reduction in virus yield          greater than  log            decrease was noted for mice          treated with either VCV or FCV at  mgml following          infection with either HSV or HSV          In the same experiment virus yield from          suboptimallytreated mice was reduced approximately           log            compared to placebotreated mice          and these data are consistent with a previous report in          which ACV was administered at a concentration of           mgml     At  mgml viral replication albeit          reduced was still ongoing a prerequisite for the           in vivo selection of resistant          HSV          A reproducible difference in virus yield between the          two antiviral treatment groups at the suboptimal          concentration was evident regardless of virus type For          HSV the difference in titer between VCVtreated mice           log            PFUml and FCVtreated  log            PFUml was statistically          significant p   Similarly for HSV VCV at           mgml was significantly more effective than FCV in this          mouse model Titers from VCV or FCVtreated mice were           log            PFUml or  log            PFUml respectively p            Similar trends were noted when the antivirals were          compared at  mgml for both HSV and HSV Table           These observations can not be accounted for by          differences in exposure to ACV and PCV since oral          administration of VCV and FCV results in almost identical          blood concentrationtime curves for ACV and PCV              A more probable explanation is that ACV is approximately          fourfold more potent than PCV in murine cells                       To select and amplify drugresistant HSV in mice a          total of seven consecutive passages were performed and          progeny virus from each passage was characterized           in vitro by PRA and PEA

     standard resistance breakpoint criteria whereas            isolates from mice treated with VCV had PCV IC              s ranging from  gml            One isolate th passage P in this treatment            group was confirmed as resistant to both PCV IC                gml and ACV IC                gml Generally test            sample IC              s varied within twofold of the

          control virus IC              for both PCV and ACV            Interestingly although P was resistant the            third pass isolate for this sample was completely            sensitive to both antiviral agents ACV IC                gml PCV IC                gml Therefore the PRA            provided no early indication at pass  of potentially            increasing resistant variants

one HSV isolate          P was identified in the PRA as an antiviralresistant          isolate Five single plaques from P were isolated          after three rounds of plaque purification and          characterized The clonal isolates were tested for          susceptibility to using the PRA and were found to be          highly resistant to ACV ACV IC            s   gml and PCV Table           PCV

Sequence analysis of the TK          coding region from all five plaque isolates identified a          G nucleotide insertion in the homopolymeric hotspot G          tract at nucleotide  a common mutation present in          other ACV rHSV isolates      This base insertion          produced a frame shift in the coding sequence resulting          in a loss of the ATP  nucleosidebinding site and the          creation of a premature stop codon at amino acid  to          encode a truncated  kD TK polypeptide          Lastly the           in vivo pathogenicities of P          and one of its clonal isolates PE were compared          with the control virus HSV SC Isolate P          containing  resistant virus caused significant          clinical disease in mice only marginally less severe          than that observed with HSV SC In marked contrast          mice inoculated with the plaquepurified isolate PE          developed a mild infection The cumulative disease scores          for parental virus control HSV SC P and PE          were   and  respectively                            Discussion        HSV or HSV isolates were passaged serially seven        times in mice inoculated in the ear pinnae and treated with        suboptimal  mgkg per day concentrations of FCV or VCV        to select resistant virus Despite ongoing albeit reduced        viral replication in the animals selection of resistant        HSV with the prodrugs proved difficult Interestingly the        single drugresistant isolate identified from this study        reverted to a sensitive phenotype upon reinfection even        with suboptimal antiviral treatment        Although virus recovered at passage  from one of five        mice treated with VCV P was clearly resistant in the        PRA IC          s  and  for PCV and ACV        respectively the preceding and the subsequent isolates        were sensitive according to the criteria for defining        resistance The PEA identified a gradual increase in the        proportion of resistant virus from P  to P         to P  However for the most part the PEA        data did not correlate with the eventual appearance of        drugresistant virus as defined by the PRA Consistent with        this an earlier studied showed that the proportion of        drugresistant virus in a preparation needs to be        approximately  before resulting in a signficant change        in IC                     Biochemical characterization of the P isolate        confirmed that impaired TK activity was most likely        responsible for the resistance phenotype Sequence analysis        of one of these clonal isolates PE revealed insertion        of an extra G within the G          homopolymeric region of the TK coding        region This mutation has also been detected in clinical        isolates from patients immunocompromised    or with        AIDS    as well as resistant HSV selected in tissue        culture      Interestingly this mutation was        present in ACV rclinical isolates obtained during        reactivation in the absence of drug pressure as well as in        ACV rstrains which evolved during ACV therapy and were        followed by ACVsusceptible isolates at the next        reactivation            It was surprising to find that the ACVresistant virus        selected         in vivo was not retained or amplified        in subsequent passages despite continued suboptimal        treatment with VCV This result appears to be in direct        contrast to that of Field    who found that following        selection of ACVresistant virus         in vivo such viruses remained        refractory to treatment upon subsequent passage using        suboptimal treatment with ACV The reason for this        difference is unclear However the failure to maintain the        resistant virus on subsequent passage suggests that the        pathogenicity of P may have been only partially        attenuated relative to the sensitive virus and indeed the        pathogenicity of the clonal virus isolate PE was        severely attenuated Further studies on the P clonal        isolates and the clinical significance of their        attentuation should be explored                    Conclusions        Suboptimal therapy of immunocompetent mice with either        VCV or FCV did not readily select for HSVmutants resistant        to either ACV or PCV suggesting that selection of        resistance with either prodrug remains difficult using this        system All the virus isolates from each serial passage        were examined by both PRA and PEA The former is widely        accepted as the gold standard for susceptibility testing of        HSV and for ACV a correlation between PRA         in vitro IC          and clinical outcome has been        established In spite of this the PEA appears to have        potential as an adjunct to the PRA by providing earlier        detection of the emergence of resistant HSV However it is        important to note that although an increase in the number        resistant variants within isolates was readily detected by        the PEA clinicallyresistant virus did not develop in the        immunocompetent mice Therefore the presence of resistant        virus within an isolate even at levels substantially above        background does not in itself indicate that increased        resistance will follow nor does it necessarily predict        clinical resistance It would be of interest to apply the        PEA to an extensive series of clinical isolates        particularly isolates obtained from severely        immunocompromised patients in order to evaluate the        proportions of resistant virus that occur within different        clinical isolates
