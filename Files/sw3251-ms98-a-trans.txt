            okay and uh i i missed a part of it were to talk about what lawns and gardens   lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do im im a putterer i chose that topic because i really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard   uhhuh uhhuh i well its its its very  strange strange that i got this call because my wife just called me i was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn   oh   and you know mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall fall bulbs   umhum weve had a late fall it seems like the weather in fact today its really warm and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up but you know you need to pretty soon   uh right thats the way this was the the petunias were really great our mums are are beautiful   oh   uh i dont know if we i dont think weve had a frost up here ive been i was down New Orleans for a week so i dont know what happened last week   uhhuh   uh but uh it seems like its oh i dont know if its late im sort of waiting for Indian Summer so i can get a lot of stuff down out here   uhhuh   um i i enjoy it we came here we just moved into this well we moved in November and put all all the landscaping in this this year we came from nine years in a condo uh and working in that condo you didnt have to do anything you know unless you really wanted to so   umhum so now you have the chance to really create and and spread out   right you know ive had this is my third third house i think ive owned um but uh its interesting the only the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling and it sort of gets away from me if youre not with it so but uh i i enjoy   umhum   most of it and about this time of year there is it starts getting a little old and i start looking forward to you know having other things to do with my   the grass not growing so fast   ah well it is it is for me because ive been doing a lot of fertilizing we had a terrible summer we had a drought   oh   and uh took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing and now its really growing and im trying to establish a good root root growth you know for the winter   hm ours seems to have slowed down here were not having to mow every week religiously   really   but were still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the the summer flowers out i still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year   uh oh really um yeah   uhhuh but like today its eighty five degrees its really strange   oh yeah yeah i hear that from my brotherinlaw lives in Plano   but thatll change real quick  then well wished wed planted bulbs and pansies already   yeah well he always         he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here and then he calls us yeah its seventy degrees here in the sunshine so   oh my gosh well Texas has gotten to where its a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot   oh i yeah   and we have ice storms every year and there just arent that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they dont make it through the two swings   uhhuh yeah that is i was you know i was like conditioned to it theyre theyre have to be hardened to it already yeah thats uh thats strange with me   umhum   you know you think Dallas you know almost semitropical you wouldnt have that kind of that kind of problem but   well for the most part we dont but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold well the summers have gotten where theyre a lot hotter   umhum   but the the ice storms really are stressful on all the the plants that we have around weve noticed that crepe myrtles dont do as well as they used to   really oh do they   and uh pittosporum that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time you you really take a chance with them freezing   uhhuh i love yeah i love the uh the landscaping like i say my brotherinlaw lives in Plano and i get to Carrollton quite a bit   uhhuh   i go there on on business and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens and Texas is Dallas Dallas is very nice i really enjoy it there the landscaping the homes the architecture the whole thing very enjoyable gardens and my wife and i   umhum except for the lack of trees out where we are  it was all cotton fields and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it   well yeah that we have you know Ohios a a very pretty state we moved in seventy six we moved to Chicago we lived there for five years   umhum   and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt uh we were coming in and before the plane landed she looked out the window and she said she said Randy theres no trees down there       i said there are this is Illinois you know and when we got out to the area where we decided decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land   hm umhum   and now all of a sudden it was being developed and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees
