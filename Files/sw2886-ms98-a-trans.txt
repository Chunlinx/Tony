              nope   did i interrupt your reading schedule   no       been playing on my computer   oh oh   and   well have you what have you read good lately   um lately   well well not not even lately tell me   well uh lets see last book i read was a science fiction book called Weapon   whos it by do you remember   um uh it was it was his first book i think not very popular   yeah my husband is a big science fiction uh reader but i dont uh care for it as much i dont have uh hes a computer man too so   yeah   i think that sometimes goes hand in hand           yeah what books are you into   well uh im at a stand still right now but uh um we havent lived in Charlotte very long   umhum   and so uh and our furniture is stored somewhere else so ive had a lot of time ive read a lot of books but and this is uh one group of books im wondering if youve read that i i guess i started reading them two or three years ago by Jean Auel uh the first one was Clan of the Cave Bear   umhum no i sure havent read that   oh gosh that is wonderful   yeah   and then the second uh book of hers was Valley of the Horses and the third one was the Mammoth Hunters are they sounding familiar   yeah uhhuh yeah   and her last one which i think waited everybody waited about a year or two for to come out   umhum   uh uh Plains of Passage   hm   but uh uh i think Clan and and you have to read them in order you have to read the Clan first   umhum   but that has that is the most different book that my ive read in many many years probably since Brave New World uh made such an impact on me many years ago   oh yeah thats a good book   and my husband says so too   umhum   the Clan so its if you can pick those books up uh and sometimes theyre packaged together those first three in paper back   uhhuh well the last good book i read would be uh let me think uh the last series i read was Power that Preserves and have you ever read those by Donaldson   yes i have   yeah with the leper   yes   yeah   good   yeah   but how do you uh read more realistic books perhaps   um what do you mean   selfimprovement or yeah howto books   yeah lot of computer books i guess   yeah yeah   im into um neural networks and artificial intelligence   youre into what im im terribly i im sorry i didnt   neural networks and artificial intelligence   uhhuh   its kind of what ive been studying in school and stuff   uhhuh are
