that purposeLawyers                law is a mass of opinions and decisions which courts andlawyers have instituted themselves Paine liked the first kind of law betterSo does Antonin Scalia As the most intellectually consistent and stylisticallygifted member of the Supreme Court Scalia has never hidden his enthusiasm forthe American tradition of mistrusting courts and lawyers The basics of hisjudicial philosophy are now usefully collated in this volume which consists ofan essay by the associate justice followed first by responses from GordonWood Laurence Tribe Mary Ann Glendon and Ronald Dworkin and then by a replyfrom Scalia            Accordingto Scalia the problem begins in law school where tomorrows judges digest asteady diet of fusty  th century English appellate decisions andtastefor the first timethe joys of reasoning by analogy and precedent Afew of these students befriend their senators or find some other way to becomefederal judges by that time they have internalized what Scalia calls thecommonlaw attitude and they become a dangerous lot Faced with an ambiguousstatute or regulation these judges reared on the common law too often treatthe enacted text as just one more precedent to circumvent In other words theyhijack the democratic process            Scalia offers two antidotes to this epidemic of judiciallawmaking textualism and originalism Textualism is just what it soundslike As Scalia puts it The text is the law and it is the text that must beobserved The only democratically binding feature of a statute is its literallanguage because that language alone has been ratified by both houses ofCongress and the president in accordance with the Constitution Originalismas Scalia defines it is a species of textualism particularly relevant toconstitutional interpretation Its adherents tether their interpretations toplain meanings as they were understood when the text was first pennedOriginalists believe as Scalia puts it that a constitutions whole purposeis to prevent changeto embed certain rights in such a manner that futuregenerations cannot take them away            None ofthis is new to anyone who has paid attention to Scalias opinions and otherwritings over the past decade Yet in A Matter of Interpretation  hisreprise of the traditional jeremiad against judicial usurpation concludes witha twist The specter raised by commonlaw judging Scalia says is not theunelected judge determined to impose the values of an elite few upon themasses but that old Tocquevillian villain the tyranny of the majorityScalias argument goes like this As judges persist in bending the law themajority of the moment will begin to insist ever more stridently on judges ofits particular ideological stripe Once on the bench these judicialpoliticians emboldened by their anythinggoes commonlaw attitudes will setabout encoding the popular will into law to the detriment of unpopularminorities            As law Professor Mary Ann Glendon points out inher response this is an odd coda especially given the majoritarian premisesof Scalias philosophy Glendon shares Scalias distrust of undisciplinedjudges but hers is the more traditional anxiety rooted in a fear of elitesAt the end of the book Scalia defending his prediction that judges will carrydemocracy too far contends that the individual rights favored by judges tendto be the same ones championed by popular majorities Here is Scalias listwomens rights racialminority rights homosexual rights abortion rights andrights against political favoritism Scalias notion of what constitutes apopular cause does seem questionableracialminority and gay rights are notnearly as universally supported as Scalia seems to think they are Hisnightmare scenario is also farfetched Lifetenured judges are dubiousvehicles for implementing a popular will that changes from moment to momentBesides judges cant be relied on Supreme Court justices for instance arefamous for disappointing their appointers            Scaliasprescriptions have long drawn fire from legal academics Some of theircriticisms are repeated here by legal academics Laurence Tribe and RonaldDworkin Scalias originalism is too glib because it doesnt distinguishbetween what the Constitution says and what its framers expected it todo  too malleable because it merely substitutes the guesswork ofhistorians for the musings of moral philosophers too valueladen because itimputes an antievolutionary purpose to the Constitution And so on            Yet Scalia is refreshingly right in several particularsHe justifiably laments the virtual disregard of statutory interpretation inlawschool curricula where the hoary commonlaw casestudy method stillpredominates despite the fact that most law nowadays takes the form of statutesand regulations            Scaliaalso rightly rejects the use of legislative history committee reports andfloor debates as a guide to divining lawmakers intent Committee reports areworthless not only because they lack a democratic pedigree but because theyare infinitely pliable Scalia quotes Judge Harold Leventhals quip that usinglegislative history is like looking over the heads at a cocktail party untilyou spot your friends And Scalia is right to object to the caricature of thetextualistoriginalist judge as wooden and unimaginativenontextualists afterall can be plenty wooden and unimaginative themselves            Admitted nontextualists incidentally arebecoming harder and harder to find Scalias plain language approach hascertainly become more popular among his bench mates The simplest proof of thisis the remarkable increase in citations to dictionaries in Supreme Courtopinions A recent study found that dictionary definitions were  times morelikely to appear in the courts decisions five years after Scalias swearinginthan they were five years before it The originalists of course like to dustoff old dictionariesDr Johnsons  edition for the Bill of Rightsfor instance This lexicographical trend wont cure the textualistsreputation for stiltedness reading some of these opinions is like listening tothe highschool valedictorian who inevitably begins I didnt know what to saytoday so I looked up the word commencement             Evendevotees of the Living Constitution like Tribe now declare their fidelity totext Its surprising that Tribes essay doesnt discuss his textualistargument for the unconstitutionality of Colorados Amendment  which forbadecities to enact antidiscrimination ordinances based on sexual orientationCiting almost no cases Tribe told the Supreme Court that the Coloradoinitiative violated the letter of the Equal Protection Clause because it deniedgays alone the protection of the antidiscrimination laws Not an airtightargument all antidiscrimination laws pick and choose among protectedclasses but a cleverly textualist oneand one that seems to have helpedconvince a majority of the court to strike down the amendment despite a lackof helpful precedent Scalia offered a different textualist reading of theEqual Protection Clause grounding his arch dissent firmly inmajoritarianismThe Court has mistaken a Kulturkampf for a fit ofspite            So how often are judges actually as willful as Scaliaclaims they are It still sometimes happens Last spring the  thUS Circuit Court of Appeals found in the Due Process Clause a constitutionalright to physicianassisted suicide by relying on Plato Montaigne ThomasMore and the Roper poll Its decision which Tribe defended before the courtearlier this month is almost certain to be reversed probably on textualistgrounds Most of the current textual infidelity though occurs because thedoctrine of stare decisis which dictates adherence to precedentforcestodays judges to live with adventurous Supreme Court decisions from earlier inthe century Not surprisingly Scalia is no big fan of stare decisis  Inhis dissents he often calls upon the court to scour away layers of encrustedprecedent in order to get at the original meaning of the underlying text            How judges interpret statutesand constitutions is according to Scalia a question utterly central to theexistence of democratic government Thats hard to dispute Yet as Woodahistorian of early Americashows in his essay its also a question weve beenasking since the colonial era fitting the answer to the needs of the momentThe revolution of  for instance was fueled in part by the colonistsresentment of the overweening powers of royal judges As early as the showever the pendulum had swung back and many Americans looked to the courtsto check the excesses of their legislators To Scalia however the idea thatjudicial power responds to the demands of the time merely proves that therehave always been willful judges who bend the law to their wishes            Seen from a historiansperspective Scalias view of the debate over the judiciary does look a bitManichaean But it would be a mistake to dismiss him for that reason Scaliasarguments have shaped the debate in our time he has gone a long way towardchanging how judges interpret the letter of the law Not all the wayhe hasnot yet succeeded in building a durable majority on the court Does this meanthat unpopular individual rights are in peril More likely it simply goes toshowas do the exchanges in this stimulating bookthat there is more than oneway to read a text
