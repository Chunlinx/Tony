        served on jury duty but its ironic because i have a summons here for the thirtieth which is the Monday after next and ill be a little more authoritative on this after then     um i havent either but here recently i with with the advent of court TV ive watched a little bit more than   but um   uh than i would have a probably a year or so ago so i ive been getting a little more interested in court procedures too   um yeah i would think that um sentencing would be the kind of thing that an expert system would be ideal for you know theres a whole bunch of evidence thats supposed to be weighed and for nice uniform sentencing for particular things it would um seem like the perfect solution but i suppose that would be really subject to abuse as well   well uh i guess it could be but i i i agree with you in that to the extent that i i think it it largely would be more uniform i think uh as a opposed to a a real mixture of juries with in different locations and different you know ideas   yeah theres so much variation in sentencing like this guy recently that um there was some guy that was convicted and he volunteered to be castrated i guess that was down in your area uh   yeah uh i think it was yeah Houston ive been hearing about that yeah   and then here theyve gone and um no surgeon could be found to perform the job so the judge went and withdrew the whole idea or something like that   yeah plus he was getting a lot of uh uh criticisms i guess for by different groups you know about just being inhumane you know that sort of thing   yeah one thing i would certainly like to see is that um criminals be sentenced to some sort of a uh a means of paying for their um incarceration i think thats thats reasonable those of us on this side of uh the justice system have to pay pay our way through life   yeah and and the costs are real high i guess of both uh of of keeping someone in prison and going through the trial procedure the whole whole works uh   yeah absolutely   and and that just comes out of the tax money and uh in a lot of cases the uh uh the person being tried sometimes you know they do have the means to uh to repay the courts or the victims or the prisons to uh to keep them   really   or to perform some sort of more work than is is currently done in most prisons   yeah i would think theres a lot that a lot of production that could could be done um you know with people like that whether totally unskilled or not   yeah yeah  they need to make some adjustments on that um uh the the other question i guess that that to be addressed is uh whether uh a a verdict should should require unanimous uh uh decision   thats a tough one we seem to as a group have such a hard time all agreeing and what is it they say about democracy the flaws of democracy  is that nobody will um agree on anything or its hard to get everybody to agree on something i cant theres some saying i cant remember what it is   yeah it yeah i i i dont know but it seems like um  everything is so stacked and in favor of the criminal that its a shame to have a a majority that would vote uh guilty and to have just one dissenting vote could jeopardize the whole uh whole process or whole whole verdict to   yeah really thats a really good point   and it seems like it should just be uh some come up with some sort of majority maybe um uh maybe a two thirds or a three quarters majority or something because its its hard to get every single person to to agree on anything like you say   how is it now do you know do they have it so that if um some certain percentage agrees then or   well it has to right now it has to be unanimous on most of those decisions if not its a hung jury and uh theyre asked to stay in and try to come up with the unanimous verdict and then if eventually its uh uh not unanimous even by one vote its sometimes i i think its either thrown out or they have to go for retrial   hum   um even if just one person is is holding out or cant be convinced to uh to vote guilty   more time and expense     yeah i mean thats really a really really really a lot of cost to uh to bring that to trial again   very interesting yeah there seems to be a lot of problems with the uh criminal justice system in America today im certainly no one to have the answers   yeah they it needs some some revising and i heard that this is a little unrelated i guess but i heard uh what was it the other day it said to for someone whos convicted and put on death row it was it it was up in the millions what it costs to keep that person and then to execute that person at the time you you you know it usually takes years to do that   hum unbelievably i   just all the appeals processes that goes on and   yeah and theyre all automatic too for a long ways at least   yeah and that was just uh amazing that they were talking about a millions of dollars per
