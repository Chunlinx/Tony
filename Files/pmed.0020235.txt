                            Twins research is a favorite tool of the human geneticist but it has a controversial        history Nazi doctor Josef Mengele infamous for his work at Auschwitz was fascinated by        twins He sought them out at the extermination camp and used them in violent experiments        Later British psychologist Cyril Burt worked on the heredity of intelligence producing        findings that some suspected were too goodand which later were shown to be based on        fraudulent data involving invented twins        In this months         PLoS Medicine  Nancy Krieger and colleagues examine the health of female        twins from a very different perspective To understand the impact of lifetime socioeconomic        position on health they studied twins who were raised together but who had different        socioeconomic position after adolescence Many studies have compared the health of twins        raised separately since birth or early childhood but few have investigated the adult        health of twins raised together but who had different postadolescent socioeconomic        position Such a study could clarify the impact of adult experiences on adult health in a        population matched on early life experiences the authors say        Kriegers team employed data from a cohort of  twins who lived in the San Francisco        Bay area in  the average age at recruitment was  years old The cohort was        given a health and sociodemographic questionnaire Data on anthropometric and biological        characteristics were obtained by physical examination and laboratory analyses the process        was repeated at a second examination around  At the second phase of the study         women  did not return of whom  had died which left  twin pairs         monozygotic  dizygotic representing  of the original cohort        The sociodemographic and health characteristics of the full cohort  pairs and the        cohort analyzed those pairs where it was known both that they had lived together until at        least age  and their joint socioeconomic was availableie  pairs were quite        similar  grew up in workingclass households and  in households where the father had        fewer than four years of college education        At the second examination  of the twin pairs in the analytic cohort had a difference        in their adult household occupational class and  had different levels of college        education The team found that health outcomes among monozygotic adult female twins who        lived together through childhood varied by their subsequent socioeconomic position Twins        with differing occupational class differed in health status compared with twins with        similar occupational class The workingclass twin had significantly higher systolic blood        pressure diastolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol than her professional        nonworkingclass twin Twins discordant on educational level however had similar health        status likely reflecting the fact that current occupational class is a better measure for        investigating the impact of lifetime socioeconomic position than is education which is        completed usually in early adulthood Dizgyotic twins with differing adult socioeconomic        position either occupational class or educational level did not notably differ in their        adult health status        These novel findings lend support to the hypothesis that health is shaped not only by        early life experiences but also by cumulative experiences across the lifecourse the        authors say        As with many twin studies the numbers of individuals studied is relatively limited The        lack of some biological and personal data such as detailed occupational class position over        time lack of data on income poverty wealth debt gestational age birthweight and        birth order also limits the conclusions that can be drawn These limitations are countered        however by the tight matching of the twins on early life and childhood exposures as well        as by the matching for genetic endowment among the monozygotic twins Together the        findings have important implications for health policy since they suggest that adult        socioeconomic position does have an impact on adult health above and beyond early life        exposures and they also add to our understanding of how societal conditions shape        population patterns of health disease and wellbeing
