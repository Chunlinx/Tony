        all right well tell me all about your reunion planning   well we uh uh this will be uh uh the reunion for not my grandfather but my great grandfather and then my great and then my grandfathers so its a couple of generations um and these were pioneers who came across the plains   uhhuh   and uh the families were are quite large and so weve had we spent a lot of time trying to gather up uh names and addresses of all the tons of people that are involved   uhhuh   and so it takes a lot of time and planning um good activity the what   are you going to do it over a weekend are you going to do it over a weekend or   well interesting enough were going to were going to do it over an eight day period   uhhuh   uh they will not everyone wont be there for the whole time but the families can come in during that eight day time and kind of meet on the on the living family level   right   like i will come there kind of early and my brothers and sisters and their families will come so that we can get acquainted and then uh it goes back the the generation before will join us and they may meet kind of individually in this camping area   uhhuh   and then uh toward the end of the week there will be two specific days when we honor these two uh uh groups my the grandfathers and the great grandfathers   uhhuh   uh so its kind of once more combining the whole group again but uh its its its uh it requires a lot of uh logistics for food for the people who will have to meet   uhhuh   and a lot of uh arranging for activities   what are some of the activities   uh well uh course you want to do some kinds of things that which will help them to get to know the ancestor that youre honoring   umhum   but besides that if you have a lot of children and and different ages you need to try to find things that uh that they will just have like to do together so that the next time somebody says reunion they wont run like the four winds   yeah yeah   so it has to be pretty fun too i think uh were were going uh going to Utah to uh uh place near Park City   uhhuh   and uh and its a a pretty good size area where therell be hiking and and then there will be uh oh just uh general kinds of things like uh swimming and whatever during the uh in the area roundabout which they will do during the days when they want to when theyre not uh uh rehearsing or whatever for a part of the the play and then well kind of get together and and uh work out some small oh vignettes or or uh acts or things like that Musical numbers and the fact that were together early during the week will help us to get together to prepare those things for the for the programs at the end of the week   yeah   so it it were real excited about it now always before we have only had my grandfathers family and uh we only did it for one day   uhhuh   and uh the last time we doing we were doing it every two years and we decided last time we would wait a third year because it came across so often that it was kind of hard to get there and uh   yeah   some people come from Back East and course i come from Texas so theres some of us come from quite a ways   yeah   uh and so we we had a little longer and decided to try to hold it uh in a situation that was a little longer like a camping situation something that wasnt too expensive but uh could be more of a vacation situation for families to come and participate in while getting to know their ancestors and relatives   umhum   uh so that maybe theyd be attracted more to bring their families now ive never gotten all my family to come before but this year i have uh several married daughters and and sons whose families are coming en masse so it it it looks to be a lot more interesting activity   this is what how did you pick uh the place in Utah is it central location or   well uh the ancestors came from there   okay   and uh and we we were holding them there because there were some living ancestors up until uh fairly recently at this point in that generation that were honoring theres only well my mother is ninety three and she wont go this year because its just too hard on her but uh and theres one other wife but all of the all of the children are now gone they theyve passed away in the meantime   uhhuh   and so uh at that point we were going for that reason we were going there but it just there just more of them there still than there are other places the rest of us are kind of strung around some but were but you know if you if youre talking about convenient for the biggest majority it still is there   uhhuh   also we had a we had a a the member who was in charge of it in general this time had some access to this park which was a big factor   uh   whether well be able to do it there again but there are other kind of arrangements like in in uh in some of the areas in Colorado you know where they ski in the winter time you can make some pretty good arrangements for uh for group uh activities and things like that   how   so we might do something like that also sometimes universities will will rent out uh areas for doing things like that   yeah okay how long in advance did you set the date   but uh well we knew generally the time of year uh that we wanted to do it in three years ago but we could not set the date until the first of January this year because this park where they have it uh they allow people in the vicinity to make their arrangements ahead of time and so we kind of had to take what was left   uhhuh   and uh so we we feel pretty fortunate to have gotten in at all but uh   yeah   uh i think you need to plan on you need to be sure and plan uh at least a year ahead of time or youre going to lose people you know they have to plan their vacations that far ahead a little bit   right   if not exactly at least know generally what theyre going to do   okay   well its kind of important to to know quite a while ahead of time uh the last time we had one uh i was in charge of it and my goal was to write a history of my of my father and his  brothers and sisters   uhhuh   there was a history of his father and mother but there was no history on them so i spent the two years before that compiling and and writing the history and then we gave it out at that this year were not were were combining it in the and the parents before and so were going to do some um uh acting out of of these groups and try to help them get better acquainted and mostly its a different kind of thing so were were just kind of playing it by ear and seeing how it goes i think   wow sounds like you guys are uh your familys really into family   but yeah were kind of like we kind of uh well we like each other and we liked our families and so we figure they the little kids ought to get to know each other and and we are scattered enough there i have several children who live here but i also have children in in uh Nevada and Arizona   uhhuh   so its its really neat to be able to get acquainted get around with them you know   wow   and  youre younger   yes   you have any family at all   uh well im married and uh my wife is from a large family but my family my mothers   uhhuh   living and she has one brother that has no children thats living and my deceased father has one sister that has one child with and no other children so i have like four relatives   not very many huh do you do you enjoy your do you enjoy your your wifes large family though   not very many no it too its it was a large transition let me tell you because they had to meet one person they only had to meet me and i had to probably meet twenty five or thirty people   was it is it yeah yeah   so getting names and faces and jobs and where they live and everything straight was a quite a task uh   yeah   i i still kind of balk at it because theyre really into family too and like   you dont feel quite involved huh   well they try to involve me and if i allow myself to be involved you know ill fit into the picture but uh they uh they make a big deal out of everything   yeah well you have to try it youll like it   yeah uh i guess so uh     it really is quite a lot of fun and uh um uh   yeah   uh   im just not used to it because our family has a reunion about once ever two years and and its about a   yeah   you know ten people show up so no one theres my age so i just kind of sit there and hang out but uh Carla has a lot of cousins   yeah yeah yeah   that are our age and you know so we get   yeah cousins get really get really close sometimes almost closer than brothers and sisters sometimes   its yeah it seems that happened with their family   especially right especially if they live fairly close together so they get a chance to see each other   right   its kind of special   yeah there family was pretty well centralized everyone kind of stayed around the the uh the grandparents   um uhhuh   for at least for a while at least while they were growing up   yeah   now theyve kind of moved out a little bit but not too much   yeah   so
