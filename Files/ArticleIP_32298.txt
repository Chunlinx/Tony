                                  Florida Juice            I still have my notes from that morning May  in the Q Wing of Florida State Prison steak broccoli hot Lipton teafor the last meal The lights go off throwing the prison into darkness as theprison switches to its own generator At  am the door in the back of thedeath chamber opens and theres Jesse Taferoslender bald whitestandingbetween two guards and looking at the chair like he cant believe its realIm attending his execution as a witness and covering it for my employer theMiami Herald  The guards make Tafero sit down and tie him to the chairwith leather straps He says his last words and then stares out at each of usone by one as the guards stuff a gag into his mouth He is defiant my notessay as if I can read his mind The guards slip a black leather hood over hisface and screw the head electrode with its circular sponge down onto the topof his skull Ready set go At six minutes past  the electricity hits JesseTafero and his head bursts into flame            Some things you cantescapecant burn them cant box them up cant run far enough or fast enoughaway I thought of Jesse Tafero earlier this month when I read about theexecution of Bud Davis in the Florida electric chair Davis started to bleedwhen the electricity hit him soaking his shirt bright red scaring theassembled witnesses The chair functioned as it was designed to function iswhat Florida Gov Jeb Bushs press secretary said            And in a way thats absolutely true If tidy executionswere the point Florida could have switched over to lethal injection a longtime ago Pretty much all the states have But Florida has been insistent aboutkeeping its lethal furniture even though three times in the last nine yearsbeginning with Jesse Tafero the chair has gone awry Fire in  fire in and now blood Meanwhile Florida continues to fend off legal challengesto its right to electrocute behaving as if death itself werent punishmentenough            Its no coincidence thatmodern Florida was born of electricitywithout air conditioning none of itwould be possible not those golf course condos or tall beach hotels or trailerparks or malls spreading across the shallow limestone shelf that separatesFlorida soil from the sea Down there more than in other places electricityis power the fine bright line between life and no life which is the samething as between life and death            The electric chair came to the state in the middle of thefirst great Florida land boom when Florida was conjuring itself up out of thesea of grass Back then Florida executed by hanging which wasnt a foolproofway to kill people either Some of the noosed choked to death in those dustyjailhouse courtyards but that wasnt what bugged Florida about the method Theproblem was that hangings were popular and sometimes drew huge raucouspicnicking crowds an image that didnt quite mesh with the orangeblossomgentility the land barons were trying to create In  the Floridalegislature moved death indoors to the chair away from the curious and themayonnaisesmeared            Somehow the electric throne made death seemcivilized But those carefree days when frying someone was a sign of progressare long gone The chair has become an anachronism an unpleasant physicalreminder that the death penalty involves death  One by one starting inTexas in  states switched to lethal injection Only four states stillelectrocute and of them Florida is by far the most enthusiastic            You see Floridalikes the chair Its collective bloodthirst hasnt changed much sincethe days of public hangings Following Davis bloody demise Gov Bushproclaimed that the execution let everyone know that Florida was against themurder of innocent people After the chair misfired in  Attorney GeneralBob Butterworth similarly explained that if people didnt want to burn up whilebeing electrocuted then they should commit their capital offenses somewhereelse Burn em up and warn em off The only thing unusual about the chairFlorida thinks is that it isnt used often enough            Outsiders think the Florida executioners are sadisticmorons Nothing could be further from the truth If anything theyrefrustrated home economists Consider for a moment the science ofelectrocution at Florida State Prison When flames erupted from Jesse Taferoduring the execution I witnessed prison officials blamed the fire on thewaterfilled sponge attached to his head that was placed there to conductelectricity from the electrode The sponge purchased by maintenance workers atthe local fiveanddime was highly flammable because it was synthetic they determined To demonstrate their theory they bought another syntheticsponge and stuck it in a kitchen toaster where it caught on fire A simulatedexecution was conducted with a fireresistant sea sponge a tub of waterstanding in for a human body and a colander for a human head After that onlysea sponges could enter the death chamber            But when Pedro Medinashead caught fire during his March  execution the Florida Supreme Courtordered the Department of Corrections to write down its electric chairprotocol previously just a folksy wordofmouth operation in Q Wing Theruling came out of a  lawsuit filed by condemned inmate Leo AlexanderJones who argued that the electric chair was cruel and unusual punishment Thestate by way of saying thank you ordered Jones to watch the chairs nexttrial run This time a metal salad bowl played the role of the human head            In  the Florida Supreme Court ruled  to keep thechair with the dissenting justices comparing the chair to the guillotineSince then three justices have left the court two of them from the prochairside Its hard to imagine that this latest incident wont have an impact onthe court which is currently reviewing another legal challenge to thechair            Heavy use of the chair executions in the last yearshas put some wear and tear on the device In  the Department ofCorrections which had previously told the court that the chair was in goodshape up and called a structural engineer and paid him  to inspect thechair The inspector reported that the chair itself the wooden part neededreplacement It just so happened that the Department of Corrections had anotherelectric chair a fullsize replica that it had had manufactured and thenplaced on display at the departments tiny and strange museum in TallahasseeWhile still in the death chamber the inspector had snapped a few quickpictures of himself sitting in the chair and he is planning to use them asChristmas cards this year According to the inspector the states concernwasnt the condemned The guards were worried that if the chair broke apartduring an electrocution the thick black highvoltage wires screwed to theinmate might rip loose and electrocute everybody in the room                           Flames  my notes say about Taferosexecution Flames and smoke It is impossible to put into words Whatdoes it look like when someone catches fire while strapped to a piece of woodThe flames are nearly a foot high they arc out from underneath the blackleather hood there is smoke the huge buzzing sound of the electricity thereare white walls and Venetian blinds and linoleum underfoot Theres ash fallingon Taferos shirt and hes nodding his head hes heaving his chest in and outtied down with those thick leather straps The executioner turns the power onand off three times in all and in between the jolts Tafero is moving hesnodding his chest rises and falls He looks like hes still alive Then theelectricity hits him again and the fire rises from his head from the blackleather mask and he shudders forward and is slammed back against the chair Ittakes seven minutes before the prison doctor pronounces him dead seven minutesof heaving nodding flame and smoke You cant see his face because the maskcovers it but as you walk past him on your way out you notice his hands thereTheres a sore on his right pinky finger a raw spot flesh rubbed off to bloodagainst the oak from where he was clawing the chair
