                                 Wealthier Than Thou            What do people really careabout being rich or being richer than their neighbors            Of course people care abouta lot of things that have nothing to do with being rich Just by logging on toSlate instead of using this time to earn an extra dollar youve refuted theproposition that people pursue wealth the way sharks pursue food Instead wecompromise between the pursuit of wealth and the pursuit of leisure sometimesaccepting less of one so we can have more of the other            Besideswealth and leisure theres a long list of other things we value We like toavoid risk we care about the qualities of our mates we want our children tobe happy But wealth is one of the things we strive for so it makessense to ask how we measure success in that dimension            One hypothesis is that its only your raw wealth thatmattersa million dollars will make you happy regardless of whether its halfor twice what your neighbor has In other words you measure the value of yourwealth by what you can buy with it The alternative hypothesis is that you alsocare about your place in the pecking order            If only raw wealth mattersyour hardworking neighbor is no threat to you He keeps what he earns youkeep what you earn and you can each decide whether youd rather earn moremoney or enjoy more leisure On the other hand if people care about thepecking order you and your neighbor can get involved in a costly and futilearms race sacrificing valuable leisure in your mutually frustrating effortsto be the top earner on the block            To putthis in perspective imagine that we could all agree to take an hour off fromwork this week Under the raw wealth hypothesis theres no advantage to thatagreement After all you were always free to take an hour off Butunder the pecking order hypothesis the agreement could serve as a sort ofarms control that leaves everyone better off by preserving our relativepositions while freeing up some extra time for leisure But any such agreementwould be impossible to enforce which if the pecking order hypothesis istrue is a failure of the marketplace            Which hypothesis is true Economiststraditionally have assumed that relative position does not matter andnoneconomists traditionally have scoffed at that assumption The scoffers pointto medieval monarchs who earned less in real terms than todays averageAmerican nevertheless by the standards of their contemporaries theylivedliterallylike kings Its easy to imagine that ruling all of th century England brought greater satisfaction than does saythe life of a modern certified public accountant            But whensomething is easy to imagine its often because your imagination is limitedIn this case your vision probably has neglected to include the diseasemonotony and isolation of medieval life I think it not at all unlikely thatHenry V would have traded his kingdom for modern plumbing antibiotics andaccess to the Internet            Heres another reason to be skeptical of the hypothesisthat people care deeply about how their income compares with others Ivenever met anyone who subscribes to the analogous theories about leisure orrisk Do you care about the length of your vacation or about whether yourvacation is longer than your neighbors Do you care about how well your airbag works or about whether youve got the best air bag in your neighborhoodIn each case surely its the former But if we feel that way about leisure andrisk why would we not feel that way about income            On theother hand if you really believe that people care about wealth only for whatit will buy them its hard to explain why Bill Gates gets up and goes to workin the morning Surely its not because hes afraid hell run out of money Butit just might be because hes afraid hell lose his No  ranking in the Forbes Though here Im tempted to respond that its a mistake to generalizeabout human behavior on the basis of a few extraordinary individuals whoprobablyand quite atypicallylove their work            Recently three economists named Harold ColeGeorge Mailath and Andrew Postlewaite for whom I will use the collectiveabbreviation CMP have proposed a compromise between the two theories On theone hand people do not care directly about their relative positions inthe wealth distribution On the other hand they care indirectly abouttheir relative positions because a high relative position allows you toattract a better mate            The CMP theory sounds verysimple but it has some remarkable implications First it implies that thecompetition for mates drives most people to save too much money Young peopleoversave in an attempt to improve their own prospects and old peopleoversave in an attempt to improve their childrens prospects Ifeveryone could agree to save a little less wed all be better off Ourrelative matinggame scores would be unchanged but wed all have more money tospend And yet while this oversaving is costly to any given generation itenriches future generations            Whenpeople compete by saving the rich have a head start So the CMP theorysuggests that income inequality should grow over time But if inequalitybecomes so great that people lose all hope of changing their relativepositions then the incentive to oversave disappears and the inequality couldbegin to shrink            The most striking implication of the CMP theory is that theconcern for relative position vanishes in societies where mates are allocatedby mechanisms other than wealth Imagine an aristocracy where your socialstatus is inherited from your parents and dictates your choice of mate Such anaristocracy might not be sustainable People with low status and high wealthcan prove attractive to people with high status and low wealth whereupon theentire social structure disintegrates Even families with low status andlow wealth might be able to save aggressively for several generations inorder to buy their way into the aristocracy and again there is an eventualbreakdown            But theCMP researchers have identified a way for an aristocracy to be sustainedindefinitely Mixed high statuslow status marriages can be effectivelydeterred in a society where the children of such marriages are relegated to thelowest status of all In that case a lowstatus man who wants to crack thesocial barriers and who cares about his offspring must save enough topurchase highstatus mates for both himself and his children CMP havedemonstrated that to succeed such social rebels would have to achieveimpossibly high savings ratesso the aristocracy endures            Now here is the punch line Imagine twosocieties that are identical in all the ways that economists traditionally viewas important They have identical populations They have access to identicaltechnologies Their people have exactly the same preferences in all things Butin Society A you attract your mate by wealth and in Society B you attractyour mate by inherited status Then the standards of living in these societieswill differ dramatically and diverge dramatically over time because they offerdifferent incentives to saveand saving is one of the twin engines of economicgrowth The other engine is technological progress which weve assumed is thesame in both societies            The moral of the story isthat cultural norms are extremely important Of course one could argue thateveryone except economists knew this all along But the CMP researchdemonstrates something genuinely new that cultural norms can be extremelyimportant even if we accept all the standard simplifying assumptionsthat economists like to make about human behavior            We can go further imaginingsocieties where status is conferred not by accidents of birth but by learningor by physical strength or by darkness of complexion Clearly any one of thesesocieties will evolve very differently from all the others But what makes themdiffer in the first place Part of the answer according to the logic of CMPis that once a cultural norm is establishedeven for purely random reasonsitcan become selfsustaining Ideally though wed like a coherent account ofthose purely random reasonsand Im not sure anyone knows how to think aboutthat
