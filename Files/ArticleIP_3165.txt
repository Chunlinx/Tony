                                 Airline English            In an opening monologue notlong ago Late Night host Jay Leno told his audience that Air Force Onehad hit a patch of turbulence during a recent trip forcing President Clintonto return the flight attendant to her full upright and locked position            Whatsocial historians of the future may find most notable about Lenos joke is notwhat it says about popular perceptions of Bill Clintons sex life but what itsays about the language of air travel and how its suigeneris vocabularyseat pocket ground personnel emergency flotation

destroy any lavatory smokedetector  and its utter regularity across corporate and internationalboundarieshow all these things have become matters of mass familiarity            Airline English has in a way become thelinguistic equivalent of the worldwide nonverbal graphic system that conveyssuch meanings as ladies room no parking first aid and informationIt is just as streamlined just as stylized often in the same oddly archaicsort of way The worldwide symbol for cocktail lounge is a martini glass witholive even though martinis themselves are a relatively uncommon sight thesedays The symbol for pharmacy is a mortar and pestle Airline language issimilarly atavistic Whenever else does one hear the word stow being usedexcept as part of the command to stow your belongings in the overheadbins            Actually the other placewhere stow is frequently used is on board boats and ships One significantelement of airline language including many of its archaisms derives from thenautical terminology that the pioneers of air travel appropriatednotunnaturally given the obvious parallels between the two modes oftransportation fragile means of conveyance built to negotiate a boundlessoften turbulent medium of fluid or gas An airplane is a craft and itscrew including a captain first officer and purser operates from adeck inside a cabin The aircraft is segmented by bulkheads Its kitchensare galleys It carries cargo in holds            But thecompressed time of air travel gives its language a focused liturgical qualitythat oceanic travel has never had at least for passengers from the initialwelcome aboard to the cautionary homily to the ritual mealon more and moreflights a merely symbolic activityto the final Goodbye GoodbyeGoodbye Goodbye Goodbye The linguistic contours of a typical airlineflight are every bit as scripted as those of a religious service For Americancarriers the Nicene Creed of official cabin talk comes in the form of a numberof Federal Aviation Administration regulations such as No  Briefingpassengers before takeoff and No  Briefing passengers extendedoverwater operations The subject matter of these dense passages of textwhich in their original versions date back to the early s concernseverything from seat belts and life jackets to emergency exits and oxygenmasks The regulations are distilled by each airline into detailed scriptswhich are reviewed by company lawyers and must be approved finally by theFAA The scripts are then circulated to inflight personnel            Credal formulations aside airlines haveconsiderable latitude when it comes to routine announcements again thoughthe language is often fastidiously scripted down to even the most casualremarks Would you like Coke or Sprite appears in a script provided by theAssociation of Professional Flight Attendants Most of the dozen or soairlines contacted were reluctant to furnish actual transcripts of approvedlanguage manuals although one veteran pilot with United asserted Youregonna hear the same thing but youll hear it just a bit differentlySouthwest Airlines did provide an example of an unusual rap announcement thatsome of its ground personnel have used It reads in part We board in groupsof thirty According to your card One thru thirty boards first Its reallynot that hard And it goes on Federal law prohibits smoking On mostdomestic flights No smoking is permitted So dont even try to lightSouthwests corporate culture of officially sanctioned iconoclasm if there canbe such a thing is far from typical            From time to timepassengers may notice a crew member reading an announcement from a laminatedtextchanges do get made and are distributed airlinewidebut for the mostpart the scripts are committed to memory and the habits born of rigoroustraining die hard Not long ago one of my sisters discovered that she was tobe the only passenger on a commercial flight and settled in for the journeyAs she prepared for the plane to push back a flight attendant materialized forthe safety briefing and in the one concession to the circumstances sat downin the seat next to my sister instead of standing in the aisle at the front ofthe cabin The dull monotone was the same as ever As we prepare for takeoffthe flight attendant said looking at my sister from six inches away pleasecheck that your seat belt is fastenedand here she made the requisiteclicking and unclicking movements with the demonstration modeland dotake time to look through the safety information in the seat pocket in front ofyou Our aircraft is equipped with four emergency exits             As you might imagine mysister at that point was ready to use them all
