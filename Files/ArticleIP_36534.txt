                                  Planning for Obsolescence            When I wrote my first textbook the publisherwanted to combat the secondsemester used book market by sewing a  billinto the binding of every  th book Every student would tear hisbook apart to see if hed won Printing with disappearing ink that lastsexactly one semester would also discourage the used book market But instead ofrunning lotteries or using disappearing ink most publishers make usedtextbooks obsolete by periodically releasing revised editions Did I mentionthat the fifth edition of my textbook is forthcoming next year            The naive answer to why publishers might want todiscourage the used book market is that they prefer to get paid every time astudent buys a book But by that logic you should never sell your house whenyou can rent it Why get paid only once when you could get paid every monthThe logic is wrong because the sale price is likely to be far higher than themonthly rent And the logic is still wrong when applied to textbooks becausethe sale price for a book that can be resold is likely to be far higher thanthe price of a book designed to lose its value            If a student is willing to pay say  for atextbook that same student will be willing to pay  for the use of atextbook that can be resold for  at the end of the semester For the sakeof simplicity lets ignore the fact that the  delivered a few months fromnow is worth a little less than  delivered immediately And for a book thatcan be resold twice the second owners willingness to pay  means that thefirst owner is willing to pay             Now if youre apublisher is it more attractive to collect  apiece for three books printedwith disappearing ink or to collect  for one book thats designed to lastAs long as its cheaper to produce one book than three the publisher shouldopt for permanence            Thats why economists are generally skeptical aboutallegations of planned obsolescence Every few years someone claims thatGeneral Electric knows how to make a light bulb last  years but suppressesthe technology to keep us coming back for more light bulbs Likewise AnnLanders is forever publishing columns about how pantyhose are intentionallydesigned to run so women will need a new pair every two weeks            But a woman who buys a pair of pantyhose every two weeks has demonstrated her willingness to spend a year on pantyhose If Hanes could make a pair thats guaranteed to last ayear shed buy it for  That would be a better proposition for Hanesthan having to make  pairs to collect the same revenue So the Ann Landerstheory makes no sense            Does that mean theres no such thing as plannedobsolescence No it means that planned obsolescence occurs only under specialconditions Mistrust for example is a special condition If a publisher saysBuy this book for  and youll be able to resell it next year for  astudent might well respond How do I know you wont bring out a new editionnext year and undercut my resale market Unless the publisher can quell suchdoubts students wont pay premium prices for books with lasting value sopublishers wont provide them            Students of course are in some sense a captivemarket forced to buy the books their professors assign But there mustnevertheless be some upper limit on their willingness to pay otherwisetextbooks would sell for an infinite price And whatever the upper limit is itwill always be higher for a book that can be resold than for a book thatcant            In most instances ofplanned obsolescence customers have demanded it and firms have provided it asa service Maybe youd rather not spend  on a pair of pantyhose that mightget lost at the laundry Or maybe you dont have  in your pocket right nowBy letting you buy  shoddy pairs at  apiece the manufacturer provides youwith the equivalent of either insurance against the prospect of losing yourentire years supply of hose at once or a loan by allowing you to spread outyour payments over an entire year            What brings all this to mind is the recent controversy overMonsanto Cos development of infertile seedsseeds that yield crops thatdont reproduce so that farmers have to buy new seeds each year From thefarmers point of view the opportunity to buy infertile seeds can be a greatboon Instead of paying  for seed that should last  years you pay for new seed each year which insures you against the possibility of adisastrous and expensive crop loss            Are you worried thatMonsanto would charge just as much for the infertile seeds as the fertile onesDont be Surely farmers are willing to pay much more for fertile seeds thanfor infertile and you can be sure that Monsanto fully exploits thatwillingness            Many highyield hybrid seeds are infertile though not bydesign Like mules theyre naturally infertile Taking its lead from thesoftware industry Monsanto had planned to convert this bug into a feature Butin the face of considerable public pressure Monsanto has agreed to stopdeveloping infertile seeds            Much of the opposition had nothing to do withplanned obsolescence and everything to do with concern that the Monsantosinfertility gene might leap from its seeds to fertile seeds in adjoiningfarms and eventually render those fertile strains infertile Such hypothesizedcontamination is a legitimate concern and quite plausibly a sufficient reasonto applaud Monsantos decision But an unfortunate side effect is the lostopportunity to provide some socially desirable planned obsolescence
