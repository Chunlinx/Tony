                                 Reading About Korea            I dont read the newspapersmuch anymore But the other day it seemed to me that if I wanted to participatein the lunchtable conversation at my office I would have to learn somethingabout Korea So I clipped all the articles about Korea in the three dailynewspapers that had accumulated in my apartment over  days and I readthem            I wasgreatly impressed by the volume of the reporting the diligence of thereporters the number of new facts recounted every day and the number ofexperts who had been interviewed and quoted But when I had read it all I wasleft unsatisfied I felt I didnt know what was going on and I thought thatmany readers would have the same feeling perhaps even more so than I didPerhaps I was expecting more than should have been expected or could have beenprovided I dont think so but even if Im wrong it makes one wonder what allthe reporting is for            One can read a perfectly accurate and detailedplaybyplay description of a baseball game and still not understand whathappened unless one knows the rules of baseball and something about what isordinary and what extraordinary in any particular game One has to have amental model of the sport into which one places the facts of a particular gameif one is to create a comprehensible story Probably most people who read thesports pages have such a model in mind and the sports reporter can assume thatand not have to reiterate it            But it isequally probable that few people who read the daily paper even those who readthe financial pages have a model of the international financial system inmind Without that they cannot be expected to understand the connectionbetween the bankruptcy of some Korean firms and the decline of the value of theKorean currency the won relative to the dollar why the Korean population ingeneral is suffering why unemployment should rise or why the trade deficitshould decline Most importantly they will not understand the function of theexternal funds being provided by the International Monetary Fund and somecountries or where the whole process is heading What would the end of thecrisis be            Iknow about Korea only what I read in thepapers But I would like to illustrate what I mean by the missing model bytelling a Korea story within the context of a simple model of the internationalfinancial systema model I learned at school decades ago            We startwith the proposition that in any country the excess of domestic investmentmainly expenditure on new plants equipment and housing over domestic savingthe part of the national income not spent on consumption private or publicis equal to the inflow of capital from abroad This excess in turn is equalto the excess of imports of goods and services over exports ofgoods and services This excess of imports over exports is the currentaccountdeficit a term that reporters use but rarely define            These equalities are maintained by variations of theexchange rate interest rates inflation rates and real incomes Thus ifthere are insufficient domestic savings to satisfy all highly profitableinvestment opportunities foreign capital will be attracted into the countryForeign investors will want to buy the local currency in order to invest inthe country and that will raise that currencys exchange value With a highervalue of the local currency exports from the country will be less competitiveand the export volume will decline creating or increasing the currentaccountdeficit            Thegovernment may try to keep the value of the local currency from rising bybuying foreign currencies with it To do that the government will increase thedomestic money supply in simple parlance it will print more money This inturn will either raise real inflationadjusted incomes if domesticproduction increases to meet the increased buying power of citizens or raisethe price level if more money ends up chasing the same amount of goodsEither of these effects will attract imports and discourage exports increasingthe currentaccount deficit Rising real incomes enable citizens to buy moreimports and more of the domestic product that would have been exported orattract domestic resources into producing for the home market rather than forexport A rising price level will make the countrys exports lesscompetitive            Before the crisis in  Korea had anextremely high rate of domestic savingabout  percent of total Koreanincome compared with about  percent for the United States But it had aneven higher rate of internal investment thanks to an inflow of foreigncapital So large was that inflow that Korea ran a currentaccount deficitequal to almost  percent of gross domestic product higher than in any otherindustrialized country except Poland and the Czech Republic As noted abovethis deficit was made possible by a high exchange rate for the won Theexchange rate would have been higher and the deficit larger if the governmenthad not been buying dollars with won and in the process accumulating a reserveof dollars            Towardthe end of  investment in Korea suddenly became less attractive to bothKorean savers and foreigners A number of Korean businesses went bankrupteither because of dishonest practices or because the possible Korean share ofworld markets for some products like automobiles had been overestimatedForeigners wanted not only to stop investing in Korea but also to get theirmoney out The effort to convert won into dollars and other foreign currenciesdepressed the value of the won despite the Korean governments efforts tosustain it by using its reserves The decline in the won caused furtherbankruptcies Companies that could pay their foreign debts when a dollar cost won could not pay when a dollar cost  won            The decline in the won by making imports more expensiveand exports more competitive would help bring about the decline in thecurrentaccount deficit or the generation of a surplus So one couldvisualize a postcrisis situation in which total output was unaffectedinvestment was smaller the capital inflow was smaller or negative and the wonwould reach an equilibrium level lower than it had been before the crisis            But thetransition to that situation would be painful The decline in the won would notimmediately raise exports or limit imports The cut in output and employment inthe investment sector would not be immediately offset by a rise in output andemployment in industries that produce for export or that compete with importsThe decline of the Korean economy would cause more bankruptcies increaseinvestors efforts to get out of won assets into other currencies and forcethe won down further So there could be a cumulative speculative process inwhich the won fell far below what might be its longterm equilibrium value andthe Korean economy was depressed far beyond what its postcrisis situation wouldbe            The purpose of assistance by the IMF andforeign governments is to cushion that transition and help Korea get to itspostcrisis condition The objective is to keep the won from falling much morethan is necessary for the longrun adjustment of the Korean economy andthereby to prevent unnecessary bankruptcies and unnecessary depression ofKorean income and employment The goal is not to bail out failing Koreanenterprises but to keep enterprises from failing only because of a panickyflight from the won and the fall in its value The assumption is that privateinvestors who buy and sell won are depressing its value below its equilibriumrate That assumption may or may not be correct            This may not be the onlypossible story of the Korean economy But it is a story that fits into standardeconomic analysis is coherent and understandable and reveals the interactionamong the forces at workthe kind of story I miss when I read the dailyreports
