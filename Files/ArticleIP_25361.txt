                                                            AbortFace                        What is especially enjoyable about the RepublicanPartys agony over abortion is that the leading Republican lights are almostsurely prochoice in their hearts Not Pat Buchanan and not Gary Bauer buttheyre not the ones doing the agonizing The agonizers are folks likeElizabeth Dole and George W Bush and their agony isnt moral goodness knowsIts political How to prevent the partys hardline prolife stance fromdriving millions of voters away            Dole and Bush and DanQuayle and John McCain and Steve Forbes and the rest all claim to share thehardline antiabortion view as they must in order to be leading Republicanlights in the first place But who believes them Does Liddy Dole really thinkabortion is equivalent to infanticide Is George W mourning over millions ofmurdered babies every year Not likely So they must pretend to a deep moralbelief they probably dont have then pretend to have come up with a reasonthis deep moral belief shouldnt really matter Even Bill Clinton might havetrouble executing this doublereverse flipflop fib off the high board Arelesser pols up to it            The official Republican position on abortion as expressedin the past three GOP platforms is so extreme that if it were taken seriouslyno Republican could be elected to any office except perhaps pope Fortunatelyfor the GOP few voters are aware of it fewer still understand it and thosewho do understand it assume correctly that the party doesnt really meanit            The platform reads Theunborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot beinfringed We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorselegislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendments protections apply tounborn children            The  th Amendment guarantees all persons theequal protection of the laws If the fetus is a person under the th Amendment an abortion must be treated exactly like thepremeditated killing of an adultthat is like firstdegree murder There canbe no exceptions for rape or incest And the woman who procures an abortion isguilty of murder just as if she had hired a gunman to kill her born offspringIn a death penalty stateand the Republican platform favors the death penaltynaturallyshe must pay with her life            The  platform goeson to say we have only compassion for women who procure abortions and ourprolife agenda does not include punitive action against them Which onlyshows that the platform does not even believe itself since that stuff aboutthe  th Amendment can have no other meaning            But the current Republican position is logicallyconsistent If full human life begins at conception then full human rights dotoo including the right to equal protection of the laws It is a concept thatdoes not easily lend itself to compromise as the Republican presidentialcontenders are demonstrating Their search for a way out has led most of themto two rhetorical strategies            One is the notion thelate Lee Atwater called the big tent Theres room for everybody John McCainsays about the abortion issue I believe we are an inclusive party and we canbe so without changing our principles What does this mean Does it mean thatpeople should feel free to vote Republican even if they disagree with what theRepublican Party stands for A nice offer though I wouldnt expect manytakers Or does it mean that because there are so many people to divvy up thetwo parties neednt stand for anything in particular Not a big votegettereither            Asked about abortion the other day on CNN RepublicanNational Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson also invoked what is apparently thepartyline phrase inclusive party He elaborated We want to reach out andgrow this party Were recognizing that there are differences This is ahuge country Its a continent really There are  million of us and thereare only two parties So why wouldnt we have some differences            Its surely true that itwould be suicidal for a party to demand agreement on all issues from either itscandidates or its voters The tricky question is what are the core values thatreally define you and what are the fringe issues on which differences are notcrucial Republicans would prefer not to be defined by their position onabortion But if you take it seriously the antiabortion position isdefinitive by definition How can you make the capital gains tax a litmus testissue but say that the slaughter of millions of innocent children is somethingabout which you have only a mild preference and dont care much if peopledisagree The truth is that most Republican leaders dont actually take theiralleged position on abortion seriously But they cant admit this            The other rhetorical way out for Republican politicians isto say that you yourself are as hardcore as ever but since a majority ofAmericans apparently disagrees theres no point in trying to do anything aboutit it Elizabeth Dole goes further Theres no point in even discussing itLast week she called on Republican women to set an example and refuse to bedrawn into deadend debates about something that is not going to happenGeorge W sounding like a very promising cross between his father and DanQuayle explained in March why he opposes pushing for a constitutionalamendment although he favors one himself There are a lot of Americans whodont view the abortion issue as a matter of life I do Thats one reason whyIm a prolife person            This is an imaginativeattempt to dress craven pragmatism as high principle but it makes no senseThe Republican and Democratic platforms are littered with proposals that arenot going to happen Almost nothing is going to happen if a majority mustalready favor it before any political leader will speak out in its favor Ifshe actually believed that millions of human lives were at stake the formerhead of the Red Cross surely wouldnt try to build a holy crusade aroundrefusal to discuss the matter Nor would she blame the media for an inordinatefocus on the issue            Lamar Alexanders way out is worth noting though itdoesnt rise to the level of illogic Lamar says that we should movestatebystate to change laws and culture so there will be fewer abortionsand therefore I do not support a constitutional amendment that would overturnRoe vs Wade  Well you see Lamar Roe vs Wade held that stateantiabortion laws are unconstitutional Thats what it was all aboutMaybeto give him the extreme benefit of the doubtLamar means that he favorsoverturning Roe by Supreme Court decision rather than by constitutionalamendment This is an unlikely occurrence and combined with the statebystatebusiness a rather leisurely approach if you honestly believe that theslaughter of innocents is going on daily            Finally since the subject is Republicans logicjurisprudence and advanced metaphysical speculation youre probably wonderingwhere Dan Quayle comes down Quayle agrees with everybody else that aconstitutional amendment is not going to happen But thats notimportant  The important issue is where you stand on thisimportant debate I have always been prolife In other words as long as youprofess to believe that human life begins at conception and that abortion ismurder its not important whether you actually do anything about it            This is of course a truer statement of theRepublican position on abortion than any other candidates But it is more thanthat Quayle may actually have produced a compromise in what seemed to be a warof moral absolutes Speaking if I may for the prochoice side of the debateProlifers may profess any principles they care to as long as they agree notto act on them They can actually believe what they say for all I care ThoughI doubt in the case of most Republican presidential candidates that this lastconcession will be necessary
