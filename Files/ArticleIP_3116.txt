                                 Some Genius            Leonardo da Vinci was a genius at painting nodoubt about it He invented sfumato inaugurated the High Renaissance andcreated what is arguably the cleverest composition in the history of artThe Last Supper             Was he also a genius atscience The casual visitor to the current exhibition of the CodexLeicester at the American Museum of Natural History in New York throughJan   might come away with the vague impression that he was Thecurators describe the page manuscript on loan to the museum from Bill Gateswho bought it two years ago for  million as a masterpiece of scienceOne of the catalog essayists writes that as a scientist Leonardo rates morespace in the reputable Dictionary of Scientific Biography than KeplerGalileo and Einstein combined            But Leonardo was not a genius the way Einstein or Galileowas He was more a genius the way Buckminster Fuller was if that is a way ofbeing a genius            For a couple of centuriesafter his death in  Leonardo was seen mainly as a painter albeit apreternaturally gifted one His artistic legacy comprises the Mona Lisaand  other paintings several of them unfinished together with a treatiseon painting But he had also left behind some  pages of unpublished noteson hydraulics geology anatomy flight ballistics botany optics andastronomy as well as designs for all sorts of fantastical inventions It wasnot until the time of the Industrial Revolution that his notebooks by thenscattered all over Europe were paid serious attention Soon he was beingcelebrated for his precursive genius He had beaten Newton to the theory ofgravity and Copernicus to heliocentrism He had worked out the circulation ofthe blood before William Harvey He had grasped the principle of erosion morecompletely than Georges Cuvier He had invented the airplane the tank thebicycle the modern toiletsuch are the claims that have been made forhim            What is the evidence for such deep originality in theCodex                Leicester  The manuscript itself whose pages are dimlyillumined in a series of glass cases at the museum is not at first blush afetching object You cant exactly read the thing since Leonardos jottingsare in medieval Italian and are rendered in his famous mirrorimage scriptThe hundreds of marginal drawings have some aesthetic interestespeciallythose depicting the flow of waterbut they are mainly simple geometricaldiagrams and doodles The earls of Leicester who owned the codex since seem rarely to have looked at it Nothing like three centuries of aristocraticincuriousity to keep ink and paper in nearperfect condition commented onewag Between the Leicesters and Bill Gates the notebook was owned for a dozenor so years by Armand Hammerwho with his unerring flair for the ludicrousinsisted it be called the Codex Hammer and claimed that he had retaineda squad of elite commandos trained in kung fu and armed with Uzis to guard itround the clock            Looking at the Englishtranslation of the codex on a CDROM at the exhibit I saw that what began asan attempt by Leonardo to set down the first principles of the behavior ofwater ended up as a farrago of observations and musingsfanciful insightfulanalytically maddening At one point for example he notes that the higher acolumn of water the greater the pressure it exertsa valid if unexcitingconclusion But elsewhere in the codex he maintains that only movingwater produces pressure at the bottom reasoning that the still water of apond after all does not press down the grasses that grow on the bottom Notonly is this breathtakingly wrongheaded it contradicts the previousprinciple            Leonardos greatest shortcoming as a scientific thinkerwas not paradoxically his greatest strength as an artist his eye This forhim was the ultimate epistemic instrument one to be trusted over allclassical authorities Do you not see that the eye embraces the beauty of thewhole world he wrote insisting that the visual eye was preeminently thereal It is Leonardos sheer ability to see to notice in a way that noone had before precisely what it looks like when two streams of watermergethat accounts for the thrilling bits of the Codex               Leicester             The problem was thatLeonardo knew very little mathematics Algebra was a closed book to him and hewas poor at figures When he writes Let no one read me who is not amathematician he is using the term loosely to suggest a rigorous cast ofmind His ocular observations were in a qualitative vein hearkening back toAristotelian science rather than forward to Newton That is fine when it comessay to anatomyin which Leonardo was also wellserved by his willingness tothrust his nicely manicured hands into the guts of dead felons he wasdissecting But its disastrous in dynamics where his experiments led him toconclude that both the velocity of a falling object and the distance fallen areproportional to the time of the fallwhich a moments reflection exposes as alogical absurdity The only other figure I can think of who had similar claimsto genius both in art and science Goethe was also a mathematical innocentBut where Leonardo had a keen respect for mathematics Goethe was openlycontemptuous of it The true precursor of the scientific revolution wasGalileo who proclaimed with almost mystical conviction that the Book ofNature was written in the language of mathematics            As for Leonardos inventions those that were sound froman engineering point of view were usually borrowed from contemporaries Hiselaborate hoists and cranes were designed by Brunelleschi his engines of warby the German engineer Konrad Keyser his automobile by the Sienese Francescodi Giorgio Martini On the other hand a device described in the CodexLeicester that the exhibition catalogue notes sounds curiously similarto a modern espresso machine seems entirely original Leonardos flyingmachine would not have flown but that hardly counts against its visualbravura one version resembled a calabash shell crossed with a windmill andanother a fourwinged butterfly Leonardo was a man who according to onebiographer was plunged into a kind of ecstasy by devising neverendingsystems of cogwheels and screwsrather like Buckminster Fuller deliriouslymultiplying geodesics            If there was a bit of Fuller in Leonardo there wasalso a bit of Liberace in this theatrical highliving dandy who favoredbrocade doublets and bad boys with pretty faces Since his disciples werechosen for their looks he had no distinguished successors Little ofLeonardos weirdness is conveyed by the Codex                Leicesterexhibitthough Isabella Rosellinis bluevelveteen voice narrating theexhibits eightminute

destruction in a universal deluge Leonardos obsession withswirling waterwhich found scientific expression in the Codex               Leicester and sublime artistic expression in the drawings he did towardthe end of his lifecould be pretty morbid
