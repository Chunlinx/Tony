                                 TV Ratings and Sweeps            Spring brings the debut ofepically expensive madeforTV movies Last May NBC gave us The Odyssey million On Sunday the same network will air Merlin million These television events are part of the hype that is sweeps Duringthe sweep months February late Aprilearly May and November network execspack their prime time lineups with the shows they are convinced will reap thehighest ratings of the year Inflated sweep months ratings are in turn usedto set advertising rates for the rest of the rerunriddled year Are sweeps asbig a scam as they seem And what exactly are ratings            To trackviewership networks both broadcast and cable regularly keep tabs on threestatistics  Ratings  the percentage of the total households with TVsets tuned in to a show Because there are about  million households withsets reports dutifully note that each ratings point is equal to viewers Cable networks receive another set of figures based on the number ofhouseholds wired to receive them  Shares  the percentage of setsturned on that are tuned in to a show  Demos short fordemographics numbers breaking out the age and sex of viewers            Seven broadcast networks and  cable networks paysubstantial annual fees to the AC Nielsen company to have these numberstracked Every morning Nielsen compiles the overnights the ratingsshares and demos for the previous nights programs extrapolated from resultssent in by the People Meters wired to  TV sets These householdsare randomly selected but supposedly represent a crosssection of viewersEvery  minutes the People Meters small black boxes containing a tinycomputer linked to a modem register whether a set is turned on and if so thechannel to which it is tuned Attached to the box is a remotecontrollikedevice with buttons that viewers push to register their age and sex each timethey watch television            There is areason only  people consent to take part in this programits a pain Itrequires that your home get wired another ugly box in your living roomholes drilled in wallsand that you constantly push buttons But as a rewardNielsen families get to pick a prize from a catalogue or receive a  a monthstipend The incentives apparently work Nielsen estimates that  of theselected households provide data each night Worried about viewer fatigueNielsen has ruled that households participate for only two years            The People Meters dont provide statisticallyvalid data on most  out of  TV markets Thus the need for sweepsDuring sweep months Nielsen sends out diaries  to  householdsacross all these markets In these diaries viewers log entries every minutes for what they watch The affiliates use these numbers to set ad ratesNational networks sell ads based on averages of the overnight numbers            Throughthe mids networks tied ad prices strictly to ratings But with the rise ofcable and the proliferation of networks networks lost their leverage tocontrol prices Ratings now only provide networks a jumpingoff point in theirnegotiations with ad agencies In addition advertising has grown moresophisticated targeting specific demographic groups This can createunexpected results CBS for example frequently wins the highest ratings Butbecause it has more viewers who are senior citizenssupposedly the stingiestdemoCBS brings in lower advertising revenue and frequently runs in the redOn the other hand the WB and UPN networks with abysmal ratings areconsidered comers because of their success with youtha prized demo            Many network execs grouch that the Nielsens arentreliable  Some networks have flirted with funding a service to compete withNielsen The biggest beefs are that the Nielsen numbers  depend on peopleshonesty and initiativefilling out diaries punching buttons etc read                  Slate               s My Life as a Nielsen Family for the confessions of one anonymousfudger of a Nielsen diary  dont cover a truly representative samplecollege dorms prisons and AfricanAmerican homes are all said to be eitherunderrepresented or excluded from the survey  fluctuate wildlyFoxofficials for instance gripe that ratings for Beverly Hills yoyo as much as  percent week to week and  measure minute intervalswhich is detrimental to networks such as CNN that viewers usually watch foreven smaller chunks of time            Thenetworks sweeps tactics however take even more heat Critics say that sweepscause networks to expend the bulk of their resources pulling out all thestops for these three months rather than spreading them around the yearThe result The cashstrapped networks are forced to air too many blooper showsand reruns in nonsweep months turning people off network TV Others complainthat during sweeps local affiliates compete by injecting even morecarnivalesque antics into local news Stunts pulled include cash giveawaysprofiles of the Nielsen families and tabloid lead stories And advertisers ofcourse complain that sweep months artificially inflate the amounts they payfor spots            So if everyones unhappy with the system whydoes it persist Some TV execs say their industry is reactionary Even if theNielsens are inaccuratethe stated margin of error hovers between  percentand  percent but some say its largerthe industry will never muster thewill to replace them And Nielsen which now enjoys a monopoly on the TVratings business its major competitors Arbitron and ARB having beenbeaten out of the ratings businesshas little incentive to innovate Itstechnology is supposedly a
