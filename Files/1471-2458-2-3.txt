                    Background        Health information systems HIS provide a scientific        and technological framework to gather manage and        interpret data to inform the public policymakers        administrators and healthcare workers about the        distribution and determinants of health conditions        Further they can and should guide and measure the impact        of interventions     Public health surveillance  a        subset of HIS  has been defined as         the ongoing systematic collection        analysis and interpretation of outcomespecific data for        use in the planning implementation and evaluation of        public health practice     Public health        surveillance can be used to  assess the overall health        status of a population  describe the natural history of        disease  monitor disease trends  detect epidemics         evaluate the effect of prevention and control measures         generate hypotheses and  facilitate epidemiologic and        laboratory research            Before  the Soviet Union centrally planned the        infectious diseases surveillance systems IDSS of its         republics Approximately  million persons were covered        under the IDSS Central monetary and technical support for        the IDSS ended in  As a result the republics have        struggled to maintain their respective IDSS The former        Soviet Union FSUwide diphtheria outbreak in the s           and the reemergence of malaria in Tadjikistan in            and in Armenia    and Azerbaijan    in         indicated that financial constraints resulting in the        disruption of public health infrastructure and services had        increased the risk of the reemergence of infectious        diseases            After  this transition to nationalism        privatization and social reorganization posed new        challenges to each republic of the FSU The loss of        centralized training public health expertise and        resources especially impacted the surveillance systems in        each republic    Further privatization of the FSU        medical systems resulted in underbudgeted public health        services and inadequately paid personnel     Combined        with these infrastructure problems the increased        population migration  both within the FSU and        internationally  contributed to morbidity and mortality        through population dislocation     This has increased        the risk of exposure to reemerging microbial and        environmental pathogens and limited access to health        services and good nutrition             The most important of these changes was the financial        crises resulting from the severance of economic ties among        all republics of the FSU Public health officials were        challenged to transform the bulky statesponsored IDSS        With high inflation and unemployment they also suffered        from shortages of vaccines hospital supplies and        essential drugs Provision of basic public health services        were compromised including repairing antiquated water and        sewer systems resulting in increased risk for        gastroenteritis and infections with hepatitis A            the largest documented outbreak of typhoid in this century        occurred in Tajikistan in February      Practices        such as reusing syringes during vaccination and poor        sterilization procedures during dentistry have contributed        to nosocomial outbreaks of HIV and a high prevalence of        infections with hepatitis B            The objective of this work was to assess the current        status and functioning of various IDSS so as to guide        reform efforts At the invitation of seven Ministries of        Health MoHs we performed assessments in the Russian        Federation and in the Republics of Kazakhstan Tadjikistan        Uzbekistan Turkmenistan and Armenia and in the Kyrgyz        Republic We found striking homogeneity in comparing the        IDSS from one republic to another and for clarity we        present here representative findings by using the Armenian        component of the IDSS AIDSS as a prototype                    Discussion                  Description of the AIDSS          A republic of  million Armenia gained its          independence from the FSU on September   Figure           The country is divided into  regions which are          subdivided into  districts Figure  Responsibility          for the AIDSS rests with the Department of Hygiene and          Epidemiologic Surveillance  a department of the Armenian          MoH AMoH  composed of  functional units known as the          Sanitary Epidemiologic Service SES The units or          stations of the SES parallel the geopolitical divisions          of Armenia There exists one SES station in each          district Each city has one SES station except Yerevan          the capital Yerevan has eight districts each with one          SES station The national SES is also located in          Yerevan          The SES           per se developed from a model          created in the late s in russia and uniformly          developed over many years in the republics of the FSU          Its principle functions are to collect and analyze public          health surveillance data and to implement and enforce          strategies for the prevention and control of infectious          diseases Traditionally the SES had approximately  of          the entire medical personpower and budget of the AMoH          and was separate from the curative medical care system               The SES was staffed by epidemiologists          physicians microbiologists sanitary hygienists and          other health workers paramedics and physician          assistants The district SES was the basic public health          unit that monitored infectious diseases investigated          outbreaks attended to child and adolescent health          inspected the foodservice industry monitored water          purity and dealt with occupational and environmental          health problems throughout Armenia     City          regional and nationallevel SES administrations were          larger with specialized staff          The SES collected infectious diseases data from all          healthcare facilities throughout the country Before           Armenia had a comprehensive and free healthcare          delivery system accessible to all citizens with health          facilities and healthcare workers employed under the          auspices of the AMoH Outpatient facilities village          health centers and polyclinics and hospitals reported to          the AIDSS Each district had  village health          centers two polyclinics and one hospital The seven          cities in Armenia had variable numbers of polyclinics and          hospitals          Altogether Armenia had  village health centers           polyclinics and  hospitals Figure  Data from          these health facilities were reported to the  districts          and city SES and then to the national SES which          forwarded aggregated data to the Department of Hygiene          and Epidemiologic Surveillance in the AMoH                          Objectives and Data Collection Reporting          Analyses and Response          The objectives of the AIDSS were to identify cases of          infectious diseases document outbreaks and monitor          trends in disease occurrence It collected aggregated and          casebased data on new cases of  infectious diseases          This list included some diseases with low pathogenicity          eg pediculosis and scabies and some diseases with          inadequate or nonexistent preventive measures eg          infectious mononucleosis and parapertussis There          existed no tiered eg confirmed probable and          suspected standardized case definitions The reporting          of confirmed or suspected cases of some infectious          diseases required immediate reporting via telephone or in          person within  hours These included epidemic prone          diseases eg diphtheria polio plague          Data were provided monthly and yearly from the          district to national SES Reports from the national SES          were sent monthly to the AMoH and the other  republics          of the FSU and back to the district SES twice a year The          district and city SES reported immediately to the          national SES          At all levels epidemiologists used descriptive          statistics for data analyses These included the          calculation of aggregated case numbers and incidence and          prevalence rates based on estimates of the population          size provided by the state agency charged with gathering          census data limited stratification by person time and          place and the assessment of trends Epidemiologists did          not use analytic methods to assess risk factors for          diseases even though they were collected          Cases and contacts of every disease were investigated          by a district or city SES epidemiologist within  hours          of the receipt of the case report using a standardized          form known as the           epid carta This form was not          disease specific yet lengthy  questions many of          which required subjective responses Little or no          feedback was provided to the original reporting sources          and no routine or formal sharing of data and information          occurred between the district SES and healthcare          facilities Table summarizes the public health practice          activities in Armenia stratified by health facility                          Qualitative Attributes                      Simplicity            Referring to both its structure and ease of            operation the AIDSS was complex Epidemiologists            gathered voluminous information on each case parallel            vertical public health programs reported duplicative            information much time was required to collect            register and report case information and many staff            maintained the system                                Flexibility and Acceptability            Addressing the extent to which the AIDSS could adapt            to changing information needs or operating conditions            and reflecting the willingness of participants to            provide information and monitor the system the AMoH            itself determined both its flexibility and            acceptability Because the AMoH provided salaries for            healthcare personnel it could enforce compulsory            reporting through monetary fines and professional            demotions Changes in reportable conditions or criteria            were made rapidly because administrative SES employees            carried out orders quickly and completely at all levels            in the system                                    Quantitative Attributes                      Sensitivity            Assessing the AIDSSs ability to account for all            incidents of a disease ie the proportion of cases            detected correctly diagnosed and reported we            learned that detection of most reportable infectious            conditions did come to medical attention This was            enhanced because all citizens received free health care            and because primary care physicians were responsible            for care including community outreach of persons in            their assigned territories However due to constrained            resources laboratory confirmation of reportable            infectious diseases was limited in practice As such            reporting was based on clinical or epidemiologic            rather than laboratory information                                Predictive Value Positive            The likelihood that a disease report constituted a            true case of that disease was diminished because of the            lack of laboratory confirmation and standardized case            definitions                                Representativeness            We felt that ideally the AIDSS accurately            described the distribution of diseases in the            population by person time and place because disease            reporting was mandatory and failure to report was a            punishable offense And because of the penalties all            official reporting to the national level did occur on a            monthly basis However it was common practice for            epidemiologists to conceal cases of infectious disease            and willfully underreport epidemic morbidity because            outbreaks meant that the epidemiologists were not            performing their duties of preventing and controlling            infectious diseases This paradox resulted in            epidemiologists managing two sets of information one            officially reported to higherups and one unofficially            kept with more accurate numerators                                Timeliness            Information for action or for longterm planning was            available because mandatory reporting to the SES within             hours of diagnosis for most conditions under            surveillance allowed rapid implementation of control            and prevention measures                                Costs            Because budgets were relatively nonexistent in the            FSU historical data on the costs of operating the            AIDSS were not available In the FSU centrally planned            economy resources were obtained from cost centers            eg utilities were not metered office supplies were            requested by quantity and not cost and salaries were            provided from the central budget However numerous            observations led us to conclude that the AIDSS was            relatively inefficient and costly in large part            because the expenditure was paid from the public            sector            The AIDSS was labor intensive Being paperdriven            reporting dieases for which no practical public health            interventions exist misallocated scarce resources            Other common public health activities with high            opportunity cost in the AIDSS were indiscriminate            disinfection of homes and work sites Environmental            background monitoring practices by district and            regional SES included routine collection of specimens            and laboratory testing eg air and water samples            food products and items that children may come in            contact with such as toys or eating utensils in            addition to evaluation of physical factors noise            vibration microclimate electromagnetic fields levels            of lighting and ionic radiation at several sites            eg work places and daycare centers            When cases of hepatitis A acute gastroenteritis            tuberculosis diphtheria or pediculosis were reported            disinfection of homes schools daycare centers and            work places was conducted by public health workers who            used chloramine application and steam cleaning of all            hard surfaces and laundering of all clothing and            bedding materials The effectiveness of such            disinfection practices or environmental background            monitoring has not been documented and is likely of            doubtful public health utility            During disease outbreaks it was common practice to            investigate every case and culture all available            materials and decontamination efforts were instituted            regardless of epidemiologic evidence It was common            practice to hospitalize children   year of age            with pneumonia for  days and children of all ages            with acute gastroenteritis for  days It was also            common to hospitalize both adults and children with            hepatitis A for  days with syphilis for two weeks            with gonorrhea for three weeks and with tuberculosis            for one year These isolation practices meant to            prevent disease transmission to the community were            consequences of central planning in which emphasis was            placed on input indicators such as the occupancy rates            of hospitals Incentives budget allocations placed on            input rather than output measures led to a level of            medical infrastructure that has been difficult to            maintain given current levels of funding available for            the health sector            Because financial issues were a major driving            factor cost analyses of surveillance practices and            control measures could identify areas for costsavings            Analyses of the surveillance system in Ukraine using             budget figures revealed that excessive culturing            represented  of the cost             per capita expenditure of the            Lviv Regional SES and disinfection procedures            accounted for almost  of the entire Pustomity            District SESs budget V CarandeKulis CDC personal            communication                                    Recommendations                      Data Collection

 that were initiated in December  through a          cooperative project among the AMoH United States Agency          for International Development USAID and CDC This          project provided technical and material assistance toward          reform of the Armenian HIS The approach focused on          training a cohort of public health officials and          epidemiologists in the modern aspects of epidemiology          biostatistics surveillance techniques and scientific          communications developing Armeniaspecific case          definitions facilitating HIS reform strategies through          workshops and training sessions and developing the          capacity to publish an epidemiologic bulletin          Since  this HIS reform activity has been          selfsustained with no additional monetary support from          USAID     In  the AMoH created a national HIS          program for the development and reform of the HIS and the          Armenian National Health AnalyticInformation Centre              The system has been transformed into a comprehensive          HIS and includes chronic diseases maternal and child          health and injury data Diseases are now categorized by          a threetiered approach disease elimination eg          polio casebased eg diphtheria and indicatorbased          eg number of children immunized by two years of

centers equipped with computers and faxes have          been organized for the collection analyses and          reporting of health information National and regional          public health bulletins are being published monthly in          three languages  Armenian Russian and English  and          distributed to wide audiences Tiered standardized case          definitions and essential health indicators for          decisionmaking at the clinic and community level have          been developed and disseminated These include health          status performance and resource indicators          Comprehensive HIS reform is critical throughout the          FSU Timely accurate and relevant health information          are necessary to assess the burden of disease and          disability

all sources of          data into one comprehensive HIS prevents duplicate          recording and reporting across services and programs          averts laborwasting inefficiencies and saves scarce          resources          A comprehensive HIS includes the capacity to obtain          data from vital registries clinical administrative and          other records from provider and populationbased surveys          and sentinel systems for infectious and chronic diseases          and disabilities and maternal and child health          nutrition and program implementation indicators          including access coverage and service quality              This reform activity should include the development of an          indicator monitoring system based on selected essential          actionoriented indicators of health status service          performance and resources that can be used for          decisionmaking at the local level                            Summary        We found the AIDSS to be a complex and sensitive yet        costly and inefficient surveillance system for infectious        diseases Despite the lack of standardized case        definitions feedback of information and computer        technology it functioned fairly well before  However        the functioning and continuation of the AIDSS has been        affected both directly and indirectly by events of the past        decade        Overall the former AIDSS was useful because it detected        cases of infectious diseases estimated morbidity        monitored trends in disease occurrence and documented        outbreaks The comprehensive nocost healthcare delivery        system and compulsory reporting of diseases to the AMoH        enhanced its flexibility representativeness and        timeliness The strengths of the AIDSS stemmed from the        large numbers of health facilities and trained personnel        and the separation of preventive from curative medicine        that secured an independent status including separate        budget for preventive medicine and public health        practitioners        The AIDSS also had weaknesses Though the system        meticulously tracked persons from birth to death very        few of these data were computerized analyzed or used to        develop direct or evaluate public health policy In most        cases when used data guided regulation and punishment        rather than public health decisionmaking Simply put data        were used to fix blame and punish rather than to find and        implement effective interventions        Epidemiologists were motivated to perform actions that        both pleased their supervisors and avoided the punishment        of monetary loss or demotion For example it was common        practice for epidemiologists to hide select cases of        infectious disease and willfully underreport epidemic        morbidity because outbreaks meant that the epidemiologists        were not performing their duties of preventing and        controlling infectious diseases These disincentives to        thoroughness and honesty resulted in surveillance data and        reports that did not reflect true incidence and prevalence        of disease circumstances needs responses or impacts                   Because the AIDSS was but a component of the systems        designed for the entire FSU the AIDSS did not address        Armeniaspecific needs Further because of the lack of        tiered standardized case definitions there existed a        potential for misclassification of diseases Lack of        feedback to reporting sources hampered improvements in        clinical practice Monitoring conditions for which there        were no practical public health interventions the        multitiered and duplicative reporting processes and the        use of expensive and indirect monitoring and control        measures such as excessive culturing disinfection and        prolonged hospitalization led to waste of resources As a        result the system did not guide control measures optimally        nor use resources efficiently        As the republics of the FSU embrace various aspects of        democratization improvement of public health surveillance        systems such as the IDSS should be a goal if decision        makers are to use credible data for informed public
