Oprah fromthe top spot in nationwide talk show ratings Springer is now watched bynearly  million Americans every day more than twice as many as a year agoJerry Springer Too Hot for TV  a video compilation of the shows worstmoments has won a cult following and sold  copies by mail order EvenSpringers bad news is good news Two weeks ago Sens Dan Coats RInd andJoseph Lieberman DConn demanded the feds stop funding Springer sclosed captioning calling the show the closest thing to pornography onbroadcast television Activists for free speech and the deaf rose toSpringers defense Its always good business to be censored            This isan era of aggressively nice talk shows Oprah has abandoned sleaze forselfesteem Rosie ODonnell has never met a guest she could not drown inslobber But the Jerry Springer Show is unrepentantly vicious Itsdedicated to strife and misery to the principles that human frailty should beridiculed that the weak and the stupid should be humiliated and that there isno better cure for your problems than the sorrows of others On Springersshow men learn their girlfriends are actually boys wives learn their husbandsare sleeping with their sisters or exwives or both women learn that theiryearold daughters are strippers or their yearold mothers are whoresfat people are poked and prodded and berated Springer is an endlessparade of losers perverts and exhibitionists            What makes Springer a TV landmark is not itsguests though they are the saddest rabble in the mediums historybut itsviolence Jerry seeks out guests who are too confused and too angry to addresstheir problems rationally and too inarticulate to address them verbally Othershows excise fighting and profanity Springer promotes it Theaudiencemostly wellgroomed collegeage kidsscreams for blood When oneepisode of Geraldo erupted in a brawl in  it made national newsSpringer has brawls every day and more reallife violence than any showon television On the episode I watched last night Tell Her Its Over therewere eight separate fights There was also so much cursing that entire segmentswere incomprehensible theyre bleeped out Most talk shows maintain at leastthe pretense of reasoned discussion not Springer  The closest it getsto debate is a robed KKK moron assaulting a black guest as in this clip fromToo Hot for TV             Springerhimself presides oleaginously over this spectacle Hes sometimes funnyoften smarmy and always condescending He brings the dry tinder and lights thematch but hes always shocked shocked  when a fire breaks out Ifguests swear he tuttuts them If they fightwhich is exactly what thehost and his producers want them to do exactly why they have burly bouncers atthe ready exactly what ratings depend onhe admonishes them to controlthemselves A lecture from the devil            Its no mystery why Springer is ontelevision A talk show is cheap to produceonefourth the cost of a newsshow onetenth the cost of a dramaand immensely profitable As forSpringer s grotesque contentwell someone will always push theenvelope of good taste And Springer is riveting excruciatingtelevision It is unbearable to watch but impossible to turn off You know Iknow the audience knows he knows No good can come of exposing these horribleproblems to the world yet its impossible not to watch it happen As NewYork Times media critic Bill Carter put it Jerry Springer does not haveviewers he has rubberneckers            So thequestion is not Why is Springer on television It is Why is Springeron television How did Springer with his dogooding rsum end up here Thechild of Holocaust survivors he earned a law degree at NorthwesternUniversity then became a campaign adviser to Robert F Kennedy in Springer settled in Cincinnati lost a race for Congress in  and waselected to the city council a year later He was only  He became a popularoutspoken lefty leaderhis first action was to propose a ban on the draftingof Cincinnati residents for the Vietnam War He resigned in  when he wasfingered in a vice investigationhe had paid a prostitute with a check duhBut a year later he ran for council again and won In  he was electedCincinnatis mayor Springer was an oldfashioned taxandspend liberal He wasa beloved figure around town the smart young thing of Ohio politics He evenread the New Republic             After a failed run for Ohio governor Springer jumped totelevision He delivered short commentaries at the end of local newsbroadcasts He was brilliant The minieditorials were concise witty and warmHe took over the news desk and soon became Cincinnatis most popular anchor In he launched his own talk show It was responsible and dull As ratingssagged in  Springer had a change of heart Backed by a producer whodworked at the Weekly World News  he went tabloid The  JennyJones Show related chagrined the rest of the talk show world but Springerfilled the sleaze vacuum Hes descended the moral food chainlawyerpolitician TV journalist TV talk show hostand climbed the incomeladder            During his slide into HadesSpringers liberalism has degenerated into a kind of nihilism If aconservative is a liberal who has been mugged a nihilist is a liberal who ispaid  million a year to do something revolting Springer makes several tepidattempts to justify Springer             It gives voice todisenfranchised folks who would be ignored otherwise            Guests are not exploitedbecause they are             The show shouldnt becriticized for presenting disgusting behavior because television doesntcreate values it only reflects them Click below for his unctuous commentaryon this                           Springer actually teaches moral lessons Bad guestseg wifebeatersare booed Springer himself closes each episode with a FinalThought a sermonette that makes it clear how little he thinks of hisguests            Springers excuses are halfhearted not tomention contradictoryits not consistent to say that television doesntcreate values then lecture your audience about values            Butmostly Springer doesnt bother with justifications He smiles and admits thetruth about the Jerry Springer Show  Its stupid human tricks Itsall stupid Were all idiots Its bubble gum He has said that kidsshouldnt watch it and that he himself has never watched it            Most articles about Springer describe this badmouthing asselfeffacement But its not Its more like selfloathing Once upon atime Springer was an idealist He hoped to change the world through politicsto lead Ohio out of a recession He cast himself as onair adviser to half amillion Cincinnati TV viewers Now he is the ringleader of a circus of moronsthe host of a TV show he doesnt like and doesnt believe in            Springer hopes to redeemhimself but its a lost cause He wants to be a political science professorwhen his contract runs out in  Imagine that Jerry Springer professor ofpolitical theory and teen hookers Last year Jerry attempted a return to thestraight world A Chicago TV station hired him to deliver the kind ofcommentary that made him so beloved in Cincinnati a decade ago But thestations anchor and chief correspondent chose to resign rather than share airtime with Springer He delivered only two commentariesone a bitter rantagainst elitists who condemned himbefore the public outcry drove him toquit He slunk back to his rabblethe losers pervs and exhibitioniststheonly folks who might still listen to his advice
