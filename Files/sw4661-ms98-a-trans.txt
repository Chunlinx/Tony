        have you any wisdom to offer someone picking a college     oh well i think i think the biggest thing thats important is to is to learn enough about the student to match the student well to the to the school and one thing i learned i went undergraduate to Harvard and then came out to Berkeley and its pretty clear that there are some people who thrive at Berkeley uh and there are some people who who just die here because of the the amount of support thats given and the amount of uh bureaucracy you have to deal with and other things like that   are are you saying that that theres more bureaucracy et cetera at out in California at that particular school   uh in a large public school i think in general   ah   and uh this is a school with some thirty thousand students and it is set up in such a fashion that students register for classes months in advance and if they dont get them they may not get a chance to take them that year um average graduation has crept up closer and closer to five years largely because of the number of students who cant get all of the courses to fulfill their major on time uh on the hand this is   that seems so wasteful   it is and and its happening in in a lot of public schools uh because of of budget cuts but on the other hand what it does provide is is for the um for students who who need a chance to be forced to fend for themselves uh who have perhaps been too isolated this is a a case where theyre theyre forced to do that and and my wife went here as an undergraduate she had been sort of protected right through high school and and had to learn to to make it on her own and she graduated from the place in four years by learning to be smart and picking courses that uh at the right times and right priorities and i can see that as advantageous but there are a lot of people for whom this is just a waste of time   hum that its interesting youre approaching it from the  sort of administrating your education just you know trying to get the class and be there i was thinking in terms of um how would you advise a kid uh on how to pick his future career i i have a son whose a freshman in high school   umhum   and he hasnt got a clue you know what he wants to do you know hes good in math and science and hell you know   umhum   uh his stepdads an engineer his fathers an accountant you know he hell probably lean toward some kind of math or science kind of thing but hes not sure what i myself graduated with an undergraduate and a Masters in art   umhum umhum   and i did it because its just something i love to do and i felt that im not im not a Picasso so i guess ill teach and i kind of backed myself into a career that i never ended up really using i mean now that im raising my kids im substitute teaching because the hours are so good et cetera   umhum umhum   but i had never given that much thought to whether i actually liked to teach you know it just seemed that well thats a practical thing you can do with art so you might as well do it   right   and i guess my advice to uh kids approaching college would first of all do something practical because the art for me um didnt work out very practically i got out of school when the Vietnam draft evasion was going on and everybody wanted to be a teacher there were no jobs and i ended up taking a secretarial school summer class for graduate college graduates which it struck me as so sad   just just to be able to find a job that you would qualify for   so sad you know theres a whole bunch of college graduates who are learning how to type just to be able to to make some money   yeah well   and um   i i think one of the reasons that i dont see that as as much of a problem see i would encourage people to go into college not knowing what they want to do because so many of the high schools have done such a bad job at introducing different areas   hum   that it may be that what you want to do and it may be a very practical thing to go into doesnt seem attractive because what youve learned of it so far is is not interesting a lot of people are turned off from math because of high school math and going to a school that offers a lot of choice and taking your first year or two to explore what the choices are still gives you plenty of time and   to pick so you youre suggesting some liberal arts program where you take a smattering of everything   and then eventually focus on a single major i certainly wouldnt say to go to a liberal arts school that doesnt have a strong science program   umhum   uh and id even encourage a liberal arts school with an engineering program but i tend to look i dont like what i see from the students who are graduating here with engineering degrees where seventy five or eighty percent of their time is spent in a prearranged technical curriculum   umhum   and they are moving here towards a program where they have a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Science combined where you get a general education with guaranteed admission into an engineering degree for a Masters degree   oh that   and that seems like a good compromise its
