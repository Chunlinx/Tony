                                 High and Mighty            Theres a new It Girl ontelevision these daysa pale sexy raccooneyed waif who looks like anadvertisement for shooting heroin The twist The commercial is an ad fornot shooting heroin The waif smashes china and plumbing fixtures in thecommercial screaming angrily about how heroin will ruin your life            The waif spot is one of aseries of new antidrug commercials that the government will pay  billion toair over the next five years The ads are produced by the Partnership for aDrugFree Americathe best funded and best connected propaganda machine inAmerica today Its backed by the president the speaker of the House bothparties in Congress the biggest of big corporations and foundations theadvertising industry and the major media            Theslickness and pervasiveness of the campaign conceals one flaw Themessagethat all drug use leads to disasteris a baldfaced lie            Founded in  by a group of advertising execs the PDFAsstated goal is to produce and place ads that persuade kids not to try drugs todenormalize adult drug use and to make drug use less acceptable Itslatest TV adscreated pro bono by leading ad agencieswill saturate primetime this year thanks to a budget in excess of what Nike or Sprint spent on TVadvertising in  The PDFA once relied on donated airtime but in theseflush days network time is at a premium hence the requisition of taxpayersfunds The budget dwarfs even the public service ad campaign run during WorldWar II in support of the war effort            The ads focus solely on kidsIn addition to the waif ad is one that depicts a little girl answeringquestions Lesson Her mother has told her not to talk to strangers but hasnttold her drugs are bad In another ad a father and son sit at the breakfasttable in silence Lesson This time could have been spent talking about howdrugs are bad            Some haveattacked the efficacy of these ads Indeed no study conclusively demonstratesa link between them and reduced drug use Few have slammed the hypocrisy of thepoliticians and the ad agency staffers behind this campaign who cant all bedrug virgins But the greater scandal is the free pass that reporters most ofwhom have imbibed have granted the PDFAs propaganda blitz The loneexception is the New York Times  Frank Rich            Lets be clear Drugs can be awful They candestroy lives But for every person who has died or ended up in a guttermillions have dabbled in drugs and still led productive sane successfullives This is indisputable In fact some longterm drug use can beharmlessand yes even kind of fun But the PDFA model offers only thesalvation of abstinence or the perdition of addiction The PDFAs Web site suggests youtell your kids marijuana is a bad drug that can hurt your body            Whileits true that marijuana smoke like tobacco smoke contains carcinogens andthe medical data suggest it compromises the immune system and can also lead toshortterm memory loss honesty demands that the silent dad in the PDFA adadmit to his son that he smoked a good deal of pot when he was young stilloccasionally lights up at parties and has turned out just fine            Instead the PDFA insists on using your tax dollars to lieto your kids Should teens hate and fear a friendly welladjusted responsibleclassmate who occasionally rolls a spliff Should the culture denormalizesomeone who does good work in a steady job hurts no one and once in a bluemoon sniffs some blow at a club Are you on a hellbound train if you takemushrooms Is all drug use drug abuse The PDFA tells your kids yes when thecorrect answer is no            Perhapsthe most shameful thing about the PDFA propaganda campaign is that its leadersknow better having used drugs themselves Bill Didnt Inhale Clinton NewtGingrich and Al Gore have all admitted to having tried drugs in their earlydays How can they tell kids pot is an evil gateway drug when theyre stellarproof that it isnt            To succeed a propaganda campaign need notconvince its audience it need merely suck the oxygen out of the lungs of itsfoes Prior to its alliance with the government the PDFA merely hogged thedrug debate Now it stands to monopolize it thanks to its ad dollars and itsfriends in the media July  PBSs The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ranwithout comment all the PDFAs new ads The Robert Wood Johnson Foundationresponsible for  percent of the PDFAs funding also donated over  toPBS last year Media luminaries from ABC News anchor Peter Jennings toWashington Post Co mogul Katharine Graham have supported the PDFA since itsinception The editorial side of Grahams Post has only compliments forthe PDFA while the advertising side has donated ad space to it Thepaternalism of the PDFAs campaign has sunk in at major newsrooms Click tofind out more            We donttrust Madison Avenue to tell us the truth about fabric softener so why are weletting it brainwash our children about drugs Indeed if the PDFA had a shredof integrity its ads would be battling alcohol and tobacco Americas two mostinjurious drugs and the two most popular among teens The PDFA no longer takesmoney from Philip Morris RJR Reynolds and AnheuserBusch or other booze andsmokes companies but even so the alcohol connection remainsMargeotesFertitta and Partners which created the waif spot also designsStolichnaya vodka ads            In a rational world the Republicans who decry theantitobacco campaign as another appendage of the nanny state would see throughthe PDFA campaign and reiterate their belief that Americans can be trusted tomake informed choices For instance contrary to what the raccooneyed waifsuggests many heroin users are able to use their drugs and conduct functionallives What makes heroin users life so crazy is that their dependence on anillegal drug forces them to enter a criminal underworld The PDFA ignores thesesubtleties Likewise with cocaine Most of the  million Americans whovetried it have had no trouble walking away from it And pot No one hasever overdosed            Byconfusing propaganda with education the PDFA stands to reap the whirlwind Wedont lie to kids about alcohol Everyone knows from an early age what it candoand that most people can handle liquor but some people cant Eventuallykids see through the drug hysteria usually by the time they turn  or  andstart observing drug users for themselves When they discover theyve been liedto they stop trusting the liartheir parents or teachers or TVcommercialsand start trusting their peers Whatever real opportunity we haveto reach them vanishes Simply letting kids know what the real risks arewithout hyperbole should be enough Madison Avenue propaganda iscounterproductive                           If you missed the linkin the
