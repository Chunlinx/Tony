                                 PIs the quotSensationquot Art Worth the FussP            DearDavid            Since youre writing from London I assume youhavent seen the show in Brooklyn so the first thing Im wondering is how youcan dismiss an exhibition that you havent even seen Consider yourself amember of the Rudy Giuliani School of Art Criticismthe mayor too has notseen the show            I have been out to Brooklyn several times to seeSensation and I think its a wonderfully spirited show Obviously not everypiece in it is a masterwork and there are more than a few dogs But on thewhole I felt moved by the level of energy and feel that the show provides awelcome antidote to the New York scene which at the moment is suffering from asevere case of theoryitis Sensation to its credit isnt about Derrida orBaudrillard or genderbending or the reified moment of perception It isntabout political correctness Generally speaking it takes art away from thetheory people from the academics with their pound books and theirunbearable jargon and allows real life to come shining through            Take for instance Damien Hirsts shark piece Itoccupies a giant glass box and so obviously harks back to the geometric formsof the Minimalist movement of the s Yet its also a critique of AmericanMinimalism which at a certain point became too elegant and mannered for itsown good Minimalism in the end became an art of polished quite exquisitesurfacesand Hirst wants to get us below the surface into a deep muddy oceanof feeling Hence the shark the perfect belowthesurface symbol At anyrate I love the shark piece Maybe Im just a sucker for icons            By the way I think it needs to be said that DamienHirst isnt nearly as dangerous as Mayor Giuliani Damien Hirst is not runningfor the US Senate            As to Chris Ofili ofHoly Virgin Mary fame I think hes a solid painter Ofili is a blackRoman Catholic and to my mind the picture represents an earnest attempt toappropriate the Virgin for black culture I have no problem with elephant dungwhich is just chewed up grass anyway and Id guess the reason the paintingset off such a furor is that it depicts a black Virgin Mary I think Giulianifreaked out when he saw a Virgin Mary who wasnt white I mean its probablynot a coincidence that the mayor decided to single out and all but lynch themost prominent black artist of his generation Thats a shame especially sincethe Brooklyn Museum of Art is the only major art museum in New York that servesa racially diverse community            Yourstruly            Deborah
