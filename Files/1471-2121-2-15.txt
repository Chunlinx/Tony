                    Background        Wound healing involves reepithelialization granulation        tissue formation and contraction reviewed in refs             Reepithelialization and granulation tissue formation in        turn involve proliferation and migration of cells from the        wound edge to fill the wound site In higher vertebrate        adult animals reepithelialization of a wound begins within        hours after injury while granulation tissue begins to form        approximately  days after injury Besides fibroblasts        granulation tissue consists of macrophages blood vessels        and extracellular matrix ECM produced by fibroblasts        Once the wound is filled with granulation tissue and        covered with a neoepidermis a portion of the wound        fibroblasts transforms into myofibroblasts which contract        the wound to reduce and strengthen the defect        Myofibroblasts are rich in Factin bundles which establish        cellcell and cellmatrix linkages and thus generate the        force for wound contraction        SPARC secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine is        an extracellular glycoprotein expressed in elevated levels        in actively proliferating cells and organs such as        developing embryos and adult tissues associated with        remodeling bone and gut wound healing angiogenesis        reviewed in refs      and tumorigenesis             SPARC belongs to a class of recently denoted matricellular        proteins that are involved in cellECM interactions It        binds to ECM proteins and interacts with cells SPARC has        been postulated to modulate cell shape     and cell        adhesions       to regulate cell proliferation            and migration      and to influence matrix        contraction     In addition SPARC is known to bind to        certain growth factors    and to modulate expression of        ECM components     Many of these functions are        requisite to wound repair        To further investigate the role of SPARC in wound        healing we used cells from our recently generated        SPARCnull mice     As we reported previously SPARC        plays a role in regulating expression of growth factors        growth factor receptors and ECM proteins and in modulating        cell proliferation In the absence of SPARC expression of        transforming growth factor and type I collagen is        downregulated in kidney mesangial cells     The        expression of cell surface receptor for insulinlike growth        factor I in SPARCnull embryonic fibroblasts is also        diminished     Studies with SPARCnull cells have        confirmed that SPARC functions in cell proliferation        Mesangial cells adult skin fibroblasts and smooth muscle        cells from SPARCnull mice proliferate faster than their        respective wildtype counterparts in media containing fetal        bovine serum FBS     Although embryonic fibroblasts        from the SPARCnull mice grow at the same rate as the        wildtype cells when they are cultured in FBS the        SPARCnull embryonic fibroblasts exhibit downregulated        proliferation as compared to the wildtype cells when the        fibroblasts are cultured in serumfree medium containing        insulin as the sole mitogenic factor     Thus it        appears that the role of SPARC in cell proliferation is        cell type and environment dependent        Although SPARC is expressed in fibroblasts and        macrophages at wound sites    and functions in many        processes important to wound repair the role of SPARC in        wound healing in a whole animal has not yet been studied        Previously studies of phenotypes in this laboratory have        shown that SPARCnull mice develop osteopenia around         months of age    in bones where SPARC is normally the        most abundant noncollagenous glycoprotein     The        second phenotype thus far uncovered is in the lens where        SPARC is normally produced by lens epithelial cells            and is a component of the lens capsule             SPARCnull mice show progressive cataract formation        beginning approximately  months after birth             Electron microscopy of the SPARCnull lens revealed        abnormality at the lens cellECM capsule interface with        an intrusion of cellular processes into the basement        membrane of the lens capsule whereas wildtype lens        exhibited a precise border at the cellmatrix interface            In the present study we show for the first time        that SPARC plays a role in wound repair in vivo and in        vitro Wound healing in SPARCnull mice is retarded due to        delayed granulation tissue formation Repair of a wound in        vitro by dermal fibroblasts is impaired due to defect in        cell migration                    Results                  Delayed wound healing in SPARCdeficient          mice          Two independent experiments with  mm oblong          fullthickness excision wounds  mice of each type per          experiment including the striated muscle layer          panniculus carnosus on the dorsal skin of wildtype          and SPARCnull mice indicated that the absence of SPARC          impeded healing of skin wounds One day after surgery a          clear thin film of dried exudate covered the wounds in          the wildtype and SPARCnull mice Buildup of dehydrated          wound crusts or scabs began at day  and became          subsequently more extensive In the SPARCnull mice scabs          were thicker and extravasation of blood visible in the          gaps within the scabs was more frequent and extensive          than that in the control mice In control wildtype mice          loss of wound scabs began at day  and was complete in          all mice by day  Fig A lower panel with wounds          wellhealed and epithelial covering restored Fig A          upper panel In contrast the scabs in SPARCnull mice          started to come off partially around day  resulting in          a scab with a gaping red wound field which was evident          even at  days Fig A upper panel Healing of          SPARCnull wounds remained incomplete on day  and          complete healing in all mice was observed between  and           days Fig A lower panel Similar results were seen          with mm circular excision wounds not shown          Although the larger  mm oblong full thickness          excisions allowed us to observe visible differences in          wound healing progression the wound sites were too          fragile to be isolated for histological examination We          therefore made  mm full thickness circular lesions and          examined the gross and microscopic appearance of skin          wounds at various time points with four wildtype and          four SPARCnull mice at each time point Examination of          the gross appearance of wounds showed no apparent          difference in healing progression between wildtype and          SPARCnull mice with build up of scab at day  and loss          of scab by day  However we detected histological          differences between wildtype and SPARCnull mice          Histology of  mm wound tissues showed that at day           after wounding the epidermis at wound edges had grown          thicker in both wildtype and SPARCnull mice indicating          that proliferation of keratinocytes had began However          no granulation tissue formation was visible at this stage          of healing in either wildtype or SPARCnull mice          results not shown At day  reepithelialization and          granulation tissue growth had begun as shown in the  mm          biopsies in figure B The epidermis had begun to migrate          centrally to cover the wound edge and reepithelialization          at this early stage of wound healing in a small biopsy          appeared to be as efficient in SPARCnull mice as in the          wildtype mice except for the more extensive granulation          tissue formation in the wildtype than in the SPARCnull          mice In wildtype mice the granulation tissue had          formed at the edge and base of the wound In SPARCnull          mice the granulation tissue covered the edge of the          wound but did not extend to the base of the wound Fig          B At day  reepithelialization and granulation tissue          formation appeared as elaborate in SPARCnull mice as in          wildtype mice with the neoepidermis and granulation          tissue filling two third of the wound beds not shown          By day  the wound areas in both control and mutant          mice were smaller reflecting some degree of wound          contraction and in addition the wounds were now closed          being completely covered by epidermal cells and          underlying granulation tissue results not shown          Northern analysis of  mm circular wound tissues          isolated during a  day healing period showed similar          patterns of cytokeratin  expression in SPARCnull mice          and wildtype mice Fig  Cytokeratin  expression is          associated with proliferative epidermal keratinocytes at          wound sites     Such expression in control unwounded          skin  day is as expected very low but increased          appreciably by day  after wounding with peak expression          at day  Interestingly expression of cytokeratin  was          upregulated in the normal epidermis and neoepidermis of          SPARCnull mice relative to those of wildtype mice Fig           although histologically no differences in          reepithelialization between the SPARCnull and wildtype          wounds were apparent Fig B Analysis of I          collagen and fibronectin transcripts which are          synthesized by fibroblasts of dermal granulation tissue                revealed that expression of both transcripts          was delayed in the wounds of SPARCnull mice relative to          those of wildtype mice Fig  In wildtype mice both          transcripts were expressed in the unwounded skin  day          used as controls At day  the levels of the two          transcripts decreased appreciably below the levels of the          control skin followed by an increase in expression          between day  and day  In the case of SPARCnull mice          expression of the two transcripts remained below the          control unwounded skin at day  and day  and did not          begin to increase until between day  and day  Fig           Thus we conclude that SPARC deficiency compromises          granulation tissue formation that involves fibroblast          ingrowth and ECM protein deposition                          Impaired wound repair by cultured SPARCnull          fibroblasts          Granulation tissue formation after cutaneous wounding          involves both cell proliferation and migration              However these two processes are difficult to analyze in          vivo To investigate these two processes a small scrape          wound was made across a confluent monolayer of primary          dermal fibroblasts and the process of wound closure was          monitored Fig A In wildtype cells at  hours          after wounding repair of the wound was essentially          complete with the denuded area covered with fibroblasts          Fig A upper panel In comparison repair of the          wounded SPARCnull fibroblast monolayer was retarded          Fig A lower panel The denuded area remained          unpopulated through  to  hours even though cells at          the edge of the wound showed forward movement The first          evidence of cell ingrowth did not appear until around           hours and wound repair was not complete until some time          between  and  hours after wounding Since the          doubling time for these dermal fibroblasts was about           hours our unpublished observation the healing in          wildtype cells at  hours implied that wildtype          fibroblasts had extensively migrated from the edge of the          wound into the wound site prior to the onset of cell          proliferation However SPARCnull cells did not show any          migration prior to the onset of cell proliferation and          ingrowth was retarded even after the onset of cell          proliferation This defect in cell motility was rescued          to the level of wildtype cells by the addition of          purified SPARC Fig B The denuded area was          repopulated by the SPARCnull cells by  hours in the          presence of added SPARC Fig B lower panel as          compared to  hours in its absence Fig A lower          panel The repair of wildtype fibroblasts was not          affected by the addition of SPARC and was complete by           hours in the presence of exogenous SPARC Fig B upper          panel or in its absence Fig A upper panel The          results indicate that SPARC regulates wound healing          directly through cell migration Although the long period          of impeded ingrowth of SPARCnull cells after wounding          already suggested defect in cell migration rather than          cell proliferation we determined cell migration in the          absence of cell proliferation Mitomycin C blocks mitosis          and thus allows analysis of cell migration in the absence          of cell proliferation Treatment with mitomycin C did not          affect the time course of wound closure of either the          wildtype or SPARCnull cells Fig  The wound in a          monolayer of wildtype fibroblasts cultured in the          absence or presence of mitomycin C healed by  hours          after wounding Fig A The wound in a monolayer of          SPARCnull fibroblasts whether cultured in the presence          of mitomycin C or in its absence remained unrepaired at           hours began to show slight closure at  hours and          healed by  hours Fig B These results confirm that          cell migration is a key step affecting the rate of wound          healing and that this process is impaired in SPARCnull          cells To further test our conclusion we investigated          whether cell proliferation was affected by the lack of          SPARC We found that SPARCnull fibroblasts incorporated          Hthymidine as efficiently as control wildtype          fibroblasts over the  hour period studied Fig           These results together show that indeed cell motility          rather than cell proliferation is the major factor in          the retarded wound repair process in SPARCnull          cells                          Collagengel contraction by SPARCnull fibroblasts          is not compromised          An important event during wound healing is the          contraction of newly formed granulation tissue by          fibroblasts to bring together the edges of the wound              It has been reported    that fibroblasts          incorporated in a collagen gel induce progressive          contraction of the gel resulting in the formation of a          dense collagen disc of greatly reduced diameter This          phenomenon has been considered as an in vitro equivalent          of the connectivetissue contraction that occurs during          wound healing We used this procedure to examine the          contractile ability of SPARCnull fibroblasts Gel          diameter was measured at various time points following          incorporation of fibroblasts in the collagen gel and the          area calculated and expressed as a percentage of the          initial area Primary dermal fibroblasts from SPARCnull          mice contracted type I collagen gels as efficiently as          primary dermal fibroblasts from wildtype mice          contracting to  of the initial area at  hours and to           by  hours after incubation of the fibroblasts in          collagen gels Fig                             Discussion        In this study we have shown for the first time that        repair of excision wounds in SPARCnull mice is impaired        Histological examination and study of the expression        patterns of ECM components fibronectin and type I        collagen at the wound site suggested that retarded        granulation tissue formation caused impaired wound repair        In vitro studies with dermal fibroblasts isolated from        SPARCnull mice further showed that the ability of the        cells to restore wounded areas was hindered and that a        defect in cell migration rather than cell proliferation        was the major cause of the delay in repopulating the        denuded area The delayed cell migration and restoration of        the wound site were growth factor independent as these        defects occurred in the presence of FBS Furthermore these        defects were reversed by the addition of purified SPARC        showing that the defect in cell migration and wound healing        was attributable to the absence of SPARC The mechanism by        which SPARC influences cell migration is not known One        possibility is that the lack of SPARC causes alteration in        ECM with respect to structure andor function and thus        contributes to a decrease in cell migration Although SPARC        has been postulated to be involved in wound healing due to        its elevated expression in fibroblasts and macrophages at        wound sites     our results are the first to        demonstrate that SPARC indeed plays a role in wound repair        and that it does so by promoting granulation tissue        formation through modulation of fibroblast migration        In large wounds  mm visual examination of wounds        showed that loss of wound scabs and restoration of        epidermal covering were delayed in SPARCnull mice due to        premature partial loss of scabs and neoepidermis        resulting in repeated setbacks in the reepithelialization        process However similar setbacks in reepitheliallization        were not observed in small wounds  mm Furthermore        histological examination of new epidermal cells in the        wound bed and Northern analysis of expression of a wound        keratinocyte marker cytokeratin  in the biopsied        tissues revealed that reepithelialization in SPARCnull        mice was probably not compromised It seems possible that        reepithelialization occurs normally in SPARCnull mice        However since SPARC is a matricellular protein involved in        cellmatrix interaction       cellmatrix        interactionrelated defects may exert a significant        influence in large wounds of SPARCnull mice causing        premature loss of a part of the scabs and of the        neoepidermis a pathophysiological process requiring        repeated healing In small wounds the pathophysiological        process caused by the cellmatrix interactionrelated        defects may be too small to affect reepithelialization        significantly with the result that restoration of epidermal        covering progresses as normally as in the wildtype mice        Perhaps this sizedependent wound closure may have        contributed to the enhanced wound healing in SPARCnull        mice cited recently as an unpublished result            Although SPARC is required for migration of dermal        fibroblasts into the wound site it is apparently not        essential to the motility of keratinocytes since        reepithelialization appears normal in SPARCnull mice        Thus the role of SPARC in cell migration may be cell        typespecific which has been shown to be the case with in        vitro studies       Cell motility is controlled by a        cycle of cell attachment and detachment It is generally        accepted that the driving force for cell movement is        provided by the dynamic reorganization of the actin        cytoskeleton directing protrusion lamellipodia and        filopodia at the front of the cell and retraction at the        rear      Although we have not examined the        ultrastructure of the dermal fibroblasts at the edge of        wound sites we showed previously by electron microscopy        that in the lens of SPARCnull mice numerous cellular        processes extended into the ECM of the lens capsule            We further showed that in contrast to the abnormal        filopodial projections at the lens cellECM interface        cellcell contacts between the neighboring lens epithelial        cells and between the lens epithelial and fiber cells were        normal     The results indicate that disassembly of        cellcell contacts between lens cells is not taking place        despite the forward movement of the lens cells into the ECM        of the capsule In this study the lack of ingrowth despite        the forward movement of cells at the edge of wounded        monolayers suggests that a similar failure of SPARCnull        dermal fibroblasts to break away from its neighboring cells        may account for the impaired cell motility observed during        wound healing in vitro Previously SPARC has been shown to        regulate cellcell contact through tyrosine phosphorylation        of adherens junction proteins     Electron microscopy        of the SPARCnull dermal fibroblasts at wound sites should        not only confirm the role of SPARC in cell motility but        also reveal how SPARC mediates cellECM and cellcell        interactions to promote cell motility        We showed in the present study that there are no overt        differences in cell proliferation and type I collagen gel        contraction between control and SPARCnull dermal        fibroblasts Wound contraction depends on migration of        fibroblasts into the wound site where they lay down their        own collagenrich matrix     Northern analysis of wound        biopsies showed that production of type I collagen and        fibronectin by the null mice at the beginning of wound        healing was lower than that by the wildtype mice        Subsequently the wound in the null mice was fully invaded        by fibroblasts and expression of type I collagen and        fibronectin by the SPARCnull mice was as abundant as that        by the wildtype mice Wound contraction takes place when a        wound site is filled with fibroblasts and ECM     Thus        it is likely that consistent with the in vitro study wound        contraction in the SPARCnull mice is not compromised                    Conclusions        The delay in granulation tissue formation and healing of        excision wounds in SPARCnull mice and the defect in wound        closure in in vitro assays indicate that SPARC plays a role        in wound healing through its effect on cell migration Cell        migration is crucial not only to wound healing but also to        a wide variety of normal or abnormal biological phenomena        such as embryogenesis leukocyte immigration into areas of        insult and tumor cell invasion SPARCnull mice and their        cells should provide a useful system to investigate how a        matricellular protein regulates pleiotropic functions        through cell migration and how its absence alters        biological processes                    Materials and Methods                  Animals          SPARCnull mice and control wildtype mice used in          this study were generated and maintained on a mixed          genetic background F of SvEv  CBLj as          described previously                              Wound healing assays          Two to monthold male mice were anesthetized          intraperitoneally with avertin  gkg body weight          The hair on the back was cut and fullthickness  mm          oblong or  mm circular wounds including panniculus          carnosus were made Wounds were neither dressed nor          sutured Mice were caged individually and progression of          wound repair was monitored daily                          Histology          Five fullthickness  mm circular wounds were made on          the back of an anesthetized mouse by a procedure similar          to that described above The  mm diameter wounds          provided stable wound beds appropriate for collection of          wound tissues for histological analysis Mice were          sacrificed by CO asphyxia    and  days after          wounding An area  to  mm in diameter which included          the uninjured epithelial margins was removed bisected          in the midtransversal plane fixed in  formalin          Buffered FormaldeFresh Fisher Scientific Fair Lawn          NJ and embedded in paraffin Sections  m were cut          from both faces of bisected tissues and stained with          hematoxylin and eosin                          RNA analysis          Circular fullthickness dorsal cutaneous biopsies of           mm diameter were made on the backs of anesthetized mice          and wound sites including the uninjured epithelial          margins were excised   and  days post wounding as          described above Control unwounded dorsal skin  day          was also isolated The harvested tissues were frozen          immediately in liquid nitrogen Total RNA was isolated          using guanidine thiocyanate extraction and  g of the          total RNA was analyzed by Northern hybridization as          described previously     cDNA probes used in          hybridization were human fibronectin     I          collagen     or cytokeratin  cDNA Hung Tseng          unpublished results The same Northern hybridization          filters were reprobed with glyceraldehydephosphate          dehydrogenase GAPDH cDNA The amounts of transcripts          were quantified by PhosphoImager Molecular Dynamics and          normalized to GAPDH transcript Two independent          experiments gave similar hybridization patterns                          Isolation of primary dermal fibroblasts          Primary dermal fibroblasts were prepared from  day          old newborn mice Mice were euthanized by cervical          dislocation and sterilized with  ethanol Skin was          removed washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS and          incubated overnight in  trypsin in PBS at C The          dermis was separated from the epidermis and subjected to          further incubation overnight in  Uml of crude          collagenase Sigma St Louis MO in Dulbeccos modified          Eagles medium DMEM Life Technologies Inc          Gaithersburg MD at C Small cell aggregates were          separated from large tissue fragments by gravitation          sedimentation for  minutes at room temperature The          supernatant was carefully removed and cells were          collected by centrifugation and plated in DMEM containing           FBS Hyclone Logan UT for  hours The cells were          then replated twice to deplete from the culture the          residual keratinocytes that do not survive replating in           FBSDMEM The fibroblasts were checked for their          spindle shaped morphology passage one and used for          future experiments Twenty fibroblast preparations were          made from  wildtype or SPARCnull mice In all          experiments wildtype and SPARCnull cells at identical          passage numbers  were used                          In vitro woundhealing and cell migration          assays          Both wildtype and SPARCnull primary dermal          fibroblasts were seeded in well plates             cellswell and grown to confluence overnight in DMEM          containing  FBS Monolayers were wounded using a  ml          plastic micropipette tip and incubated at C in DMEM          containing  FBS

migration of          cells into denuded space by a phasecontrast microscope          The assays were performed in triplicate in two separate          experiments To investigate cell motility monolayers of          dermal fibroblasts were prepared and wounded as described          above The wounded monolayers were incubated at C in          DMEM containing  FBS with or without mitomycin C           gml Sigma St Louis MO to block mitosis Migration          of cells into denuded areas was monitored for up to           hours                          Incorporation of Hthymidine          Wildtype and SPARCnull dermal fibroblasts were          plated in well plates    cellswell and          cultured overnight in DMEM containing  FBS The cells          were then washed three times with DMEM without FBS and          incubated with Hthymidine  Ciml NEN Boston MA          in DMEM containing  FBS for time periods varying          between  and  hours Due to the problem of cell death           in serumfree medium cell cycle          synchronization of the dermal fibroblasts in serumfree          medium was not performed prior to Hthymidine assays          DNAbound Hthymidine was
