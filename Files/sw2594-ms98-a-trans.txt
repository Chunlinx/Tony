          okay   so Jan how do they recycle in Texas   well i the biggest uh way its going right now uh lot most of the grocery stores   umhum   have got uh things set up so where you can bring in your uh plastic and your cans and newspapers and then theyve just got different barrels sitting out  i shouldnt say barrels like big John Doors or whatever theyre called Gondolas  um theyve got them set outside and   uhhuh yeah yeah   and uh   is it is it all voluntary   yes its all voluntary now they do have some places where you can take things and get cash but i think the lot of people dont really want the cash you know they just want to uh help recycle which is what we do you know we   right umhum yeah umhum   probably the only thing sometimes well take cash or the cans in and we let the kids get the money for that but uh for   right yeah theres a a lot of projects where the the Boy Scouts and things and that will collect your cans and its a good fund raiser for the kids   right right yeah thats true but but thats really the the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating you know but   umhum i guess i you see i guess it depends on your landfill space   umhum   i know i were in Maryland but my i from Pennsylvania and my parents how are forced recycling   oh really   uh yeah all plastic they have all plastic has to go into a recycling bin all cans have to be recycled all newspapers have to be recycled   oh wow   because theyre um theyre just running out of space and landfills uh Pennsylvania Ohio and New York are some of the uh theyre using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones   yeah   so its really uh its uh really hard on them now up here in Maryland though were just just in a voluntary recycling stage right now so uh so my wife and i you know we save our bottles and we save our newspapers and we save all of our plastic and all of our tin cans and just like you say we go to uh a community area where they have it set up and we dump them off there   so its all about you say it is all voluntary do they   yeah its still voluntary though i think i think were supposed to have something impeme implemented by nineteen ninety three though   will it be mandatory   where some aspects will be mandatory umhum   is it all um is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff or is it all   mostly just the cans   okay yeah thats   and i and most of the time like i said thats thats a sort of like fund raiser things that the schools do or that the Boy Scouts do or whatever   right right yeah thats true thats true   yeah umhum cans are the only thing i think you really get money for   well they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers and stuff like that but   umhum   you know i think a lot of people like i said are more concerned with you know right now you know the aspects of saving the earth  um   right umhum yeah and i think thats mostly well you know we even before as soon as the community said you know were going to put up bins for recycling you know we automatically   umhum right   started doing it it was its one of those things you know and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be separated you know thats   umhum well i tell you its kind of funny now at even even at TI i dont do you work for TI okay   no humum   um at TI theyre doing recycling i mean for a long time they didnt do this but now theyre theyre recycling cans and paper we have separate bins   umhum yeah   uh separate wastebaskets  in our offices for paper   umhum yeah   you know and they i mean its tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees and you know   right   its really i cant believe that you know because theyve got it all posted all over the place how much theyre saving and how well yeah   yeah how much how well theyre doing yeah we do i um i i work in a uh speech interface lab at a at a at a college   oh okay   and we do basically the same thing the state of Maryland has lost asked all the colleges and universities and some of the large organizations you know if they would definitely recycle their office paper   umhum umhum   and the same thing you know every almost every college in Maryland is recycling office paper but you know in the giant bins around and its surprising how much   yeah   you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage can every night   right yep so you dont think about it   you dont notice until you start leaving yeah they dont pick up your recycling until its full and you just cant believe how much paper that you uh   right i know   reams of paper come out of an office every day they just asked me to recycle   yep yeah well you think about the waste even i mean you know cost wise and and you know like you saving saving trees and stuff like that i mean its just amazing you know the difference   umhum right yeah so i think hopefully if you know i guess a lot of the large organizations probably TI did they advertise on television how successful they are   no i havent seen anything uh but that doesnt mean that they dont i dont watch much TV but i havent really seen anything advertised publicly   some yeah yeah umhum   i mean like i said they do a lot of internal advertising on that kind of stuff but i havent seen anything   internal umhum yeah   see i dont see a lot of TI advertisements on TV anyway i think they advertise more um other places where theyre not located   right yeah that would probably be true   you know so so i dont see a lot of advertisements for TI   umhum yeah because i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television you know theyll just come up and say you know theyll show you theyll to encourage to encourage recycling   right   theyll say and here those of us at Dalmarva Power which is our power company you know we now recycle forty five percent of our solid waste and they   uhhuh right   and uh we do this for the community they put those on so i so i think you know were probably reaching a successful stage and and just with voluntary i think   right well even i mean in the kids schools i mean they do things to try and recycle and   umhum   i know my kids um like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say oh look at that somebody is not saving the earth you know so i mean the kids i mean theyre really trying to educate all ages you know and its good to start the kids real young   right yeah yeah i think so too yeah   and stuff like that because i mean when i was a kid they never did stuff like that i mean its like nobody was concerned about it you know and its like   right yeah we werent concerned yeah thats true   you know its like all of a sudden when theres noticeable things saying hey you know were ruining the earth you know and now everybody is doing something about which is good   umhum umhum   but how come we werent doing this say twenty years ago  you know   yeah i i think really probably what hit peoples you know i know that here in the up in the uh uh the the New England area and also in in Pennsylvania Ohio and New York the just run all of a sudden were out of landfill   umhum   and then theyre saying we we estimate this landfill will be over will be full in two years unless we cut back   umhum   and even then you know were really running out of space so i think that that became that all of a sudden really hit home that theres no longer landfill space in some of the more crowded states   well yeah this is   so what you know and no no other state im sure Texas probably still has some landfill space theyre not going to voluntarily say hey ship your garbage here   right  yeah thats true   so you know realistically you know we had we really had to start we have to start recycling in some some uh geographic areas its really tough   i think that it it really surprises me because of the cost savings i mean this is such a tremendous amount of cost savings i mean why   umhum   i cant understand why nobody saw that before i mean even even not   umhum   even the aspects of not saving the earth i mean its so cost you know   right yeah though well well in some ways i guess it it doesnt become really cost savings until you have an industry around it you know because i know that like in Pennsylvania   well yeah   they require them to um put their newspaper for recycling but the deinking process that they have to they use to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused   umhum uhhuh   um is very expensive and also it waste it produces a a waste a um a liquid waste that they dont know what to do with yet   oh oh i see okay   so even some aspects of recycling   is not real cost efficient oh okay okay oh i understand that though   still have cost yeah cost efficient yet yeah so but others you know like tin cans and plastics are are really uh efficient you know they uh they melt they melt on quickly and can be you know just because of the heating and things yeah and glass yeah   uhhuh right and glass right umhum   so yeah it really is surprising that people havent noticed it before   yeah thats true and even i i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil   umhum yeah umhum   and i mean that kind of surprises me  i mean you know because once oil gets so you know thick and yucky youd wonder how they could you know clean that up enough to use it again but they can   yeah umhum   um i dont know how cost efficient that would be i guess   yeah i dont i dont know either thats i know that though i even all those petroleum products though are so terrible for your um the water table you know they really pollute quickly and   umhum   you know one i was what reading some place that the brake fluid you put brake fluid normally comes in just small little pint containers   umhum   that one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water you know like hundreds of gallons of water   wow   so its one of those things that they really um and you wonder you know with all these oil spills   yeah   how how terrible that is yeah how terrible that is so well have to well have to keep our eyes on all that i guess   yeah i know really i know i really i dont know i i think that i mean i think that they really are doing a good thing now and i hope it keeps it well im sure itll keep up   umhum yeah i agree   you know i think its really catching on you know i i think that   umhum   im not sure if it i dont know i think its a good idea to make it mandatory   i do too   um  because like we were asking some people that live in um North Dakota well are you saving your you know are you recycling and they said well were not forced to do it yet so no   umhum   you know so i mean i dont know i think that if people are forced if the people are not forced to do it they may not you know i mean i dont know i think a lot of people still still still will but   yeah it well you know if theyre forced to do it becomes sort of a habit   right   you know i know that its really funny my parents are forced to do it and they
