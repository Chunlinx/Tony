                    Background  Aims        MAdCAM is a  kD endothelial cell adhesion molecule        expressed on the surface of high endothelial venules in the        gut and in Peyers patches MAdCAM is expressed basally        in these tissues and is dramatically increased in        inflammatory bowel disease IBD In IBD especially        Crohns disease MAdCAM acts as the main ligand for        abexpressing lymphocytes and recruits these lymphocytes        into the intestine where they initiate and sustain chronic        inflammation Several animal models and human studies        support an absolute requirement for both MAdCAM and ab        in the production of immune models of colitis MAdCAM is        expressed on the surface of lymphoid endothelial cells in        response to several cytokines including TNF and ILlb        however the signal transduction pathways involved in        MAdCAM are still not well understood However since        MAdCAM is induced by Th cytokines like TNF and ILb        it is likely that its induction is mechanistically similar        to that of adhesion molecules like ICAM and VCAM These        adhesion molecules are also induced by Th cytokines and        require activation of the NFkBPARP The activation of        these transcription factors also requires the formation of        intracellular oxidants since mobilization of these        adhesion molecules in response to cytokines can be        prevented by antioxidants like PDTC or NAC        Physiologically the expression of these cell adhesion        molecules also appears to be limited by the formation of NO        through either constituitive or inducible forms of nitric        oxide synthase eNOS iNOS It has been suggested that NO        could inhibit the transcriptiontranslation of adhesion        molecules through either scavenging of signal oxidants        produced in response to cytokines or through covalent        modification of polypeptides in the signaling pathway like        IkB        Here we examine the induction of MAdCAM by TNF and        evaluated whether endogenous nitric oxide from eNOS and        iNOS or exogenous NO from rapid or slowreleasing NO        donors affect the expression of MadCAM Our data suggest        that in this model endogenous NO derived from either iNOS        or eNOS does not significantly influence MAdCAM        expression however both rapid and slow releasing NO        donors can potently inhibit the expression of MAdCAM and        reduce lymphocyte endothelial adhesion                    Materials and

established a role of NO donors in the          regulation of MAdCAM expression by endothelial cells          we examined effects of NO donors on the adhesion of ab          expressing mouse lymphocyte cell line TK to          TNFtreated endothelial cultures Figure showed that          control adhesion of TK cells was    TNF          induced maximal adhesion    p   vs          untreated control at  h This relatively high level of          adhesion was inhibited by preincubation of endothelial          monolayers with antiMAdCAM antibody MAdCAM antibody          reduced TK adhesion to    p   vs          TNF treatment showing that most of the TNF induced          lymphocyte adhesion in this model was MAdCAM dependent          Similarly treatment of endothelial monolayers with          DETANONOate significantly reduced adhesion to             of that induced by TNF alone p            DETANONOate did not affect lymphocyte adhesion to          untreated endothelial monolayers            data not shown                             Discussion        Human IBD is characterized by the extravasation of        leukocytes especially lymphocytes into the gut where        these cells induce and sustain chronic intestinal        inflammation   Lymphocyte homing to both normal        tissues and to sites of inflammation is regulated in        part by differential expression of cell surface homing        receptors and their bonds with tissue specific vascular        addressins that are sites of lymphocyte recruitment from        blood     Lymphocyte homing to mucosal lymphoid        tissues such as Peyers patches and the intestinal lamina        propria involves a singlechain Kd adhesion        glycoprotein the mucosal vascular addressin MAdCAM                  MAdCAM is expressed on endothelial cells in mesenteric        lymph nodes lamina propria of the small and large        intestine and the lactating mammary gland Increased        expression of MAdCAM on murine endothelial cells can be        induced after stimulation with IL and TNF          MAdCAM has also been detected at high levels on colonic        lamina propria venules from mice with hapten induced        colitis   mice injected with TNF   or colitic        IL knockout mice   The interaction of the         integrin on a subset of T cells with its ligand MAdCAM        on high venular and lymphoid endothelial cells has been        shown to be support the entry of of these lymphocytes into        the gut in IBD   However this process is still not        well understood        Immunemodels of colitis in mice show that the        MAdCAMB integrin bond is essential to produce colitis        CDRB highCD T lymphocytes which normally home to and        populate the colons of severecombined immune deficient        SCID mice will not enter the gut after treatment of        recipient animals with either MAdCAM or  specific        antibody This shows that this pair of molecules is clearly        involved in cell traffic into the inflamed gut          Therefore it is possible that there may be unregulated        MAdCAM expression in IBD and likely that the control of        MAdCAM expression may be an effective potential treatment        for IBD        With respect to adhesion adhesion of polymorphonuclear        leukocytes has been shown to be enhanced by treatment with        NOS inhibitors similarly Hokari et al   have also        demonstrated that LNAME promotes the adhesion of        Tlymphocytes cells to endothelium in vivo        NO is an important modulator of adhesion molecule        expression in both acute and chronic inflammatory states        and may influence the course of IBD It is known that NO        can function both as an oxidant or antioxidant depending        on the availability of reactive oxygen species          Similarly the concentration of NO can also augment           or inhibit    oxygenradical mediated tissue        damage and lipid peroxidation It has also been reported        that inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthases        using the nonselective NOS inhibitor LNAME induces        endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM and VCAM in HUVEC                  With respect to NO in inflammatory bowel disease Singer        et al   found that iNOS expression was significantly        increased in colonic epithelia from individuals with IBD        In iNOS deficient mice McCafferty et al           reported that acetic acidinduced colitis was more severe        in iNOS deficient animals consistent with a protective        role of iNOS derived NO in colitis        De Caterina et al   reported that in another model        NO blocked the TNF or IL induced expression of VCAM        Eselectin and ICAM Similarly GSNO also reduced NFkB        activation as measured by EMSA Further Binion et al          reported that iNOS expression in human intestinal micro        vascular endothelial cells inhibited leukocyte adhesion        indicating that iNOS derived NO may control inflammation in        human IBD Further support of this hypothesis comes from a        more recent report by Binions group showing that        individuals afflicted with Crohns colitis have an apparent        inability to express iNOS in their intestinal microvascular        endothelium   McCafferty et al    suggest        that in IBD iNOS blocks an early obligatory phase of        inflammation but perhaps not the chronic phase Kubes and        McCafferty   suggest in IBD NO may be either        beneficial or detrimental and may reflect the tissue source        cell type enzymatic source of NO eNOS vs iNOS and        rate of NO production as well as the bioavailability of        oxidants in these different models        In this present study we investigated how MAdCAM        expression in cultured endothelial cells is altered by NO        donors and by NO synthase inhibitors We have also examined        how cytokines and NOmodifying agents control adhesion of        expressing mouse lymphocytes in response to TNF        We observed that both a short and longacting NO donor        significantly reduce TNFinduced expression of MAdCAM        expression in lymphatic endothelial cells The effects of        NO donors appear to reflect their ability to prevent the        nuclear translocation of NFkB The MAdCAM promoter has        several NFkB binding sites   and are necessary to        induce MAdCAM expression Both a short and long acting NO        donor blocked MAdCAM induction but the slowreleasing NO        DETANO was apparently at least  times more effective        than SperNO on a molar basis This probably reflects the        need for persistently elevated NO to block cytokine        signaling in this system        In this model the mechanism through which NO donors        limit inflammation is by NFkB inhibition since these NO        donors effectively block p translocation into the        nucleus Khan et al   demonstrated that NO donors        blocked TNF induced NFB activation in human umbilical        vein endothelial cells as measured by EMSA Similarly        Spiecker   showed that GSNO blocked TNF induced        NFB activation by EMSA in human saphenous vein        endothelium However in that model IB the inhibitor of        the NFkB complex was still degraded Therefore NO might        limit NFkB activation through pathways independent of        IkBa In that report NO was found to induce IB synthesis        through activation of its promoter therefore increased        IkBa might also contribute to NFkB inhibition  Several        other possible pathways eg p p MAPK and        transcription factors eg SP and possibly AP Adh        ETF PEA sites   which could also contribute to        NFkB dependent gene activation and might participate in NO        mediated MAdCAM regulation by cytokines   have        reported that an NOreleasing derivative of mesalamine        one agent currently used to treat gut inflammation        exhibits enhanced antiinflammatory effects compared to the        parent compound While NO donors are not currently used for        treatment of IBD the literature and our data here suggest        that NO donors could be beneficial        An improved understanding of the interactions of these        signals may improve our ability to understand the role of        MAdCAM in IBD and design effective therapies to treat        it                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations
