        okay now uh the town i live in uh they started a recycling program uh in the certain small part of town a little couple neighborhoods neighborhoods and they said that they were disappointed in the response that people they tried to promote it and everything but i dont think the city necessarily supported what the they were doing uh   is this like roadside collection   yeah i dont think they really uh encouraged it i dont think they really uh made it wellknown how to do it uh thats my perception but   well now down here weve got you know collection bins in the parks and things but theres no you know theres absolutely no   yeah there used to be uh a big uh trash bin several trash bins in front of the WalMart in town here that uh you could put plastic jugs on one side and newspapers on another and glass on the third but uh that has been taken away its not there anymore i mean that thing was always full because people really brought stuff to it all the time and uh then they took it away for no real reason that i can understand or i ever heard about and its not there anymore and the only place to take things to recycle them is like clear off on the other side of town and whos going to do that very few people   thats right well ive seen you know ive seen examples of uh communities where they they take the other other approach you know you you have to do it or youre fined   is that right   and you know im actually all for that i dont im probably not the best best person for recycling but ill be damned if you know if they they didnt uh charge me an extra ten bucks for garbage collection every month id be sure and recycle   yeah how how how do they monitor that though i wonder   i mean its not that much trouble its just different different communities that pass the laws that say you have to have to recycle you have to you have to you know on Mondays they pick up glass and on Tuesdays its you know plastics or whatever and if if you dont uh if your garbage is just out there in a bag and its not sorted you know they mark you down and fine you for it shit its kind of like   hum   its the same principal when theres a drought they fine you for using water you know they just   yeah   you dont do what they say and you not that i promote over government or anything but you know the the worlds in a bad enough state       you know i people being the way they are you kind of need some incentive   yeah it would definitely help you know even if they were to uh uh pay like for recycling aluminum or uh newspapers or whatever i mean they used to be that if you well like grocery stores you buy uh pop and and you had a deposit on the bottle you bring the bottle back you get a nickel per bottle back or whatever you know that encourages you not to throw it away youd take it back and and   yeah right   and get your money back or at least exchange it for another bottle thats full you know   thats true   um i havent seen that done for a long time either   yeah no deposit no return   yeah everythings no deposit no return or else its all plastic jugs that you just pitch you know uh   i was listening to Karen DeNard the other night on the way home from school you know shes got that talk show and uh   yeah   KRA and they were talking about you know a lot of the plastic bottles you cant just throw all plastics together   is that right   and they were talking about you know you need legislation to uh identify what kind of plastic it this is what can be recycled as what   hum   because you know say shampoo bottles i think was the example they gave theres no they dont even give you any indication of what kind of plastic that is you just cant throw that in with your   hum   two liter Coke bottles or whatever   i wasnt aware of that i thought they were more or less all the same   yeah so did i thats thats it was news to me too i thought it was kind of interesting though     there needs to be legislation that they should all be the same plastic   yeah they yeah that or you know things need might be identified and there needs to be a means a convenient means for people to to recycle i know for me now ive got to drive a few miles down the road to do it if i want to do it and a lot of times its the difference between doing it or not doing it   yeah   you know is whether you can like take it out the back like stick it out in the back back alley for the guys to pick up when they do or having to throw it in the back of your car   or at least have you know a a bunch of collection bins around the city you know if they had one for every five thousand people or or two thousand people uh you know just scattered throughout the city you know who who wouldnt mind just you know why going down that way anyway just throw things in the back of your car and   right right   and take them down and throw it in there i mean i think that would be great i id support that entirely you know as a country we produce way too much garbage its its its phenomenal   yeah way too much well i know just as an individual you know i know how many times i haul out a bag of trash and its like incredible if you multiply that times everybody   oh yeah   you know on my block in this city its crazy   where i work there they have uh uh recycled paper thing so you just you have two trash cans in your office one one is for the regular   right   non recyclable trash and is for paper yeah and you know i think its great i use it all the time   yeah youre TI right yeah so am i   you know and i read that the companies now save like what fifteen thousand trees or whatever because of that and i thought thats great   yeah it is   you know   i guess theres the other side of the issue that uh there need to be facilities for processing all this stuff and a market for recyclable goods   uh yeah   and that was something they brought up on the show i listened to was uh you know theres all kinds of you know recycled paper but you know nobodys wanting to use it   is that right   you know how many people are using how many people do you know that use recycled paper in the office   yeah   you know you can you can buy your your Moores computer forms for your computer paper or whatever you can buy it with regular paper or recycled and ill guarantee you in my building i havent seen recycled paper yet   yeah   so at the same time were were doing all this effort to throw it a way and recycle it we ought to be working on the other end and and paying the extra dime on on a dollar for that recycled stuff   ive always wondered why they havent taken some of these recycled plastics and made them into like uh plastic boards to build a house with instead of making it out of wood lumber make it out of out of plastic boards   well i think they actually do some of that but again its the cost the cost of processing that it just   is that right   it intimidates people you know its easier to buy something thats you know the the the cost of building is already   once again the bottom line counts   yeah for it its easy to say but for a lot of people to do you know if you were building a house and you were going to spend you know fifty thousand versus twenty thousand on mat erials because your   yeah   youre going to youre going to pay for uh technology thats not mature yet   yeah that thats a problem   what are you going to do you know youre going to spend twenty thousand and   and then right it off   and yeah you mean youre going to do what you can   thats right well   but uh   thats about all i have to say tonight   i was surprised i thought this thing was shut down but i   whats that   i thought this whole switchboard thing was shut down i was surprised to get the call   yeah so did i but i thought id try one more time and sure enough its okay   yeah great   well thanks for talking and   all right all right bye   see you later bye
