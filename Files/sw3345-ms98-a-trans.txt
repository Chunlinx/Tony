        uh you keep up with current events   um somewhat yeah not not as well as i would like to probably but thats the way it goes   somewhat is that right yeah where where abouts in Pennsylvania   what   where in Pennsylvania   um State College i go to Penn State   oh do you well great   yep   hows uh well no were not supposed to talk about that were supposed to talk about current events  well im a current event junkie so i   right exactly uh   i watch i try to watch the news and i read the newspaper and i like to read Time magazine People magazine keep up whats going on in the world   i see well what particularly are you interested in   but well i just pretty uh a little you know about everything and not and then again not everything but you know i like to know   umhum   pretty well whats happening so political things dont interest me a great deal except i do like to stay informed enough to feel like i halfway vote intelligently you know   umhum   but uh other than that uh i just you know just the events that happen around the world interest me and   yeah   and stay in touch with it know feel like i know whats going on now i have to say all three of my children none of them are too interested in current events   i see   but i always have been   umhum   and i stay up with it but uh how do you how do you uh stay aware of most of the current events uh newspaper   um uh well some of both i   TV news or what umhum   read i read the newspapers sometimes and i watch CNN and that sort of thing occasionally and  i   uhhuh well thats yeah thats good because   read magazines and such   uhhuh well you stay up with it pretty well then   well yeah i mean not not that badly anyway so i am i am interested in whats going on   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   and im particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about Haiti recently because ive been down there   uhhuh yes uhhuh oh youve been there well you would be interested in it then   and yeah right exactly   yeah uh i i follow it you know i dont just read everything about but i im always aware of whats going on like that   yep   and uh because it is its interesting   umhum   and uh i i dont know i feel sorry for those people down there theyve just been so terribly mistreated for so many many years you know i mean through Papa Doc i mean he was a terrible tyrant   thats true theyve never really had a good leader uhhuh umhum   and it i think its been better since he died but its still been bad   yeah   but uh even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew uh i ive read some things about him that he was he wasnt too good himself   oh yeah   yeah he was pretty pretty much a he didnt mind having people bumped off for certain things you know   umhum   but uh   i see   thats one one of the reasons US wasnt so you know didnt do more than they did at the time   umhum   because they werent all that excited about him although hes probably better than a lot of them but  uh but then again who know you know theyre so super so used to it i guess its the only thing that works   yeah so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America and   and not that i think its pretty darned good i think were lucky to have as good a coverage as we have   umhum   i really do now i uh they sometimes they jump on it and and and go a little to the extreme the media does but uh but thats kind of understandable because you know it of course if you watch it more than more than once a day i mean its the same thing over and over and over and over and i listen to the radio watch   right   so i you hear it so much you get a little tired of it but then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe   yep   but i think the quality of our uh our news is just uh i dont believe it could be better   umhum yeah well you know i think it probably could be  it always could be better but id agree that its pretty good   i really dont i dont think so i dont think our news could be better   oh yeah   i i mean i mean what else could they do to make it better   um   i dont see anything that they could do   yeah it well i think that um i dont know   well you always wanna think everything can be improved upon i i really i understand what youre saying   the uh right right i think that   but by trial and error over the years i think they got it about as good as they gonna get it   well that may be so yeah uh i think that im not always satisfied with how dig they deep into things how deep they dig into the things and such   uh nothing is perfect but yeah uhhuh well thats uh thats true i understand what youre saying and then again i understand why they cant dig too much deeper thats why we have CNN you know CNN has the time since thats all they do is news to dig deeper   right umhum right
