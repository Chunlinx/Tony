                                 AOL and Free Net Access                        Dear Kara            A new day and Im back in Northampton after a quick trip to New Yorkyesterday Between the Amtrak ride to and from the cityAmtrak out West mightbe nice but on the East Coast its helland the awful fluorescent lights inthe Time Inc building where Fortune is headquartered I was a prettycranky guy yesterday My mood is much improved today back in my lovely littleoffice overlooking this lovely little downtown reading about the Red Soxvictory last nightrooting for the Red Sox is the curse of all native NewEnglandersperusing the New York Times before I saddle up for a day infront of my computer I check my email and there is your latestmissivesent it says at  am Im happy to get itthough momentarilyworried that youre not getting enough sleep on what is supposed to be afterall a short vacation for you In any case yesterday I didnt think I couldmuster another thought about the Internet if you put a gun to my head But as Isay today Ive got a whole new outlook            The distinction I was trying to make yesterday was between the Internet as atool to make the world a better place which I dont buy and the Internet as apowerful business tool which I very much do buy And so there is not thatmuch in your message that I disagree with because you are focusing on thebusiness dynamics Where we do differ clearly is our level of enthusiasm forthe coming of interactivity Youre right I roll my eyes at the thought of anInternet refrigerator Im not all that sure Id even want to have a Web sitededicated to me and my needswhich are pretty mundane and pretty wellsatisfied without such a site For that matter Im not even much of a cellphone userIve got a digital phone but it only works about half the timeand I dont bother to get anything else            To answer another query of yours On the privacy issue I subscribe to theScott McNealy position When asked about this one time he said something tothe effect of Youve already lost your privacy Get over it Some years agoI wrote a book that was devoted in part to the rise of the credit cardindustry In doing that research I became painfully aware of how much personalinformation was already sloshing around as you put it In other words longbefore the Internet this battle had been lost And in truth I dont much carewhat is discovered about my habits through my Web use            I was particularly glad you brought up AOL for the story in theTimes that caught my eye today was headlined America Online Offers FreeInternet Use in Britain This is big and potentially very dangerous for AOLThe reason it is the most successful Internet company is that it has a hugerevenue stream because it charges a monthly subscription fee There is no wayit wants give away free what it used to charge for but it is being forced todo so by a British company that is offering free Web accessand has taken awaya big chunk of AOLs market share in Britain This of course is preciselywhat Microsoft did to Netscapeit gave away for free a product the browserthat produced most of Netscapes revenues Marc Andreessen the former Netscapewonderboy who now works at AOL must be having nightmares            There it is again thoughthe Nets ability to blindside an establishedcompany to squeeze away profits and to give consumers a deal that seeminglymakes no economic sense but is great for them The irony is that theestablished company in this case is not some socalled bricksandmortardinosaur but a Net company My friend and colleague Andy Serwer predicts thatwithin  to  months nobody will charge for Internet access Where inthe world will that put AOL then            I will say this for AOL Unlike the folks at Netscape who never figured outwhat to do when Microsoft took away their bread and butter those guys at AOLare awfully resilient They proved it a few years ago when it was widelybelieved that their service would be rendered irrelevant by the growth of theInternet And the companys performance during the past few years has beenlittle short of astounding I have no doubt they will adapt to broadband anddeflect the threat posed by ATT And theyve done a great job keepingMicrosoft from eating their lunch which is no easy task But can they adapt tothe potential loss of most of their revenue stream I dunno Do you            I leave you with one other question which Ive been wondering about forawhile When I was covering the Microsoft trial I got to see two AOLexecutives testify David Colburn who was on the stand twice and CEO SteveCase who was deposed one day when the trial was in recess They were bothsmart clever guys who could not be rattled and easily deflected even the mosthostile questions from Microsofts lawyers Colburn struck me as one meanSOB But the trait they had most in common is that were both real wiseacressarcastic and darkly funny Is that kind of sarcasm part of the AOL cultureAnd if so what does it say about the company            BestJoe
