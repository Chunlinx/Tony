                    Introduction        Fluid restriction and diuresis are frequently used in        the management of the acute respiratory distress syndrome        ARDS and a strategy of reduction in extravascular lung        water EVLW has been shown to reduce both ventilator and        intensive care unit ICU days          Intrathoracic blood volume ITBV comprises the left and        right heart blood volumes and the pulmonary blood volume        and has been shown to be a better indicator of cardiac        filling than the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure PAOP          Both EVLW and ITBV are measured using        doubleindicator dilution and the COLD Z system        Pulsion Medical Systems Munich Germany which requires        the insertion of a catheter into the femoral artery through        a  F sheath The technique also measures cardiac output        by analysis of the femoral artery thermodilution curve        Digital ischaemia although rare is a well known        complication of arterial cannulation     and this        problem may be exacerbated in patients with sepsis who have        microcirculatory disturbances including slowing of        capillary blood flow and local arteriolar constriction          and who also often require vasopressors for        hypotension A clinical concern exists therefore about        the safety of femoral artery cannulation in the critically        ill patients who may potentially benefit from this        sophisticated monitoring        Following insertion of the femoral artery catheter        peripheral tissue perfusion is usually assessed by regular        clinical examination of skin colour capillary return and        temperature all of which are subjective measures The        presence or absence of pedal pulses and measurement of        maximum calf occlusion pressures assess only gross changes        in large vessel flow Single point laser Doppler flowmetry        has been employed successfully as a technique for measuring        skin blood flow                        but there are several methodological        drawbacks associated with the technique These include the        potential influence of local perfusion by contact with        traditional laser Doppler probes   the small sampling        area of single point measurements which because of the        spatial heterogeneity of the cutaneous microvasculature        might not be representative of overall flow    and        the long time needed to make multiple measurements        Scanning laser Doppler flowmetry is a recent development           of the laser Doppler technique that may overcome        these drawbacks A laser beam is directed to scan over a        predetermined area and thousands of individual measurements        of perfusion are made These data are stored electronically        and converted into both greyscale photographic and        colourcoded perfusion images Subsequently regions of        interest can be outlined on these images and mean perfusion        within them calculated        This new technique was used to assess the influence upon        pedal cutaneous perfusion of the insertion of a femoral        artery catheter for the purpose of measuring ITBV EVLW and        cardiac output CO using the Pulsion COLD system                    Materials and methods        Following hospital ethical committee approval and after        obtaining informed consent  patients in a single        intensive care unit were studied All were intubated        ventilated and sedated and required cardiovascular support        with vasoactive drugs Following the clinical decision to        insert a femoral artery catheter the patients were        randomized to right or left leg catheterization None had        either historical nor current clinical evidence of        peripheral arterial disease Room temperature was kept        constant at C and both legs were uncovered for a  min        equilibrium period All measurements were made immediately        before and after insertion of the femoral artery catheter        Pulsiocath  L Pulsion Munich Germany and  h        subsequently All catheterizations were performed by a        single individual and involved a standard Seldinger        technique and insertion of a  F catheter through a  F        sheath        The mean systemic arterial blood pressure was measured        using a gauge cannula positioned within the radial        artery Calf occlusion pressure was measured using a hand        held sonic Doppler and a standard sphygmomanometer cuff        the maximum in either the dorsalis pedis or posterior        tibial artery being recorded as the value Vasoactive drug        doses were recorded at the time of each measurement        Laser Doppler scans Moor LDI Moor Instruments Ltd        Axminster Devon UK approximate cost   of the        plantar aspect of both feet were made from a distance of         cm This distance was chosen as the closest from which a        scan of the entire sole of the foot could always be        included In each case the laser Doppler scanner was        positioned to ensure that the laser beam was perpendicular        to the patients feet From each set of data two images        were simultaneously produced and stored electronically a        greyscale photographic image and a colourcoded perfusion        map On the photographic image the sole of the foot was        outlined which equated to a mean of over   individual        perfusion measurements on the corresponding blood flow        image allowing calculation of mean perfusion units PUs        for each foot for comparison with the other side The        results were analysed statistically using the MannWhitney        Utest                    Results        The laser Doppler scans were easy to make Fig  and        the computer software supplied with the scanner allowed        simple measurement of mean perfusion within the outlined        foot There were no complications associated with catheter        insertion        There were no significant changes in mean systemic        arterial blood pressure or maximal occlusion pressures        between preinsertion and postinsertion measurements Table         Furthermore there were no significant changes in any        of these parameters when they were measured  h following        catheterization        All the patients were receiving vasopressor agents over        the  h study period norepinephrine  gkg per        min and epinephrine  gkg per min Dobutamine         gkg per min was also administered to seven        patients No alterations to the patients doses were made        between arterial catheterization and the first        postcatheterisation measurement There was no significant        change in any of these drug dosages  h following catheter        insertion          P values for norepinephrine        epinephrine and dobutamine   and         respectively        There was no significant reduction in foot cutaneous        perfusion measured with the laser Doppler scanner either        between the first two or between the second and final        measurements following insertion of the catheters Table         Prior to catheter insertion the mean difference in        foot perfusion insertion minus noninsertion legs was         PUs following insertion this value was  PUs          P   and at  h  PUs          P                      Discussion        ARDS describes a pathological syndrome characterized by        an immunological reaction to various insults that results        in diffuse alveolar damage It is commonly associated with        sepsis and has a mortality of  Mitchell         et al   showed that patients with        ARDS managed with diuresis fluid restriction and guided by        the measurement of EVLW had significantly less EVLW than        those managed conventionally using the PAOP furthermore a         reduction in EVLW was associated with a reduction        in ventilator and ICU days However fluid management in        patients with ARDS and septic shock can be difficult Fluid        restriction in patients with septic shock may exacerbate        haemodynamic instability increase inotropic requirement        and lead to vital organ hypoperfusion Thus if this        strategy is to be used circulatory volume status and        endorgan function must be carefully monitored        Following insertion of a femoral artery catheter prior        to the measurement of EVLW and ITBV using doubleindicator        dilution peripheral perfusion has usually been assessed by        regular clinical examination for capillary return warmth        presence of pedal pulses and measurement of maximum calf        occlusion pressures More objective techniques of measuring        cutaneous perfusion are available   but these do not        lend themselves to everyday clinical use Conventional        singlepoint laser Doppler flowmetry LDF has been        successfully used to assess the cutaneous microcirculation        in a variety of clinical applications Several studies have        demonstrated the ability of LDF to distinguish patients        with established peripheral vascular disease from normal        patients    and it has been used to assess the        viability of tissue flaps     LDF has also been        useful in the measurement of cutaneous perfusion following        percutaneous transluminal angioplasty   in patients        with peripheral vascular disease and following the        administration of vasoactive agents          Several comparative studies have validated LDF with        other methods of measuring skin blood flow    but        the failure of the technique to gain widespread acceptance        in clinical practice is secondary to the methodological        drawbacks associated with it Variation in the number of        perfused capillaries and local differences in the        vasodilator response characteristics of vessels cause local        differences in blood flow of up to sixfold   The        sampling area of singlepoint laser Doppler probes is        dependent upon their geometry but is usually between  and         mm and because of the spatial heterogeneity of tissue        blood flow single measurements may not be representative        of overall local cutaneous blood flow    It has        been suggested that calculation of the mean of up to six        measurements each taken over  s will reduce the error        but clearly this is time consuming   Direct contact        with the skin is necessary with traditional laser Doppler        probes and there are frequent difficulties in maintaining        the same point of contact making sequential measurements        open to inaccuracy   furthermore pressure may        influence local perfusion itself          The recent development of the scanning laser Doppler        technique    allows the rapid measurement of flow        over a large predetermined area and by collecting        reflected light via mirrors the previously requisite probe        and optic cables are dispensed with and there is no contact        with the skin itself The scanner is mounted on a portable        stand and can be positioned to allow imaging around a         axis Figs and  It is run by a portable notebook        computer which allows the operator to predetermine the area        in which flow is to be sampled The laser is then scanned        in a continuous rasta pattern over the tissue A        measurement is made every  ms and up to   individual        measurements can be made in less than  min The perfusion        data is transformed instantaneously into a greyscale        photographic image and a corresponding colour perfusion        image is generated with different colours representing        different levels of flow The associated computer software        allows either the whole image or smaller regions of        interest on either the colour or photographic images to be        outlined and mean perfusion calculated within this        area        The technique is noninvasive and because of the        multiple measurements made over a wide area the error        associated with the spatial heterogeneity of cutaneous        vessels when making sequential measurements from the same        point is removed The technique has been validated against        flow models conventional singlepoint laser Doppler        flowmetry and other established methods of assessing skin        perfusion      and has been used to measure        perfusion in hepatic   and colonic   tissue        Amongst cutaneous applications it has been successfully        used to assess burn depth   skin flap viability          the cutaneous response to inflammation   and the        therapeutic response of psoriatic plaques to psoralen and        longwave ultravioletA radiation therapy PUVA treatment          Other clinical applications of laser Doppler imaging        to the measurement of cutaneous blood flow include the        effects of postural changes in blood flow in venous leg        ulcers   the assessment of digital perfusion following        arterial repair   skin perfusion overlying benign and        malignant breast disease   and the effect of        prostaglandins on ischaemic ulcers          Femoral artery catheterization has an associated limb        threatening complication rate of up to  and can        jeopardise peripheral perfusion   Femoral arterial        trauma with associated thrombosis and limb threatening        ischaemia following catheterization will be clinically        obvious Standard postcatheterization observations usually        involve measurement of calf occlusion pressures and in        this study these were not influenced by insertion of the        catheter        More subtle changes in cutaneous flow may be more        difficult to establish using clinical observation        particularly in patients who are receiving vasoactive drugs        secondary to their septic condition this group of patients        may be particularly at risk of critical peripheral        ischaemia Furthermore by their very nature these        techniques are wholly subjective Scanning laser Doppler        flowmetry allows objective measurement of cutaneous blood        flow and is able to detect changes in cutaneous perfusion        that are not detected by the human eye We were not able to        demonstrate any significant alteration in pedal cutaneous        perfusion either immediately following catheterization or         h later Despite the vasoactive drugs that the patients        were receiving the presence of the femoral catheter did        not appear to reduce the blood supply to the skin        Femoral artery catheterization for the purpose of        measuring ITBW EVLW and CO does not compromise peripheral        cutaneous perfusion in critically ill patients Scanning        laser Doppler flowmetry is easily used to assess cutaneous        perfusion in the ICU and provides an objective alternative        to standard clinical evaluation of limb blood flow It also        has the potential to assess cutaneous perfusion following        other interventions either mechanical or        pharmacological
