                            Schizophrenia is a devastating mental illness and a major contributor to the global        burden of disease In their quest to understand schizophrenia epidemiology John McGrath        and colleagues have previously undertaken a systematic review of schizophrenia        incidencethat is the number of new cases diagnosed each year in a specified population        see         BMC Medicine  e They now report results from a second systematic        review that examines published studies on the prevalence of the diseaseie on the number        of people who are suffering from the disease at a given time or within a specified time        interval Incidence studies can suggest risk factors that may underlie variations in the        disease Prevalence studies are central to health systems planning        Analyzing a total of  estimates from  studies and covering  countries they        calculated the following median prevalence estimates  per  for point prevalence        defined as prevalence during any interval of less than a month  for period prevalence        defined as prevalence during a period from  to  months  for lifetime prevalence        the proportion of individuals in the population who have ever manifested the disease and        who are alive on a given day and  for lifetime morbid risk which attempts to include        the entire lifetime of a birth cohort both past and future and includes those deceased at        the time of the survey        These numbers are consistent with key policy documents about point prevalence but        suggest that the  estimate for lifetime prevalence given in many textbooks is an        overestimate This estimate the authors suggest is another example where the research        community needs to review their belief systems in the face of data Another often quoted        statistic namely that schizophrenia affects about one in a hundred most sensibly refers        to lifetime morbid risk data Here as well the systematic analysis suggests that the        reality is somewhat lower and the authors suggest that if we wish to provide the general        public with a measure of the likelihood that individuals will develop schizophrenia during        their lifetime then a more accurate statement would be that about seven to eight        individuals per  will be affected        The authors were surprised to find no difference in prevalence between males and        females because their incidence review had found a malefemale risk ratio of  On the        other hand the incidence study had revealed a higher incidence among migrant groups than        among nativeborn individuals and this was true for prevalence estimates as well Compared        to economically developed nations the prevalence of schizophrenia is lower in developing        nations which is consistent with the literature showing that the course ie prognosis        of schizophrenia is better in developing nations        Systematic reviews are secondary research where the object of scrutiny is not the        prevalence of schizophrenia per se but the literature on the topic and the estimates in        this review have to be treated accordingly Regardless of exact numbers however the        authors conclude that many people with schizophrenia have persisting symptoms despite the        best mix of interventions we can offer It has been estimated that current interventions        can at most reduce  of disease burden thus the authors conclude that this is a        powerful argument for investing in applied and basic research
