Organizations are like elephants  slow to changeJames A BelascoOver the last ten years many civil legal services leadersstakeholders program directors and managers throughout the UnitedStates began to wonder whether the civil legal services deliverystructure that had been in place for a quarter of a century waspositioned to meets its many future challenges Funding wasdeclining or stagnant many people in leadership positions wereweary after years of fighting for survival demand for the deliveryof quality legal services was increasing staff were questioningtheir work environments and their personal goals technology wasfundamentally changing the practice of law and society was growingincreasingly inhospitable to the needs of poor people The legalservices delivery system created in another time and place didntseem to be working in the ways that westakeholders staffclientsexpected it to work And although we were proud of ourcollective past many of us had serious doubts as to whether thedelivery system that we had created and that had performed wellfor us and for our clients for the past twenty years was the mosteffective and efficient delivery system for the difficult andchallenging times aheadPrograms and program directors responded to these concerns indifferent ways Some pursued strategic planning initiatives Othersengaged in aggressive resource development pursued alternativemethods of providing legal services to clients reconfigured theirorganizations or in some instances took their skills and talentselsewhere And unfortunately too many of us did nothingIn  and again in  the Legal Services Corporationrecognized that legal services programs were going to have tochange the method and manner in which they conducted their businessif they were going to remain viable and responsive to the needs oflow income persons Moreover LSC wanted to encourage all programsto pursue some semblance of planning LSC therefore required itsgrantees to begin to examine on a statewide level how allgrantees in a particular state would serve in the present and planto serve in the future the civil legal needs of lowincomepersons In  LSCs state planning initiative was primarilyfocused on how grantees would work together to address fundingshortfalls and to respond to the  restrictions In  LSCProgram Letters  and  broadened the scope of the stateplanning initiative asking grantees to determine how they couldexpand services and ensure that all clients received similar levelsof assistance regardless of their location in the state or otherfactors such as language disability or political popularityIn essence these two Program Letters asked grantees to expandtheir horizons from whats best for the clients in my servicearea to whats best for clients throughout the state Programswere requested to develop plans to coordinate and integrate theirwork in seven important areasenhancing client access andefficiency in delivering high quality legal assistance usingtechnology to expand access and enhance services promoting clientselfhelp and preventive legal education and advice coordinatinglegal work and training collaborating with the private barexpanding resources to support legal services and designing asystem configuration that enhances client services reducesbarriers and operates efficiently and effectively LSCs granteeswere asked toInvestigate the strengths and weaknesses of and resourcesavailable to individual programs as well as the overall strengthsand weaknesses of and resources available to the states legalservices systemAssess the needs of the communities served by theprograms and the overall systemAnticipate changes and trends that will most likelyaffect civil legal services programs in coming yearsandDevise a plan of action on a statewide basis to addressthe identified needs of low income persons in the present whileensuring that the civil legal needs of future generations oflowincome persons can be efficiently and effectivelyaddressedA handful of states answered LSCs call to action Theyconsolidated programs to increase efficiency and deploy resourcesmore effectively they took advantage of technology advances toimprove intake systems they expanded the network of stakeholdersto increase the support and guidance available to serviceproviders Their successes inspired LSC and other nationalorganizations to a deeper involvement in state planning and higherexpectations for all statesIn January  the LSC Board of Directors approved LSCsyear Strategic Direction Plan This document commits LSC todramatically expand the impact of legal services programsthroughout the nation by improving access to legal services amongeligible persons while enhancing the quality of the servicesdelivered The Plan highlights LSCs State Planning Initiative asthe primary strategy for achieving these goals In December LSC issued its third program letter on state planning ProgramLetter  renewed LSCs challenge to its grantees to activelyengage in assessing their delivery practices and policies and theallocation of their legal services dollars Program Letter makes clear that the state planning initiative will continue to beLSCs highest priorityWhat does LSC mean when it talks about state planning It hasoften been pointed out that the term state planning does notcapture the full scope of the activities that are included in theprocess as it is playing out across the country Developing a planis only the beginning of an ongoing effort that includesimplementation of the plans initiatives continuous outreach tonew partners regular assessment of progress toward goals andmodifications of the plan as circumstances changeBecause these elements are all included in the concept ofstrategic planning as it is currently understood in managementpractice one advantage of the term state planning is that itemphasizes that what is involved is strategic planning for stateequal justice communitiesDeveloping structures and processes for building and maintainingcomprehensive integrated statewide civil legal assistancedelivery systems may define the process more accurately but it iscertainly a mouthful Building state justice communities capturesthe concepts of partnership and shared responsibility that areinvolved but may underemphasize the ultimate goal to which thebuilding of the community is directedthe creation and maintenanceof a system capable of providing equal justice for lowincomepeople In the end actions do speak louder than words It doesntreally matter if we talk about state planning or state justicecommunities or worldclass delivery systems or the creation ofcomprehensive integrated and coordinated legal services deliverysystems It just matters that we do it In this Report howeverthe term state planning should be understood in its broadest senseas inclusive of all these concepts and various structuresprocesses and individual initiatives described in the followingsectionsOne final thought Although state planning is LSCs highestpriority and we have put considerable resources into it over thelast three years LSC did not embark upon this journey alone As weproceeded with state planning activities our national partnersalso introduced projects targeted to the same goalsthe creationin every state of a state justice community collaborating on thecreation and maintenance of a civil legal assistance system fullyresponsive to the needs of lowincome people Among theseinitiatives we would like to specifically recognize are the jointABANLADA SPAN State Planning Assistance Network project and thejoint NLADACLASP Project for the Future of Equal Justice On thestate level IOLTAbased funders including but not limited toIOLTA programs in Ohio Florida Pennsylvania Texas Virginia NewYork New Jersey and Michiganhave also been a key force in stateplanningThis Report describes progress that the legal services communityhas made in the six years since LSC issued its first Program Letteron the subject It identifies some lessons gleaned from theseachievements describes the growth in selected states towardbuilding a justice community capable of responding to the fullrange of civil legal needs of lowincome people Part II andidentifies some lessons that have emerged from successful orpromising planning processes as well as the particular structuresand strategies that these states have employed Part IIIWe acknowledge the hard work of building state justicecommunities and salute all those who have rolled up their sleevesto take part in this exciting effort We believe this reportdemonstrates there is a big payoff for clientswhich after allis what it is all aboutOver the past six years many states have developed a range ofinitiatives aimed at expanding access and improving services toclients Their achievements like the planning processes they havefollowed have varied according to local circumstances challengesand opportunities As expected one size truly does not fit allHowever there have been important similarities in terms ofsuccesses These includeObtaining or significantly expanding state funding forlegal servicesEstablishing systems for coordinating advocacy andtraining among programsMaking the court system more responsive and accessible tolowincome and pro se litigantsReconfiguring programs within a state to strengthencoordination access and servicesEstablishing structures to more creatively involve theprivate bar in the delivery of civil legal assistanceCreating and executing a statewide technology plan toimprove access and enhance deliveryDeveloping a statewide coordinated intake systemandExpanding the number of stakeholders within a statecommitted to the concept of equal justiceThis section describes the progress that has taken place in selected states toward building state justice communities capableof responding to the civil legal needs of their lowincomeresidents These states are at different stages in the planningprocess In a few states a fully developed state justice communityis in place and its accomplishments are paying off in terms ofexpanded and improved services to clients Some states havedeveloped key justice community institutions whose significantimprovements in the structure of civil legal assistance in theirstate position them to make real changes for clients Some statesare still in an early phase they have developed a plan that showsreal promise and are just beginning to build the structures andlaunch the initiatives to implement itThe states described here are by no means the only ones thathave made progress Others could have been included as well Somestates such as Connecticut Vermont and Hawaii made majorchanges in their delivery systems in  and  and are workingdiligently to realize the full potential of those systems Otherssuch as New York Texas and North Carolina are engaged inpromising efforts to overcome particular challenges associated withtheir size and diversity Still othersKentucky WisconsinLouisianawhile relatively slow to embrace the concept of stateplanning have within the past year made significant progress inaddressing issues of access and quality in their statesWhat we hope to demonstrate in describing what has been achievedin these selected states is both their differences and theirsimilarities the range of different processes structures andstrategies that have led to their successes and the basiccommonalties that underlie them in terms of vision inclusivenessleadership and commitment Each of the states described in thissection provides insights and lessons that can be of benefit toothersIn  California in recognition of the states sizediversity and complexity asked LSC to allow it to first developregional plans for the creation of regional justice communitiesLSC approved this proposal and in October received regional plansfrom five regions The current configuration and planning successesin each of these regions are described belowThe Northern Region Since April  as the result of programmergers Legal Services of Northern California has been the soleLSCfunded provider for the entire region with nine officescovering  counties This region has made significant progress indeveloping a comprehensive integrated delivery system to providehighquality services to clients throughout northern California Inaddition to instituting a programwide Regional Counsel advocatesupportcase review system which emphasizes collaboration andcocounseling on common issues throughout the whole region LSNC iscoordinating and advancing a regionwide advocacy agenda in welfareto work and housing and economic development This region has alsodeveloped additional resources for regionwide initiatives such asa  threeyear grant from the Rockefeller Foundation toincrease the capacities of three communitybased organizationsThe Bay Area The Bay Area was one of three geographical areasin the United States involuntarily reconfigured by LSC On January  Bay Area Legal Aid Bay Legal became the only LSCfundedprogram for all seven counties in the San Francisco area The newprogram headquartered in Oakland was the result of a mergerbetween San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance SFNLAFCommunity Legal Services in San Jose and Legal Foundation ofContra Costa In FY  Bay Legal was the recipient of a LSC Technology Initiative Grant This grant will enable Bay Legaladvocates and clients throughout the region to use networkedcomputer terminals to easily access forms and information In itsfirst year Bay Legal also successfully conducted a regionwideCampaign for Justice fundraising effort which brought insignificant funds to all of its officesThe Central California Region Five LSCfunded programspreviously served the central California region Today the regionis served by three LSCfunded providersCalifornia Rural LegalAssistance CRLA Central California Legal Services CCLS andGreater Bakersfield Legal Assistance GBLA These three programscreated the California Rural Justice Consortium a planning entitydedicated to the vision of a seamless justice system in the regionThe Consortium is working on issues throughout the regionincluding the legal problems of migrant sheepherders and health andenvironmental issues affecting rural clients In order to addressthe access barriers that face rural and isolated communities andenhance communication between and among the three programs theprograms have developed highly sophisticated videoconferencingcapability The three programs have also agreed to allow andencourage staff members to move freely among the three programs inorder to respond to clients needs most effectivelyThe Los Angeles Basin As a result of the merger between theLegal Aid Foundation of Long Beach and the Legal Aid Foundation ofLos Angeles there are now three programs serving this region Theprograms have hired a Joint Advocacy Coordinator who staffs theJoint Advocacy Project to respond to major issues that cut acrossprogram lines and can be addressed most effectively by advocatesfrom multiple programs One of the first projects jointly pursuedby the LA Basin programs will address the diverse languages spokenby Asian client population Under a grant from the Open SocietyInstitute the programs contracted with the Asian Pacific AmericanLegal Center of Southern California to provide centralized intakefor Asian clients who do not speak English If the clients requireextended service or representation their cases are then matchedwith staff of any of the three programs depending on the specificlanguage capabilities of each program Through this project the LABasin has found a way to serve Asian clients who do not speakEnglishThe programs are also poised to make a major investment intechnology to expand the delivery of legal services The ICANproject funded initially by an LSC technology initiative grantwas developed by the Legal Aid Society of Orange County LASOC tohelp pro per clients fill out Judicial Council forms in familylaw matters Future plans includes replicating ICAN throughout theregion and locating kiosks at libraries that can be used by clientsfor online filings of certain legal mattersThe Southern Region The two programs in this region the LegalAid Society of San Diego and Inland Counties Legal Services wererelatively late in regionwide planning Recently these twoprograms have committed to an agenda of specific collaborativeprojects including joint technology consultations joint effortsby the two Boards of Directors in areas of mutual interest jointeconomic development projects and assistance in developing intakesystems Both programs are recipients of partnership grants torun projects to help Spanishspeaking pro per clients in theirrespective county courthouses Both are also active participants inother statewide initiatives For example Inland and San Diego haveboth partnered with CRLA to respond to migrant clients needs in theCoachella and Imperial valleys However significant integrationand planning work remains to be done in this area of the stateState Activities LSCs  call for state planning coincidedwith an active period within Californias justice community TheAccess to Justice Commission was created in  as a coordinatingbody to seek support for legal services programs and developstrategies to address the severe lack of access to justice that hadbeen identified earlier by a State Barsponsored blue ribbon studygroup The membership of the Commission consisted ofrepresentatives from the bench and bar including many longtermsupporters of legal services academics and business labor andreligious leaders as well as representatives of the providercommunity The first priority of the Commission was resourcedevelopment and the Commission led a sustained effort in theCalifornia legislature to obtain state funds to support theprovision of civil legal services to lowincome persons In California appropriated for the first time  million for legalservices The same amount was appropriated in FY  A increase to  million is expected for The Commissions second priority was the improvement of accessto the courts for pro per litigants The Commission and plannersdedicated  of the state appropriation for civil legal servicesto fund innovative projects that partner legal services providersand the courts to assist lowincome selfrepresented litigantsWith support from LSCs Technology Initiative Grants LSCfundedprograms are leaders and active participants in Californias planto utilize technology to expand access and improve legal servicesdelivery Other promising technology initiatives include theCalJustice Technology Project of the Public Interest Clearinghousewhich focuses on increasing client access to the judicial systemthrough the development of an artificial intelligencebased tool tohelp advocates quickly spot issues in and strategize about casesThe state has also recently adopted statewide priorities forconnectivity and communication developed minimum technologystandards and created mechanisms to share best practicesOther statewide nontechnology initiatives includeInterprogram and interregion collaborative projects todevelop new substantive expertise and new programs to respond tochanges in policy and law impacting upon lowincomeclientsA system of advocacy training and litigation supportthrough a network of support centers in the areas of health youthhousing and economic developmentThe development of standards and assessment toolstovaluate the support centersState planning in Colorado began in  with the formation ofthe

and ensuring effective delivery of services by thefederally funded programs Initial efforts addressed a variety ofinternal issues including training and support increased use oftechnology more efficient and uniform intake and the provision oflegal advice and brief service and meeting the needs ofparticularly vulnerable populations including migrants NativeAmericans nonEnglish speaking persons immigrants and disabledand institutionalized individualsProgress was made on a number of issues important to the legalservices community but despite signs of chronic weakness in twoprograms the program LSC structure was left intact During LSCs competition the service area of one of these programs wasawarded to an adjacent program The other received limited fundingand ultimately was provided a very short grant Together with LSCs Program Letters this decision provided the impetus for moreserious discussion of program configuration which resulted in theformation of a single statewide program Colorado Legal Serviceseffective October  The formation of a single statewide program was adopted tobreathe life into a single program that will provide meaningfulaccess to high quality legal services in the pursuit of justicefor as many lowincome people throughout Colorado as possibleThis vision became a touchstone for decisions as to programgovernance delivery issues including office staffing supporttraining technology and increased access to high quality legaladvice brief service and more extensive legal representationDuring the consolidation process the Legal Services Corporationtechnical assistance grants enabled the program to utilize theservices of a skilled consultant and facilitator to move theprocess to conclusion to send program staff to visit and observeother programs with well respected and technologicallysophisticated centralized intake systems to bring experts to theprogram to help design a transition to statewide administrative andpersonnel systems and helped fund the statewide staff meetingwhich launched and celebrated the new statewide programThe goals of the single statewide program included establishinguniform standards for high quality legal representation increasedadministrative efficiency and the provision of more effectiveaccurate and helpful brief service and advice increased trainingtechnical assistance and support for all staff but particularlyfor casehandlers in small remote rural offices and significantlyincreased access for more lowincome Coloradans in need of serviceMany of these goals have been met

General Assemblyappropriated funds in   to serve the civil needs ofvictims of domestic and family violence and  in fiscal yearThe coordinated and focused efforts of the State Planning Grouphave also brought major positive changes to pro bono activitiesthroughout the state includingThe Colorado Supreme Court revised Rule  of theColorado Rules of Professional Conduct effective January  to provide an aspirational goal that every lawyer provide not lessthan  hours per year of pro bono services each yearThe Colorado Supreme Court amended the Code of JudicialConduct to more clearly specify that judges may engage inactivities to encourage lawyers to perform pro bonoserviceThe Colorado Bar Associations Board of Governors in May approved a set of guidelines to encourage pro bono service

maximize local pro bono participationwhile further coordinating statewide technical assistance and legalsupport provided to attorneys who participate in pro bono programsas well as increased recognition of volunteer lawyers at both thelocal and state levelThe relationship between LSCfunded providers and their partnersin the state justice community in Colorado has always beenpositive The consolidation of the federallyfunded programs into asingle statewide entity has provided the opportunity for increasedcommunication and collaboration throughout the state both withinlegal services and between legal services providers and theirallies in the private bar client and local communities and withother key constituencies It is expected that continued planningand concerted effort will result in higher quality service providedmore uniformly throughout the state and that clients in increasingnumbers will be the beneficiaries of a more thoughtful and bettercoordinated state justice community in ColoradoFloridaFlorida planning efforts began in  with The Florida Bar andFlorida Bar Foundations Joint Commission on the Delivery of LegalAssistance study and report Its recommendation to increase probono engagement was addressed in  when the Florida SupremeCourt mandated pro bono reporting for Florida Bar membersRecommendations contained in the  plan also resulted in theinstitution of triannual peer reviews for all Florida BarFoundation Foundation funded programs including the statestwelve LSC organizations Recommendations that programs improvetechnology capacities were addressed in large part by a revolvingloan fund established by the Foundation that enabled LSC programsand other IOTA recipients to purchase needed computer and relatedtechnology In  the states companion system was created toserve clients whom LSCfunded organizations could notrepresentMore recently and in response to LSCs state planning lettersplanning moved to a new level when the directors of Floridaslargest legal services programs held a retreat to consider how toimprove civil legal assistance in the state A Technical AssistanceGrant from LSC matched by a grant from The Florida Bar Foundationenabled the directors to retain the services of a consultant whohas continued to guide the planning processAt the retreat the  directors examined changes in clientneeds and the practice of law over the past ten years They askedthemselves what accomplishments they and their staff were mostproud of and how they could expand these achievements Theyconsidered ways in which the  civil legal services programs inthe state including the  LSC entities should expandpartnerships to ensure that lowincome Floridians had access to afull array of the highest quality legal services possible Theyrealized that significant change in the service delivery system wasneeded because of the increasing complexity of the practice of lawthe number of legal services providers in the state therestrictions on LSC recipients and most important changes in lawsand programs affecting clients It became clear that restructuringFloridas delivery system could increase the work that made staffmost proud and brought clients the best services The directorsdeveloped the concept of statewide clientcentered energeticaffirmative advocacy as a key value against which to measure allproposals for change Its elements were identified asShared responsibility for the statewide deliverysystemCollaborative attitudes on the part of advocates andprogramsStrategic thinking about the most effective way toachieve results for clientsAdvocacy skills needed to provide effective highqualityservicesClient centered provision of servicesOngoing selfassessmentA survey was sent to all staff at the  nonprofit civil legalservices asking them to describe how they could become or maintainthemselves as energetic affirmative advocates as well as whatsupport they might require and how collaborative efforts in thestate could meet those needs There were  responses from programs The results were reported to the equal justice communityand posted on the Florida Legal Services

December  Afinal version was adopted at the end of February The  State Plan divides the state into six regions andhighlights a regional approach in its collaboration andconfiguration strategies Each region houses LSC and othernonprofit civil legal services providers bound together by acommitment to collaborate Programs in each region will sign anenforceable agreement enunciating the specific activities eachorganization will undertake In January  LSC asked the Floridaplanners to more carefully explore whether the currentconfiguration of LSC and nonLSC funded programs is one that willbest advance their goals LSC requested that the planners seriouslyconsider the advantages of having one LSCfunded program anchoreach of the six regions identified in the planPrograms have already moved to carry out some of the Plansrecommendations All  programs receiving Foundation funds havejointly hired a statewide resource director The Foundation alongwith The Florida State Bar and several law firms

program Thus programs willbe measured not only on their individual contributions to regionaland state planning but also on the quality of their regionsaccomplishments The Foundation anticipates that this approach toevaluations will help maintain the productive pace of the pastyears planning and emphasize the importance of joint endeavorsFurthermore planning leaders have indicated that configuration isa priority for planners in  and have developed committees andstrategies to address this critical issueThe LSCfunded programs in Illinois have a long history ofworking together on joint projects state support and othermatters In  in response to LSCs first program letter theprograms requested that the Illinois State Bar Association and theChicago Bar Association join them in the planning process In April under the authority of these bar associations the IllinoisEqual Justice Project was established The mission of the IllinoisEqual Justice Project included protecting the integrity andaccessibility of the legal system for all Illinois residentseducating individuals families and groups about the selfhelpprocess within the judicial system and promoting costeffectivelegal services for low income individuals and familiesThe Equal Justice Project brought together a very diverse groupof individuals including representatives of the lowincome clientcommunity social service agencies government agencies civillegal services organizations religious communities the judiciarylawyers and cultural organizations to address the need forcomprehensive costeffective legal services in the State ofIllinois The project was governed by a Steering Committee Inaddition three working groups were created NonAdjudicatoryProblem Solving User Friendly Pro Se Adjudication and LegalService Delivery System The Project adopted six guidingprinciplesEqual justice is a basic right which is fundamental toour democracy Thus the integrity of our country our state andour justice system depends on protecting and enforcing the rightsof all people on an equal basisIllinois residents must be educated to protect theirlegal rights and accept their legal responsibilities They mustalso have

of existing and emergingtechnologiesLegitimate political discourse requires constructivealternatives Attacks on the current system often based onmisleading anecdotes have failed to enlighten participants orimprove services to the public andThe organizations and institutions which comprise ourjustice system are largely local Equal justice is an integralpart of the general public welfare and funding equal justice is afundamental obligation of state and county governmentEach working group met several times to develop recommendationsfor changes to the legal services delivery system Therecommendations were adopted by the Chicago and Illinois State BarAssociations and along with an appendix of existing and proposedimplementation measures submitted to the Governor the IllinoisGeneral Assembly the Illinois Supreme Court local governmentsstate agencies legal services programs bar associations andindividual lawyers The focus was on creating a true system ofequal justice in Illinois The report also recognized work thathad already begun among all legal services programs with theestablishment of a Statewide Legal Services Delivery and TechnologyWorking Group which was meeting to share information on the use oftechnologyAs part of the goals developed by the Equal Justice Project theChicago and Illinois State Bar Associations agreed to support theintroduction of the Illinois Equal Justice Act in the IllinoisGeneral Assembly The bill failed in the  session but passedthe following year Although stripped of any funding mechanism thebill authorized the establishment the Illinois Equal JusticeFoundation to receive and distribute any money appropriated by thelegislature Finally in the  session  wasappropriated While less than the  sought by thegovernor it is a startIn June  LSC commented upon the Illinois State Plan andimplementation to date In its feedback letter LSC noted that itwas impressed with the steps you have taken and will continue totake under this plan to develop an integrated and comprehensivedelivery system that is designed to meet the present as well as thefuture needs of lowincome person within your state However LSCalso asked the planners to reopen their consideration of theconfiguration of the LSCfunded programs believing that a thoroughreview of this plan leads to the almost inescapable conclusion thatwhile reconfiguration may not be a frontburner issue within thisstate there is merit to seriously exploring reconfiguration of thefive LSCfunded programs into three LSC also suggested that theplanners develop ways to involve more clients and communityrepresentatives in the planning process and develop plans to expandtheir funding baseReconsideration of the configuration of the LSC programs has ledto decisions to consolidate the five organizations In  finalreconfiguration of the LSCfunded delivery system will becompleted leaving three programsPrairie State Legal ServicesLand of Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation and the LegalAssistance Foundation of Metropolitan ChicagoThe programs have also followed LSC and the Equal JusticeProject recommendations to consider more streamlined andcooperative ways of operating While Illinois initially had fivefederally funded legal services programs planners identifiedanother twentytwo programs that were providing legal services tothe economically disadvantaged Many of these programs were smalland most operated within Cook County In November  the firstever meeting of all of these programs was held The Legal ServicesCorporation provided funding for two facilitators and lodging andmeal costs were paid for by the Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois Theprograms met for two days to plan areas of need and cooperationWorking groups were established to coordinate training statewideto focus on the establishment of a statewide website and tocontinue coordination and sharing in technology mattersThe programs continue to explore avenues for improving servicesto clients With funding from the Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinoisthe Technology Working Group and representatives from CARPLS theChicagobased hotline and referral services Legal AssistanceFoundation of Metropolitan Chicago Prairie State Legal Servicesand Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance Foundation have formed a BestPractices group These individuals have visited one anothersprograms as well as four additional model hotlinetelephone intakesystems around the country As they have observed better moreefficient and more innovative ways of doing business newprocedures have been adoptedIn cooperation with IIT Kent College of Law legal servicesprograms are also involved in establishing a Technology Center forLaw and the Public Interest This will be a single database thatwill have three portals for three separate interest groupsincluding a portal for clients that would provide them access toclient community legal education materials and selfhelp legalmaterials This would expand upon materials that are currentlyavailable from Southern Illinois SelfHelp Center and the Illinoislegal services website A second portal would provide informationand video streaming training for pro bono attorneys The finalportal would provide access for legal services staff to trainingmaterials discussion groups legal research and other matters Thetwelve partners in this collaboration have recently signedagreements specifying the duties of each partner The site will belocated at IITKent College of LawThe Illinois Equal Justice Foundation has recently made itsfirst grants from money appropriated by the Illinois GeneralAssembly Because of the limited money available the first grantswere restricted to funding for civil legal services and hotlinesLater this year the Foundation will initiate a study to evaluatethe most effective way in which pro bono can be encouraged andsupported At the present time Illinois has a Pro Bono Centerwhose function is to work with the organized bar and legal servicesprograms in encouraging participation in existing pro bono programsas well as to help develop new pro bono programs in Illinois Thefocus of the study will be to determine what changes need to bemade in the existing structure to allow the Center to effectivelymeet its mission or alternatively to recommend a new structureThis study will be funded by an LSC technical assistance grant andwill be coordinated with an ABA peer studyIn  the four LSCfunded programs in Indiana submitted astate plan to LSC that was seriously flawed The planners were toldthat their plan was nonresponsive to the issues identified in LSCProgram Letters  and  and in need of major work Indianawas instructed to submit a revised plan to LSC and develop acollaborative inclusive and valuesdriven plan and planningprocess that strengthens services to clients throughout thestateSerious planning within the legal services community began inearly  with a commitment to plan to plan on the part of thefour LSCfunded programs in the state at that time LSC gaveIndiana a technical assistance grant to hire a consultant to assistwith the planning efforts Over the course of a long series ofmeetings and discussions representatives of the boards and staffof the four programs reached the conclusion that if all clients inIndiana were to have access to high quality legal servicessignificant changes needed to be made in the configuration ofprograms within the state In September  the boards of allfour programs passed a resolution approving the concept of mergerAlthough merger discussions continued among the four programs inMarch  two of the programs did not vote in favor of the mergerplan and therefore the plan moved forward with only two programsLegal Services Organization of Indiana Inc and Legal Services ofNorthwest Indiana IncAs of December   Legal Services of Northwest IndianaInc joined with Legal Services Organization of Indiana IncLSOI by transferring its assets to LSOI LSOI then changed itsname to Indiana Legal Services Inc ILS and on January  became the only LSC funded program in Indiana ILS currently has amonth subgrant

and ILS and LSMVare in the process of developing referral protocols to ensure thatclients are referred to the appropriate organizationThe formation of ILS is based on the Legal Services Plandeveloped by the boards of LSOI and LSNI The plan describes thelegal work allocation of resources role of private attorneysrole of the client community role of service providers governanceand program operations and intake for Indiana Legal Services IncThe Plan provides for a minimum of nine offices and a memberboard that is appointed in proportion to poverty population fromthe  judicial districts throughout the stateThe major values included in the Legal Services Plan areThe need to remain responsive to and work with localcommunities The Indiana Legal Services Plan makes it clear thatILS must look at problems faced by the lowincome community fromboth a state and a local perspective ILS is designed so that itcan bring together statewide resources in order to meet the needsof local communities Priorities will be set statewide but eachregion of the state will have its own case acceptance guidelineswhich will take into consideration local needs and resources Eachregion will have a Regional Advisory Council with a large numberof client representatives which will develop these guidelines andwork with the local ILS office to ensure that it is meeting theneeds of clients in the regionThe need to ensure high quality legal work In order toensure that advocates throughout the state are linked to eachother the  programs developed the Indiana Justice Center in The IJC developed a website

formal collaborative arrangements in areassuch as technology planning and development and substantivesupport and training and creation of a framework for more ongoingplanning and systemwide decisionmaking regarding issues affectingthe entire system particularly with regard to substantive mattersnot being addressed The report concluded that the MCCJ should leadin planning and overseeing the implementation of these strategiesat the statewide levelMinnesotaState planning in Minnesota goes back to  when the sixLSCfunded programs in the state received a special planning grantto identify areas for coordination and cooperation The system inplace today is the result of the processes begun with that grantThe providers worked with the newly created Legal Assistance to theDisadvantaged

with disabilities and financiallydistressed family farmers continue to have access to legalservicesAdequate state support services such as trainingcommunity legal education materials and mechanisms for informationsharing continue to be available to all legal services providersincluding volunteer attorney programsThe Committee report concluded that while the Coalitionprograms and others are already a national model of coordinationand cooperation the programs should continue to search for areasin which they can achieve additional efficiencies and improveclient services through increased coordination and cooperationAmong the other recommendations of the Joint Committee that havesubsequently been implemented are the followingAn attorney registration fee increase to support

maintenance of a statewide delivery system that hasso many componentsAlthough some planning efforts took place in Ohio in response tothe legislative changes of  the recent round ofsuccessful planning efforts occurred because of two independentevents that merged to become an effective catalyst for change Inlate  the Ohio Legal Assistance Foundation OLAFa majorfunder of civil legal services throughout the statelaunched aprocess of comprehensive evaluation of each of its recipientsincluding the LSCfunded programs in the state These indepthevaluations used teams of respected legal services leaders fromthroughout the country and assessed the quality and effectivenessof each legal aid provider with regard to legal work clientinvolvement management and administrative functioning makingrecommendations for improvement as appropriate In January LSC independently launched its state planning initiative andselected Ohioa state wherein LSC funded  separate programsincluding two programs that served a single countyas one of itspriority states State plans were due into LSC by October  However since LSC was working closely with Ohio in planningactivities LSC quickly determined that any plan submitted to LSCon October   would not meet LSCs planning expectations noraddress the issues identified in Program Letters  and Accordingly LSC granted the Ohio planners a fivemonth extensionfor submission of their plan urging them to develop a planningprocess that is values driven articulates core capacities thatmust be in place throughout the state is sensitive to the needs ofall clients in Ohio and is inclusive of all of legal servicesstakeholders In addition the planning process and the plan itselfmust address the need for program collaboration and coordinationwithin the stateAs state planning activities were slowly initiated the programevaluations launched by OLAF were also proceeding OLAF extendedan invitation to the LSC planning consultant assigned to Ohio toparticipate in the evaluation of six of the LSCfunded legalservices providers in the state She accepted the invitation Asevaluations were completed it became increasingly apparent thatthe many strengths of the states civil legal assistance systemwere offset by significant weaknesses including variation inquality among the programs insufficient communication and lack ofshared responsibility for addressing problems on a statewidebasisIn mid the Ohio Planning Steering Committee was formed tocoordinate existing planning groups and to make sure planning waslaunched where it did not yet exist The Steering Committee was andis composed of representatives of legal services programs OLAFlaw schools pro bono programs the client communitycommunitybased organizations and the organized bar A consultantwas engaged by the state planners to facilitate the planningprocess Using the discussion draft on the hallmarks of acomprehensive integrate statewide civil legal assistance systemprepared by the Project for the Future of Equal Justice as a modelthe planners adopted as two overarching goals  the need for thecreation of a legal services delivery system that providescomprehensive integrated high quality legal services to the clientcommunity and   access to essential legal services forlowincome Ohioans such that they are able to secure substantiveand procedural equal justice Measuring the existing system in thestate against that vision the participants in the planning processquickly came to the realization that significant change wasnecessaryThe Steering Committee working through subcommittees produceda draft report setting action plans for activities aimed atbuilding an integrated statewide delivery system The plan wasshared with other stakeholders including all program directorswho then met as a group in early  for a frank and opendiscussion about configuration The Ohio State Plan TowardAchieving a Comprehensive Integrated Legal Services Delivery Systemwas submitted to LSC in March  It was quickly approved and thelegal services community in the state has spent the two years sincethen refining and implementing the plan mobilized by a new energyand a renewed sense of purposeA key component of the plan was the decision was to reduce the LSCfunded programs in the state to seven regional deliverysystems The reconfiguration process took place over the course of and has now been completed In addition to the LSCfundedprograms there are nonLSCfunded programs in three regions aswell as three statewide nonLSC funded programs ProSeniors whichserves senior citizens the Equal Justice Foundation whichprovides litigation advocacy and the OSLSA State Support CenterOSLSAPlanners also identified the development of an integrated andcoordinated statewide intake process as an essential component ofan effective delivery system for the state Among the specificgoals were the followingEstablish telephone access for clients in those parts ofthe state where it did not existCreate centralized regional telephone intake systems inthe seven new service delivery regions for all LSCfundedproviders as well as other providers where possibleEstablish a statewide telephone service with a tollfreenumber that will route callers to the appropriate regional intakesystemStandardize intake and case management software amongprograms to expedite intake and referralsStudy systems other programs use to provide advice andbrief services to clients and development of recommendations as tohow these service components can be standardized from program toprogramCurrently most of the regions have developed or are developinga regionwide intake system with the assistance of consultants andfunding provided by the Ohio Legal Assistance Foundation and fundsgranted by LSC under a technical assistance grant Several of theseregionwide intake systems are extremely innovative and offerpotential as a prototype for the stateUnder the leadership of a Technology Advisory Committee createdin early  and a Technology Coordinator hired in late supported by OLAF funds and originally housed at OSLSA the stateplanners adopted a technology plan in  that set minimumtechnology standards for all programs in the state as well aslongterm goalsIn  the Statewide Technology Coordinator launched aTechnology Task Force made up of two representatives from eachprogram one who is responsible for technology matters and one whocan effectively communicate how their program provides services tothe client community All providers have now met most of thestandards which include upgrades of computer hardware andsoftware computers for all staff desktop internet accessindividual email and electronic legal research capacity Thestate has a statewide website and planners are consideringwebbased intakeThe plan includes a heightened commitment to client empowermentclient and community education and expansion of pro se optionsOSLSA is coordinating a Pro Se Project funded by OLAF and the OhioState Bar Foundation to develop standardized pro se materials foruse across the state set up two pro se pilot projects in ruralOhio and develop training materials for pro se clinics LSC hasawarded the State Support Center a Technology Integration Grant fordevelopment of webbased pro se assistance with tutorials forvictims of domestic violence A NAPIL Fellow is cataloguing allcommunity education material currently in use throughout the stateand reviewing them for accuracy duplication and needed changesNew mechanisms for effective and efficient dissemination ofcommunity education materials will be developed by communityeducation and technology plannersLegal work is coordinated through OSLSA and the LitigationDirectors Task Force which was created during the planningprocess The task force has set two initial goals to prioritizecoordinate and develop a work plan for legal work on a statewideand regional level and to develop resources to support this legalwork through pooled resources of programs collaborations with lawschools special funding from OLAF and foundations and thecreation of additional task forcesOSLSA and OLAF also play important roles in the area oftraining OLAF funds training for the state civil legal servicesproviders and coordinates training for various pro bono projectsOSLSA has primary responsibility for coordinating and deliveringtraining to legal services staff across the state There have beena number of successful statewide substantive law trainingconferences The statewide website has a calendar of trainingevents and related information and a statewide brief bank that canbe accessed by all advocates is in the worksDuring the planning process the planners recognized thatmobilizing and involving the private bar in the legal lives oflowincome clients was one of the states weaknesses Accordinglythe planning process resulted in the establishment of a Pro BonoWork Group to develop and implement a state pro bono plan OLAF hasdesignated two key staff to provide leadership in this area Thegroup is working to expand enhance and coordinate pro bonoinitiatives and integrate pro bono programs with staffbaseddelivery systems with the ultimate goal of raising the currentstatewide participation rate in pro bono programs of under percent to  percent As part of this effort the Ohio AttorneyGeneral and Governor recently announced pro bono policies forgovernmental attorneys and the Chief Justice of the Ohio SupremeCourt sent a letter to all lawyers in the state urgingparticipation in pro bono work Ohio is also experimenting with aninnovative project to link churches private attorneys andlowincome clients through faithbased pro bono projects in areasof the state where pro bono participation is lowThe civil legal assistance in the state has a long history ofcollaborative fundraising endeavors Ohio has been extremelysuccessful in obtaining diversified state funding for legalservices and has one of the highest levels of state funding in thecountry In  the Ohio State Bar Association received theprestigious Harrison Tweed Award from the ABA in recognition of itsefforts to help expand funding for legal services OLAF hassucceeded in significantly increasing IOLTA funding in recentyears The initial planning report submitted to LSC in March ranked continuing attention to resource development as a very highpriority and outlined steps to ensure continued support for legalservices from filing fees attorney registration fees IOLTA andother sources OLAF continues to work each year to try to generategeneral revenue funding One important new resource has been theOhio Supreme Court which initially provided  annuallyraised to  this year The Columbus and Cincinnati legal aidcapital

receiving no LSC fundingPennsylvania programs were also competing with one another for LSCfunds And as Pennsylvanias State Plan observedIt had never been a state role to say its not acceptable

projects to expand access tojusticeWashingtonWashingtons state planning has been led by the Access toJustice Board The Board was created by the state Supreme Court in and charged with expanding resources for civil legal servicesand coordinating their delivery Its nine members appointed by theCourt represented a range of civil legal assistance stakeholdersincluding the bench the bar the Legal Foundation of Washingtonwhich administers IOLTA funds LSCfunded programs and volunteerlawyer programsOne year later the three federallyfunded legal servicesprograms requested that the ATJ Board appoint a committee tooversee the planning process outlined in LSCs  Program LetterThe Board led a broad planning process and in October adopted the two documents which guide the delivery of legalservices within the state of Washington Visioning JusticeHallmarks of a Statewide Civil Legal Assistance Delivery System andthe Plan for Delivery of Civil Legal Services to LowIncome Personsin Washington State These two documents define the mission of thestates civil legal assistance delivery system express key EqualJustice Values and attempt to identify corresponding CoreCapacities to serve the mission The fundamental principles ofthese two documents can be summarized as follows a legalservices providers must be clientcentered ie activities mustbe conceived and carried out in service and in concert with thepopulations that are being served b legal services providersmust strive to ensure the highest and best use of all availableresources within the state of Washington and available to thestatewide access to justice network and c legal servicesproviders have a special responsibility to ensure that nopopulation or client group is written out of the justice systembased on

Statewide Technology Committee is standardizing all systemsand a statewide technology plan for the state is set to becompleted in early JuneThe key challenge facing planners in the state is finding a wayto increase funding in order to significantly expand the capacityfor services In addition to establishing a single statewidecoordinated fund raising plan the Symposium is exploringlegislative proposals involving feeshifting statutes as well asmore traditional approaches such as filing fees surcharges or anincrease in bar duesThe delivery of legal services in West Virginia will soon

on a wide array of legal problems that can obstacles beto making a transition from welfare to work The addition of thisstaff will increase the states legal services advocacy staff byover onethirdAlthough there is no single model for success many states thatare building state justice communities share similarcharacteristics that can guide other states less far alongParticular models strategies and approaches that have provensuccessful in one state may be useful to others while the progressof the national initiative to build state justice communities as ithas played out across the country provides some valuableinformation for national leaders and institutions The followingidentifies some of the lessons that can be gleaned from observingstates that have made significant progress toward building statejustice communities and attaining the goal of equal justiceIncluded also are models and initiatives that have provensuccessful or hold out the promise of successA Broad LessonsThere is no single model for building a state justicecommunity States that are on the road to success have taken avariety of different approaches based on particular circumstanceschallenges and opportunitiesPeople within a state must feel the need to and someurgency for changing the legal services delivery system Change isdifficult and time consuming people do not willingly make dramaticchanges in the way they go about their business unless and untilthey feel that the situation demands it Similarly legal servicesdelivery systems will not change until they come to recognize thataccess quality expansion of resources promotion of diversitybipartisan support and public acceptance are issues that must beaddressed The goal is to light a fire without burning down thetent We can be proud of what we have accomplished over the last years while still understanding that we need to do more andbetterBuilding and maintaining a state justice community is anongoing process The fact that it is a process means that somebodyhas made a decision about the direction the process should takeand it implies some ability to predict the outcome of the processthrough implementation of strategies designed to accomplish thedesired objective It also requires continuous dedication andeffort on the part of all those entities and individuals in thestate committed to equal justice Even the few states that havesucceeded in building a justice community that has significantlyexpanded and improved services for lowincome people have notachieved the ultimate goal of realizing equal justice forlowincome peopleA firm grounding in shared values and a shared visionwill increase the likelihood of success Most successful efforts tobuild a justice community have begun with a process to identify thevalues that will inform planning efforts and provide the basis fora shared vision of what the process is intended to achieve Sharedvalues and vision impel the ongoing investment of time and energythat is necessary for success and have enabled processes in anumber of states to get past areas of disagreement Values andvision paint the picture that drives the actionPlanning initiatives must be based upon a structured andprincipled determination of the needs of client communities A keytask of the planning process is to identify the major legal andjusticesystemrelated issues confronting lowincome people andcommunities in the state and to develop the best possible methodsand mechanisms to address them Some states have used a thoroughclient needs study or report as a basis for their planning effortsInvolving a broadbased group of stakeholders in the designsupervision or administration of the study or report has helped toensure that partners are fully invested in its findings and theimplementation of proposed solutions In different states thestudy or report has been initiated or overseen variously by thecourts the legislature the state bar association or anofficially chartered commission or similar entityLeadership is key The states that have made progresstoward building justice communities have all had leaders willingand able to see the need for change unafraid of taking a statewideperspective eager to put the needs of clients first to acceptresponsibility for meeting those needs and to keep their eyes onthe prize that is on the core values and vision on which theprocess and its initiatives are based Moreover these leaders havesuccessfully defined a series of goals and objectives that arefounded in the communitys belief in equal access to justice andthey have been adept at communicating their goals toothersPlanning and implementation require staffing and supportPlanning processes are complicated Ongoing coordination andsupport for them are essential Permanent change will occur withinand among our state communities of justice only if participatingorganizations adopt new structures and approaches that can copewith a growing

forceBuilding a state justice community is demanding andinvolves real costs The planning processes under way across thecountry have required a tremendous expenditure of time and energyas well as actual outofpocket costs for staff planningconsultants and other expenses LSC has been able to provide somefinancial support for these activities but because of our limiteddiscretionary spending our capacity to contribute is limited Allof the partners that make up state justice communities mustunderstand and accept the need for an ongoing commitment tocontribute their time and energy to these efforts and that thosewith funding capacity must bear a share of the costs Thisinvestment while significant will be far outweighed by thepayoff in terms of increased access and expanded servicesforlowincome people and the intangible benefit that realizing theideal of equal justice for all AmericansIf a state is going to successfully create a statejustice community someone has to be responsible for it In otherwords state planning can not be left to take care of itselfSomeone an individual person or group of persons must advocatefor change must be willing to do the work necessary to secure thechange and must be committed to doing what it takes to make thechange permanentThe creation of state justice communities will besuccessful only if there is encouragement and legitimization ofconstructive dissatisfaction Ongoing evaluation of progress isimportant Openness candor and frank feedback areessentialState planning will fail unless there is acceptance ofand

explore innovative creative or experimentalapproaches to the delivery of legal servicesThe successful state planning initiative requires opencommunication Planning that results in permanent change will occurmost readily and effectively where collaboration and team buildingis rewarded and infighting andor turfprotecting activities areshunned And no one can be cut out of the process State planningfails when groups of stakeholders feel ignored marginalized orunimportantObstacles and setbacks must be anticipated Changing adelivery system that has been in place for a quarter of a centuryis difficult It will take longer than you anticipate Skepticswill try to derail it There will be failures along the way andthe personal costs for some stakeholders cannot be overestimatedDont expect the path forward to be smooth but dont let theobstacles overwhelm youIn the end a state planning initiative takes time acommitment to forego issues of turf and personal interests and
