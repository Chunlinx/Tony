                                 Re  Come off it                        Katha            With all due respect you keep changing the subject My point was merelythat our doublestandard with regard to Nazism and Communism is curious andlargely because of lingering and I think mistaken notions that somehow theCommunists werent quite so bad They were The targets of their liquidationwere different but the totalitarian structure police state and militaristicexpansionism in both systems were uncannily alike So of course were thecrude domestic economic policies which harnessed big business interests tothe military state Both were evil empires and both were essentially nationalsocialist experiments The only difference is that we defeated one in sixyears and took another fortyfour to defeat the other And you misunderstandme when I said that Communism was responsible for American casualties in Koreaand Vietnam I didnt blame the American Left for these wars I blamed theSoviet Union Could anyone now dispute that Oh maybe you do            And no I dont dispute that for a short period of time some socialisticimpulses addressed some real problems in America and the West and should remainin place What after all is workfare if not a sstyle piece of governmentintervention But I do think that given Big Governments record in providingpublic goods over the last few decades almost universally execrable whereveryou look and given Extremely Big Governments record in the Soviet Union andNazi Germany we should be a little more concerned about a state that is nowimposing a higher tax burden on ordinary citizens than at any time in thehistory of the Republic Those taxpayers by the way are not big businessThey are consumers and citizens and they are being bilked of their ownmoney            And no Im not a reactionary Just because I think we should drasticallycut governments suppression of our economic choices and liberties doesnt meanIm against universal suffrage or desegregation For goodness sake Im aFirst Amendment absolutist a solid believer in gender and racial equality ofopportunity etc etc And you know it A truly liberal government would bestrictly neutral between citizens and do as little as possible to rob them oftheir civil liberties and worldly goods Given the twentieth centurys recordof the alternative whats so bad about that            Andrew
