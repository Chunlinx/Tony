when he was Time hasnt done a lot for his accentthough admittedly there are rumorsthat he cultivates his slow lumbering delivery                                       But what if the young man had crooked teethWould you advise him to skip orthodontia telling him appearances mean nothing those who make judgments based on looks and speech are superficialNeanderthals Thats a highminded philosophy but Im afraid it may hinderyou in real life                                       What if this personwants to study law Telling people that time will solve all problems is abankrupt idea My advice to this person is to seek help from a speechpathologist Actors and entertainers often do this Richard Burton wasnt bornspeaking the kings English As the English say Accent iseverything                                       Accent on Success                        Dear Ax            Though no Brit has ever said to Prudie Accent iseverything she accepts your other arguments She cannot resist pointing outhowever that Mr Kissinger has done OK for a guy who sounds like he isgrowling in a German movie            The points you make are more useful than Prudiesearlier ohjustignoreit approach Prudie culpa  Prudieculpa             In this particular caselets just say when the original advice was given the wheel was spinning butthe hamster had gone            Prudie correctively

basement of the building where Im housesitting There is onething that I have never figured out about laundry room etiquette perhaps youcan clear things up When a washer or dryer finishes and the owner doesnt showup within a few minutes to collect the clothes what am I supposed to do if Iam waiting for the machine Leave it and hope they remember to retrieve it orremove the contents and place them on top of the machine or a table                                       I ask because mypractice has always been to allow about five minutes grace then remove itThat always seemed fair to me and I wouldnt expect more of others However afew times the owners have arrived while Im emptying the machine and they havebeen apoplectic Most people either remove their laundry right away or leave itfor hours Please help                                       Tired of Waiting Toronto                        Dear Ti            Prudie finds your fiveminute grace period generousPutting forgotten laundrywet or dryon the machine or a table is perfectlyacceptable in a communal situation            The next time youencounter an apoplectic latecomer just say Lucky you I dont do this foreverybody And smile

 asked for advice about afriend who lies Your answer made sense but I have a curve ball to throw youin a variation on the same theme My sister whom I love very much is prone tolying She constantly embellishes her stories and everyday conversation withnonsensical madeup whimsy that she expects people to take at face value WhenI occasionally confront her with what I know to be the truth she getsdefensive and abusive in tone                                       I am sure thisbehavior carries over to her other relationships as I have discussed thisproblem with other members of my family who share my concern What must I sayto not only get her to stop lying but also to see the damage she is causing inher own life                                       Concerned Brother S                        Dear Con            Having occasionally confronted your whimsicalsister with the true version of events and apparently getting nowhere Prudiesuggests you have a tough conversation outlining the potential damagedishonesty can create in relationships with those having less whimsy            Lets be blunt If yoursis is a congenital liar words of warning will have little effect and youcannot save her from herself You dont mention anyones age but if you failto interest her in therapeutic help perhaps your sib could tryscreenwriting            Prudie honestly
