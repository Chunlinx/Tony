                well the main uh two recycling efforts i see in this neighborhood are at work um somebody got the idea of collecting all the phone books together and its probably several tons of them   uhhuh   and uh white paper computer paper and stuff like that and the other one would be the local grocery stores have got um newspaper bins i just recently noticed a magazine bin which is really nice and now ive got a place to dump all these things but a really prominent sign is that until recently they accepted those plastic milk jugs   uhhuh uhhuh   and theyre probably the main you know source of those things in the first place but theyve quit taking those now   huh   which is a little disturbing   uh is that because they cant do anything with them or uh   i dont know i was under the impression that they were converting or that the two liter plastic bottles could be um chipped down and used for a lot of things like uh carpet industrys pretty big in the northern part of the state here   umhum   and ive heard that some of the companies make their carpets completely from that stuff but i dont know if theres any use for those strange opaque milk carton type um plastic jugs or not   uhhuh yeah i dont even know what theyre made out of  urethane or   yeah they seem to be a pretty nasty kind thing whatever that is   something like that yeah yeah weve actually got uh see theres several different bins at the work place and at home weve got several different recycling things going on and um uh at home we actually have a private sanitation company that asks us to separate out all of our stuff and they take everything from car oil you know engine oil   oh very good     which is a hard one to get get rid of   yeah yeah   to you know plastic milk jugs and bottles and stuff like that so we have it all sort of separated out in bags by the time he comes around he comes around a couple times a week then we have um theres a recycling center down at uh park not far from us uh where if you really have big loads you can go in and separate it yourself so theres all uh you know all the different categories categories of stuff i dont know if they break it out in plastics between milk jugs and other things but i think its like plastics glass paper   yeah hm   and then uh at work this actually kind of a funny story uh for a long time the the guys who ran the company i work for were kind of resistant to uh any kind of recycling because they felt like it was just going to cost them money or something   yeah thats kind of reasonable     and uh so they put up uh eventually you know theres enough pressure and they put up they put up a couple different uh bins one of them was for paper which everybody gets everybody gets a paper bin in their office but therere so many restrictions on what you can toss in there that its almost more of pain than its worth   um yeah   no you know no clips no staples you know and so its kind of its kind of a pain you have to get get in that habit   yep   and uh the other ones uh they have for aluminum cans they also have and this is sort of the funniest part they had a styrofoam recycling thing going on   i understand   and they were actually yeah they were actually um in the uh staff meetings that we used to have there was this guy whos job it was to sort of track that and every month he would actually report how much money   never heard of that one before   of this company made on recycling and so hed say you know and id like to report that we made twenty five dollars and two cents       on styrofoam cup recycling so we were we were always making jokes about you know maybe we could fold that over into computer purchases or something like that you know so by the year you know twenty fifty you know we could buy a  or something you know with but uh     thats an interesting one never heard of styrofoam recycling before   yep  so   that seems like a prime candidate for recycling though   yeah for uh well they they actually took sort of the reverse approach to start with they just decided well we wont we wont let anybody use anything styrofoam  so they stopped buying coffee cups and stuff like that       which is a real pain you know because i mean not everybody uh wonders in with their coffee cup i mean a lot of us havent been you know   yeah and those packing peanuts are hard to avoid in a business too   yeah yeah so anyway so we we have a lot of things lot of things going on i actually im im a big uh im a big recycling fan i think its pretty important actually hear about all these stories about uh plastics and stuff showing up out in the ocean you know choking animals and stuff like that its pretty pretty gory   uh yeah yeah theyll last forever   yeah   all these millions of years nothing has um  evolved to take care of that stuff   uh there theres actually a company out um uh straight west of us in Strasburg Virginia that makes arm rests for cars in mass quantities in fact virtually every piece of trim that you see on the inside of your car Japanese or American these guys make   hm   and uh so its a giant plastics plant i think they have a seventy like a seventy five percent market share or something   do they use a lot of recycled goods for their raw material   uh i think they use a lot of recycled plastic but the funny thing about it is is that they have because of certain
