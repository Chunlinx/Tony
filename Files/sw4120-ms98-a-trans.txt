        ever um       hello   hello   yeah okay so were started i guess ill press press one again   umhum   there uh im surprised its not telling us that that uh were going but at any rate um had do you have such a program uh where you work   okay no i dont and uh i cant say that im unhappy that we dont uh or happy you know either way i guess not being not being involved in it uh   well ill tell you the truth when it uh when it was introduced to Texas Instruments it was a lot of hard feeling now my initial reaction was benign i uh really didnt feel as a matter of fact i was sort of sympathetic in the sense that uh uh you know we we want to stamp out um drug use   umhum   uh and uh the its certainly no good for the company to have employees who are on drugs   umhum   um and i dont really consider it uh an invasion of privacy uh in the sense because uh drug use is uh a dangerous influence on other people in society   umhum   um there was i was in with a group of fuzzy heads however who um were rabidly opposed to it and i i gradually became   umhum   proselytized uh by this group and the to me the big sensitive thing is well there therere couple things one is the is the insult of it perhaps as a um preemployment test is one thing but to come in post facto and say to uh employees who are tried and proven uh that theyve been asked to do theyre gonna have to submit to drug test is sort of a slap in the face   umhum oh yeah you know i might i might see a case as well where it might be warranted in um someone who obviously had a problem with it um someone who had um well i wont say behavioral problems but uh you know noticeable signs or you know got caught on the job you know uh in that case if they really wanted to help the employee its sort of an enforced uh enforced clean period um but you know   and of course therere problems with doing that you realize because uh this requires a very strong minded management and uh uh a supervisory it requires the supervisor to be brass balled in in a sense to go to a an employee who appears to possibly be under the influence of drugs and say  youve got to take a drug test   yeah id   uh as opposed to just randomly requiring it of everyone   thats true that that sort of singling singling a person out i guess i could see that side it of it as well well you can see i really havent given it a whole lot of thought im i work for a privately held uh uh systems integrator and uh we are family oriented as a company and uh we we dont have uh any any problems that uh anyone knows about if you know what i mean there may be problems but no one is aware of them so it its sort of a an invisible thing for us um   umhum right   theres no real requirement for it um  i did work for a company where i had to take a psyche profile once but uh thats another story   was that on a need on a need basis or   no all uh uh um everybody had to take one   oh i see all right   but uh  thank you very much thats uh thats another thats another matter entirely but yeah i guess uh i guess i would say now now that now that uh youve presented that case i would have to say that uh random if if it were gonna be done random would be the only way to do it otherwise youre unfairly singling someone out   uh right um i guess the other objection that i was exposed to at Texas Instruments was the um unproductive unproductive nature of it that basically uh drugs is not a problem at Texas Instruments and the corporation i think are going through this exercise mainly to remain in the good graces of their customer the government   umhum   uh rather than to improve their productivity by stamping out drug use because the the likelihood of finding drug users in the TI population is very very low   oh sure you have to be sharp   and um and so uh people saw it as actually sort of a passing on of the the testing uh requirement from the government
