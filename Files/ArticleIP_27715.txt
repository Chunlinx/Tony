                                 Students Have Always Been Violent            Judging by the histrionic Columbine massacrecoverage youd think that children are by nature innocent free of violent orsexual thoughts until corrupted by our culture That schools have traditionallybeen safe That the recent spate of killings is unprecedented            History says otherwise In every era Americanschoolchildrenespecially teenagershave been unruly and destructive Aslate as the  th century those children we now call teenagerswere considered adults And preteens swore drank had sex even dueled withguns If school violence wasnt a problem back then its only because fewchildren went to school            In colonial America most young children weretaught at home Those who attended school were just as prone to be disorderlyas todays youths Teachers kept problem children in line with corporalpunishments that seem positively barbaric today They tied children to whippingposts and beat them or branded students for their crimesa T for thievery aB for blasphemy Occasionally children were put to death            Branding fell from favorin the th century but students were still flogged or tied tochairs for more on corporal punishment click  In the early  thcentury school reformer Horace Mann reported that he saw  floggings in oneschool during the course of a week As the principles of humanitarianism spreadand the era of mass schooling arrived Mann and others replaced or supplementedthe elite academies with taxpayersupported common schools which admittedyoung students from all walks of life Later attendance become compulsoryIn the Gilded Age as immigrants and migrants flooded the cities publicelementary schools proliferated Finally the Progressives championed the viewof adolescence as a stage of childhood and high schools the first of whichopened in the s multiplied as well            It appears that more students meant more violence In Mann noted that almost  schools across Massachusetts had to be shut downbecause of disciplinary problems In most institutions keeping order tookprecedence over teaching One observer in  likened the typical Americanschool to the despotic government of a military camp In the colleges wherethe teenage students were bigger and less docile violence was even worsePrinceton University to take just one example witnessed six major riotsbetween  and  including the burning of the library in  and a rashof campus explosions in  that caused half of one class to be expelled            School violence persistedinto the  th century taking different forms according to theclimate of the day In politically charged times students became violent inthe name of political causes In  for example when New York Cityintroduced a platoon system to deal with an influx of pupils studentsrebelledliterally Between  and  schoolchildren picketed and stonedPS  on Madison Avenue and attacked nonstriking classmates Similar riotserupted across the city resulting in furious battles between student mobs andthe police Likewise the civil rights movement and antiVietnam War protestsbrought different forms of political violence to places ranging from LittleRock Central High in Arkansas to Kent State University in Ohio            More politically sedate times didnt translate into studentacquiescence however In the postWorld War II years urban strife andsuburban anomie gave rise to school violence of the sorts broadly rendered byHollywood in the  films Rebel Without a Cause and BlackboardJungle  The nation waxed hysterical over juvenile delinquency as thevogue phrase had italienated adolescents unaccountably sullen in thebountiful Eisenhower years Though history had recorded public concern overbands of violent teenagers ever since the beginning of the republic the fearof gangs a term coined in the s caught the nations fancy Timemagazine headlined a story Teenagers on the Rampage which detailed aweeklong outbreak of violence in high schools from Maine to CaliforniaCongress held hearings on the delinquency epidemic calling comicbook artiststo testify about whether their drawings inspired children to violence            Youth rebelliousnesssurged in the s While crime grew overall juvenile crime grew fasterSociologists social workers and policy wonks turned their attention en masseto offenses ranging from vandalism to gangrelated crime from drug use tostudentuponstudent assaults Schools implemented safety plans bringing inadult hall monitors and setting up bodies for hearing student grievances Urbanschools hired professional security agentsand later adopted the surveillancecameras metal detectors locker searches and other measures more commonlyseen in prisons But a major study conducted in  confirmed what experiencehad been teaching Teenagers were more likely to be victims of crime at schoolthan anywhere else            If student violence has now been a major concern fordecades now what seems to distinguish s violence is the suburban orruralschool massacre West Paducah Ky Jonesboro Ark Pearl Miss MosesLake Wash Springfield Ore and now Littleton Coloin each case youngstudents armed with guns committed multiple murders in or near the schoolitself To be sure similar atrocities have occurred in the past In  ayearold schoolboard official detonated three bombs in the Bath Michschoolhouse killing  people And to be sure the string of recent killingsin fact reveals nothing statistically speaking about our society Yet theyremind us that the number of children killed by guns skyrocketed in the sand while tailing off in the s remains far higher than in decades pastAccording to  the growing trend of violent altercations ending in death isattributable almost entirely to the proliferation of guns among children            History makes it clear that children and teenagersare no strangers to violent impulses There have always been and always willbe maladjusted or deranged students who unleash those impulses That they doso is inevitable How they do so may be within our control
