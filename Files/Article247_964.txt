                                 Headline                        KathaYes Im a skeptic about marriage and its idealizers To my mind the bestmarriages are rooted in friendship not romantic love or very rarely inromantic love which somehow manages to evolve into friendship Thats a gooddeal of what my next book is about Its often a miracle when it worksespecially given our cultures bizarrely high expectations of the institutionSo it seems to me to behoove those who believe in the virtues of marriage to bemore effusive in their praise when a couple manages to carry off this difficultrelationship especially when it involves children as well as the McCartneysdid But Paul and Lindas countercultural roots are an embarrassment to theRight and their traditional adherence to fidelity and bourgeois blissembarrasses the Left So the McCartneys are without their champions But theyare surely more admirable in their modern embrace of traditional values thansay representative Bob Barr            As to equal marriage rights it is very frustrating to see people on theright and left completely equate the right to marriage with the duty to marryI think it has to do with the fact that it is so inconceivable to most straightpeople that they couldnt have the right to marry that it is literallyunimaginable to put themselves in gay peoples shoes Right now unlike youKatha I do not have the option of choosing against marriage or embracing thenontraditional forms of relationship you seem to like Im stuck with themwhether I like it or not You cannot spurn marriage if you cannot also chooseit And you cant reject marriage if it has never been offered to you What Imarguing for is a simple equality in that choice Where marriage can work forgay people and successful marriages will be as rare I think as they are forstraights then we should rejoice and be happy Where marriage doesnt fitpeoples needs or desires then theres no reason for people to feelconstrained to be a part of it Its a free country after all But the rightto choose such a thing even if that choice will make you miserable for therest of your life is so fundamental to our cultures and constitutionsdefinition of the pursuit of happiness that to deny it to anyone for somethingthey cannot change is a grotesque and deep injustice I cant think of adeeper denial of civil rights in this country can you            Which is to say that just as gay people should have the right to be asboring and as traditional and as conservative as everybody else so too shouldthey have the right to be as miserable in their relationships Or in the rarecase like the McCartneys very very happy            bestandrew
