                                 Uniform Pay Raise            The LosAngeles Times and Washington Post lead with Wednesdays Supreme Courtdecision upholding the limitation on the First Amendment rights of illegalimmigrants imposed by the  immigration reform law The Court ruled that anillegals claim of being banished from this country on political grounds is nota defense against deportation that requires additional federal court hearingsThe New York Timesgoes instead with the Senates passage and sending on to the House a militarypay and pension package that exceeded the Clinton administrations proposalUSAToday leads with a compendium of YK alarms from aviation bigwigscongressional reports and the CIA The upshot is that aviation controlfacilities in Russia China Eastern Europe the Middle East and Africa aresufficiently millenium buggy that they could suffer computer problemsequivalent to those created by a massive snowstorm But the storysheadlineForeign Flying Risky on Jan seems a bit shrill given that thetext below also credits Western Europe and Japan with having undertaken fixesthat could mean only minimal disruptions in those places            The WP makes it clear that yesterday the Court also forbade illegalimmigrants use of the federal courts to fight deportation until they havealready exhausted all administrative procedures In short the ruling supportsthe way in which current immigration law deprives illegal immigrants of adefense and a venue Both papers note that even before this decision the newlaw has produced a much more active deportation rate and so even though thedecision doesnt have that much direct impact because comparatively few illegalimmigrants claim political persecution it may still cut a rather wide swathbecause in the words of the Post  it has great potential to intimidateimmigrants and make them wary of speaking out about any political matter forfear of drawing attention to their illegal status            The principal features of the Senates military pay bill reports the Times  are a percent pay raise across the board increased educational aid funds newkstyle savings accounts a return to a higher retirement pension rateand  a month to the lowranking troops eligible for food stamps The paperreports that the Clinton administration favors pay increases but only ifCongress increases the Pentagons overall budget to pay for them Otherwiseexplains the paper the DOD may have to cut training or spare parts to affordthem The story by experienced Hill and Pentagon reporter Eric Schmittcommunicates the widespread sentiment among members of Congress that thesecosts are inevitable if readiness is to be maintained But there is nodiscussion of such readinessenhancing but cost effective ideas as targetingbonuses for the specific warfare specialties where retention is worst orrestricting them to those in combat specialties a surprisingly low percentageof military personnel Nor does the story mention that service members receivea portion of their compensation taxfree receive housing subsidies on top oftheir salaries and pay belowmarket prices for goods at base commissaries andexchanges Or that they typically become eligible for their pensions in theirearly forties and hence these shouldnt be viewed as needing to be competitivewith civilian post retirement packages The WP coverage is silentabout these wrinkles as well                           USAT and the WP front a study being published today in theNew England Journal of Medicine that seems to show that the race and sex of patients presenting with chest painsdetermine the course of treatment doctors pursue Previous studies had producedsimilar differences but have been generally discounted as based on suchdifferences as illness severity insurance coverage or patient preferenceBut explain the papers this study eliminated those explanations by usingdemographically diverse actors describing their chest pain from
