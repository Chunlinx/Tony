            well i guess were uh   uh   forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution i hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting fuels fuels are being experimented with ethanol and other types of fuels   yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from   i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories but i   or sources thats what i would think   i dont know for sure i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from what comes over the border from us   right yeah i think the automobile definitely is an area uh any any industry that burns you know and then i dont know about chemical pollution im not real into that as far as how it affects the air i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution they have offices that are too well insulated they found people are getting sick   yeah   but i dont know if that affects outside you know i i think seems to think seems to me thats what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories   yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes um i guess theres been a lot of pressure to um   yeah   do away with the CFCs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem   right yeah that is well thats destroying the ozone isnt it yeah   again i thats what i hear and and theres this big debate apparently about whether the ozone theres a hole in the ozone or not but at last i heard it was uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially   yeah thats it its kind of scary   well it is scary and i think it will uh continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively   yeah   weve got to learn to manage without destroying the environment   yeah i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces   i i im wondering whether its going to get to the point where you cant do that  in Los Angeles theyre apparently going to theyve passed laws that for habit for example people using   i think it will   barbecues gasoline lawn mowers   uhhuh   um and its really bad in places like Los Angeles and its gotten bad in Denver and and uh its not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky   right   and people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars and our economy seems to and this i think is one of the big problems   right yeah in this area too since you know in Texas were so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in Colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh   yeah   it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts but were even getting it here we can drive into when weve been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and theres just a brown fog here and we dont even have any mountains that are holding it in   yeah   but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets   well that makes a lot of sense i mean i i hadnt thought about it that way but it it   you dont have to have mountains there stopping it   yeah   and uh they make uh making more and more highrise buildings and uh so yeah we can comment and we didnt see this a few years ago it was pretty clear here   no and i think yeah and i think that that more and more its becoming apparent to people that the earth which includes all the people on it and everything thats going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a  a whole   right   set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it its going to tell us about it and uh were going to feel it and i think its going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy   umhum   uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars and in in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars   yeah yeah   and uh im i have a little sports car that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but i think uh were gonna have to make some fundamental changes and and im im not sure how long its gonna take or what its gonna take because they keep saying that the economy is gonna depend on how many cars and houses we sell   yes and its a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that its a lot of waste but
