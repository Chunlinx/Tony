                yeah um   okay im uh were not that were not that big at dining out but uh  in fact i guess since since uh we dont make it uh uh make a big hobby of it or anything were were really into uh were interested in economy and uh you know a nice enough atmosphere that you can carry on a conversation     uhhuh   good food i mean thats important too   yeah that sounds about what we i mean we go out to places i mean we dont go to places where we all dress up and all that you know and all that we try to get uh you know some place that you know thats a little better than home and all but you know its not going to cost a ton of money either   right right yeah well well weve got three kids and so uh and so uh i guess theres theres two kinds of dining out theres dining out with the kids and dining out without the kids   huh all right   and uh when were dining out with the kids the the great places are those where you you know i dont uh are you uh you in Texas   no im in uh Maryland   Maryland well theyve got a couple of places here im in im calling from Texas um theres a place that you know i can feed the five of us for under fifteen dollars and and its all you can eat and uh that thats the kind of place that you take the kids to   yeah  well id go there  all five i mean how how old are the kids     well they they range from four to eleven and   thats pretty impressive   uh yeah oh well i i was amazed because we lived uh id lived uh in Virginia i was born and raised in Virginia and then uh we spent uh about ten years in New Hampshire   uhhuh uhhuh   and dining out especially with the kids has always been a major you know thing   yeah were were having a kid in October and its like well you know no more no more eating out for a while   oh right but uh i was i was just amazed theres this one place called CCs pizza   uhhuh   and its all you can eat and its for for grown ups its like four dollars and its like i dont even think its four dollars its three dollars and something and for the for the the uh eight year old and the eleven year old its its like uh two dollars and something and for the four year old its a dollar something   oh thats incredible   and its all you can eat and its decent pizza  you know and it comes with a salad bar too but i mean the salad bar is essentially lettuce and carrots   uhhuh   but uh but you know its good enough to eat  and then um theres uh another place called Panchos Course they have to have Mexican food and uh the uh   uhhuh   the uh the grown ups eat for four dollars and something and the and the uh the eight and eleven year old eat for uh two dollars and something and the four year old eats for free and uh the grown ups get all you can eat and the kids have to have can only have like four items   uhhuh   but you go sit down at a table the great thing about this is you sit down at the table and they have a little Mexican flag and when you raise the Mexican flag the waiter comes over and he just gives you whatever you want     we got to look around here find out if theres anything like that around here     oh youll find something like that uh especially when you have kids   thats yeah thats incredible i mean we just were like well were not going out for a while you know my folks live close you know fairly close here so its like well we if were going out to dinner we can drop the kid off at my folks and     yeah   i know   and  its like oh great grandpa you know   well Maryland Maryland has some i mean um Maryland has some great seafood doesnt it   yeah theres um theres a place i live just outside of Baltimore in a town called Olicott City and uh theres a seafood place here called the Crab Shanty thats really good its like rated higher than like the the seafood restaurants down in the inner harbor in Baltimore you know the the trendy section of Baltimore   uhhuh wow yeah   and uh you know weve eaten there sometimes and its pretty good its you know its a little more expensive than than i normally like to spend plus the other thing is im not uh im not a big seafood fan   yeah   so you know its like great we go to the Crab Shanty and im going to have veal you know   oh   so whats whats eating out cheap for you is McDonalds or something like that   not that bad theres some well actually weve been we end up doing a lot is uh theres a couple of places around that are like uh yuppie i mean it it seems like a big thing now with uh with diners uh   diners oh yeah the back to the fifties   yeah theres um theres a place up in my my folks actually live up in Delaware and theres a place up there that we like to go to called um The Hop which is you know just a fifties diner basically and then theres um a chain around here called Silver Diner   uhhuh right yeah   um and you know you and uh lets see theres another one up in uh just north of Baltimore called Ralphies Diner   huh Ralphies   yeah um it was fun im uh im a baseball fan i you know my my girlfriends like you know she she puts up with me being a baseball fan you know but uh we go we walk into this place Ralphies Diner and i look on the wall and theres like uh   yeah   theres like uh like a relief of the of of the guy who Ralphies Diner is named after and it turns out he used to work for the Orioles and shes like no not more baseball   yeah oh no kidding       but um all these places you know you can get like you know a hamburger or um you know um ive had turkey and meatloaf at all these diners and you know we usually get out of there for around twenty bucks   yeah yeah thats okay yeah   you know its good food and everything and um you know you get malts or whatever so its really good you know my only big gripe is every time ive gone to Silver Diner i have tried to get the banana cream pie and they they are always out   yeah yeah always out yeah we had a place like that that had uh in Virginia it was called Bills Barbecue and they had the grest   uhhuh   greatest banana cream pie and it was was uh you could take it home it was was just it was so popular it was great stuff and now now my mouth mouths watering im beginning to think about that  yeah the uh yeah twenty dollar thats   oh sorry   we can do pretty thats thats what we try to aim for just the two of us or naw you know if we want to have some wine or something we start get into the forty dollar range i guess and   well neither of us are big wine d rinkers yeah we went out tonight and i had a you know i had a beer and and you know obviously since you know shes were not weve been kind of laying off the alcohol since shes expecting and all that   yeah yeah yeah sure sure   but we i mean even before i mean usually we you know we might have a beer but thats about it so   yeah yeah thats the same well well go to a place and of course being in Texas well go to a place and the big thing is frozen margaritas margaritas and uh so well have some nachos and drink and they they serve these margaritas in   yeah   i dont know do do you ever go to Howard Johnsons in uh i i dont know if there are even any Howard Johnsons around any more you used to get an ice cream sundae in that big old goblet   yeah there are yeah   well thats how thats what they serve these margaritas in these frozen margaritas its just huge things   yes ive seen them i know that uh Chi Chis has margaritas in big glasses like that   yeah yeah yeah Chi Chis they they have Chi Chis down here too but thats thats sort of looked down upon because theyre a chain   oh oh yeah well i i i would i mean you know theyve got them out here because its you know  they dont actually know what Mexican you know what Mexican food is here     right yeah right well i didnt either i mean you know to me Panchos where i can where i can eat for less than fifteen bucks to me thats gourmet and everybody i say i went to Panchos they all down at me down their noses you know its like uh its all right with me   yeah   well weve been to some what what have been rated fancy Mexican restaurants and uh they were good i have to say they were good   huh yeah ive got to try i um years ago um we were uh my folks were um we were visiting Los Angeles or something and i remember being taken to a real fancy Mexican restaurant there called Senor something  Senor Pico or something like that and   yeah     you know i hated everything at the time i just hated Mexican food id id love to go to some place like that now where its you know a real Mexican restaurant and see if i like it   did you Mexican yeah yeah yeah yeah what kind of what kind do you like uh like Chinese or Italian or   i um i like Chinese and i should experiment more the problem is that my favorite food in the world is cashew chicken so any time i go to a Chinese restaurant i want cashew chicken   oh yeah my wife too thats her favorite too  yeah you know its funny with Chinese restaurants since you cant read the menu or anything you tend to stick with one thing i used to it used to always be sweet and sour pork for me and then i just i i started getting a little more health conscious   uhhuh   and i try to uh you know try something else you know something with a little more vegetables  or something but yeah i was the same way but we havent really eaten Chinese that much since weve been in uh Texas its funny   i was just thinking the same thing its like we havent had Chinese in a while lets have a shake up we get this uh theres this take out Chinese place that i mean you know stones throw from my apartment here   yeah right yeah yeah   and uh we can get they do this thing for dinner for two where we can get like um Kung Pao chicken you know its a big you know container full Kung Pao chicken um pork fried rice two egg rolls and like you know   um yeah um   you know i dont know a pint or two pints or whatever of a wanton soup for like twelve fifty   yeah ooh what a deal yeah   yeah its great we should have done that tonight   that sounds great well you know its funny because the grocery store down the street its one of these you know super grocery stores they have a a Chinese takeout   um   in the corner of it and the foods decent but its expensive i think especially since its all take out   uhhuh   uh yeah im well i like Italian food too but you dont there arent that many Italian restaurants around here   theres um im trying to think theres a French restaurant real close but weve never gone there because im not   yeah   oh im you know im not a big French you know i i dont eat   im into quantity and French the French restaurants arent   yeah well i also i also dont do snails so     right   it seems to me theres an Italian deli nearby thats pretty good uh   well of course when we
