                      A Brief History        The modern Republic of Turkey dates only from  but the        history of the land within its borders stretches back to the dawn of        humanity Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations        show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the        Palaeolithic period about  to  years ago By Neolithic        times organized communities had arisen such as the one at atalhyk        near Konya Turkeys most important prehistoric site This town which        flourished between  and  bc  had flatroofed houses of mud        and timber decorated with wallpaintings some of which show patterns        that still appear on Anatolian kilims        The advent of the Bronze Age about  bc  and the        spread of citystates ruled by kings is marked by the appearance of        royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the        west and Alacahyk near Ankara Around this time the Sumerian        civilization living in Mesopotamia the region between the Tigris and        Euphrates rivers in presentday Iraq founded and developed the        cuneiform script the worlds oldest form of writing on record The        technique was introduced by Assyrian traders  years later into        Anatolia where it was quickly adopted by the indigenous Hatti        people who at this point had already reached an advanced state of        civilization        The Hittites        The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh modern Kltepe near        Kayseri Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia        of warlike invaders around the second millennium bc Their origins        remain a mystery their written language was finally deciphered in         but they came from the direction of the Caucasus mountains        spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia It was two        hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly        conquered empire        The newcomers were the Hittites and their domination of        Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods the Old Kingdom        c  bc  then the New or Empire Period c  bc         and the Late Hittite Period c  bc  Their first capital        city was Hattusa now Boazky near Ankara which dates from the th        century bc and has tombs fortifications enclosed temples and a        citadel containing an impressive library of more than  cuneiform        tablets        During the Empire Period an ambitious Hittite king        Mutawallis defeated the forces of the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II at        Kadesh Syria in  bc Ramses was too proud to accept defeat        commissioning obelisks that celebrated his victory  But he was        sufficiently wary of the formidable strength of the Hittite Empire to        make peace with the next king Hattusili III The Treaty of Kadesh        recorded on clay tablets on display in the Museum of the Ancient Orient        in Istanbul see page  is the oldest known example of an        international treaty        The Hittite Empire eventually collapsed following invasion        from the west by the Achaeans the Phrygians and a mysterious force        known only as the Sea People  The Hittites were forced to flee south        into the mountains where they remained until they were absorbed by the        Assyrians        Troy and the Greeks        While the Hittite Empire declined other momentous events        were taking place on the shores of the Aegean The ancient Greeks        traditionally took the fall of Troy as recounted by Homer as the        starting point of their history Much academic debate surrounds the        exact date of the Trojan War if indeed it ever took place Modern        archaeologists studying the ruins of Troy have discovered nine        superimposed cities ranging from Troy I  bc  to Troy IX         bc ad  the city of King Priam described in the Iliad        and the Odyssey is thought to be either Troy VI which was destroyed        by an earthquake in  bc  or its successor Troy VIIa Some say        the Trojan War never took place at all and that the decline of Troy        was due to the mysterious Sea People mentioned earlier        Whatever really happened the Mycenaean Greeks who were        supposed to have conquered King Priams city soon found their own        civilization in decline A race known as the Dorians came to power in        southern Greece forcing many mainland Greeks to leave their homeland        and cross the Aegean to settle on the coast of Anatolia Their        colonization of the coast took place in successive waves of        immigration First came the Aeolians who settled the region to the        north of Smyrna now Izmir then the Ionians who settled the coast        south of Smyrna as far as the River Maeander The Dorians followed        installing themselves south of the Maeander in the region known as        Caria        Around  bc mainland Greece entered a dark age of        limited achievements but not so the Ionians who developed an        outstanding civilization By the eighth century bc the  main        citystates of Ionia including Ephesus Priene and Miletus had        formed what was known as the PanIonic League Science philosophy and        the arts flourished and the Ionians founded further colonies        Lydians and Persians        Inland from Ionia lived the wealthy and powerful Lydians        with their capital at Sardis They reached their peak during the reign        of Croesus  bc  who owed his fortune to gold panned from        the River Pactolus His lasting legacy was the invention of coinage        which led to the beginnings of our moneybased economy His        expansionism brought the bulk of Ionia under Lydian rule but also        resulted in conflict with the advancing Persians in the east where he        was roundly defeated Driven back to Sardis he witnessed the sacking        of his city by the army of Cyrus the Great in  bc        With Lydia defeated the Greek coastal cities lay open to        the Persians who swiftly incorporated them into their empire Ionias        revolt around  bc  supported by Athens was easily subdued        However Athenian involvement provoked the Persian king Darius to        invade the Greek mainland He was defeated at the famous Battle of        Marathon in  bc  and ten years later his son Xerxes lost the        Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis Xerxes suffered a further        humiliating defeat in  bc  when his army was beaten at Plataea on        the same day that his fleet lost to the Greeks at Mycale        As a result of the Persian Wars the Greek cities of        Anatolia were encouraged to join the Delian Confederacy paying tribute        to Athens in return for protection against the Persians Athens became        so attached to this source of easy money that dissent soon grew among        the member cities and Sparta led the confederacy from Athens after the        Peloponnesian War  bc  The Persians sensing weakness in        the ranks launched another offensive resulting in the Aegean coast        cities coming under Persian control in  bc        Alexander the Great        Meanwhile King Philip II of Macedon dreamed of driving out        the Persians from northern Greece and unifying the entire Greek world        His dreams were fulfilled and even surpassed by his son Alexander the        Great in a brief but actionfilled lifetime of only  years         bc  In  bc  aged only  he led his army across the        Hellespont now the Dardanelles and paused at Troy to make a        sacrifice at the temple of Athena and pay homage to his hero Achilles        before going on to defeat the Persians at the Battle of Granicus and        liberating the Ionian cities After conquering the entire Aegean and        Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia and subduing Syria and Egypt he took        the great prize of Persepolis the Persian capital before advancing        farther still into India During his year campaign Alexander        established some  cities and built the greatest empire the world had        yet seen        After Alexander the Greats death the conquered territory        was divided among his generals whose mutual antagonism and        expansionist ambitions led to weaknesses that exposed western Anatolia        to the increasing might of Rome        Enter the Romans        One of the most prosperous citystates of the Aegean coast        was Pergamum ruled since  bc by the Attalid dynasty The last of        the Attalid kings Attalus III is remembered as something of an        eccentricone of his hobbies was devising new poisons and testing        their efficacy on his reluctant slaves When he died of natural        causes in  bc  his subjects were dismayed to learn that he had        bequeathed his entire kingdom to the Romans Thus Pergamum became the        capital of the new Roman province of Asia Mithridates VI King of        Pontus on the Black Sea resisted Roman occupation temporarily        occupied Pergamum and ordered the massacre of all Romans But        eventually Romes power prevailed in this territory        In  bc Julius Caesars nephew Octavian took the name        Augustus Rome ceased to be a republic and became an empire There        followed a long period of peace and prosperity known as the Pax Romana        All of Asia Minor the Roman name for Anatolia was incorporated into        the Roman Empire Greek cities were embellished with Roman        buildings        Soon news of a new religion that was beginning to cause        trouble for the Roman authorities spread through the empire        Christianity threatened the establishment because it rejected the old        gods and denied the divinity of the emperor Paul the Apostle carried        the word His voyages ad  led to the founding of many        churches notably the Seven Churches of Asia addressed in the        Revelation of St JohnPergamum Smyrna Ephesus Thyatira Laodicea        Sardis and Philadelphia        Byzantium        Legend claims that the city of Byzantium was founded around         bc by a Greek named Byzas after the Delphic Oracle had bidden        him to build his city opposite the Land of the Blind  When he saw        that earlier settlers had built a town on the eastern shore of the        Bosphorus he decided they must have been blind themselves to overlook        the advantages of an easily defensible point across the water and        founded Byzantium there on the site now occupied by Topkap        Palace        In the succeeding centuries Byzantium like the cities of        the Aegean fell under the sway of Athens Sparta Persia Alexander        and Rome It tried to regain its independence from Rome but proved too        small and weak and was conquered by Emperor Septimius Severus in ad         He had the city razed to the ground but soon saw the advantages        of its strategic location and began a programme of enlarging and        strengthening the old defensive walls        A succession of weak and decadent emperors saw the Roman        Empire fall gradually into decline and anarchy In ad  Diocletian        sought to reverse the decline by splitting the administration of the        empire in twohe would govern the east based in Nicodemia while his        friend Maximian ruled the west from Milanand later to split it        further into four parts His policy succeeded for a time but following        his abdication in ad  the empire continued to weaken harassed by        invaders and troubled by internal strife Constantine the Great who        was a convert to Christianity and Licinius ruled east and west        respectively until in  Constantine overthrew his pagan ally and        reunited the empire He chose Byzantium as his new capital to emphasize        the break with heathen Rome The city was inaugurated with great        ceremony in  and in honour of the emperor was renamed        Constantinople Constantine added new city walls following a plan he        claimed to have been given by Christ in a vision and commissioned a        grand central forum decorated with a triumphal column as well as        several other monuments The New Rome soon achieved a preeminence in        the Christian world that it would retain for  years        In  the Emperor Theodosius proclaimed Christianity to be        the official religion of the Roman Empire and on his death in  the        empire was split once more between his two sons and was never again        to be reunited The Western Empire ruled from Rome fell to the        Ostrogoths in  while its neighbour the Eastern or Byzantine        Empire became one of the longestlived empires the world has ever        known dating from  to         The greatest of the Byzantine emperors was Justinian the        Great ruler from  to  who introduced an equitable legal        system and also extended the boundaries of the empire into Spain        Italy and Africa He greatly encouraged the arts and commissioned the        building of the magnificent basilica the Haghia Sophia        Following the death of the Prophet Mohammed in  Arab        armies united under Islam poured out of their homeland and soon took        Egypt Syria and Palestine from the Byzantines Constantinople was        besieged from  to  but survived because of its defences The        empire was further diminished by the loss of North Africa and Italy        and was brought to the brink of civil war by the Iconoclastic Crisis        before enjoying another brief golden age under Basil II  But        the empires troubles increased as invaders made further incursions        into Byzantine territory Most worrying were the Seljuk Turks who came        out of the east in the th century to wrest large parts of Asia Minor        from Constantinoples control Converted to Islam in the tenth century        and fired by religious zeal the Seljuks overran Anatolia menacing        Christian holy places and attacking the pilgrims bound for        Jerusalem        Reluctantly the Emperor Alexius I sought outside help from        the Christian West The First Crusade was organized to help the        Byzantines recapture the Holy Land from the infidel Muslims and        resulted in victory for the Crusaders The Second and Third Crusades        however were a disaster for the Christians The Fourth Crusade        launched in  and partly inspired by Venetian jealousy of        Byzantiums trading power became an excuse to plunder Constantinople        itself Thus the city that had held out against so many attacks by the        infidel became subjected to mindless pillaging by fellow        Christians        The Crusaders ruled the city from  to  calling        their new state Romania also known as the Latin Empire A remnant of        the Byzantine Empire survived in Nicaea now Iznik and recaptured        Constantinople in  but the city had been shattered and its great        monuments were stripped of gold silver and precious works of art        The place was never the same again        The Ottomans        During the th century the Turks in Anatolia rallied under        the banner of one Osman Gazi who had won a great victory over the        Byzantines in  Osman Gazis son Orhan captured Bursa in         and set up his capital there then moved it to Adrianople Edirne        which he took in  By the th century the whole of Anatolia and        Thrace except for Constantinople was under the control of these        Osmanli or Ottoman Turks The Byzantine Emperor at the time Manuel        II  tried to appease his enemies by allowing a Turkish        district mosque and tribunal within his city and by courting        Turkish goodwill with gifts of gold but to no avail The young Ottoman        Sultan Mehmet II who reigned from  to  set about cutting        off Constantinoples supply lines The huge fortress of Rumeli Hisar        on the Bosphorus was built in just four months in  He then        withdrew to his capital in Adrianople to await the spring        The Byzantines tried to protect the Golden Horn from enemy        ships by stretching a huge chain across its mouth They repaired and        strengthened the city walls that had saved them so many times in the        past and waited fearfully for the inevitable onslaught In April         the Sultans armies massed outside the city walls outnumbering the        Byzantines ten to one The siege and bombardment lasted seven weeks        The Ottoman admiral bypassed the defensive chain by having his ships        dragged overland under cover of darkness opening a second attack The        final ass ault came on  May  when the Ottoman army surged        through a breach in the walls The last emperor Constantine XI fell        in the fighting and by noon that day Mehmet and his men had taken        control of the soughtafter city        His first act was to ride to Haghia Sophia and order that        it be converted into a mosque on the following Friday he attended the        first Muslim prayers in what came to be called Ayasofya Camii Mosque        of Haghia Sophia After allowing his soldiers three days of pillaging        he restored order acting with considerable leniency and good sense        Henceforth he became known as Fatih Conqueror and his newly won        capital city was renamed Istanbul        Fatih Sultan Mehmet laid claim to all the territories        previously held by the Byzantines so that his empire incorporated most        of Greece and the Balkans as well as Anatolia Expansion continued        under his successors but it was during the reign of his great        grandson Sleyman that the Ottoman Empire reached its greatest and        most celebrated heights Sleyman the Magnificent aged  ascended        the throne and ruled for  years  the longest and most        glorious reign in the history of the Ottomans Sleymans army captured        Belgrade in  Rhodes capitulated in  Six years later he        besieged Vienna for  days unsuccessfully before going on to take        most of Hungary Turkish corsairs notably the infamous Barbarossa        helped to conquer Algiers and Tunis        By the midth century the Ottoman Empire had reached its        greatest extent stretching from Batumi at the eastern end of the Black        Sea to Algeria taking in Mesopotamia Palestine the shores of the Red        Sea including Mecca and Medina Egypt Anatolia Greece the Balkans        Hungary Moldavia the North African coast the Crimea and southern        Ukraine With such farflung territories dissolution was inevitable        and began immediately Northern conquests including Hungary had        been lost by the close of the th century The decline of these        territories was drawn out and painful leaving problems in its wake        that have been the source of trouble and friction in the Balkans and        the Middle East ever since        Decline and Fall        The year  marked the beginning of the Greek War of        Independence which resulted in victory for the Greeks in  and        another loss of territory for the Ottomans whose empire had shrunk        significantly A century of decadence and intermittent wars had left        the Ottoman sultanate in serious irreversible decline Attempts at        reform came too late by  the government was bankrupt Sultan        Abdl Hamid II  tried to apply absolute rule to an empire        staggering under a crushing foreign debt with a fragmented population        of hostile people and succeeded only in creating ill will and        dissatisfaction amongst the younger generation of educated Turks        Young army officers and the professional classes were        becoming increasingly interested in Western ways of government and        social organization European literature was widely studied Robert        College an American school and the Galatasaray Lyce the French        Academy in the city were turning out young men imbued with dreams of        democracy These intellectuals formed an underground group known as        the Young Turks centred on Salonica where revolt broke out In         Abdl Hamid was deposed and replaced by his brother Mehmet V        There followed the Balkan Wars in which Turkey lost        western Thrace and Macedonia then World War I into which Turkey        entered on Germanys side In the notorious Gallipoli campaign of         the Turks under the leadership of General Mustafa Kemal defeated the        Allied attack on the Dardanelles        At the end of the war the Treaty of Svres formally ended        the existence of the Ottoman Empire Greece was given large        concessions Armenia was to become an independent state in the east        and the Middle East was to be divided among the Arab leaders who had        fought with Colonel Lawrence under British and French spheres of        influence        The subsequent period of internal strife between the Turks        and the Greeks and Armenians was dominated by Mustafa Kemal who had        risen from the status of war hero to become the leader of the Turkish        nationalist movement In  with army support he was elected        president of the Grand National Assembly in Ankara in defiance of the        Sultans government in Constantinople From  to  he waged war        with the Greeks who had invaded at Smyrna and ultimately managed to        defeat them and force their withdrawal from Asia Minor        He was then faced with the delicate task of abolishing the        sultanate without antagonizing the religious elements within his party        This meant deposing Sultan Mehmet VI who as caliph leader of the        Islamic world and sultan stood for the old tradition of combined        secular and religious power Kemal handled the problem with his usual        vigour and eloquence in a speech to the Assembly by linking the power        of the caliphate with that of the Assembly  It was by force that the        sons of Osman seized the sovereignty and Sultanate of the Turkish        nation Now the Turkish nation has rebelled and has put a stop to these        usurpers and has effectively taken sovereignty and the Sultanate into        its own hands This is an accomplished fact         In the early morning of  November  Mehmet VI slipped        quietly away to a waiting British warship to end his life in exile He        was replaced as caliph by his cousin whose powers were strictly        limited by secular laws until that position too was abolished in                The Republic of Turkey        In  the Treaty of Lausanne defined the present borders        of the Turkish Republic An exchange between Greece and Turkey of        expatriate populations resulted in the movement of thousands of people        and the wholesale desertion of Greek villages and districts        From  to  several wideranging reforms were        introduced by President Kemal He secularized institutions reformed        the calendar adapted the Latin alphabet for the Turkish language        emancipated women and improved agriculture and industry He introduced        the Western idea of surnames until then Turks had a single name and        made everyone choose a family name which they had to hand down to        their children For himself he chose Atatrk or Father of the        Turks        His proved an appropriate choice as he almost        singlehandedly created the modern Turkish state He was enormously        popular with the common Turkish people and when he died in         thousands of mourners lined the railway track to salute the white        presidential train as it carried him from Istanbul for burial in        Ankara the new capital        Turkey remained neutral during World War II until         when it entered the war on the side of the Allies It joined NATO in         The Democratic Party was elected in  and remained in control        until  when faced with increasing social and economic        difficulties it was overthrown by a military coup A new constitution        consolidating liberal reforms was drawn up and approved by a        referendum held in  However further unrest led to more coups in         and  after which yet another more restrictive constitution        was prepared        Turgut zal leader of the Motherland Party and former        world banker and economist was elected as prime minister in  and        served until his death in  Under his leadership Turkey adopted a        Westernstyle economy and in  applied for membership of the        European Community now Union        He was succeeded by Tansu iller Turkeys first woman        leader She inherited the countrys rampant inflation and the conflict        between Kurdish separatists and the security forces in the southeast        These political and economic difficulties helped the fundamentalist        Refah party later win the largest share of the vote in  The Refah        party was officially outlawed in  though it continues to be widely        supported Despite these political tensions Turkey is becoming an        increasingly popular tourist destination offering all the trappings of        a Mediterranean paradise and a wealth of fascinating history
