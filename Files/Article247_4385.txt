Allende The Wall Street Journal puts the story atop its frontpage newsindex box and the Los Angeles Times fronts it going instead with how as fewas two dozen seats will determine if the Republicans hold on to the House thisfall The Washington Post goes with a State Department internal auditshowing rampant lax security The USA Todaylead is a followon to a story the NYT had last week the emergence ofthe possibility that the government and drug companies might agree on some formof Medicare coverage for prescription drugs The latest Pharmaceutical execswill meet on the topic this week with the White House chief of staff Also thepaper says a new industry ad campaign will unlike previously adversarialspots be conciliatory on the subject            The two Times explain that the Chilean election marks not only theresuscitation of socialism in the country but also of the dormant rightthemargin of victory was slim over a former Pinochet aide Another significantdevelopment the two papers note The rightist candidate went to the winnersheadquarters to personally congratulate him            The LAT lead says the Republican grip on the House is especiallytenuous because the party has the slimmest majority either partys had theresince  Democrat fund raising is more effective than its historicallybeen and because more than three times as many Republican incumbents asDemocrats are vacating their seats            The Post lead says that the security audit showed that State Department officialsfailed to sweep  offices where classified intelligence reports of the utmostsensitivity were handled and that in one timeframe studied more than percent of those reports were not returned to their proper storage place Thepaper also reports that the audit was completed before the discovery of alistening device and a Russian spy nearby at State headquarters late lastyear but after a  incident in which a man came in took some classifiedmaterials and left The paper reveals the man was never identified and thematerials were never recovered            The WP offlead on the antimissile shield system being tested by thePentagon says that the system could defend against at most  or  missilesand explains that this limitation is being stressed to the Russians who havesome  nuclear missiles as a reason for them not to worry about it Evenif it passes the important tests in the months ahead and gets full funding thesystem wont be ready until                            USAT s frontpage snapshot is a soberup for Martin Luther King Dayfrom the US Census

LAT runs a column in the metro section by Robert Scheersiding with Barbra Streisand in a zoning dispute shes having with the Malibugovernment over construction plans at her new house Is Scheers friendshipwith Streisand clouding his judgment Well in his column he describes her asthe hardest working taxpayer and says her body of work is widely recognizedas a national treasure            The WP reports that a business editor at the Idaho Statesmanin Boise has quit over his papers practice of submitting stories about MicronTechnology a major local employer to the company for review before publishingthem A heavy at the paper is quoted as defending the practice as a method offactchecking Todays Papers sides with the departed editor but would addthat there is nothing wrong with showing copy to a story source or subject forfactchecking purposes What is wrong is surrendering control of that copy tosuch persons But a reporter doesnt have to do that if hes willing to fightagainst powerful local interests and his bosses for what he knows is right Inother words the traditional view against advance peeks sacrificesfactchecking primarily to take the easy way out But journalism should almostalways take the hard way out            Another reminder of how shoddy smalltime journalism can be comes with theNYT s report on the sudden departure of The Oklahoman s executiveeditor apparently for displeasing local behemoth the KerrMcGee Corporationwith a story about the death of Karen Silkwood a wouldbe whistlebloweragainst the company            Of course not all shoddiness is local Both the NYT and WP runfollowon stories to last weeks revelation that the governments drug officehad a program of financial incentives for networks incorporating antidrugthemes into their shows Todays coverage focuses mostly on ABCs claim that itstopped trying to get the financial credits after the government asked to seescripts before broadcast Disappointingly neither paper mentions theorganization that broke the story Salon magazine On the other handWalter Shapiros column in USAT touching on the controversy doesproperly credit Salon  Not doing so is bush league and cheats the readerout of being able to look at more facts Another nagging question How is itthat the TV networks which were parties to the deal failed to break thestory
