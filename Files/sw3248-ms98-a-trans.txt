                 oh okay well i am sorry to do this to you um i dont know if you  explained this is part of a fund raiser for the church   yeah yeah i remember it its just like what do i know about the metric system   yeah well i dont know anything so um you know we can just kind of wing it but if youre ready ill push one and we can start and       lately their bank has been so full that theyve been cutting us off after about three to five minutes so it it wont be anything like the   okay   okay     i dont know why the last effort failed i i know that its very hard to get people to change to do different things i think the metric system is so convenient because its in multiples of ten um but its just hard to switch everything over England managed to do it uh   right   uh   i know the whole world has managed to be doing metric system and were just left out in the middle of nothing and then having to do the conversions that uh the rest of the world doesnt have to do   umhum   which makes it more difficult in trading and and that type of thing as far as going back and forth between the two   i dont know if they um tried before if there were any way that they could offer incentives to corporations that switched uh i dont even really know where to they would begin i mean certainly um its already being taught in the schools   yeah the schools need to do more widespread um you touch it a little here and there and but youre never explained really explained to it all and and actually even in the science classes though a lot of times um the metric system is used rather than um the American system   umhum well it is a a an universal system now uh   that we use umhum   i uh and some ways its like the idea of the alternative school calendar uh the way our calendar set up goes back to uh the days when we were primarily an agricultural country and people they needed the kids home to help with the farming and planting again the rest of the world it has it has already adopted has always had a uh what we call an alternative calendar with more breaks throughout the year and a shorter summer vacation uh   umhum   and and gradually as things try and uh and using that as a parallel i know different districts are trying first with you know one or two schools and then some districts have converted uh maybe theres some areas that they could start a conversion like maybe at the gas pumps that would be one way maybe they need to do it in stages   umhum   uh   i think the most logical way is just to educate very severely or very uh try very hard in the education system and starting with the young eventually eventually they grow old and they take a while to do it that way but um since its just right now touched on the education system the more that its used um and its impressed upon the children the more comfortable theyll feel with it um i dont feel very comfortable with the metric system even though i was exposed to it um but if they did even so even more than they are now eventually um   umhum   it would gain popularity as they grow older and they could switch over more easily the more people they have thats trained on the metric system rather than our system   um and actually the metric system itself isnt so difficult its the conversion thats difficult and um   right exactly   thats what um i look at it from uh trying to feed families from old recipes and things having i i have friends in England and Germany and when they give me recipes its hard because they do things in grams and um you know their whole measuring system is different and   umhum   um i think thats been an area of resistance but i think your idea of uh starting through the schools and working with the kids um certainly easier growing up with it its easier to learn something when you are young than to relearn and uh   right but much easier so and i always had a hard time converting converting its like why cant we just all do it the same whats the purpose of switching back and forth why are we different   yeah well i dont know why the effort failed before but i have a feeling that it may have been businesses it would be costly for them to convert over um especially some of the manufacturing industries all the machines they have um to have to convert over to centimeters although several things uh already are i know my husband has tools for the car that he has to use
