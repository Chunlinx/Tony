                    Background                Pneumocystis carinii causes pneumonia        in immunocompromised patients with a high morbidity and        mortality rate However the interaction between this        organism and the host cell is not well understood The        target cell for         P carinii is believed to be the type        I pneumocyte After contact with the type I pneumocyte         P carinii trophozoites anchor        themselves to the host cell It was found that the major        surface glycoprotein of         P carinii upregulates the        expression of integrins on the surface of cultured lung        cells   to facilitate this attachment         P carinii attachment to type I        pneumocytes may also be mediated by laminin vitronectin           or mannose          Alveolar macrophages interact with         P carinii in the lung as the first        line of defense against infection The major surface        glycoprotein of         P carinii has been shown to be a        chemotactic factor for macrophages and monocytes         in vitro   The interaction of        alveolar macrophages with         P carinii is mediated by fibronectin                  P carinii organisms are phagocytized        when they bind to mannose receptors on the surface of        macrophages   Alveolar macrophages have been shown to        release TNF prostaglandin E           and leukotriene B          upon interaction with         P carinii   These compounds are        potent modulators of pulmonary inflammation and lung injury          These are early and important events in the acute        response to infection and clearance of         P carinii organisms from the lung                 Although it is not certain whether         P carinii organisms attach to type        II pneumocytes type II pneumocytes do respond to         P carinii infections Type II        pneumocytes maintain the structural integrity of alveoli        for gas exchange They produce alveolar surfactant and        replicate and differentiate into type I pneumocytes after        lung injury   Type II pneumocytes have been shown to        increase the production of surfactant proteinA SPA in        patients with         P carinii pneumonia PcP and the        increase of SPA correlates with the organism load in the        lung   The secretion of phosphatidylcholine from type        II cells has been found to be inhibited upon         P carinii infection   leading        to a deficiency of phosphatidylglycerol and the loss of        surfactant function in patients with PcP          The purpose of this study was to detect alterations in        host cell gene expression that occur in response to         P carinii infection We have        compared gene expression patterns in         P carinii infected and        mockinfected cells using mRNA differential display and        found that the mitochondrial ATPase  gene is        overexpressed in response to         P carinii infection in rats We also        found that type II pneumocytes and Clara cells are        responsible for overexpression of the ATPase  gene in         P carinii infected rat lung                    Results        In order to determine whether         P carinii infection causes increases        in gene expression in host cells experiments using mRNA        differential display were performed Human embryonic lung        HEL cells were used as host cells and were inoculated        with lung homogenate of dexamethasoneimmunosuppressed and         P carinii infected rats A separate        set of HEL cell cultures was inoculated with lung        homogenate of dexamethasoneimmunosuppressed noninfected        rats to serve as noninfected mockinfected control        Several PCR product bands were seen in the         P carinii infected but not in the        mockinfected lanes of the mRNA differential display gel        Three of these bands Fig  designated AII AI and        AI were selected for further study To identify the genes        represented by the differentially displayed PCR products        the DNA was recovered from the gel reamplified cloned        and sequenced The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool        BLAST was used to identify the sequences thus obtained        The AII product was determined to be a bp DNA fragment        with sequence approximately  homologous to nucleotides           of the yeast mitochondrial ori  sequence        gbKYSCMTORIA This product was not further        investigated since it is not a human or rat gene The AI        product was found to be a bp fragment with sequence        identical to nucleotides    of the rat ribosomal        protein S gene embXRRRPS The bp AI        product was   identical to nucleotides    of        the rat mitochondrial ATPase  gene gbJRATMTCYOS        Since we sought to detect genes that were upregulated in        the human host cell line HEL  in response to         P carinii infection it was        surprising that none of the three selected PCR product        bands were of human origin        To verify the expression pattern seen in the mRNA        differential display the cloned AI and AI fragments were        used to probe Northern blots of RNAs derived from        noninfected and         P carinii infected rat lungs The        AI probe reacted with a kb RNA band but the        intensities of the RNA bands of samples from mock and         P carinii infected rat lungs were        approximately the same Therefore the AI product band was        not further studied The AI probe reacted with an RNA band        of approximately  kb Fig  which is the size of the        rat ATPase  mRNA   Both         P carinii infected and        mockinfected RNA samples showed the kb band The        intensity of the band of the RNA sample from         P carinii infected rat lung is        approximately  times stronger than that of the sample from        noninfected rat lungs based on densitometric analysis of        the autoradiogram The band intensities of the same blot        probed with a fragment of the S rRNA gene were used as an        internal control for variations in the amount of RNA loaded        on the blot Fig  These results indicate that        noninfected rat lungs have a basal level of ATPase  gene        expression and that this expression is increased in         P carinii infected lungs        To verify overexpression of the ATPase  gene in rat        lung tissue         in situ hybridization with        digoxigeninlabeled riboprobes was performed Slides each        of which contained lung tissue sections of both        dexamethasoneimmunosuppressed noninfected NRL and         P carinii infected PcIRL rats        were probed with sense and antisense riboprobes of the        ATPase  gene The sections reacted with the sense probe        served as a control for nonspecific background signal The        sections reacted with the antisense probe were expected to        show a dark blue precipitate in cells as an indication of        ATPase  gene expression A dark blue precipitate was not        seen in NRL and PcIRL sections reacted with the sense        riboprobe Fig  ATPase  probe panels NRL S and PcIRL        S but was seen in    cells per alveolus in the NRL        sections reacted with the antisense riboprobe Fig         ATPase  probe NRL AS Large alveolar macrophages with        blue precipitates were also seen in some of the alveolar        spaces In addition some of the epithelial cells of the        very distal parts of the respiratory tree also showed blue        precipitate Data not shown In sections of PcIRL reacted        with the antisense riboprobe hybridization signal was        seen in many more cells per alveolus when compared to those        of NRL Some alveoli were packed with foamy exudate        indicative of a heavy         P carinii infection Most of the        cells in the septal areas around these alveoli reacted with        the probe Fig  ATPase  probe PcIRL AS but there        was no reaction with the probe in consolidated alveolar        spaces indicating that the probe did not react with         P carinii organisms        Cells in the apical areas of the alveoli are usually        type II pneumocytes and the nonciliated cuboidal        epithelial cells in the very distal parts of the        respiratory tree are usually Clara cells   The        observation that cells reacted with the ATPase  gene probe        are located in these two areas suggests that type II        pneumocytes and Clara cells are the cell types that        overexpressed the ATPase  gene To confirm this        possibility         in situ hybridization with a probe        specific for type II pneumocytes and Clara cells was        performed This probe was a bp fragment of a portion of        the rat surfactant proteinB SPB gene embXRNSPB        that is expressed only in type II pneumocytes and Clara        cells          As seen in Fig SPB probe S tissue sections NRL or        PcIRL reacted with the SPB sense probe showed no        hybridization signal Similarly to those probed with the        ATPase  gene cells in the apical area of alveoli  per        alveolus and epithelial cells lining the distal airways of        NRL sections showed blue precipitate when reacted with the        antisense SPB probe Fig  SPB probe NRL AS In        PcIRL sections reacted with the antisense probe more        cells than in the NRL sections in apical areas of alveoli        had blue precipitate indicating SPB expression Fig         SPB probe PcIRL AS        To confirm that ATPase expressing cells are type II        pneumocytes and Clara cells doubleprobe fluorescent         in situ hybridization was performed        Sections of NRL and PcIRL tissues were hybridized        simultaneously with fluoresceinlabeled SPB and        digoxigeninlabeled ATPase  riboprobes Hybridized        fluoresceinlabeled SPB or digoxigeninlabeled ATPase         riboprobes were visualized as green or red fluorescence        respectively using the appropriate filter on a fluorescent        microscope Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI and emitted        a blue fluorescence under the appropriate filter Sections        of NRL and PcIRL hybridized with the sense probes for both        ATPase  and SPB showed little red or green fluorescence        Fig  G and H These sections exhibited predominately        host cell nuclei that appeared as large blue elliptical        rings or spherical masses whereas         P carinii nuclei appeared as small        blue punctate clusters in the alveolar spaces Fig H        Composite images of NRL Fig A and PcIRL Fig B        sections hybridized with the antisense riboprobe for both        ATPase  and SPB exhibited large blue nuclei surrounded by        yellow fluorescence in the cytoplasm This yellow        fluorescence was due to complementation between red and        green signals derived from antisense ATPase  red signal        and SPB green signal probes that hybridized with RNAs in        the same cells Panels  C and D and E and F are images        of A and B respectively split into individual green        SPB and red ATPase  channels With very rare        exceptions cells that expressed the ATPase  gene also        expressed the SPB gene In addition no hybridization        signal red or green was seen in areas that had clusters        of         P carinii organisms These results        strongly indicate that type II pneumocytes and Clara cells        are the sources of ATPase  overexpression during         P carinii infection                    Discussion        The technique of mRNA differential display has been used        to detect differences in gene expression between different        types of cells    during cell transformation           and in various stages of disease development   In        this study we used it to detect genes that are        overexpressed in         P carinii infected cells        Homogenates of lungs from noninfected and         P carinii infected rats were used        to inoculate a human cell line the HEL cell line to        determine whether         P carinii would upregulate or        induce gene expression in infected HEL cells Unexpectedly        we detected and identified the mitochondrial ATPase  gene        which appears to be overexpressed in response to         P carinii infection as demonstrated        by Northern blot analysis Fig  and         in situ hybridization Figs and         in rat lungs The possibility that the observed increase in        hybridization signal to the rat ATPase  probe was due to        crossover contamination by yeast or         Pcarinii derived ATPase  mRNA is        remote because the mitochondrial ATPase  gene of yeast        shares only   sequence identity with that of rat        Furthermore there was no indication of ATPase  signal        originating from yeast or         P carinii organisms in the         in situ experiments that were        performed Figs and         ATPase  is a component of the F          F          ATP synthase complex which converts        the energy stored in the form of the proton motive force to        chemical energy in the form of ATP This complex is        composed of  major domains F          and F           F          is the catalytic portion of the        enzyme It lies on the matrix side of the inner        mitochondrial membrane and is composed of  subunits of                         and an ATPase inhibitor        protein   F          is the integral membrane domain of the        complex and functions as a proton channel in ATP synthesis        F          has  domains the stalklike domain        and the integral membrane domain The stalklike domain of        F          is composed of two proteins OSCP        oligomycin sensitivityconferring protein   and F            OSCP is found as a dimer in        each F          sector It interacts with the F          sector and is required for H        translocation   The integral membrane domain is        composed of  main proteins subunits  AL and         Subunit  is the product of the ATPase  gene Little is        known about the structure and function of the subunit         protein except that it is an integral membrane protein that        interacts with the OSCP subunit and may be involved in        energy coupling to the F          sector The AL subunit is also an        integral membrane protein associated with the F          sector   There are approximately         copies of subunit  involved in forming the proton        channel          Except for ATPase  and AL which are encoded by the        mitochondrial genome all of the subunits of the F          F          ATP synthase complex are encoded by        nuclear genes   It is not clear how expression of each        of the protein subunits is regulated or how the complexes        are assembled on the mitochondrial inner membrane It has        been shown that triiodothyronine T increases the        transcription of the ATPase  gene of the F          complex but has no effect on the        transcription of the  subunit of the F          sector   This result suggests        that the two sectors of the complex are not necessarily        coordinately expressed        As mentioned above the cells that expressed the ATPase         gene were found to be located at the apical areas of the        alveoli and in the epithelium of the very distal parts of        the respiratory tree The apical areas are where type II        pneumocytes are located and the very distal parts of the        respiratory tree are where Clara cells are located Cells        in these locations were also found to react with the SPB        probe Since the SPB gene is known to be expressed only in        type II pneumocytes and Clara cells the results suggest        that these two types of cells are overexpressing the        ATPase  gene in response to         P carinii infection        The fact that the rat mitochondrial ATPase  gene was        isolated from HEL cells inoculated with homogenate of         P carinii infected rat lungs        suggests that rat cells were present in the inoculum and        survived in culture This possibility is consistent with        the nature of type II pneumocytes as they are known to be        longlived in culture   In this study the HEL cells        were incubated with the inoculum for  days before the        cultures were processed for RNA isolation This day        incubation was to allow sufficient time for         P carinii organisms to interact with        the feeder layer HEL cells and for apoptosis of the        shortlived ratderived cells that were present in the        inoculum It is likely that type II pneumocytes survived        for the entire day period of incubation It is also        likely that some of the HEL cells died in the incubation        period and that differentially expressed HEL RNAs were        missed Since no human genes were found to be        overexpressed by the mRNA differential display performed        in this study the effects of         P carinii infection in gene        expression in HEL cells or in human lungs remain to be        investigated        The significance of overexpression of the mitochondrial        ATPase  gene in         P carinii infected lung is unknown        Since type II pneumocytes transform into type I pneumocytes        in response to lung injury   it is possible that this        process requires a higher amount of ATP To satisfy this        need these cells may increase the expression of the genes        of the F          F          ATP synthase complex This hypothesis        implies that the expression of all or most of the genes        encoding various components of the ATP synthase complex        would be upregulated in response to         P carinii infection It is also        possible that ATPase  plays a role in other functions that        also respond to         P carinii infection If this were        the case genes of other components of the ATP synthase        would not necessarily be upregulated together with the        ATPase  gene All of these possibilities remain to be        studied It also remains to be determined whether        overexpression of the ATPase  gene is specific for         P carinii infection It is        conceivable that overexpression of the ATPase  gene can        be a diagnostic marker if it is unique to         P carinii infection Studies are        underway to explore these possibilities                    Conclusions        The technique of mRNA differential display was used to        detect genes that have an altered expression in         Pneumocystis carinii infected hosts        The nucleotide sequence of one differentially displayed        fragment was found to be identical to that of the gene        encoding the rat mitochondrial ATPase  which is a subunit        of the F          F          ATP synthase complex Northern blot        analysis of total RNA extracted from         P carinii infected rat lung versus        that from mockinfected rat lung revealed that the ATPase         gene is over expressed during         P carinii infection Cells that        expressed the ATPase  gene were found lining the distal        parts of the respiratory tree and in apical areas of        alveoli by         in situ hybridization With a        twocolor fluorescent         in situ hybridization most cells        that expressed the ATPase  gene were also found to express        the SPB gene indicating that type II pneumocytes and        Clara cells are the cell types responsible for the        overexpression of the ATPase  gene in         P carinii infection                    Materials and Methods                  Development of P cariniiinfections in rats and          preparation of P cariniiinoculum          To develop           P carinii infection          SpragueDawley female rats were immunosuppressed with          dexamethasone and then transtracheally inoculated with           ml of homogenate of an infected rat lung containing                        P carinii trophozoites or with a          homogenate of uninfected rat lung as controls as          described previously   After development of           P carinii infection approximately          six weeks after inoculation rats were sacrificed and          lungs were removed and homogenized in minimal essential          medium MEM Life Technologies Inc Grand Island New          York containing  fetal calf serum and           nonessential amino acids Following removal of gross          cellular debris by centrifugation at             g the number of           P carinii organisms per ml of          supernatant in the infected lung homogenate was          determined as described previously                            Cell cultures          The human embryonic cell line HEL  American Type          Culture Collection Rockville MD was used for           P carinii culture When the cell          monolayer was confluent the cells were split into six          cm flasks and grown to confluence The medium on all           confluent HEL cell culture flasks was then removed Two          flasks designated noninfected NI controls were each          replenished with  ml of fresh complete media Two          flasks designated mockinfected M were inoculated          with an aliquot of normal rat lung homogenate in  ml of          complete media The remaining two flasks designated          infected I were each inoculated with an aliquot of           P carinii infected lung          supernatant containing               P carinii organisms per ml in           ml of media These  flasks were then incubated in an          isolation chamber containing a gas mixture of  O              CO             and balance N            at C for five days                          RNA extraction          RNA was isolated using the hotacidic phenol          extraction method described by Chuang           et al   HEL cells were          dislodged from the flask with a trypsinEDTA solution          washed with DEPCtreated PBS and then resuspended in           ml of icecold resuspension buffer  mM TrisHCl pH            mM KC  mM MgCl             Six ml of hot C lysis buffer           mM TrisHCl pH   M NaCI  mM EDTA           mercaptoethanol  SDS and  ml of citratebuffered          phenol pH  were added to each cell suspension The          resulting mixtures were boiled for  minute and then          extracted with phenolchloroform  The aqueous          portion of the extraction was layered onto a cushion of           M CsCl in ultracentrifuge tubes The tubes were          centrifuged at             g for  hours at C After          ultracentrifugation the supernatant was removed and the          RNA pellets were dissolved in TE buffer  mM TrisHCl          pH   mM EDTA and then treated with RNasefree DNase          I  Uml to remove any residual DNA To extract RNA          from tissue  mg of rat lung was ground in  ml of          icecold resuspension buffer The resulting homogenate          was centrifuged at   g for  minutes to remove the          gross cellular debris The supernatant was then treated          as above starting with the addition of  ml of hot lysis          buffer Eight g of each RNA was electrophoresed in          triplicate on a formaldehyde agarose gel to check for          integrity of the RNA and to perform Northern          hybridizations which were done as described previously                                     Densitometry of Northern Blots          The intensities of hybridization signal on          autoradiograms of Northern blots were determined by laser          densitometry An LKB  UltroScan Laser Densitometer          set in absorbance mode was used to scan  mmlong areas          of each lane on the autoradiogram Height width and          area of each peak were determined by a leastsquaresfit          method and the amount of absorbance over the scan length          was evaluated and corrected for baseline absorbance by          the LKB  GelScan software package                          mRNA differential display          The RNAimage Kit GenHunter Corporation Nashville          TN was used to detect differences between RNA samples of

TrisHCl pH   mM KC           mM MgCh  mM DTT  M of each deoxribonucleoside          triphosphate dNTP and  M of one of the following          anchored primers HT            A HT            G or HT            C H AAGCTT The RT reactions          were performed as described in the procedure manual of          the kit          The resulting RT reaction products were used to          prepare eight l PCRs per RT reaction Each PCR          included  l of the RT reaction containing the primary          strand cDNA reaction buffer  mM TrisHCl pH            mM KC  mM MgCl              gelatin  M of each          dNTP  M of the same anchored primer used in the RT          reaction  M of one of the eight mer arbitrary          primers API Table   Ci of  S dATP           Cimmole and  U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase          PerkinElmer Foster City CA Thermal cycling          parameters included  cycles of denaturation at C for           seconds annealing at C for  minutes and          extension at C for  seconds The final cycle          included five additional minutes at C to ensure          complete extension of all products and a subsequent hold          at C          Approximately one fifth of the PCR products from each          reaction were electrophoresed on a  denaturing          polyacrylamide gel to display the PCR product bands The          samples of reactions performed with the same primer pairs          but different templates M or I were loaded into          adjacent wells of the gel An autoradiogram of the gel          was obtained and analyzed to detect bands which were          present in one of the paired lanes but not in the other          Each band was labeled with a threepart designation          representing the anchored primer HT            A HT            G or HT            C arbitrary primer API            and the number of the differential band in the lane from          the well Therefore band AII was found in the          Aanchored primer HT            A reaction with the AP arbitrary          primer and was the second differentially displayed band          in that lane Differentially displayed bands were          isolated and reamplified with the same primer pair as          that used to produce the isolated differential display          band The amplified DNA was cloned into the TA cloning          vector pCRII Invitrogen Carlsbad CA and then          sequenced by the Sanger method using the Sequenase          Amersham Life Science Cleveland OH protocol as          described previously                            Cloning of a rat surfactant

minutes The RT reaction products were mixed with           pmoles of primer SPBF GACTAAGCCAGAGCAGAAGC and           U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and then subjected to PCR          which included  minutes at C followed by  cycles of          C for  minute C for one minute and C for           minutes The resulting RTPCR product was cloned into TA          vector pCR Invitrogen Carlsbad CA Two clones          pCRSPB and pCRlSPB which had the SPB gene          fragment in opposite orientations were selected                          Generation and preparation of riboprobes          The ATPase  clones were used as templates in PCRs          with primer pairs RATPaseF ACCCCCATCTCACTAATTCC          and RATPaseR AGTACTAGGGTAGCTCCTCC to generate a           bp fragment to make ATPase  riboprobes Similarly a           bp fragment was amplified from pCRSPb with          primers SPBF and SPBR see above to produce SPB          riboprobes Each PCR product was ligated to adapters that          contained an SP promoter sequence SP adapter in one          reaction or to adapters with a T promoter sequence T          adapter in another reaction according to the          LignScribe Ambion Austin TX protocol The ligation          products were amplified with an adapterspecific primer          and either the probespecific forward primer RATPaseF or          SPBF for the T adapter ligation or the probespecific          reverse primer RATPaseR or SPBR for the SP adapter          ligation Four PCR products were thus generated          RATPaseFT adapter SP adapterRATPaseR SPBFT          adapter and SP adapterSPBR          The RATPaseFT adapter and SPBFT adapter PCR          products were used as templates for           in vitro transcription to produce          antisense riboprobes and the SP adapterRATPaseR or          SP adapterSPBR PCR PCR products were used to make          sense probes The           in vitro transcription was          performed for  hours at C in
