            all right so uh what about automobiles   well i drive a pick up truck   uhhuh   and uh   you should live in Texas   thats probably true it its a small pickup truck though its one of those Isuzu uh space cab types with a sunroof so its actually not a real pickup truck you know its uh its got nice bucket seats so its very comfortable and uh   uhhuh     it has uh with the space cab in the back i can carry some storage but i have to admit Fred i ive never had a gun rack back there so i probably wouldnt fit in Texas   uh oh youre in trouble   you dont have a Yosemite Sam mud flap back off or anything like that   no no  no no nothing like that it my its pretty pretty i think uh       my truck sort of puts me as a uh as as a Baltimore Baltimore suburbanite i think is more uh you know i uh when i bought the truck i was going to buy a boat     uhhuh   and i needed something that would be able to haul a small boat but then i i um i because i wanted to try water skiing and enjoying some water sports and things and thats one reason why i bought it but then right after i bought the truck i broke my foot       and i and the doctor said because of the type of physical therapy i got no sideward movement you know for a couple of months and that meant the whole   yeah   season uh water skiing you know uh season was over so i thought well okay and then by the the next year i was thinking about doing it again but i invested the money in a house   oh well probably thats probably a little more sound investment   you know so little more sound investment yes so so then i still have this pickup truck and then i think well now maybe ill you know go by the boat again and of course then i broke my foot again uh so the thought     perhaps you should just uh dispel that thought   yeah that so thats so im not ever going going to own a boat   but you still like your truck though   yeah oh yeah i love my truck in fact uh well my wife and i contemplate selling both of us owned pickup trucks actually when we got married so we now were a two pickup truck family       uh hers in in some ways is is a little more convenient and then mines convenient other ways so its hard to decide she has a a cap on the back and and uh she has um uh roof racks so we were able to carry things on the roof and able to put things in the back of her truck without them ever worrying about them them getting wet or whatever   uhhuh right   but with mine see i have a space cab so you can put like luggage immediately behind the seats and i also have bucket seats and air conditioning  so each one has its good points and each one has its bad points in a two truck family yeah uh what     yeah do you feel that uh youre the always the guy that gets called when someone moves or something   i think family um i do a little bit but surprisingly i have uh two of my brothers since i bought my Isuzu pickup two of my brothers have bought uh Isuzu Troopers which actually you know can open the back and just take out your backseat and you can haul washers and dryers and almost anything in them so i think um i used to be   uhhuh        the one that was called but now everybody owns one themselves you know i do have some friends every once in a while thatll ask me and ill ill of course do that you know that doesnt matter   yeah   yeah its for for a friend youd do it anyway so it doesnt really matter   yeah thats uh it just seems that uh i dont know if id ever want to own one because i know ive used guys with pickup trucks two or three times and and they you know what are you doing this weekend well im helping a guy move you know and it just seems like theyre always getting the call   uhhuh   yeah thats true what type of car do you drive Fred   well i have a eighty five Mercury Cougar and ive had it since well eighty six actually so it was still fairly   uhhuh   you know it was a new style when it came out and uh my wife drives and eighty seven Topaz or an wait an eighty eighty seven Topaz yeah thats right and so were a Mercury family i guess   yeah uhhuh uhhuh   um not so much on her part but i dont know my dad always bought Ford and Mercury products so and i like the looks of the Cougar   yeah    yeah theyre nice looking i like them   yeah thanks and uh except for i got a some Texas hail storm damage its a little golf ball action so ive got   oh really   driving driving around a with a Chinese checker board basically   oh gee   i got that about a year and a half ago actually two years ago this May and i just totaled out the car   umhum   and uh so it paid for itself and im basically driving uh almost a free car so   yeah well thats see thats what im hoping to stop paying truck payments soon you know thats i think thats payments are important what you so but your wife drives a Mercury Topaz theyre nice too   yeah we havent had a trouble with either of them yet uh her Topaz uh   umhum   uh my Cougars got like eighty some thousand miles on it its made trips because were both from Indiana and she moved down here first she she pardon   umhum yeah so youve gone yeah back to visit family have you driven back to visit family in Indiana   uh yeah   uhhuh   yeah ive made the trip probably ten times because i was still going to school and she was down here and so its   uhhuh   its just racks up you know about sixteen hundred miles each time   yeah   and and we just started going in Carlas car the Topaz and it seems to make the trip pretty well its getting around thirty five forty miles per gallon   oh thats really good yeah   yeah it is especially we we were weighting it down a little bit it get it you know on the   umhum   it averaged out around thirty five or forty forty   yeah is uh gas mileage an important reason why you buy the cars you do   probably uh the Cougar i got it just for its looks   umhum   and uh the the Mercury brand and uh  Carla wanted a a car that got  good gas mileage a little something to get around town and uh dependable and uh   umhum   uh it it its kind of a sportier model than most Topazes its got the the stripping on the side and it came with uh i think Eagle tires   umhum yeah   some guy had some salesman had decked it out and uh   yeah   so it it looked pretty sharp   well i i take it you dont have you dont have kids then   no no we we just got a new puppy but uh       its close enough   because if you had if you had kids you wouldnt say anything about sportier looking youd be saying things like it has a good backseat       uh the car seat fits in very easily and we can seat belt it in securely its thats thats a big difference in conversations there  yeah   oh so you dont you dont have children or   no we well were uh just recently married in December   oh okay   uh but thats we we laugh now my wife says we should sell my truck and i say we should sell hers       and i said well the reason why we should sell yours Laura is because see mine has the space cab and it actually has little drop seats in the space area with seat belts i said and we can seat buckle in a car seat there   yeah   so we should get rid of yours because the three of us wont be able to go on trips i said but we can go on trips in mine you know we can travel anywhere with my truck so thats uh you know we laugh i laugh about that umhum     thats funny uh see thats true i never thought of that and   yeah   you know oh its a good child and you know loading up the kids you know we havent crossed that yet so   i know  we havent either but   have you seen these new station wagons they look pretty sharp   well what the Ford ones   uh i dont know what it was i just saw it going down and mom and the kids were in there and it looked like a pretty sleek looking car   yeah i think uh i think Ford was one of the first ones to step into that new um that new almost shuttle space shuttle like appearance and i think theyve done theyve really come on strong with some of that um   yeah yeah   uh wind resistance and energy saving and uh uh developments i think that thats their station wagon i think those are Fords but i do i like those   okay no more of the the panel station wagons anymore   yeah yeah now now the station wagon looks sleek it looks yeah   i know they do look pretty sharp   and uh and hopefully i think uh you know its supposed to get better gas mileage and um i think thats thats becoming an important thing too my wife and ive been discussing is you know looking for a car when we do get rid of one of the trucks well probably look for a car that gets good gas mileage   uhhuh   just because um it it just has become such an important thing i think for the environment and for the economy and everything you know to start to pay attention to that more and more   so you you bought an Isuzu so youre not a a the buy American crowd or   no i think i think the reason why i i bought the Isuzu is because you know i looked almost all the small trucks are made by Japanese anyway   uhhuh   theres only a couple of them like i looked the first place i went were the were Dodge Chrysler Plymouth and you know i went to a number of them and i priced them all out and i was just the the i was almost going to buy a um a Chrysler which was actually a Mitsubishi truck   uhhuh   but the salesman insulted me um the guy the salesman you know they always do that deal with you where they say well i got to go talk to my manager well here the managers actually the guy that owns the place and in this small town we live on hes always on TV   uhhuh   and he comes out of his office and i asked him for i i i said well you know it was like maybe eighty three hundred dollars for this truck   yeah   and i said well i id like it for eight thousand dollars i said for eight thousand dollars ill sell you know ill write out the down payment now and you know because i can get financing i can get financing through my credit because id checked about financing and everything you know i said ill for eight thousand dollars ill take it you know because it was oh sort of marked down you know and the and the guy came out of the back and insulted me he said he said you want a truck for under eight thousand dollars go back to the used lot its behind the building and he walked away   oh man   i guess it was a sales technique he thought he was going to pressure me into giving up that three hundred dollars that i asked for i dont know and i said i said i looked at the salesman i said im im sorry your boss just insulted me i cant its against my pride to buy a truck here now   that no kidding   and guy and i felt really bad i walked out and the guy called me at home the next couple of days it was terrible but you know i walked out i got into my brother was actually with me shopping for a car and we drove down the street and he said why dont you just look in here and we went into the Isuzu dealer because my brother always had this love for an Isuzu Trooper he wanted one you know   uhhuh   and we walked in and here there was a demonstrator model on sale like ninety six hundred dollars with everything standard
