                hello   hello  i was i was thinking about our topic for the night  um  immigration problems  we have immigration problems and what do do you think about it   well i think its a very very complicated and i sort of i see perspectives on all sides uh and ive really       have no hope for solutions but um i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue i have worked with uh uh a little bit with refugees from Southeast Asia uh whove come over um you know to escape the genocide programs that are over there and seen you know heard about some of the problems that theyve had and im also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be because i in general like a smaller rather than a larger population to the land area and um   umhum umhum where are you   im in California which has a lot of immigration probably more than any where else in the country though im not sure if thats the case     well weve got a lot too im in Texas in Garland right outside of Dallas   uhhuh yeah umhum umhum   so were getting a large  oh gosh i dont know i think theres like twenty six different languages now that are spoken in i the DISD Dallas Inner City School District   umhum umhum   Cambodians uh Asians Vietnamese we were getting a lot of um Mexican Americans you know weve had those for a long time   yeah sure well Texas used to be part of Mexico or most of it   yes oh yes  no im busy right now Steven  Steven wants me to do popcorn right now  okay       and i dont know what the solution is   i i dont either its a really delicate uh moral issue because if if you have well i guess the one thing i do see that is is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation   to get them on their   to to get them on their feet because otherwise what youre doing is youre letting people in and youre youre dooming them to being underclass people   yeah right   you know youre dooming them to ghetto life or whatever and i know that that the Southeast Asians the Hmong people that ive done some work with uh feel really quite hurt and and unsure of themselves when here because theyre coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know theyre coming from the middle ages basically and theyre being plunked down in plunked down into America many of them had been promised by the CIA during the war over there that because they cooperated with the CIA and they helped the CIA out that when they came here the CIA would help establish them in America and the CIA of course isnt doing that and uh   hum   so they come here and they dont know what what the heck theyre doing and theyre finding themselves adrift in the big cities and of course there are people in the big cities who would do like nothing better than to take advantage of them   uhhuh   and theyre theyre incredible victims of crime and part of it is this lack of lack of basic information being dissimilated and im not saying its easy to do and i know there are a few people who are trying but but the funding isnt there for very much work to be going on   and theres a lot of graft like people trying to tell them oh giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it   uh yeah exactly yeah have i mean these are people who dont have the foggiest idea about what Americas like um and its very its i   yeah right   i couldnt really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until i until i met with them and i realized that they some of the information that i just you know dont even realize and know is information they dont have and i never thought well i guess that is something you need to know you know people getting into trouble because they come here and so they start farming on uh available land you know like the median strips on freeways because no ones using it but then someone comes along and says you cant do that you know why cant they they have no idea why not some some of them you know the ones that have been here longer and have been in you know understand now but when they initially come over   you mean really trying to plant something thats what youre saying farming   yeah because theyre farmers these are all farmers coming over and theyre being put in the middle of the city   ah oh oh thats terrible   i mean theyre nomadic farmers you know theyre people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside   uhhuh   these are people whove never seen flat ground before and people whove never seen property rights before you know these people whove never seen any machines other than those used in war and uh they have you know so i i i do have a lot of sympathy for them and i feel that America could try a little bit harder to to help people adjusting to the American way because if they dont youre just going to produce you know youre going to produce an underclass you know youre going to get a situation that i think a lot like what happened to the blacks being sort of led out of slavery and then then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then and there was no real up upward movement and not being yeah um   and not being cared for yeah thats true well what did you do when you helped these people how did you what did you do through   well i i wasnt helping them i worked with them not to help them but actually for my own purposes im im a linguist and i was uh doing a language trying to learn their language a little bit and i actually um i mean helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me but i didnt i didnt i wasnt a social worker or anything like that   oh i uhhuh  uhhuh   i do have friends who have tried to do more social work you know by explaining to people how the language and what the problems learning English might be and such because all the models of teaching English are based on teaching English to Spanish speakers or to other European language speakers and people dont realize how different some of the languages they speak are   well im an ESL teacher yes  i got my certification but actually they did not teach us very many things   oh you are uhhuh well you   about how really to go about helping people to learn another language i mean its like people dont know what to say its not step to step   thats thats been my impression yeah its its not theyre not withholding information they just dont have that information they they havent the foggiest idea   yeah  but anyway i enjoy it they the kids ive worked with so far have been Spanish speaking   yes   and  but im applying for what yeah it is a lot of the words are the same or you know they just change the pronunciation a little bit but i love it i love the culture the that they  way they respect education   and Spanish is pretty close to English really and Spanish is a lot like English yeah yeah yeah   and their teachers and   umhum umhum   their parents so much more than than my children do you know and   umhum umhum   i like it and what ive been thinking about doing is volunteering for this uh Asian center that a Doctor Falk has started that works with the school district and doing what   umhum umhum   trying to get them set and inculturated   umhum umhum umhum   into the system i thought that would be good experience for me and ive applied at another district where many of the children are Asian   oh im sure it would umhum umhum   and i think that would be wonderful too   yeah it would be a good experience and youd be helping people im sure very much and and i i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble i mean and part of the problem is that a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from you know decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth they became a very successful immigrant group   right   but and but a lot of people coming over from Vietnam right now coming from war torn countries are are not not having the same success i think some people have just assumed well why why cant you be successful the Japanese were or the Chinese were or something And its really much more complicated   well and times were different too   yeah the times are different yeah   my neighbor lets see is Jewish and hes going through the i dont know Jewish League or something and helping a family thats come over from Russia   umhum umhum umhum   and he spends well right now hes down to like once a week but he was going over there several times a week to meet with the family and help them with the language and he thoroughly enjoyed it   umhum umhum oh yeah i i think its a wonderful thing to do and theres a lot theres a lot more i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers arent going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets arent going to be cut to pay for it   no   uh more of the volunteer network service because everyone gains from it   umhum   would be would might be really useful um and if its you know uh just people helping people i think makes  makes the community so much happier   uhhuh whats so sad about this is both  of the the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers but their training isnt what we need in this country and because theyre so deficient in English they havent been able to get jobs   umhum yes umhum umhum   so theyll have to go back and get a degree here you know almost start all over   yes yes ive known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country i mean and theyre highly educated people but of course if youre educated and you dont speak English no one thinks anything of you   no no and this woman was um stocking the shelves in a drugstore   umhum umhum   feel sorry for her   yeah i do too well its been good talking with you   well same here have a good night okay yes i do  okay bye   uh okay okay it does sound like you have some children to take care of  uh okay byebye
