        well Harris what was your most recent woodworking project     my most recent woodworking project was i made an oak trash can   oh all right all right   its the new thing around here is people want trash cans which match their kitchen cabinets   oh thats rather clever i hadnt thought of that   so   and im if the definition of a professional means you get paid for it then i am one   oh is that right   yeah i really am in the telecommunications business but you know one has to do what you can do to make a buck   huh well maybe a small business of woodworking on the side then do you have a lot of woodworking tools   i got uh well your basic stuff your radial arm your table your drill press   yeah   what i dont do is i dont i dont turn   that thats almost a whole another world i think well   you know it you know i build boxes as people say   yeah yeah well i subscribe to both Fine Home Building and Fine Woodworking   uhhuh   are you familiar with those   oh yeah i am i dont get either one i look through them at the uh at the newsstand and buy them on occasion i get a a newspaper called the Workshop News and i get a uh um lets see i cant read the side of it   huh   uh Woodsmith i think its called   huh     its a you know a monthly sort of brown paper type of type of thing   yeah yeah well the the thing i like about the two magazines i mentioned is theyre so inspirational   oh yeah oh ive looked through both of them you can just only afford to subscribe to so many     thats right thats right i   theres an   i think i like the Fine Home Building better   uhhuh   in terms uh one of my projects is adding molding to a rather plain house   uh yes now there you can get upside down and backwards doing crown molding   thats right thats right   you know as soon as you get your head upside down and backwards youre fine     that describes it perfectly   i made an armoire recently for my wifes store   um   and the top of it has curved crown molding   oh boy   that will yeah uhhuh it sure did   even if youre an engineer by training that can be a little tricky cant it   well what you had to it wasnt what i did was i made it up out of the crown molding around the top and the the tricky part was not making up the crown molding it was how did you cut it how did you miter the corners   uhhuh i know i know i ive been through that uh do you do a lot of projects or is this is this just mostly a hobby   uhhuh no i dont build it if somebody is not buying it   oh okay   i mean uh i build a uh i have a stock English garden bench which i make   uhhuh   which i instead of making out of redwood which is really dear on the east coast   uhhuh   is i make it up out of your regularly old forty CPI pressure treated lumber   uhhuh   and then paint it   oh   which saves on the cost   uhhuh we have a lot of those at the building where i work and i think theyre made out of teak   yeah teak is awfully expensive but the the thing about teak is you cant set it on the ground you have to set it like on flagstone or concrete or something   does it whit too badly or what   yeah its just not made for direct ground contact it pulls the  it pulls the oil right out of it   huh   it its all right outside if you go out every year and you know oil it but you know the the old green pressure treated you can ignore it if the paint falls off its still not going to hurt the wood   sure yeah   you know the paints only just to cover up the fact its green       it sounds like youre much more of a woodworker than i am i just kind of dabble in it i have done some refinishing   oh oh uhhuh   of antiques and semiantiques   uhhuh   and a little bit of repair work on that sort of thing   yeah i dont do a whole lot of that ive done some i one nice thing about living in this area is the Smithsonian nearby Smithsonian is nearby   uhhuh   and they have you can call them the their restoration lab and theyre happy to talk to you   oh is that right   so you might file that if you dont mind paying the long distance charges   huh   their restoration labs will be very happy are very happy to talk to you and say you know and you say hey ive got on what do i do now   i had no idea is the lab any place close to the mall or is it   yeah its very close to the mall its actually located in the
