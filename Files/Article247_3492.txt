                                 The Lamest Company on the Planet                        Todays topic is Planet Hollywood which filed for Chapter  bankruptcy aweek ago And todays question is Wont someone just put this dog out of itsmisery            Planet Hollywood a trailblazer in the booming field of cheesycelebritythemed restaurants featuring mediocre food has been struggling foralmost three years now It has reported shrinking earnings which eventuallyturned into losses in every quarter in the last two fiscal years If even athird of the  restaurants it owns around the world are making money Id beshocked And since April the company has been in default on  million worthof junk bonds Trading in the companys stock has been suspended and theannouncement of Chapter  means that the stock is essentially worthless Thusdemonstrating the important lesson that buying a cheap stock because youresure it cant go any lower is a mistake            Its hard to feel sorry for either the bondholders or the stockholderssince this was a train wreck you could have seen coming a mile away Clickhere foran earlier piece on Planet Hollywood But the companys proposed restructuringplan is nonetheless dismaying It keeps current management in place and handsover  percent of the equity in the company to an investor group comprisingtwo of Planet Hollywoods largest shareholders for what is relativelyspeaking a small investment of  million Current shareholders will probablywalk away with nothing current bondholders will get less than  cents on thedollar and thats if everything goes perfectly while current CEO Robert Earland Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal will get most of the new company            Still my dismay is contained by the fact that  percent of nothing isnothing and in the end it seems clear that thats all Planet Hollywood isworth The striking thing about the restructuring plan is not that the equityis being redistributed but that so much energy is being put into an enterprisethe upside of which seems so small Why after all do we need a PlanetHollywood There isnt a ravenous consumer demand that is going unmet Themedrestaurants have a terrible track record And the restaurant business ingeneral is capitalintensive highrisk and lowreward            In that sense the fact that Planet Hollywood wont just die testifies totwo things the continued strength of inertia in American business and thecontinued distance between the interests of corporate managers and corporateshareholders Despite all the talk about the Schumpeterian gales of creativedestruction that are raging through the American economy and they areraging there are still plenty of businesses that stay alive just because theyare alive In an ideal economy capital will migrate away from inefficient andunproductive businesses and toward productive businesses            But even though in the long run that does happen in the US economy asevidenced by the steady decline of Planet Hollywoods stock price forinstance and even though it happens here much more than in any othercountrys economy the long run can be very long indeed And sometimes themere fact that a company exists can be enough to trick investors into believingthat it should exist In a perfect world Planet Hollywood would havedisappeared two years ago at the point when it became clear that the noveltyof the business had worn off and that all the future held was empty restaurantsand mounting losses            The other thing keeping the company afloat is that its been run by peoplewho were taking home nice salaries and plenty of corporate perks even as theywere destroying shareholder value with each passing day For Planet Hollywoodinvestors the best thing would have been the liquidation of the company whichwould have let them take their money and put it into real companies But forPlanet Hollywood executives liquidation would have meant an end to their jobsIf youre being paid well to be captain its a lot better to let the shipslowly sink even if scuttling it is whats best for everyone on board            In todays hypercompetitive world its easy to believe that Andy Grove isright and that only the paranoid survive But when you look at how tenaciouslyPlanet Hollywood is clinging to life it seems clear that even fools cansurvive Perhaps what only the paranoid do is thrive
