                                 One System Does Not Fit All                        Dear Ann            As I see it there are three separate issueswhat topics are being taughthow much homework kids get and what approach is used for teaching With thatin mind let me continue for a minute on the question of what topics are beingtaught            The debate between coveringasmallernumberoftopicsindepth versusgettingallthefactsintokidheads has raged is raging and will rage aslong as there are children to teach Bennett wants to believe that you canteach in depth and in breadth at the same time But when I read him I canthelp thinking that the former secretary of education has never actually been agradeschool classroom teacher at least not for long I know that many schoolswith the Core Curriculum whose emphasis is breadth are doing a good job Imwilling to bet though that the best teachers in those schools prune the listsin order to spend more time on specific topicsdiminish the breadth for thesake of depth This is usually the secret of firstrate education No matterhow radical a new curriculum may be the best teachers have always quietlymoderated it            My worry about Bennetts lack of teaching experience struck me especiallywhile reading the math section in The Educated Child  Bennett presents aperfectly reasonable sequence of math skills But he also launches into arather startling antimath rap Math is hard work he says Math is not funYou shouldnt expect it to be fun You must practice practice practice Heassumes that kids will not like learning math and that parents will not havethe foggiest idea about what is going on He even provides parents with thesolutions to secondgrade math problems I suppose this is necessary in hismind since he makes a math error or two himself In his list of basic mathfacts he cant seem to get product and quotient straight when it comes tomultiplying and dividing integers            Id like to suggest he spend a few minutes polling firstgraders about theirfavorite academic subject Math he will soon discover is far and away thefavorite of a large number of kidsboys in particular but thats anotherdiscussion Just as there are children who have a seemingly natural affinityfor reading and others who have an amazing ability to imagine historicalevents there are those youngsters who just get numbers            Now to homework You suggest that public schools assign more than privateschools But in my experience there are private schools that assign a lot andprivate schools that assign a little and likewise with the public schools InNew York some of the more traditional private schools load on homework Itutor fifthgraders who are at it three four and sometimes five hours anight Literally Not wise from my point of view The load is lighter inprivate progressive schools but there too by fourth grade knapsacks usuallybulge In some of the public schools kids get a rigorous curriculumwithhomework to match But Bennett is right about many of the other schools Theydont demand enough from students I work next to a public high school and thekids go to and from with sunken backpackswhen they have backpacks at all Thenew testing requirements for highschool graduation may change that but Ihavent seen it in the backpacks yet            Leaving homework aside though which method is superior progressive ortraditional Bennett clearly sides with a traditional methodology that employssome aspects of progressive thinking That can work I also think that for theright student and with the right teacher an oldfashioned traditionalclassroom can be a great place to learn Personally I prefer teaching in aprogressive style But some students require something more traditional Iremember one child who needed help in math I tried hard to give him insightinto the concepts that underlie addition and subtraction I used blocks I usedmoney I used graph paperprogressive methods all Finally the child said tome Just show me how to do it and Ill figure out why Im doing it later Itwas a lightbulb moment for me Although most children I work with learn bestwhen they go from the concept to the rote process this student learned bestwhen I reversed my usual system            I have another student an exceptionally bright child who was enrolled inone of the most prestigious traditional schools in the city A realdrilltheskill kind of place He was floundering This year he moved to aprogressive school and he is sailing along without problems            Children and teachers are individuals One system cannot fit all And soalthough I can see standardizing the curriculum at least to a degree I worryabout standardizing the approach to teaching What does this mean about schoolchoicenot that we can discuss everything            Peggy
