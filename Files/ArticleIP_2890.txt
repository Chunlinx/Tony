                                 Machiavellian            Weve become used to rockstars leaving curiously apt or ironic song titles just before they die WhenElvis expired in  his current single was  which ended with those threelow notes Way on DOOOWN  Thats Elvis Way on down And I guessone way or another he is said a disc jockey on that sad day Well at least feet            But two months after thedeath of Pac Shakur the ironies of his passing are looking not so muchaccidental as suspiciously well orchestrated Just a few days after the murderof their biggestselling artist Death Row Records couriered his last videoI Aint Mad At Cha  to MTV coyly suggesting the network might like torush it into high rotation Filmed a few weeks earlier the video shows byamazing coincidence Pac dying in a driveby shooting in a car not dissimilarto that of Suge Knight the Death Row gangsta impresario in whose passengerseat Pac met his fate            Sincethen his fans have argued that as with that other binarily monikeredwordsmith Mark Twain rumors of Pacs death have been greatly exaggerated Thegangsta rapper they claim faked his own death The boy is still in the hoodnot the shroud But just as commentators bemoan the way contemporary pop hasdegenerated into sampling remixes and cover versions so Pacs death seemsto be merely a cunningly sampled remixed coverversion medley of previouscelebrity deaths Theres the question of physical evidence No autopsy wasconducted and the body was cremated the next dayso how do we know hesreally dead eh This is the Jim Morrison strategy The only two people who sawMorrisons body were Mrs Morrison and the doctor who signed the deathcertificate and since both these witnesses died soon after how can we everbe sure Then theres the Paul McCartney approach Just as McCartney startedrumors of his death by appearing on the Abbey Road cover without shoesand on Sergeant Pepper wearing an armband marked OPD alleged to meanOfficially Pronounced Dead so did Pac on his new album slyly adopt thename Makavelilike Machiavelli who according to Pacs rapping confrereChuck D faked his own death to fool his enemiesand pose on the cover in acrucifixion pose suggesting he intended a resurrection            There are several flaws with these theories This may bedisheartening for Pac fans to contemplate but while Jesus did return itwasnt for long Also Chuck D seems to be the only Machiavelli scholar who hasheard anything about that wily courtier dodging death Possibly hes confusinghim with that other wily courtier Rasputin the man behind the czarist thronewho was poisoned drowned etc but managed to keep coming back See BoneyMs seminal  disco hit which runs RararasputEEN  lover of theRussian queen And while its pleasant to think of Pac sitting aroundpondering whether to stay or depart this worldTo pack or not to pack thatis the questionthe best evidence against the fakeddeath theory is the albumitself credited to Makaveli and cumbersomely entitled The DonKilluminatiThe  Day Theory  It indicates frankly that PacMak didnthave that much imagination            The onlyreference youll find on the album to Maks previous identity is in the smallprint on the liner notes ExitPac ENTERMAKAVELI But alas the firststage of that maneuver is easier to accomplish than the second Pop starsperiodically reinvent themselves but even Ricky Nelsons radical decision todrop the y and relaunch himself as Rick Nelson was accompanied by a switchto gloomier more adult material by Dylan and Tim Hardin From Pac toMakaveli on the other hand is merely a matter of nomenclature Mantovaniwould at least have been different From the opening track its clear theguy has nothing to say in his new identity beyond the same old clappedoutselfjustification  begins with a mock news bulletin announcing the namechange and gloating that the Notorious BIG and several othercornysounding muthafuckerz from the East Coast will want to assassinatehim            Its hard to figure out the EastWest rap wars In thes Nat King Cole declared playfully that Mr Cole Wont Rock n RollIn the s many rockers despised disco But the rap wars are a civil waroccurring within the genre The only real precedent is the s competition ofthe crooners in  Frank Sinatra depicted his competition by parodyingSunday Monday or Always as Dick Todd Dick Haymes and Como Thesemockrivalries were contrived to attract publicity and promote salessurelythats true of the rap wars too Why else would Suge and his record companyallow Mak the Knife to bore on ad nauseam throughout his album about all thoseEast Coast muthafuckerz In what may be the ultimate postmodernselfreferential autocommentary in contemporary popular culture Mak begins with a radio phonein in which the host is discussing Pacs previous recordon which the rapper taunted the Notorious BIGwho he believed had a part inhis  shootingwith a reference to Mrs BIG I fucked your bitch youfat mutherfucka If only all these rivalries could be resolved with the graceof George Harrison who after losing Patti Boyd to Eric Clapton recorded aversion of Bye Bye Love amending the line I hope shes happy I sure amblue to I hope shes happy ol Clapper too            But with this album musical comparisons are irrelevantThe most melodically interesting track is the exhibitionist provocation ofa love letter to his gunand it soon dawns on you that thats only becausehes swiped the tune from Stevie Wonders  Otherwise most of the creativeenergy seems to have gone not into the music but into the dialogue and soundeffects that precede and increasingly disrupt the songs Those who bemoan thedecline of radio drama should listen to all the screeching tires and gunfireand marvel Those who hail Pac as a poet should realize that on this albumthe lyrics are the merest afterthought by this stage he was more gangsta thanrapper The only interesting musical effect is the funereal bell tollingthroughout             Ask not for whom the belltolls it tolls for Tu Yes hes dead And if his death seems exquisitelywell timed lets tactfully put that down to shrewd career management on thepart of Suge and Death Row A few years ago I was driving around New York withPaul Simon for a BBCTV film when the car went over a pothole and the radiojumped from some tasteful doowop on WCBSFM to a rap station This saidSimon sadly is the perfect soundtrack for an age of instant gratificationMaybe Death Row is the first record company to understand as manufacturers ofautomobiles and homeentertainment centers do the need for builtinobsolescence Happy is the gangsta rapper who lives to celebrate  years inshow business
