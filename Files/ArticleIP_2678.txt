                                 The Buck Stops With the Doc            When medical practice goeswrong who is to blame The traditional answer in journalism has beenunambiguous the doctor If the press found out a person had died from impropercare or had had the wrong leg cut off the reaction was predictable A clamorwent up for the incompetent physicians heador at least his license Anddoctors everywhere cringed There but for the grace of God go I each of uswould say For all of us make terrible mistakes Only the unlucky few arepublicly exposed            So Ivebeen intrigued by the increasingly popular alternative explanationthe systemdid it In many cases this is the right way to go Bad systems are more oftenat fault than bad doctors I worry however that we have already begun to takethis explanation too farso far that we are introducing a dangerous murkinessinto the question of who is ultimately in charge when it comes to taking careof patients            Take the recent horror story in which Christopher Sercye ayearold gunshot victim lay bleeding to death  feet from the door of aChicago hospital while the staff refused to help citing hospital policyprohibiting workers from leaving the emergency room If you somehow missed orhave forgotten the details click  The case provoked a national outcry Thistime the whitehot light of publicity focused blame more on the administratorsthan on individual caregivers City state and national officials demanded toknow how a medical facility could maintain such an appalling policy In anunusual step President Clinton personally announced that the policy was sooutrageous that he would seek to have the Ravenswood Hospital Medical Centerexpelled from Medicare            In this particular casehowever the impulse to hold the CEO more responsible than the doctors seemswrong What shocked me was not so much the hospitals policy as the fact thatdoctors and nurses would stick by the rules rather than help a person indesperate need News organizations demanded an explanation from the hospitalCEO John Blair but I could find no reports that mentioned so much as the nameof a staffer who had refused to help            This wasnot an isolated instance of medical personnel providing bad care in obeisanceto a policy The Los Angeles Times recently uncovered several cases inwhich doctors at Northridge Hospital in Southern California refused to provideepidural anesthesia during childbirth to women on Medicaid unless they anted up on the spot The reason It was hospital policy patients were told Onepatient offered credit cards a check and finally had her mother wire in themoney but the epidural was denied The cash hadnt arrived in time            Certainly these policies deserve scrutiny Butthe real issue here is who ultimately is in charge of patient care Byputting all the blame on the rule makers the public is implicitly acceptingthat sometimes the rule makers are in charge instead of the caregivers That isa very recent phenomenon and it should be resisted            Hospitalpolicies after all are not federal laws They do not demand slavish devotionIn odd cases rules adopted for the best of reasons can make for bad medicineAnd real life is full of odd cases I remember one not long ago when late atnight a patient came into my hospital at deaths door because of a rupturingabdominal aneurysm Understandably our hospital forbids residents to startoperations without an attending surgeon present But none was around and thisguy would have died waiting So we didnt hesitate to break the rules andoperate on our own It was his only chance            Ravenswoods policy may also have been well intentionedAccording to a hospital spokesman it is an old policy maintained by mosthospitals to make clear that staff should not be expected to sacrifice the careof sick patients in the ER to go hither and yon But the dying boy presented acase where the staff should have broken that rule Indeed the ChicagoTribune reported that a year earlier an emergency worker at a partnerhospital with the same policy had done just that He ran outside to help awoman suffering a brain hemorrhage in her car            As forjust plain barbaric policies like the one at Northridge Hospital I see no wayin which the doctors who follow them are not ultimately culpable To say theywere obeying an administrators instructions is not even the slightest defensePatients still can and should insist on holding doctors responsible forproviding proper care            The managed care debate presents this issue ina slightly different context The recent clamor in the press and among somepoliticians to allow patients to sue insurers for medical malpractice makes itsound as if we are going in the wrong direction here too But the semanticsare important The laws under consideration would not actually make insurersliable for malpractice  Instead they would make it easier to sueinsurers for failing to pay for proper care Im all for giving patientsa fair chance to contest improper refusals of payment but we should not lapseinto calling such refusals malpractice Just because an insurer wont pay for atreatment doesnt free a doctor from providing it Essentially a patient inthis position is uninsured And doctors are still ethically obliged to offerappropriate care to uninsured patients in need            This might sound like Imcalling for a return to olden times when medical decisions were nobodysbusiness except the doctors and the patients Im not That fragmented systemwithout oversight had its problems deviance not all doctors provided goodcare and cost the doctors drove up the bills Hospitals governmentinsurers and private insurers have stepped in with standard guidelines forcare review of medical decisions and changes in how doctors are paid Much ofthis systematization of care has clearly been to public benefit But not all ofit has and not all of it will be            At themargin we doctors have found ourselves being asked to do things that make usqueasy A new guideline for example may tell us to send heart surgerypatients home earlier It forces us to justify doing otherwise Its a big painin the butt But it is not a command and we should not let it become onePerhaps the previous way was based on nothing more than fusty old habit andbeing forced to rethink it is good for us However if I know the new way isinappropriate I cannot be permitted to cave In Chicago and in Northridge thedoctors should have known that blindly following policy was bad The buck stillstops with
