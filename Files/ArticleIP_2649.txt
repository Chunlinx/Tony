                                 Big Tobaccos SelfImmolation            At this point why dont wejust line tobacco company executives up against the wall gun them down andthen blow up all the cigarette factories Itd certainly be more cathartic forthe antismoking forces and probably less painful for the tobacco industrythan the farcical death by a thousand cuts process thats currently underway inWashington            RJ Reynolds ChairmanSteven Goldstone probably wouldnt opt for the firing squad But hispronouncement this week that the deal now being worked over in Congress isdead probably signals the final collapse of tobacco industry support for asettlement that once promised to serve the interests of both antitobaccoforces and the industry That  billion settlement agreed to last June byRJ Reynolds Philip Morris and their smaller kin would have ended mosttobacco advertising raised the price of cigarettes by more than  cents apack given the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate nicotinecommitted the industry to reducing teen smoking and established a trust fundto pay for past health claims and help smokers quit Other than the FDAprovision these were all voluntary agreements on the part of the industrywhich made them in exchange for protection against class action suits andpunitive liability            Thesettlement was negotiated with a group of state attorneys general who werealready suing or planning to sue the tobacco companies to recoup Medicaid costsfor the treatment of dying smokers But the national character of thesettlementparticularly the protection from liabilitymeant that Congress hadto ratify it And after some delay the Senate commerce committee lastWednesday approved a revised version of the agreement The provisions regardingadvertising the FDA and teen smoking are pretty much the same if a littletougher while the price tag has been raised to more than  billion Inexchange the tobacco companies get  well nothing The protection frompunitive damages and class action suits is gone replaced only by a cap on theamount the industry has to pay every year If this is a settlement so was theVersailles Treaty            It is of course difficult to feel sorry for the tobaccoindustry if only because it spent more than  years lying about what it knewto be true namely that nicotine was addictive and that smoking caused lungcancer But the Senate tobacco bill is nonetheless a preposterous piece oflegislation predicated on the concept that the industry has near total controlover whether people smoke or not Its a bill for people who want to bancigarettes but dont haveor arent willing to spendthe political capital itwould take to do so Moreover parts of it are either unconstitutional orunworkable since the bans on advertising would have to be agreed to by theindustry which at this point doesnt really have an incentive to agree toanything And yet whats really odd about the whole affair is that the tobaccocompanies really have no one to blame but themselves            What Imean by that is not the obvious point which is that if these companies didntmake products that kill people they wouldnt be in trouble What I meaninstead is that the commerce committee bill is in a sense the result of thecollision between Big Tobaccos two great obsessions lying and shareholdervalue And its the industrys commitment to both thats got it into thismess            If you want to pick a moment when a punitivelaw against tobacco became almost inevitable it might very well be that Aprilday four years ago when seven tobacco executives went before a House committeeand said that nicotine was not addictive This was injudicious of themconsidering that as early as  Brown  Williamsons general counsel hadwritten in a memo We are in the business  of selling nicotine anaddictive drug As a symbol of industry arrogance and deceit youd have tosearch far and wide to find a better example than the photo of those sevenexecs            Ofcourse they were simply doing what the industry has done ever since the lates when it became clear both that cigarettes were bad for people and thatthe nicotine in them was addictive Instead of admitting what almost everyonebelieved Big Tobacco insisted on complete denial Initially this strategymade a certain amount of sense from a business angle Until the surgeongenerals  report and until warnings went on cigarette packs admittingthat cigarettes were dangerous could have opened the companies up to consumerfraud as well as product liability charges            After their packs began carrying warnings about the hazardsof smoking though it was hard to see how anyone could argue that the tobaccocompanies were deceiving their customers though certainly lawyer afterlawyer has tried And yet the tobacco industry persisted in its strategyInstead of being honest about smokings dangers and then arguing that adultsshould be allowed to choose their own poison the industry hid And in hidingit left itself with no real protection against the prohibitionist impulse Formore on how the industry booted its informed choice argument click             If thedecision to lie took away the industrys ability to make a plausible case forindividual choice its obsession with shareholder value made it believe thatonly a massive settlement could solve its problems Although Philip Morris isan enormously profitable company its stock price has remained relativelydeflated because investors were so concerned that the company might lose amassive class action lawsuit somewhere down the road Signing an agreement thatwould protect the industry from such suits would boost the stock priceimmediately even if that agreement cost hundreds of billions of dollars Inother words Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds would make fewer dollars but eachone of those dollars would be valued more highly by the stock market            Shareholder value which is shorthand forexecutives obsession with their companies stock prices has become the prismthrough which most of corporate America now sees business This has had somebeneficial effects but in the case of tobacco it pushed the industry into asettlement it could not control Its possible that these companies believedthat their lobby in Washington was so strong that Congress would ratify anydeal But if so this was selfdelusion on a really impressive scale            In the history of tobaccolitigation only one plaintiff had ever been awarded any damages and thosewere compensatory rather than punitive Save for one Florida jury wheneverjuries have been asked whether the tobacco industry is liable for a smokershealth problems theyve decided that the plaintiff knew what the risks wereand chose to ignore them Given that theres a real argument to be made thatthe tobacco companies should have just continued to litigate on a casebycasebasis They were spending obscene amounts of money on litigationas much as million a year by one accountand the strain of wondering if this casewould be the one that broke the bank couldnt have made working at thesecompanies much fun But next to  billion  million a year looks like abargain And as time went on the case for tobaccos liability would have grownweaker since public awareness of smokings hazards has grown stronger            Itspossible of course that the cost of losing a major class action suit or oneof these state Medicaid suits was just too enormous to chance But what seemsclear is that the desire to get a higher stock market valuation combined witha history of refusing to defend itself honestly pushed the tobacco industry tothe negotiating table And therein no small part as a result of thathistoryit has found itself with very little leverage For  years BigTobacco never gave an inch Its not really surprising that when it finallydid its foes realized they could take a mile                           If you missed thediscussion of tobacco executives choice to smoke click
