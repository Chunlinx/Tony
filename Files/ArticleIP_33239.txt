                                 Brits as Corny as Iowa in August            In therun up to Vladimir Putins confirmation as the new Russian prime ministerMonday papers continued to speculate about the reasons for his predecessorsremoval In the Sunday Times of London Yeltsin biographer Leon Aron declaredthat the sole rational explanation for the dismissal of Sergei Stepashinappears to be a sudden deterioration of Yeltsins health and his expectation ofincapacitation or even death  It is reasonable to assume the presidentwanted to see in the Kremlin someone he could trust in the interregnum to keepa firm hand on the wheel            TheJerusalem Postsaidthat Stepashin proved to be nicer and more honorable than the Yeltsinentourage hoped or the opposition feared  In contrast it is widely assumedthat Putin would be prepared to do whatever it takes to assure that the Yeltsinfamily remains a commanding presence in Russian politics The Post alsosaid that Yeltsins attempts to subvert or cancel elections could backfireand added Even more ominous is the possibility that political infighting inMoscow could shift the real power to regional governors many of whom are evenless democratic and more selfserving than Yeltsin himself The fragmentationof a country with thousands of nuclear weapons could have terriblerepercussions far beyond Russias borders            TheLondon Observer speculated that Yeltsin might try to hold onto power by causing the cancellation of elections This could be done thepaper said either by declaring a state of emergency or a hasty union withBelarus so that Yeltsin who cannot by law have more than two terms couldbecome Federal Presidentas Slobodan Milosevic did in Yugoslavia when his termas Serbian President finally ran out            Newspapers in Britain Ireland and Colombia fronted remarkably similarphotographs of impassioned gatherings this weekend The European shots weretaken in Omagh Northern Ireland where thousands marked the oneyearanniversary of the bomb that killed  and injured more than  the Colombiancrowds protested the assassination of humorist and journalist Jaime Garznprobably by rightwing paramilitarists            Regarding Omagh Britains Sunday People said that last years bombing by the splintergroup Real IRA could easily have derailed the peace process but the desirefor peace was too strong for one breakaway IRA group to torpedo it All sidesnow owe it to the Omagh victims to make sure that by next August they aresigned up to a fair and lasting peace The Sunday Telegraph took a lesspositive view saying Strip away all the talk about peace and progress andlook at what has actually happened in Northern Ireland since the Good Fridaydeal The brutal reality is that the only concrete changes are the weakening ofthe forces of law and order and the simultaneous strengthening of theparamilitaries whose ranks are now swollen by a number of formerprisoners            InColombia ElTiempo said Garzn was killed because of his attempts to bring an endto the political fighting in Colombia especially his negotiations with leftistgroups and also because of his efforts to secure the release of many kidnapvictims An article in the Guardian of London Saturday said that Colombians have longago become desensitised to violence Apathy is deeply ingrained and it isunlikely things will change despite the widespread repugnance and anger shownby most of the countrys citizens but an editorial in El Tiemposuggested otherwise Echoing the cries of Colombians who lined Garzns funeralparade the paper said NO MORE NO MORE NO MORE  Let the governmentFARC ELN the countrys two largest leftist rebel groups the paramilitariesand the extreme right end their deafness and understand that we are notafraid            TheBritish papers took a field trip to the United States for the straw poll andcame back with stories that made Iowa seem more like a distant planet than aMidwestern state The Independent on Sunday puzzlingly described Des Moines as a cross between s Berlin andCalcutta and speaking of the polls disproportionate influence on the USelectoral process said It is as if the population of a Lincolnshire villagewere pivotal in deciding the British government            Aleader in the Times said that even if media inquiries into Republicanfrontrunner Gov George W Bushs private life were to uncover damagingdetails it might not put him out of the running since  character issueshave less power than they did to wreck candidates The Clinton era hasrewritten the rulebook Unless Mr Bush has committed some major sin veryrecently he is likely to survive any new revelations The paper added thatSen John McCain of Arizona may have helped his chances by staying out of thestraw poll He has thus placed himself to emerge later as a new voice thatcould win over voters who found beauty in none of those parading theircredentials at Ames Iowa            Ifelectoral politics are indeed a beauty contest and if a history of sinning isno longer an impediment to electability perhaps Warren Beatty couldbecome president A story in Fridays Independent put a positive spin onhis possible run Despite his lack of electoral experience the paper saidBeatty had several key qualifications He fosters instant name recognitionHe is goodlooking He is smart charismatic and a good talker True he has aninfamous past as a skirtchaser but unlike Bill Clinton with his taste inbighaired trailerpark mistresses he can honestly say he has slept with someof the most beautiful women in the world
