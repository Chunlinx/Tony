                                  The Last Word            The book is done            How long Ive waited to write these words It was adecade ago this summer that I began my biography of Saul Bellowor rathersigned a contract with a publisher declaring my intent to write it Last week Iturned in  pages of manuscript to my beleaguered copy editor VirginiaAvery a kindly whitehaired woman with a handsome New England face andreserves of patience that run deep            From the beginning the issue of duration loomedWhen my agent asked me how long I thought it would take to write the bookhewas negotiating the delivery dateI answered cheerfully Ten years            You cant say that he informed me No one willsign up a book thats going to take that long            Why not I trotted outthe legendary biographies known to every practitioner of the tradebiographylore Leon Edels year labor on his fivevolume Henry James How longLeon how long a reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement hadimportuned after the appearance of the third volume Richard Ellmanns yearlabor on James Joyce And to say that Nancy Milfords biography of Edna StVincent Millay is longawaited would beas James himself might havesaidputting too fine a point on it Milford is already well into her thirddecade on the project with no end in sight Sally Fitzgerald has been at workon a biography of Flannery OConnor since I was in college and I graduated in Lewis Dabney signed up to write the biography of Edmund Wilson that Ijettisoned in the early s and theres no trace of it Some of my bestfriends are biographers and theyve been in no hurry to deliver Jean Strousedevoted  years to JP Morgan and Judith Thurmans Colette isforthcoming this fall after  years Edmund Morris finishing hisReagan after a dozen years is considered a model of punctiliousness Adecades nothing            Still the general reader may be permitted to wonder Whyis biography such a protracted affair Novelists seem able to turn out a bookevery year or two Historians as burdened by footnotes and data asbiographers seldom devote more than five years to a book Whats our problemIs it some congenital defect of biographers A laziness or dilatory habit ofmind My guess is that our failure of promptitude has to do with the uniquerelationship we establish with our subjects dead or living Unlike thenovelist who invents supposedly his characters or the historian whograpples with a populous cast the biographer enters into a curious intimacywith the person being written about a relationship charged with ambivalenceresentment love dependency and all the myriad other emotions that crowd inwhenever we allow ourselves to become intimate with another That thebiographer doesnt actually live with or in many instances even know hissubject that the relationship may be involuntary an unauthorized biographythat its by its very nature unequal one person focusing attention on anotherwith no hope of reciprocity in no way diminishes the intensity of theexperience As any biographer will tell you the act of writing a biography isallconsuming The abject acknowledgments pages tell the tale To my wife whoendured my obsession with grace  To my children who grew up hearing aboutX at the dinner table  Its a wonder we dont all end up living alone inboardinghouses            In my case the equationwas infinitely more complicated than I could have fathomed when I embarked onmy biography of Bellow in the summer of  It was in many ways an almostinevitable project for me I am from Chicago Bellows turf my firstbiography of Delmore Schwartz had closely paralleled Humboldts Gift Bellows novel about Schwartz I was steeped in the Jewish immigrant world hewrote about My subject wary by nature had after a year of elaborateequivocation arrived at the point where he would grant me access to hispaperssubject to his approvaland consent to be interviewed from time totime I didnt want him to authorize the book I wanted my freedom And for hispart Bellow maintained that he wasnt finished yet wasnt ready to be summedupa reasonable stand for a robust man in his  th year In theend the book was as Bellow took to describing it neither authorized norunauthorized            Over the next decade I made my biographers rounds likethe postman deterred neither by sleet nor snownor by occasional emanations ofreticence or frostiness from my subjectfrom the routine often a fascinatingroutine of poring over his unpublished manuscripts in the rare book andmanuscript division of the University of Chicago Library lugging my laptop allover America in quest of highschool classmates cousins friends and loversof my famously peripatetic subject driving Avis rental cars into the remotestsuburbs of Los Angeles and flying into Buffalo NY in pursuit of letters inprivate hands Biography is no vocation for old men it requires physicalstamina By the time Id filled up my cupboard with the building materials formy book I was to borrow one of Bellows favorite words bushed            Then there was the laborof composition year after year of struggling to assemble these materials intoa coherent narrative form without getting bogged down by the factsthedownfall of so many of the bloated biographies that now weigh down the shelvesof Barnes  Noble for their threeweek window before being shipped back tothe publisher By the end of nine years Id written through to the endamassing  pages of typescript Even my father who might as well have beenreading the story of his own life so closely did he identify with BellowsChicago origins complained that the book was too long            The trouble is that youve gone through so much pain tocollect the damned juniorhighschool transcript or the quote from Bellowslandlord in Paris in  that you feel you have to put it injust to getcredit Only after you have a completed manuscript does your confidence buildto the point where you can go through the topheavy pile of pages andencountering the third reference to Bellows occasional book reviews for theNew York Times Book Review  decide Who cares and slash it with the redpen On my second goround I cut  pages dipping below the laminated Page Id presented in  to Katy Medina my editor at Random House asevidence of my progress Did she smile or was that a wince On the thirdpass recalling Prousts admonition to one of his correspondents that if hedonly had time he would have written a shorter letter I managed to cut another pages            At last it was clear thatI had to give up my decadal workinprogress My patient publisher was weary ofwaiting my friends were beginning to taunt me with the prospect that Id neverfinish I was ready as the selfhelp literature counsels to move on Thecover had been designed the catalog copy written I was still revising thecopyedited manuscript tearing the whole thing up finding at the lastpossible moment my voice And how to end it At last I found a way sincehappily and thanks to Bellows physical vigor I wouldnt have to write adeathbed scene a conversation hed had with Martin Amis for a BBC documentaryon Bellows life He was ruminating about death and about possibly meeting upagain with his parents and his brothers in the next world I thought of endingthe book with his quote but then some other stuff happened in his life youllhave to buy the book at your local bookstore arriving in Aprilor atleast read the reviews to find out what And Bellow too is putting thefinishing touches on a novel titled Ravelstein  about his late friendAllan Bloom so I had to mention that            After turning in the manuscript Thursday I spent theweekend revising the last four chapters and Monday afternoon I wrote the lastsentence on the last page His reunion with the dead would have to wait ThenI dropped off the last pages at Random House and rushed off to Penn Station tocatch the late train to Albany an hour from my farmhouse in the country            Depleted and drained I stared out at the HudsonRiver in the summer dusk drank two miniature bottles of Zinfandel and fellasleep My reunion with the living would have to wait
