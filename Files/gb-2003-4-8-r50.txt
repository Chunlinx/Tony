                    Background        The karyotypes of humans and the African and Asian great        apes are remarkably well conserved with relatively few        largescale chromosomal changes among these species despite        the considerable phenotypic and biological differences        between hominoids       This conservation is        particularly relevant in comparisons between the human          Homo sapiens  HSA and common        chimpanzee          Pan troglodytes  PTR genomes for        in order to completely ascertain the evolution of our own        lineage it is necessary to understand what differentiates        us at the genomic level from our closest relatives        Furthermore insight into the mechanisms underlying        primate chromosomal evolution can be obtained from the        molecular characterization of speciesspecific        rearrangement breakpoints Recent analyses of synteny        disruptions between man and mouse although valuable do        not provide the level of detail afforded by the comparison        of closely related species such as chimpanzee and human                    Several mechanisms of genetic change are thought to lead        to speciation including gene evolution via coding sequence        mutation gene expression variation by regulatory element        mutation and chromosomal rearrangement  which has the        potential to create reproductive barriers and induce        genetic isolation within an existing population            Although a thorough determination of all genetic        differences between humans and our closest nonhuman        primate relatives will not be possible until the genomic        sequences of great ape species have been determined many        of the chromosomal rearrangements between great apes have        been previously characterized at the cytogenetic level        Primarily examined through the use of Gbanding        cytogenetic techniques the human and common chimpanzee        karyotypes differ by only  euchromatic rearrangements a        telomere fusion between PTR chromosomes  and         resulting in HSA chromosome  and  pericentric inversions        HSA               The        predominance of pericentric inversions between chimps and        humans highlights their potential importance in the        divergence of human from nonhuman primate species and        provides an opportunity to investigate the mechanism        facilitating these rearrangements Recent studies have        characterized several evolutionary breakpoints in common        chimpanzee and other great ape species including        pericentric inversions and a chromosome translocation              We present here a refinement of the breakpoint        associated with a previously identified pericentric        inversion of the human qq orthologous region in        common chimpanzee XVp to a region containing multiple        segmental duplications                          Results        A panel of bacterial artificial chromosome BAC and P        artificial chromosome PAC clones spanning approximately         megabases Mb of human genome sequence was initially        used to characterize the pericentric inversion of human        qq in chimpanzee Probes were selected that flank        known sites of genomic rearrangement based upon previous        yeast artificial chromosome YAC and BACPAC mapping        studies together with the human sequence map available        from the University of California at Santa Cruz UCSC        Genome Browser         Probes flanking the        PraderWilliAngelman syndrome breakpoints in addition to        a characterized inv dup rearrangement were selected to        test the possibility that the pericentric inversion        evolutionary breakpoint corresponded to a site of known        human genomic instability Figure  Initially the        cytogenetic map position of a total of  BACPAC probes        were comparatively mapped using fluorescence         in situ hybridization FISH data        not shown        During this analysis chimpanzee pygmy chimpanzee        gorilla and orangutan chromosomes were assayed for the        speciesspecificity of the pericentric inversion Figure         Previous cytogenetic analyses of human chimpanzee        gorilla and orangutan Gbanded metaphase chromosomes        demonstrated that the pericentric inversion was a        chimpanzeespecific event with humans maintaining the        ancestral state of this region when compared to gorilla and        orangutan      Twocolor FISH experiments utilizing        distal probe RPO and the PWSAS common deletion        breakpointmarking probe pDJA clearly show that the        chimpanzee lineage is the sole great ape species to harbor        this rearrangement Figure         On the basis of the appearance of dual FISH signals on        PTR XVp and XVq the general location of the pericentric        inversion breakpoint was identified with probe RPJ        Figures   Using the most current assembly of the        human genome available build   released November          probes adjacent to and overlapping RPJ were used in        further FISH experiments to characterize and more precisely        define the breakpoint interval Figure  Clones selected        for the array were represented as either completely        finished or working draft sequence within the human genome        assembly These clones were chosen because of their        presence in at least workingdraft status in the human        genome assembly RPO RPN RPF        RPB and RPI Overall nearcomplete        sequence coverage in the form of working draft and finished        BAC clones is available for this region of q although        there are several discontiguous placements of working draft        sequences termed warping within the assembly around        RPJ and the overlapping clone RPB see for        example Figure  RPF and RPN We believe        that this warping or fragmented arrangement of working        draft sequence contigs that span a distance exceeding the        total sequence length within an accession is likely to be        due to the presence of segmental duplications as discussed        below In this second round of FISH experiments all but        one of these clones RPI displayed the dual signal        on PTR XVp and XVq Figure         We then defined the inversion breakpoint interval as the        region between the most distal probe on HSA q to display        a PTR XVp signal RPJ and the most proximal probe        on HSA q to display a PTR XVq signal RPI Figure         This interval encompasses approximately  Mb of genomic        sequence including all clones which produced dual FISH        signals in PTR hybridizations Interestingly all of the        clones which produced the dual FISH signals in PTR were        confined to a  kb segment of this interval These        results imply that either the pericentric inversion        involved the duplication of a large chromosomal segment or        that the inversion involved a sequence common to all clones        in the  kb interval        We extracted the  Mb interval from the November         human genome assembly and performed a sequencesimilarity        search against the entire human genome build  Figure         and the nonredundant nucleotide NT and high throughput        genomic sequence HTGS databases data not shown using        MEGABLAST The output was parsed and displayed in the        graphical program Parasight Jeff Bailey unpublished        work which allows for the visual identification of        duplicated sequences Figure  Interestingly the        segmental duplications identified in this analysis were        confined to the  kb covered by the clones which produced        the dual FISH signals in PTR We identified two known        duplications from this analysis which is in agreement with        previous segmental duplication analyses available from the        UCSC Genome Browser      The first is derived from        the a duplication of the         CHRNA gene characterized in detail        by Riley         et al      This sequence was        duplicated from the intact         CHRNA locus in q and is highly        homologous   similar to the ancestral locus The         CHRNA duplication involves at least         kb of material indicated in Figure  however because        of the fragmented nature of the assembly in this region at        this time that number could increase with future versions        of the human genome assembly The second duplicon        recognized within the  kb subinterval was originally        described as the GolginLinkedtoPML promyelocytic        leukemia duplicon or GLP duplicon by Gilles         et al     and subsequently        described as LCR by Pujana         et al      Gratacos         et al     and Pujana         et al     The roughly  kb        GLPLCR duplicon is present in approximately eight copies        throughout the  kb duplicationrich subinterval Figure                Although the         CHRNA duplication had on the basis        of sequence identity previously been postulated to be        humanspecific the location of this duplicon within the         kb interval associated with the pericentric inversion        in chimpanzee necessitated determination of the copy number        of         CHRNA within the chimpanzee genome            First chimpanzee BAC library hybridizations         times coverage from RPCI and CHORI segment  BAC        library filters were performed with a probe derived from         CHRNA related sequence yielding a        total of four positives which was consistent with a        singlecopy locus data not shown Second comparative        FISH analysis of RPN a clone which contains a        substantial portion of the ancestral q         CHRNA locus produced a single FISH        signal on PTR XVq only summarized in Figure  Finally        Southern blot analysis was performed using a probe designed        to a         Pst I restriction fragment length        polymorphism RFLP which distinguished the donor and        duplicate copies of human         CHRNA Figure  Upon hybridization        of this probe to a panel of human pygmy chimpanzee common        chimpanzee and gorilla genomic DNAs two bands were        observed in the human sample and a single band was noted in        all great ape species providing further evidence that the         CHRNA duplication was specific to        humans and was not present at the time of the pericentric        inversion event in the chimpanzee genome                    Discussion        Using a panel of FISH probes spanning several known        sites of rearrangement within qq we were able to        narrow the region containing the PTR pericentric inversion        breakpoint to a complex cluster of segmental duplications        approximately  kb in length according to the most        recent assembly of the human genome Comparative analysis        using material from other great apes including gorilla and        orangutan indicated the inversion event was restricted to        the chimpanzee lineage It should be noted that the        inversion although primarily characterized in the common        chimpanzee          Pan troglodytes  was also observed        in the pygmy chimpanzee          Pan paniscus  thus dating the        inversion event more precisely to an interval of         million years ago data not shown Although human        chromosome qq is noted for its exceptional        instability associated with human disease and chromosomal        rearrangement it is noteworthy that the orthologous site        of rearrangement in the human genome did not correspond to        one of the three major previously described common disease        rearrangement breakpoints        Similarly        probe RPO distal of the previously characterized        inv dup breakpoint and probes RPJ and        RPN which flank an additional inv dup        rearrangement breakpoint S Schwartz unpublished data        also appeared to have no role in this evolutionary        breakpoint between man and chimpanzee             Our FISH results using probe RPJ which        demonstrated dual signals on PTR XVp and XVq indicated we        had reached the site of the pericentric inversion or        alternatively a sequence within RPJ had been        duplicated to both arms of PTR XV Consequently we        performed comparative FISH in human and chimpanzee using        multiple BAC clones that flanked RPJ in the November         build of the human genome Figures   From on its        position in the human assembly clone RPJ was the        most distal to show a FISH signal on a single PTR        chromosome arm XVp Conversely probe RPI        hybridized to HSA and PTR XVq indicating the pericentric        inversion breakpoint likely lies proximal of this position        in the human assembly All probes tested between        RPJ and RPI produced signals on PTR XVp and        PTR XVq near the centromere In addition several probes        that yielded dual signals flanking the PTR centromere also        produced a signal in the region orthologous to HSA q        Figure         We next investigated the nature of the sequence        underlying the pericentric inversion breakpoint by        extracting the  Mb interval encompassing the sequence        between the most distal PTR XVp probe RPJ and the        most proximal PTR XVq probe RPI from the November         human genome assembly This interval includes        approximately  kb of sequence spanning FISH probes        RPO RPN RPF RPJ and        RPB all of which produced dual FISH signals        flanking the centromere in PTR XVq and XVp Figures          Sequence similarity searches of the  Mb interval against        both the November  assembly and the NT and HTGS        databases were in agreement with previous global analyses        of the human genome which indicated multiple segmental        duplications in the interval Figure              We were able to discern two major duplicons from this        analysis one segment derived from the         CHRNA locus in q previously        described by Riley         et al      and several copies        of a duplicon described as GolginlinkedtoPML GLP           and as LCR       A third previously        undetected potential segmental duplication was identified        in the proximal third of the  kb region Figure         indicated by the asterisk However considering the        assembly of the region which involves significant warping        or artifactual fragmentation of accessions AC        RPF and AC RPN and the high        sequence identity of the duplications further validation        is warranted        In Riley         et al      the authors theorize        that the duplication of the         CHRNA locus is a humanspecific        event because of the high sequence homology of the        duplicated segment to the donor segment in q and the        fact the         CHRNA duplication appeared        polymorphic in the human population     This        hypothesis deserved consideration in this study as the        site of duplication of the         CHRNA locus in the human genome may        correspond to the pericentric inversion breakpoint and the        high sequence homology noted between the donor and        duplicated         CHRNA loci does not establish the        humanspecificity of the         CHRNA duplication as gene        conversion may also maintain high sequence homology of        duplicated segments      Thus we tested the        chimpanzee genome by Southern genomic analysis for the        presence of the         CHRNA duplication which revealed        this duplication is most likely humanspecific and        therefore did not contribute to the pericentric inversion        in chimpanzee Figure  Our BAC library hybridization        results also support this assertion In addition FISH        results with probe RPN which contains the intact        donor         CHRNA locus did not produce dual        FISH signals on PTR XVp and XVq further demonstrating this        sequence is not involved in the evolutionary rearrangement        Finally the association of the dual FISH signal with        clones that did not contain the         CHRNA duplication RPF        indicates the split signal is caused by a duplicated        sequence within the  kb interval other than the         CHRNA related sequence Barring        other duplication events that may have been lost through        subsequent deletion we estimate that the breakpoint region        in the ancestral genome was significantly smaller around         kb or potentially smaller        Interestingly the extent of the segmental duplications        in the  Mb region examined was restricted to the clones        that showed the dual FISH signal in PTR XVp and XVq and        each clone that produced dual FISH signals contained a        GLPLCR duplicon by sequence analysis Figure  With        our results indicating the         CHRNA sequence is single copy in the        chimpanzee genome and thus unlikely to be involved in the        inversion the GLPLCR duplicon is therefore the best        candidate sequence for being present at the site of the        pericentric inversion Unfortunately the highly duplicated        nature of the region prevents precise narrowing of the        breakpoint to a specific sequence however we believe        largescale sequence analysis of this region between human        and chimpanzee will be able to reveal the precise nature of        the breakpoint sequence        Pericentric inversions are the most common rearrangement        differentiating humans and the great ape species at the        karyotypic level      In addition it has been        proposed that multiple inversions within a single        chromosome could potentially lead to speciation            The mechanism underlying their origin however remains        poorly understood It has been shown in multiple studies        that regions of segmental duplication can be associated        with evolutionary rearrangements      The pericentric        inversion of chimpanzee XVp having been localized to a        site of multiple segmental duplications in the human        genome indicates that the evolutionary rearrangement is        likely to involve such sequences On the basis of the        findings of Pujana         et al  the GLPLCR duplicon is        present at multiple regions of human genomic instability            In addition the GLPLCR duplicon was shown by        Gilles         et al  to be polymorphic in the        human population  showing that these sequences have        considerable intraspecific plasticity     The        GLPLCR duplication family has expanded over the last         million years of primate evolution before the divergence        of the great ape lineages resulting in a multitude of        copies estimated at  present at multiple sites along        chromosome  providing the conditions required for        rearrangements driven by nonallelic homologous        recombination NAHR        We have begun an        investigation of the organization of this region within the        chimpanzee lineage Both genomic library characterization        and partial sequence characterization AC indicate        the presence of both LCR and HERC duplicons in this        region No evidence of         CHRNA was found either by        sequencesimilarity searches or through sequencetagged        site STScontent hybridization mapping data not shown        Largescale sequence analysis of this region between human        and chimpanzee will be necessary to refine the exact        position of the pericentric inversion For NAHR to have had        a role however one must presume the presence of a        GLPLCRrelated sequence on the ancestral p        Alternatively this site which contains a recent        humanspecific segmental duplication of the         CHRNA locus may be a preferential        site of breakage which allowed the pericentric inversion        to occur The association of two independent chromosomal        rearrangement events at one site a pericentric inversion        in the chimpanzee genome and the insertion of a novel        segmental duplication within the human lineage may be a        consequence of the overall genomic instability of this        region                    Materials and methods                  FISH probe selection          We selected probes to refine the chimpanzee XVqq          pericentric inversion breakpoint on the basis of YAC maps          of human qq in addition to the genome assemblies          produced by the Human Genome Project      We chose          BACs targeted for complete sequencing Figure  so that          the underlying sequence of each probe would be available          for further analysis pending comparative FISH results          Particular attention was paid to the position of each          probe with respect to the three large lowcopy repeat          clusters found within qq as these clusters          contain both inter and intrachromosomal segmental          duplications and correspond to the common deletion          breakpoints of PraderWilli and Angelman syndrome          deletions        The duplication track of the          UCSC Genome Browser August  assembly displays          information obtained from a global analysis of segmental          duplications in the human genome and allows for the          selection of informative unique clones      In          this manner we selected probes flanking the human          qq rearrangement breakpoints associated with          common PWSAS deletions To mark the regions of lowcopy          repeats in human qq we utilized a probe derived          from the donor locus of a major component of the PWSAS          breakpoint duplication clusters PAC clone pDJA          which contains a significant portion of the           HERC gene in q     In          addition we selected probes corresponding to sites          distal to the PWSAS domain flanking a large          invertedduplicated  inv dup supernumerary marker          chromosome     Specifically probe RPCIO          abbreviated RPO was selected for FISH analysis          because it lies distal to the inversionduplication event          breakpoint and is linked to STS marker           DS      Upon reaching          the PTR inversion breakpoint interval with probe          RPJ flanking BACs were chosen from the November           human genome assembly to establish the extent of the          interval and define the boundaries of the interval These          additional hybridizations were performed on human and          chimpanzee material only                          Comparative FISH          Previous reports indicated that the inversion of human          qq in the chimpanzee genome occurred solely in the          chimpanzee lineage whereas humans share the ancestral          state with the gorilla            Gorilla gorilla  GGO and          orangutan            Pongo pygmaeus  PPY To confirm          these observations metaphase chromosome preparations          were generated from lymphoblastderived cell lines for          human common chimpanzee pygmy chimpanzee            Pan paniscus  PPA gorilla and          orangutan BAC and PAC DNAs isolated from bacterial          cultures Nucleobond Clontech Franklin Lakes NJ were          labeled by nicktranslation with biotin and digoxigenin          FISH experiments were performed under standard conditions              For each FISH experiment at least  independent          metaphase chromosome preparations were examined                          Duplication analysis          The approximately  Mb  basepairs bp          interval encompassing the entire pericentric inversion          breakpoint interval and the adjacent unique that is          present on only one chromosome arm in PTR FISH probes          was extracted from the November  human genome          assembly and compared to the entire genome using          MEGABLAST Prior to sequence similarity searches          however the  Mb of sequence was masked using          RepeatMasker     and all identified highcopy          repeats were filtered as lowercase letters For          efficient MEGABLAST analysis the human genome sequence          is fragmented into  kb pieces each chromosome is          fractioned separately and each fragment labeled          consecutively from ptelomere to qtelomere Thus the          most distal  kb segment of human chromosome  is          labeled chr and so on MEGABLAST parameters were          set to take advantage of the lowercase masking which          allows for alignment extension but not alignment          seeding through lowercase masked sequences The          MEGABLAST output was parsed into tabdelimited text and          displayed using the graphical alignment display program          Parasight Jeff Bailey unpublished work The results          were then compared to previous duplication analyses          available through the UCSC Genome Browser                                         Southern analysis          To determine the evolutionary age of the           CHRNA duplication with respect to          the humanchimpanzee divergence we performed a genomic          Southern blot using DNA extracted with the PureGene DNA          isolation kit Gentra Systems Minneapolis MN DNA was

  Homo sapiens had been identified          probe           CHRNA            Pst I was PCR amplified from BAC          RPJ DNA using primers           CHRNA probe forward          TGAAACCTTGGGTGAGTTGG and           CHRNA probe reverse          CAGATGAGACTGGGAAAGGC at an annealing temperature          of C for  cycles For Southern analysis all DNAs          were digested with           Pst I blotted and the resulting          membranes were hybridized and washed according to          standard protocols          Filter hybridizations of the RPCI and CHORI          Segment  libraries were performed according to          previously established methods      The          PCRamplified probe JSite amplified using primers          JSite forward GTACTTTACAAGCAGGCGGC and          JSite reverse CAGATGAGACTGGGAAAGGC at an          annealing temperature of  degrees Celsius for           cycles was designed to the           CHRNA related portion of BAC          RPJ accession AC
