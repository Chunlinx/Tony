                    Background        Mivacurium is a short acting benzylisoquinoline        nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with a        demonstrated safety and efficacy both in children and        adults       It has been in clinical use for a long        time and the clinical pharmacology has been widely        documented        In children administration of isoflurane previous to        and during the effect of vecuronium or mivacurium increases        their spontaneous recovery times in a timedependent manner             However these times are not modified if the        anesthetic gas is administered after the peak effect of the        neuromuscular relaxant is produced            Furthermore despite infants usually respond differently        to the effects of a neuromuscular relaxant from children or        adults do and that isoflurane is commonly used in children        including infants only few studies have evaluated the        effect of mivacurium during isoflurane anesthesia                     In the current study we compared the effect of  and         gkg of mivacurium in infants during isoflurane        anesthesia in order to investigate whether the higher dose        resulted in a faster onset of action Spontaneous recovery        times and cardiovascular response to the neuromuscular        relaxant were also compared                    Methods                  Measurements and outcomes          For analysis of the effect the neuromuscular response          was divided in two phases Response from the baseline          until the maximal relaxation was observed and maintained          was used to compute the times to a block of  OA             and  OA             Second response starting with          the maximal relaxation until it returned to baseline          values was used to obtain the times to spontaneous          recovery of     and  of the neuromuscular          function To obtain these parameters both T and TT          responses were analyzed          The timecourse of T or TT in each phase was          considered sigmoidally related to time and equation used          to fit them was the following                        The model used is a logistic equation where E  the          observed response           t  the time at which every          response was registered E             response at zero time b slope          factor           t             time at which halfmaximal          response is given and E           max  maximal response In all          patients the maximal block and maximal recovery were            Therefore the E           max was obtained by transforming the          maximal effect registered by the TOFGuard into the           a value fixed into the model All the other values of the          effect were then transformed according to the new           Value of the E            was then also fixed to the model          The complete neuromuscular response was fitted to time by          using the SigmaPlot  SPSS Mxico Mexico City          Mexico for Windows  and b and           t            were computed by iteration          Thereafter calculated effect was obtained by proper          arrangement of the equation described above For each          patient the HR and SBP and DBP were transformed into the          area under the heart ratetime curve AUCHR and into          the area under systolic and diastolic blood pressuretime          curve AUCSBP and AUCDBP respectively Each AUC was          obtained with data obtained immediately after mivacurium          was administered until  min The AUCs were computed by          means of the Microsoft Excel  using an adaptation of a          standard procedure     as follows                    where Y represents HR SBP or DBP the X is the time          at which Y was measured and n are the progressive          values until the last observation was performed By using          this equation the overall response of HR SBP and DBP is          obtained and compared between groups avoiding the          timebytime comparisons          Finally the onset of action was considered as the          primary outcome of the study while spontaneous recovery          times and cardiovascular response as secondary          outcomes                          Statistical analysis          All data were presented as mean  SD ranges and when          indicated the  confidence intervals for the difference          for parametric data were computed The Student           t test was used to compare age and          weight between the two groups of treatment while the          Fisher exact test was used for comparison of gender The          quality of fit of the pharmacodynamic sigmoidal model          to the data was judged by correlation coefficient of          observed to predicted effect automatically computed by          SigmaPlot  Visual examination of plots of the ratio of          observed to predicted response and plots of observed           minus predicted response in          function of time was also performed considering a good          agreement between observed and predicted response when          ratios approached  and differences approached           The times to OA and to spontaneous recovery of          neuromuscular function were also compared between groups          by the unpaired Student           t test The unpaired Student           t test was also used to compare          each AUC ie AUCHR AUCSBP and AUCDBP between          groups                          Ancillary analyses          In every group the HR and SBP and DBP data obtained           min after mivacurium was administered were compared to          their respective baseline values by means of the paired          Student           t test In order to evaluate the          effect of age and weight into onset and recovery times          data from all children a single linear regression          analysis y mxb was performed between each of the          onset and recovery times as the dependent or explained          variable and age or weight as the independent          variable          Finally descriptive statistics paired and unpaired          Student           t test and linear regression          analysis were performed using the software WinSTAT R          Fitch Software Cambridge MA USA for Microsoft Excel          A twotailed probability of p   was considered          significant in every test or analysis                            Results        The two groups were similar in demographic data        including gender age and weight Table  reflecting a        successful randomized procedure All patients reached the        maximal  relaxation response and received a Fahey        scale  for tracheal intubation and were extubated and        discharged from the operating room with a full recovery of        the neuromuscular function T   and without any        complication of drug administration All infants completed        the study and data were analyzed in the group they were        randomized Figure         Responses from all patients were successfully modeled        This was proved by regression coefficients always greater        than  by plots of ratio of observed to predicted        response in function of time approaching  and plots of        observed         minus predicted response in function        of time approaching  The times to OA and to spontaneous        recovery of T and TT of the two groups were summarized        in Tables and  respectively In relation to T response        Table  the maximal block with mivacurium  gkg        appeared one minute faster than  gkg p          whereas spontaneous recovery times were similar between        groups However analyzing TT response similar times to        OA and to spontaneous recovery were obtained with both        doses Table  Additionally no relationship between age        or weight and any of the OA or spontaneous recovery times        was demonstrated by linear regression analysis        In relation to the cardiovascular response the AUCHR        was similar in the two groups p   while both        AUCSBP and AUCDBP were significantly lower p          in patients receiving  gkg The HR at  min after any        dose of mivacurium was administered significantly increased        in relation to baseline values p   while a        similar timecourse of the HR was observed with the two        doses of mivacurium Figure  The timecourse of both SBP        Figure  and DBP Figure  reflected the differences        observed in their respective AUCs Transient flushing was        observed in two cases one female patient weighing  kg        aged  mo and receiving mivacurium  gkg and one        male patient weighing  kg aged  mo and receiving        mivacurium  gkg                    Discussion        In this study patients underwent muscle relaxation with        mivacurium Anesthesia was intravenously induced and        maintained with isoflurane administered when relaxation had        reached a maximal response The same clinical model was        previously used to evaluate the effects of rocuronium            and clearly differs from other studies Mainly        intubation followed by gas administration was performed        after a maximum neuromuscular block was present avoiding        any effect of the anesthetic gas on the times to OA        However isoflurane is able to increase twice the        spontaneous recovery of vecuronium in children and        prolongs recovery times for more than  after  min of        its administration      In the present study similar        spontaneous recovery was observed in the two groups and        our results are comparable to  min for T          of Goudsouzians review article            Furthermore our T          values are longer than those obtained        with  gkg of mivacurium under nitrous oxidehalothane        or nitrous oxideopioid anesthesia     These        considerations suggest that isoflurane does affect the        spontaneous recovery similar to or higher than other        anesthetic techniques        The duration of action of some nondepolarizing        neuromuscular blocking agents differs with age even when        administered in equipotent doses     Other studies        have also demonstrated age differences of response to        mivacurium         In the current study we        obtained no significant relationship between age or weight        and any of the OA or spontaneous recovery The range of         to  months of our patients could be broad to study the        effect of age in  patients However a Canadian group of        pediatric anesthesiologists found similar neuromuscular        effects of mivacurium in patients aged between  mo to         yr      supporting our results        Additionally extremely wide ranges of neuromuscular        response in children have been described for other        neuromuscular blocking eg T          ranged from  to  min with        rocuronium  gkg and T          ranged from  min with        rocuronium  gkg      In relation to mivacurium        cholinesterase activity level is a major determinant of the        spontaneous recovery of mivacurium in pediatric population             We did not quantify enzyme levels and therefore        the interindividual variations of spontaneous recovery        times are difficult to be interpreted However coefficient        of variations of T response to mivacurium varied from         to  and T          response ranged from  to  min        representing a less markedly variation than rocuronium        Furthermore an atypical response was not present in any        patient Therefore we considered that our patients were a        population without marked differences in plasmatic        cholinesterase activity        In relation to cardiovascular response administration        of mivacurium  to  gkg in infants and children has        demonstrated minor changes or lack of significant changes        in HR and blood pressure         We observed        an increment in HR at the first minute reaching the top at         min in both groups Agents having varying cardiovascular        effects were administered in addition to and preceding the        mivacurium when assessing the cardiovascular response        Atropine administration and combination of fentanyl and        propofol could certainly have an effect on heart rate and        blood pressure in our patients However a drop in blood        pressures indicated by lower AUCSBP and AUCDBP of        patients receiving mivacurium  gkg was significant        The review article of Goudsouzian states that reported ED          of mivacurium for infants ranges from         gkg     The dose of  gkg will then be to         times the referenced ED           and  will be  to        approximately  times We therefore considered that these        changes could be mainly related to histamine release with        both doses probably more marked with the highest dose        Fortunately in most cases the histamine release and        cardiovascular changes have lacked clinical significance                   The TOFGuard was used to evaluate the neuromuscular        response Some studies have supported its use by finding        that acceleromyography compares closely with other more        sophisticated equipment      whereas clinical trials        using the TOFGuard to measure neuromuscular function have        been increased However it is not yet accepted as a        monitor of definitive studies of neuromuscular blocking        agents in anesthesia probably because it does not register        the neuromuscular function in a continuous fashion and can        generate noise in the measurement of the effect            Previously we utilized it to evaluate the pharmacodynamics        of rocuronium      When used for rocuronium data        acquisition every  min in the recovery period was enough        to model the recovery phase Because of a fast recovery        after mivacurium administration data acquisition in the        recovery phase was now performed every minute and the        effect was also successfully modeled and results agreed        with those previously published in the literature We        therefore considered that if any the noise generated by        TOFGuard measurements did not affect data modeling nor        results and conclusions of the current study Unfortunately        and despite its relative low cost capacity to retain data        sets and its easytouse TOFGuard is worldwide no longer        commercially available It is being replaced by the        manufacturer company with equivalent equipment named the        TOFWatch series written personal communication from        Biometer International AS Odense Denmark  unable        to retain data and therefore require to be connected into a        computer        Finally we simultaneously registered T and TT It        has been proposed that the TT is more sensitive than        evaluation of any single twitch of the TOF response             and does not need an established control By evaluating        the T response significantly faster OA times were        identified with mivacurium  gkg while all the TT        were similar between the two groups This controversy        deserves further investigation                    Conclusions        The maximal effect of mivacurium  gkg was produced        one minute faster than  gkg However it was        associated to a significant cardiovascular response We        therefore conclude that the higher dose does not offer a        satisfactory clinical advantage over the lower dose in        infants under general anesthesia with isoflurane                    Abbreviations        AUCHR AUCSBP and AUCDBP
