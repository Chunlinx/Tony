STATEMENTS OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING CONCEPTS ANDSTANDARDSas of February  SFFAC Nos  SFFAS Nos  Selected MaterialsGAO Document FOREWORDThis volume is the first of a two volume set referred to as theCodification It contains the original text that currentlyconstitutes the body of accounting concepts and standards for theUS Government Specifically the volume incorporates thefollowing documents published through February   Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts   and  Statements of Federal Financial Accounting StandardsOrigins of the StatementsThe concepts and standards presented in the two volume setresulted from the joint efforts of the Department of the TreasuryTreasury the Office of Management and Budget OMB and theGeneral Accounting Office GAO These three central agenciesreferred to collectively as the principals established theFederal Accounting Standards Advisory Board FASAB in  FASABwas created to consider and recommend accounting standards andprinciples The principals ultimately decide upon the principlesand standardsThe Codification includes only those principles and standardsagreed to by the principals FASAB is publishing the Codificationas a comprehensive basis of accounting for Federal reportingentities It is expected that FASAB will continue to recommendstatements on specialized topics As new statements andinterpretations are adopted the Codification will be updatedPurpose of the CodificationThe Codification of Federal accounting concepts and standards isa two volume set with extensive crossreferencing and indexing Thevolumes are designed to meet the needs of users for references tooriginal statements Volume I and to standards alphabetized bytopic Volume II Both volumes serve as authoritative referencesto the standards and interpretationsStatement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards No Supplementary Stewardship Reporting has been approved by theBoards principals but may not be implemented until it hasundergone a day review by Congress The review was not completedat the time this Volume was published SFFAS No  is providedherein for your convenience and future use An announcement will bemade in the Federal Register when the review has been completed andSFFAS No  can be implementedFor a more extensive description of FASABs role refer toStatement of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts No Objectives of Federal Financial Reporting Paras Volume IThis volume Volume Federal Financial Accounting Concepts andStandardsOriginal Statements is a compilation of the documentsproduced by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board andadopted by the principals the Secretary of the Treasury theDirector of OMB and the Comptroller General of the United StatesOnce adopted the documents are referred to as Statements ofFederal Financial Accounting Concepts SFFAC or Concepts andStatements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards SFFAS orStandards respectivelyThis volume presents the Concepts in their entirety Concepts donot establish Federal financial accounting standards rather theydescribe the concepts used by FASAB as a framework as it considersand recommends accounting principles for the Federal governmentConcepts are meant to guide others involved in Federal financialreporting such as preparers and auditorsThis volume extracts the authoritative portions of the Standardsoriginally published in individual statements as well as theexplanatory text contained in any appendices It does not reprintthe summaries or all introductory and background material sincethese sections are not always essential to applying the standardsor understanding the Boards conclusions The Basis for the BoardsConclusions for each standard is included since it serves toexplain the specific provisions of the standardsThe glossaries originally published with each statement havebeen codified in a single glossary This glossary is presented asthe last appendix to the volumeVolume IIVolume II of this set A Users Guide to Federal FinancialAccounting Standards is a codification of the standards Volume IIpresents the standards alphabetized by topic pulls together allreferences to a particular topic in one section and integratesillustrative material from both the SFFASs and the originalExposures Drafts wherever possibleApplicabilityThe mission of FASAB is to recommend accounting concepts andstandards that result in federal agencies financial reportsincluding understandable relevant and reliable information aboutthe financial position activities and results of operations ofthe United States government and its component units In additionthe standards should foster the improvement of accounting systemsand internal controls that will help provide reasonable assuranceto users that government activities have been conductedeconomically efficiently and effectively and in compliance withapplicable laws and regulations Therefore FASAB believes thatfederal financial accounting concepts and standards should beconsidered in establishing systems and in maintaining daytodayfinancial records as well as being applied to general purposefinancial reports of U S Government reporting entities Thisbelief is consistent with the requirements of the Federal FinancialManagement Improvement Act of  which states that each agencyshall implement and maintain financial management systems thatcomply substantially with Federal financial management systemsrequirements applicable Federal accounting standards and theUnited States Government Standard General Ledger at the transactionlevelThe specific applicability of the standards to components of theFederal government was considered during the development ofStatement of Federal Financial Accounting Concepts No  SFFAC No Entity and Display SFFAC No  lists criteria for includingcomponents in Federal reporting entities see pp  andprovides the following guidance with regard to components requiredby law or policy to issue financial statements prepared inaccordance with accounting standards other than those constitutingFederal GAAP For example some components are required to applyaccounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting StandardsBoard or a regulatory agency Those components should continue toapply the standards required by law or policy for their financialstatements The reporting entities of which the components are apart however need to be sensitive to differences that may arisefrom the different accounting standards If these differences arematerial the standards constituting Federal GAAP should be appliedfor purposes of including the components in entitywide statementsIn such cases the components may need to provide additionaldisclosures or different measurements required to comply withFederal GAAPThe standards need not be applied to immaterial itemsHierarchy of Federal Generally Accepted AccountingPrinciplesThe

Addressed  Consolidated GlossaryTABLE OF CONTENTSPageTRANSACTIONS WITH THE PUBLICNonexchange transactions with the public Individual income taxes corporation income taxes socialinsurance taxes and contributions excise taxes estate and gifttaxes and customs dutiesTaxes including customs duties arelevied through the exercise of the power of the Government tocompel payment In broad terms taxes are the price we pay forcivilization More specifically they finance spending of manytypes to promote the general welfare provide for the commondefense and ensure domestic tranquillity national defense ajudicial system aid to the elderly construction ofinfrastructure education and training and so forth Therelationship between the tax paid and the value received is tooindirect and disproportionate to relate the revenue that isreceived from any identifiable taxpayer to the cost that isincurred for providing that identifiable taxpayer with benefitsThis is especially the case where the benefits are of a collectiveor public nature such as national defense in which caseconsumption by one taxpayer does not reduce the consumptionavailable for another or where the benefits are designed toredistribute income from one group of people to another Thereforetax revenue is nonexchange revenue All excise taxes like other taxes are classified asresulting in nonexchange revenue Some excise taxes considered tobe benefit taxes are levied on bases that are related to the useof publicly provided goods and services or the public provision ofother benefits such as the gasoline tax certain other excisetaxes are levied on bases related to a cause of some damage and arededicated to pay down costs such as the tax on domestically minedcoal which is dedicated to the black lung disability trust fundEven in these cases however the relationship between the tax andthe benefit received by an identifiable recipient is relativelyindirect and disproportionate Moreover these excise taxes likeother taxes are determined through the exercise of the power ofthe Government to compel payment Therefore like other taxes theyare classified as producing nonexchange revenue Board members have differing views on whether socialinsurance programs result in exchange or nonexchangetransactions However they agree that social insurance taxrevenue should be reported in the same way as other tax revenue forthe purposes of financial reporting This is because socialinsurance taxes like other taxes are determined through theexercise of the power of the Government to compel paymentFurthermore individuals and businesses subject to social insurancetaxes are subject to them as a byproduct of their decision to entercovered employment or engage in a covered business so especiallyfor the major broadbased social insurance programsSocialSecurity Medicare hospital insurance and unemploymentSocial insurance does not include programs establishedsolely or primarily for Federal employees such as pension andother retirement plans Social insurance taxes and contributionsdo however include payments made by or on behalf of Federalemployees to social insurance plans such as Social Security andMedicareSee discussion of social insurance programs in FASAB ExposureDraft Supplementary Stewardship Reporting August compensationthey have virtually no legal option except topay Tax receipts are generally collected from the public by theIRS Internal Revenue Service and to a lesser extent by theCustoms Service and other entities acting as agents for therecipient entities rather than on their own behalf The collectingentity receives the cash and then transfers it to the General Fundtrust fund or special fund on whose behalf it was collected Theamount so collected should be accounted for as a custodial activityby the collecting entity The tax is recognized as a nonexchangerevenue by the entity that is legally entitled to the amount Thiswould be a trust fund or special fund in the case of an earmarkedie dedicated tax If collected on behalf of the Government asa whole it would be recognized in the Governmentwide consolidatedfinancial statements Social insurance taxes and contributions paid by FederalemployeesFederal employees may be covered by social insuranceprograms such as Social Security and Medicare under the sameterms and conditions as the remainder of the covered populationThe payments made by Federal employees are in the nature of taxescompulsory payments demanded by the Government through the exerciseof its power to compel payment Insofar as the social insuranceprogram applies to employees of the United States government theterms and conditions are generally the same as the program forprivate employees The employer and employee contributions aregenerally calculated in the same way the employee contribution isnot earned by the social insurance program and the benefits aregenerally calculated in the same way The employee does not obtainparticular benefits under the plan from rendering service inFederal employment because he or she would have been similarlycovered by the program if privately employed and would haveobtained similar benefits For these reasons the employeecontribution should have the same classification as contributionsby nonFederal employees which is nonexchange revenue Deposits by states for unemployment trust fundStatesdeposit the receipts from the state unemployment tax to the USTreasury for the unemployment trust fund in order to finance mostof the benefits under the unemployment compensation system Thestate unemployment tax differs from state to state in terms of thetax rate tax base and certain other characteristics andunemployment benefits also differ from state to stateNevertheless the deposit has long been construed as a Federalbudget receipt a governmental receipt and the unemployment trustfund has long been included as an account in the Federalbudget This is for a combination of reasons taken together athe unemployment compensation systemincluding the system oftaxes the system of benefits and the trust fundwas establishedby the Social Security Act of  and has been amended by Federallaw many times b deposits are held in a trust fund operated bythe US Government c Federal law specifies extensiverequirements for the state unemployment tax and unemploymentbenefits d the Federal unemployment tax finances grants tostates to cover their entire cost of administering theunemploymentSocial insurance does not include programs established solelyor primarily for Federal employees such as pension and otherretirement plansMost Federal civilian employees hired before  are notcovered by Social Securitysystem and e Federal law effectively coerces states toparticipate in the system with participation requiring them tolevy the state unemployment tax and deposit the collections in theUS Treasury If a state does not participate or is not certifiedby the Department of Labor as meeting Federal requirements ithe Federal unemployment tax is levied within the state at itsmaximum rate ii the system does not pay any unemploymentcompensation benefits within the state and iii the FederalGovernment provides no grants to state governments to pay for thecosts of administration The deposits of the state tax aretherefore nonexchange revenue of the unemployment trust fund TheFederal unemployment tax is levied and collected separately fromthe state unemployment tax User fees Harbor Maintenance trust fund This is anexample of a tax that is termed a user fee by law whileclassified in the budget as a governmental receipt together withother taxes and duties It is an ad valorem tax of  percentimposed on commercial cargo loaded and unloaded at specified USports open to public navigation The receipt is earmarked to theHarbor Maintenance trust fund It is similar in nature to otherexcise taxes that result from the Governments power to compelpayment and that are dedicated to a trust fund or special fund tobe spent for a designated purpose for example the gasoline excisetax which is dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund It thereforeshould be recognized as nonexchange revenue by the HarborMaintenance trust fund Customs Service feesThe Customs Service collects revenueprimarily from duties on imported merchandise but also from twotypes of fees the merchandise processing fee and a group of feescalled user fees The merchandise processing fee is primarily an ad valoremcharge on formal merchandise entries into the United States at percent subject to a maximum and minimum charge It alsoincludes flat fees on informally entered goods The collections areearmarked by law to a special fund from which receipts are madeavailable to finance Customs Service operations to the extentprovided by current appropriations The merchandise processing fee is associated with the costof the Customs Services operations The fee as originally enactedwas modified by the Customs and Trade Act of  to make itconsistent with US obligations under GATT the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade after a GATT panel had ruled that theoriginal fee a straight ad valorem fee exceeded the cost ofservices rendered and was a tax on imports that discriminatedagainst imports in favor of domestic production The maximum andminimum fees and the flat fees were enacted to meet the USobligation However the associated cost is primarily some of the costsof assessing and collecting duties on imported merchandise such asthe salaries of import specialists who classify merchandise andthe costs of processing paperwork The importer pays duties thatare required by law it does not receive anything of value from theGovernment in the nature of an exchange Furthermore these costsare not likely to depend significantly on the value of themerchandise and the fee is levied through the power of theGovernment to compel payment Therefore for the purpose of aclassification system for financial reporting the fee is akin todedicated taxes that are also related in the aggregate toassociated costs and that are classified as nonexchange revenueeg the excise tax on gasoline The merchandise processing feeis therefore classified as a nonexchange revenue The user fees consist of a group of flat fees charged onpassengers and conveyances entering the country The collectionsare dedicated by law to a special fund whose receipts are madeavailable by permanent indefinite appropriation to finance CustomsService operations These fees are intended to offset certain inspection coststhat relate to the processing of passengers and conveyancesentering the country They are levied through the power of theGovernment to compel payment and the person or entity that paysthese fees does not receive anything of value from the Governmentin exchange The inspection activities are for a variety ofpurposes to ensure that dutiable merchandise is declared to seizecontraband such as narcotics and illegal drugs to detectinfringements of patent and copyright laws and so forth Some ofthese purposes are related to the Governments powers to raisetaxes which are nonexchange revenue and to enforce laws Only toa limited extent are they like regulatory user fees based on theGovernments power to regulate particular businesses or activitiesTherefore like the merchandise processing fee the user fees areclassified as nonexchange revenue Deposits of earnings Federal Reserve SystemThe FederalReserve System consists of the Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System and twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks UnderFederal accounting concepts it is not considered to be part of theGovernmentwide reporting entity Therefore payments made to orcollections received from the Federal Reserve System would bereported in the financial statements of the Federal Government andits component reporting entities The Federal Reserve earns largeamounts of interest on its portfolio of Treasury securities anddeposits to the Treasury all net income after deducting dividendsand the amount necessary to bring the surplus of the FederalReserve Banks to the level of capital paidin The Federal Reserve was established by Act of Congresspursuant to the Governments sovereign power over the nationsmoney and its investment in Treasury securities is necessary forcarrying out its monetary function It does not receive anything ofvalue from the Government in exchange for its deposit of earningsand on occasion it has been required by law to make extra paymentsThe revenue from the deposits is therefore nonexchange Donations except types of property plant and equipmentthat are expensedDonations are contributions to the Governmentie voluntary gifts of resources to a Government entity by anonFederal entity The Government does not give anything ofvalue to the donor and the donor receives only personalsatisfaction The donationThese fees are sometimes called the COBRA user fees Thisterm comes from the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof  which established these feesSFFAC No  Entity and Display para The term donations includes wills disposing of property andjudicial proceedings other than forfeituresof cash other financial resources or nonfinancial resourcesexcept stewardship property plant and equipment is therefore anonexchange revenue The exception stewardship PPE consists of Federalmission PPE heritage assets and stewardship land SuchPPE is expensed if purchased but no amount is recognized ifit is received as a donation Correspondingly no revenue isrecognized for such donations Fines and penaltiesFines and penalties are monetaryrequirements imposed on those who violate laws or administrativerules The person or other entity that pays a fine or penalty doesnot receive anything of value in exchange nor does the Governmentsacrifice anything of value The Government collects these amountsthrough the exercise of its power to compel payment Fines andpenalties are therefore a nonexchange revenue Fines from judicial proceedings are collected by the entityacting as an agent for the Government as a whole rather than on itsown behalf They are therefore accounted for as a custodialactivity of the collecting entity and recognized as a nonexchangerevenue in the Governmentwide consolidated financialstatements Fines and penalties produced by an entitysoperationssuch as inspections to ensure compliance with Federallaw and with regulations that are the responsibility of the entityeg inspections by the Office of Surface Mining or compliancewith regulations for the conduct of a Federal programarerecognized as nonexchange revenue by whichever entity is legallyentitled by law to the revenue In some cases but not all thiswould be the collecting entity If the collecting entity transfersthe nonexchange revenue to the General Fund or another entity theamount is accounted for as a custodial activity by the collectingentity If transferred to the General Fund the penalties arerecognized as nonexchange revenue in the Governmentwideconsolidated financial statements if transferred to anotherentity they are recognized as nonexchange revenue by the entitythat receives the transfer Penalties due to delinquent taxes in connection withcustodial activityThe person or other private entity that pays apenalty on delinquent taxes does not receive anything in exchangenor does the Government sacrifice anything of value The Governmentcollects these amounts through its power to compel paymentPenalties on delinquent taxes are therefore a nonexchange revenueThe penalties are accounted for as a custodial activity Iftransferred to the General Fund the penalties are recognized asnonexchange revenue in the Governmentwide consolidated financialstatements if transferred to another entity they are recognizedas nonexchange revenue by the entity that receives thetransfer ForfeituresProperty may be seized as a consequence ofvarious laws and regulations and forfeited to the GovernmentForfeited property may be acquired through forfeiture proceedingsbe acquired to satisfy a tax liability or consist of unclaimed andabandoned merchandise Forfeited property is principally managed bythe Asset Forfeiture Fund of the Justice Department and theTreasury Forfeiture Fund of the Treasury Department Revenue isrecognized from forfeited property unless the property isdistributed to state or local law enforcement agencies orforeignSFFAS No Accounting for Property Plant and Equipmentpara  and governments or is received in satisfaction of a previouslyrecognized revenue eg accrued tax receivables The timing of revenue recognition depends on how theproperty is forfeited and the nature of the property In the caseof unclaimed and abandoned merchandise revenue is recognized inthe amount of the sales proceeds at the time the property is soldIn the case of property acquired through forfeiture proceedingsthe timing of recognition depends on the nature and disposition ofthe property For monetary instruments the revenue is recognizedat the time of obtaining forfeiture judgment for property that issold at the time of sale and for property that is held forinternal use or transferred to another Federal agency at the timeof obtaining approval to use the property internally or transferit The method of measuring revenue depends on the nature ofthe property The amount of revenue recognized for monetaryinstruments is the market value when the forfeiture judgment isobtained For property that is sold it is the sales proceeds Forproperty that is held for internal use or transferred to anotherFederal agency it is the fair value of the property less avaluation allowance for any liens or third party claims The revenue from forfeiture is nonexchange revenue becausethe Government seizes the property through the exercise of itspower The Government does not sacrifice anything of value inexchange and the entity that forfeits the property does not receiveanything of value More than half of the forfeiture revenue of thetwo funds mentioned above is from currency and other monetaryinstruments Although other types of forfeited property must besold in order to recognize revenue or constructively sold iftransferred to another Federal agency or placed into internal usethis is the last step in a process that is inherentlynonexchange The disposition of the revenue from forfeiture isdetermined by law Revenue or the property itself may ultimately bedistributed to the seizing entity state or local law enforcementagencies foreign governments or the general fund Revenue isrecognized as nonexchange revenue by the entity that is legallyentitled to use the revenue or to use the property itself If theproperty is distributed to a state or local law enforcement agencyor a foreign government revenue is not recognized by a FederalGovernment reporting entity If the revenue is transferred to theGeneral Fund it is recognized as nonexchange revenue in theGovernmentwide consolidated financial statements Some entities may be involved in the management andliquidation of forfeited property but not themselves be entitled tothe revenue or to the use of the property For example a centralfund created to support the seizure activities of multipleentitiesThis amends SFFAS No  Accounting for Inventory and RelatedProperty with respect to forfeitures related to satisfying taxliabilitiesSFFAS No  para  The standard also requires deferredrevenue to be recognized when a forfeiture judgment is obtainedbut the deferred revenue is reversed when revenue is recognizedThe amount of revenue ordinarily differs from the amount ofdeferred revenue In some cases an adjustment subsequent to theoriginal forfeiture judgment may be necessary when it is laterdetermined that a portion of the forfeiture is to be distributed tostate or local law enforcement agencies or foreign governmentsmay manage forfeited property and the collection and dispositionof the revenue from that property These entities should accountfor the property as a custodial activity Revenue is shown when itis recognized and it is shown as transferred to others when thecash is disbursed or the property is delivered The disposition ofproperty to an entity outside the Federal Government is alsoaccounted forExchange transactions with the public revenue Sales of goods and servicesThe cost of production forgoods and services such as electricity mail delivery and maps isdefrayed in whole or in part by revenue from selling the goods orservices provided The sales may be made by a public enterpriserevolving fund such as the Bonneville Power Administration anintragovernmental revolving fund such as the Government PrintingOffice or a fund that is not a revolving fund such as theGeological Survey Each party receives and sacrifices something ofvalue The sale is therefore an exchange transaction and therevenue is exchange revenue for the entity making the sale Sales of goods and services in undercover operationsThecost of the Governments undercover operations is defrayed in wholeor in part from the proceeds of sales of goods that have beenpurchased as opposed to goods that have been forfeited Eachparty receives and sacrifices something of value Thesecharacteristics of the transaction are not affected by whether thesale is illegal The sale is therefore an exchange transactionsand the revenue is exchange revenue of the entity making thesale Interest unless classified elsewhere dividends andrents except for mineral rights on Government propertyEachparty receives and sacrifices something of value so the inflow ofresources is an exchange transaction Interest is classified as exchange revenue notwithstandingthe fact that the entity may not be charged a cost of capital forthe assets that yield these inflows or if the entity borrowedfrom Treasury to acquire the assets it may have been charged abelowmarket interest rate The gross cost of the entity isunderstated in such cases and to recognize an exchange revenue isto recognize a revenue without some or all of the related costsand hence to understate the entitys net cost of operationsNevertheless in some cases the entity does pay the Treasury atleast some interest and the Governments cost of borrowing toacquire the assets is recognized as a cost of the Government as awhole Since some cost is recognized even if not always the fullcost of the entity an exchange revenue is recognized for theentity that receives the inflow of interest Rents royalties and bonuses on Outer Continental ShelfOCS and other petroleum and mineral rightsRents royaltiesand bonuses are exchange revenues because each party receives andsacrifices something of value The amounts are earned by sales inthe market and therefore are exchange revenue They are collectedby the Minerals Management Service MMS of the Department of theInterior whichThe partial recognition of associated cost distinguishesinterest from rents royalties and bonuses on the OuterContinental Shelf and the auction of the radio spectrum For thelatter transactions see the subsequent paragraphsmanages the energy and minerals resources on the OCS andcollects the amounts due the Government and Indian tribes fromminerals produced on the OCS and other Federal and Indianlands MMS does not recognize a depletion cost for variousreasons including the fact that under present accounting standardsnatural resources are not recognized as an asset and depletion isnot recognized as a cost As a result this exchange revenue bearslittle relationship to the recognized cost of MMS and cannot bematched against its gross cost of operations Therefore althoughthe inflows are exchange revenue they should not be subtractedfrom MMSs gross cost in determining its net cost ofoperations MMS should instead account for the exchange revenue as acustodial activity MMS collects rents royalties and bonusesacting as an agent on behalf of the recipients designated by lawthe General Fund certain entities within the Government to whichamounts are earmarked the states and Indian tribes and allotteesThe amounts of revenue should be recognized and measured under theexchange revenue standards when they are due pursuant to thecontractual agreement The rents royalties and bonuses transferred to Treasuryfor the General Fund or to other Government reporting entitiesshould be recognized by them as exchange revenue However neitherthe Government as a whole nor the other recipient entitiesrecognize the natural resources as an asset and depletion as acost Therefore this exchange revenue should not offset theirgross cost in determining their net cost of operations It shouldinstead be a financing source in determining their operatingresults and change in net position Proceeds from the auction of the radio spectrumTheproceeds from auctioning the right to use the radio spectrum areexchange revenues because each party receives and sacrificessomething of value The amount of revenue is earned by sales in themarket at auctions It bears little relationship to the costsrecognized by the Federal Communications Commission FCC whichcollects the revenue or to the costs recognized by the USGovernment as a whole Therefore it should not be offset againstthe costs of the FCC in determining its net cost of operations oragainst the costs of the Government as a whole in Governmentwideconsolidated financial statements The FCC should therefore account for this exchange revenueas a custodial activity acting as an agent on behalf of theGeneral Fund and it should be included as exchange revenue in theGovernmentwide consolidated financial statements Interest on post direct loansInterest on directloans is an exchange transaction because it is part of a broaderexchange transaction in which the entity makes a loan to theborrower and the entity and borrower each receives and sacrificessomething of value Interest on direct loans that are budgetedaccording to the provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of consists of two components the nominal interest the statedinterest rate times the nominal principal and the amortizedinterest change in present value of the loans receivable due tothe passage of time The combined effect of these componentsequals the effective interest which is directly defined as thepresent value of the loans receivable times the Treasury interestrate applicable to the particular loans ie the interest rateused to calculate the present value of the direct loans when thedirect loans were disbursed The effective interest causes anequal increase in the aggregate value of the assets on the balancesheet and therefore the effective interest is the amountrecognized as exchangerevenue Interest on delinquent taxes and other receivables thatarise as the result of custodial operationsReceivables thatarise as the result of custodial operations are custodial ornonentity assets held by the IRS or another entity as an agentfor the Government as a whole rather than on its own behalf egIRS tax receivables on which the delinquent taxpayer must payinterest The interest is an exchange revenue because each partyreceives and sacrifices something of value but it is not relatedto the costs incurred by the collecting entity The interest isaccounted for as a custodial activity by the collecting entity Iftransferred to the General Fund the interest is recognized asexchange revenue in the Governmentwide consolidated financialstatements because it is related to the governments cost ofborrowing if transferred to another entity it is recognized asnonexchange revenue by the entity that receives the transfer Regulatory user fees such as patent and copyright feesimmigration and consular fees SEC registration and filing feesand Nuclear Regulatory Commission feesRegulatory user fees arecharges based on the Governments power to regulate particularbusinesses or activities The revenue is related to the cost in oneof two ways Special benefits may be provided to identifiablerecipients who pay the fees beyond the benefits if any thataccrue to the general public eg passport fees or theGovernment may incur costs in order to regulate an identifiableentity for the benefit of the general public or some other groupin which case the user charge compensates the Government for itsregulatory costs that were caused by the activity of the party thatpays the charge eg SEC and Nuclear Regulatory CommissionfeesPost direct loans consist of direct loans that wereobligated after September   whereas pre direct loansconsist of direct loans that were obligated before October  The same accounting that is used for post direct loans is alsoused for pre direct loans that were modified and transferredto financing accounts loans receivable arising from defaultedpost guaranteed loans and loans receivable arising fromdefaulted pre guaranteed loans that were modified andtransferred to financing accountsFor interest on pre direct loans see the preceding sectionon interest unless classified elsewhere   See SFFAS No  Accounting for Direct Loans and LoanGuarantees paragraphs  and  for an illustrative casestudy also see Appendix BBecause in general the revenue is closely related to the cost ofoperations these fees are classified as exchange transactions andthe revenue is an exchange revenue of the entity that charges thefee Diversion fees Department of JusticeRegistrants in theDiversion Control Program eg physicians pay fees to the DrugEnforcement Administration in exchange for which the DEA providesthe registrants with the authority to prescribe controlledsubstances The diversion fees are intended to cover the costs ofthe Diversion Control Program Because the revenue is related tothe cost and the registrants both receive and sacrifice value thepayment of these fees is an exchange revenue of the DiversionControl Program Premiums for SMI Supplementary Medical Insurance bankdeposit insurance pension benefit guarantees crop insurance lifeinsurance and other insuranceIn exchange for a premium andother considerations the Government promises to make payments toprogram participants if specified events occur The premium offsetsthe cost of the program in whole or in part The degree to whichparticipation is voluntary differs from program to program Becausethe revenue is related to the cost of the providing service it isan exchange revenue of the insurance program Federal employee contributions to pension and otherretirement benefit plansEmployees of the Federal Governmentprovide service to their employer in exchange for compensation ofwhich some is received currently the salary and some is deferredpensions retirement health benefits and other retirementbenefits This is an exchange transaction because each partysacrifices value and receives value in return As part of thisexchange transaction the Government promises a pension to itsemployees after they retire The Government also promises otherretirement benefits notably health benefits In return theemployee provides services and under some plans makes acontribution to the retirement fund out of his or her salary Thefinancing of these benefits may include contributions paid by theemployee to the retirement fund In broad terms the employee contribution is an inflow ofresources to the retirement fund as part of this exchangetransaction More narrowly it is a payment by the employee as partof an exchange of money and services for a future pension or otherretirement benefit Therefore it is an exchange revenue of theentity that administers the retirement plan and thus is an offsetto that entitys gross cost in calculating its net cost ofoperationsFederal employee retirement plans do not include socialinsurance such as Social Security and MedicareFor further discussion of the accounting standards forpensions and other retirement benefits of Federal employees seeSFFAS No  Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Governmentpara  and  The standards do not cover accounting forthe plan per se as distinct from the administering entity Nor dothey cover defined contribution plans or administrative entitiesthat are not Federal reporting entities Federal employee contributions to health benefits plan forcurrent coverageEmployees of the Federal Government provideservices to their employer in exchange for compensation of whichsome is received currently in the form of money the salary someis received currently in the form of payments to a third party theemployer entity contribution to the medical insurance plan forcurrent coverage of its employees and some is deferred pensionsand other retirement benefits This is an exchange transactionbecause each party sacrifices value and receives value in returnAs part of this exchange transaction the Government and itsemployees both contribute to a medical insurance plan that providescurrent coverage of the employees In broad terms the employee contribution out of his or hersalary is an inflow of resources to the health benefits plan aspart of this exchange transaction More narrowly it is a paymentin exchange for current coverage by a health benefits planTherefore it is an exchange revenue of the entity that administersthe health benefits plan and thus is an offset to that entitysgross cost in calculating its net cost of operations Reimbursement for collecting revenueThe Customs Servicecollects duties on goods imported by Puerto Rico and the VirginIslands The Customs Service retains an amount equal to theestimated cost of collecting these duties including all costs ofoperations in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and an allocationof overhead it transfers the remainder to the Treasury which inturn transfers the collections to Puerto Rico or the VirginIslands The total amount of duties collected on these goods shouldbe accounted for as a custodial activity by the Customs ServiceNotwithstanding that duties are a nonexchange revenue theseparticular duties are a nonexchange revenue of an entity other thanthe United States and therefore are not recognized as a nonexchangerevenue of the US Government The method of disposing of these collections combines twodistinct transactions into one The entire amount of the dutiescould be transferred to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands andthese governments could then pay the Customs Service to reimburseit for its services of collecting duties The payment to Customswould be exchange revenue of the Customs Service The actualprocedure for reimbursement whereby Customs retains an amountequal to the estimated cost is simpler but equivalent insubstance Hence the custodial transfer to Treasury for PuertoRico and the Virgin Islands and the amount retained by Customsshould be shown as separate components of the disposition of therevenue from customs duties The amount retained by Customs toreimburse itself for its costs is exchange revenue of the CustomsService and is offset against its gross cost in calculating its netcost of operations Reimbursement for cleanup costsThe Coast Guard or otherFederal entities may incur costs to clean up environmental hazardscaused by private parties and in some cases require these privateparties to reimburse it for the costs incurred Notwithstandingthat the Government demands the revenue under its power to compelpayment the revenue arises from the action of the private partiesand is closely related to the cost of operations incurred as aresult of that action Therefore the revenue is an exchangerevenue of the entity that incurs the costExchange transactions with the public gains and losses Note As explained in the introduction to this appendixtransactions that are classified as producing gains or lossesshould instead be classified as producing revenue or expense ifthey are usual and recurring for a particular reporting entity Sales of Government assets other than property plant andequipment and forfeited and foreclosed propertyThe sale ofGovernment assets other than property plant and equipment andforfeited and foreclosed property is an exchange transactionbecause each party receives and sacrifices something of value Ifthe sales price equals book value there is no gain or lossbecause a cash inflow equal to book value is the exchange of oneasset for another of equal recorded value and therefore not a netinflow of resources If the sales price is more or less than thebook value of the property a gain or loss respectively isrecognized to the extent of the difference The amount of thedifference between sales price and book value is ordinarily a gainor loss rather than a revenue or expense because sales of propertyare ordinarily an unusual or nonrecurring inflow of resources Sales of property plant and equipment The transactionis an exchange transaction because each party receives andsacrifices something of value If the sales price equals bookvalue there is no gain or loss because a cash inflow equal tobook value is the exchange of one asset for another of equalrecorded value and therefore not a net inflow of resources If thesales price is more or less than book value a gain or lossrespectively is recognized to the extent of the difference Theamount of the difference is ordinarily a gain or loss rather than arevenue or an expense because sales of property plant andequipment are ordinarily an unusual or nonrecurring inflow ofresources The entire

stewardship PPE forwhich the entire cost is expensed when the asset ispurchased Acquisition of property plant and equipment throughexchangeThe cost of property plant and equipment PPEacquired through an exchange of assets with the public is the fairvalue of the PPE surrendered at the time of exchange If thefair value of the PPE acquired is more readily determinablethan that of the PPE surrendered the cost is the fair valueof the PPE acquired If neither fair value is determinablethe cost of the PPE acquired is the cost recorded for thePPE surrendered net of any accumulated depreciation oramortization In the event that cash consideration is included inthe exchange the cost of PPE acquired is increased orThe sales price may include the fair value of items received inexchangeSFFAS No  Accounting for Property Plant and Equipmenthas divided property plant and equipment PPE into twobasic categories general PPE and stewardship PPE whichconsists of federal mission PPE heritage assets

by the amount of the cash surrendered orreceived Any difference between the cost of the PPE acquiredand the book value of the PPE surrendered is recognized as again or loss It is a gain or loss rather than a revenue orexpense because ordinarily the amount would be an unusual ornonrecurring inflow of resources If the fair value of the PPE acquired is less than thefair value of the PPE surrendered the PPE acquired isrecognized at its cost and subsequently reduced to its fair valueThe difference between the cost of the PPE acquired and itsfair value is recognized as a loss Sales of foreclosed property associated with predirect loans and loan guaranteesForeclosed property associatedwith pre direct loans and loan guarantees is recognized as anasset at net realizable value The sale is an exchange transactionand any difference between the sales proceeds and book value isrecognized as a gain or loss Sales of receivables except direct loansThe transactionis an exchange transaction because each party receives andsacrifices something of value Upon sale any difference betweenthe sales proceeds and book value is recognized as a gain or lossIf the sales price equals book value there is no gain or lossbecause the exchange of one asset for another of equal value is nota net inflow of resources Sales of direct loansThe sale of a direct loan is amodification according to the Federal Credit Reform Act of regardless of whether the loan being sold was obligated after FY or before FY  The book value loss or gain on a sale ofdirect loans equals the book value of the loans sold prior tosale minus the net proceeds of the sale It normally differs fromthe cost of modification which is recognized as an expense Anydifference between the book value loss or gain and the cost ofmodification is recognized as a gain or loss Retirement of debt securities prior to maturityDebtsecurities may be retired prior to maturity if they have a callfeature or if they are eligible for

the cost of themetal manufacturing and transportation It results from thesovereign power of the Government to directly create money andalthough not an inflow of resources from the public does increasethe Governments net position in the same manner as an inflow ofresources Because it is not demanded earned or donated it is another financing source rather than revenue It should be recognizedas an other financing source when coins are delivered to theFederal Reserve Banks in return for depositsINTRAGOVERNMENTAL TRANSACTIONSNonexchange transactionsintragovernmental revenue Interest on Treasury securities held by trust funds andspecial funds except trust revolving fundsMany trust funds andspecial funds hold Treasury securities on which they receiveinterest In most cases the invested balances of these funds derivepredominantly from the funds earmarked taxes which arenonexchange transactions with the public eg employment taxesand gasoline taxes and to a lesser extent from other financingsources received from other government entities eg the GeneralFund payment appropriated to the Supplementary Medical Insurancefund The balances are not earned in exchange transactions by theentitys operations Most fundamentally they are not produced byoperations in which the entity incurs a cost Therefore in such cases the interest on Treasurysecurities should not be deducted from the gross costs of the trustfund or special fund or the organization in which it isadministered in determining its net cost of operations As aresult that interest should not be classified as exchange revenueIt should instead have the same classification as the predominantsource of the invested balances which for most trust funds andspecial funds is nonexchange revenue The interest received frominvested balances of trust funds and special funds except trustrevolving funds is therefore normally a nonexchange revenue The source of balances for some trust funds and specialfunds may not be predominantly nonexchange revenue For examplethe main source of balances for two major trust funds the CivilService Retirement and Disability fund and the MilitarySFFAS No

thatoccurs the lending fund sacrifices interest from Treasurysecurities on its invested balances and instead receives interestfrom the borrowing fund on the amount of the loan Since thepredominant source of balances to the lending fund is the sameregardless of whether it invests in Treasury securities or lends toanother fund the interest received from the other fund should beclassified in the

that is canceled including the amount ofcapitalized interest that is canceled if any is a gain to theentity whose debt is canceled and a loss to Treasury or otheragency The purpose of borrowing authority is generally to providean entity with capital rather than to finance its operationsTherefore the cancellation of debt is not earned by the entitysoperations and is not directly related to the entitys costs ofproviding goods and services As a result the cancellation is anonexchange gain to the entity that owed the debt and a nonexchangeloss to the lenderExchange

sale of goods and services are both integral tothe funds operations the interest on the funds securities isrelated to the funds cost of operations just as is the revenueearned from selling goods and services Furthermore the source ofthe invested balances is predominantly revenue earned from theirsales of goods and services for which the funds incurred costs ofoperations when that revenue was earned The interest they receiveshould therefore be classified in the same way as their revenueearned from selling goods and services and should likewise bededucted from gross cost in determining the net cost of operationsFor this reason interest earned by revolving funds should normallybe classified as exchange revenue The source of balances for some revolving funds may not bepredominantly exchange revenue For such exceptions as explainedin the Basis for Conclusions the interest should be classified inthe same way as the predominant source of balances rather thanaccording to the normal rule Interest on Treasury securities held by trust revolvingfundsA trust revolving fund is a revolving fund that is alsoclassified by law as a trust fund Like other revolving funds itearns exchange revenue which is an offset to its gross cost Forexample the revenue that the Employees Health Benefit fund earnsfrom contributions by Federal employees annuitants employerentities and the Office of Personnel Management OPM is an offsetto the insurance premiums that it pays to private firms Trustrevolving funds need capital in their operations just like otherrevolving funds the source of which is predominantly the revenuethey have earned When some of their capital is invested inTreasury securities the interest is related to their cost ofoperations in the same way as the revenue earned from sellingservices Furthermore the source of the invested balances ispredominantly revenue earned from the sales of services for whichthey incurred costs of operations when the revenue was earned Theinterest they receive should therefore be classified in the sameway as the interest received by other revolving funds which isexchange revenue The source of balances for some trust revolving funds maynot be predominantly exchange revenue For such exceptions asexplained in the Basis for Conclusions the interest should beclassified in the same way as the predominant source of balancesrather than according to the normal rule Interest on uninvested funds received by direct loan andguaranteed loan financing accountsA guaranteed loan financingaccount holds uninvested balances as reserves against its loanguarantee liabilities and earns interest on these balances thatadds to its resources to pay these liabilities A direct loanfinancing account may hold uninvested balances to bridgetransactions that are integral to its operations such as when itborrows from Treasury to disburse direct loans prior to the time ofdisbursement it earns interest on these balances to reflect thetime value of money and thereby finance the interest it pays on itsdebt to Treasury Thus in both cases the interest received by thefinancing account is earned through exchange transactions withTreasury and is an offset to the financing accounts related costsof operations The interest is therefore an exchange revenue of thefinancing account Interest received by TreasuryAccounts or fundsincluding direct loan and guaranteed loan financing accounts maybe authorized to borrow from the Treasury or from the FederalFinancing Bank an entity within Treasury or other sources Theinterest that the entity pays on its borrowings is a cost to theentity and an inflow of resources to the Treasury The Treasury maybe deemed to have borrowed from the public to finance the outlaysfor which the entity borrowed and thus to have incurred acorresponding interest cost of its own The interest received byTreasury from the entity is therefore related to Treasurys cost ofborrowing from the public and should be classified as an exchangerevenueExchange transactionsintragovernmental gains and losses Note As explained in the introduction to this appendixtransactions that are classified as producing gains or lossesshould instead

thus are a means of financing the entitys cost They are nototherwise related to the entitys cost and therefore are not anoffset to its gross cost in determining its net cost of operationsThey are not earned by the entitys activities demanded by theentity or donated to the entity Therefore appropriations providean other financing source instead of a revenue More precisely appropriations used is recognized as another financing source in determining the entitys operatingresults when the entity receives goods and services or providesbenefits grants or other transfer payments To avoid doublecounting appropriations used are not recognized for theappropriation of earmarked revenues or other financing sourceswhich are already counted in determining the entitys operatingresults Appropriations that have been made available forapportionment but have not been used are recognized as unexpendedappropriations in the entitys capital Cost subsidies difference between internal sales pricereimbursement and full costOne entity may receive goods orservices from another entity without paying the full cost of thegoods or services or without paying any cost at all Other Federalaccounting standards may require the receiving entity to recognizethe full cost as an expense or if appropriate as an asset Inthese cases the difference between full cost and the internal salesprice or reimbursement sometimes called a transfer price is animputed cost to the receiving entity The financing of the imputed cost is also imputed to thereceiving entity Imputed financing is necessary so that theimputed cost does not reduce the entitys operating results and netposition The imputed financing equals the imputed cost and isrecognized as an other financing source It is not a

not make any contributions toward the servicecost For retirement health care benefits neither the employeesnor the employer entity make any contributions while the employeeis working Therefore the entire service cost is recognized as acost to the employer entity and imputed to it The financing of the imputed cost is also imputed to theemployer entity The imputed financing is necessary so that theimputed cost does not reduce the employer entitys operatingresults and net position The imputed financing equals the imputedcost and is recognized as an other financing source It is not arevenue because the employer entity does not earn the amountimputed or demand its paymentSee SFFAS No  Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts andStandards for the Federal Government para Retired employees do pay

Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Governmentpara  and  The standards do not cover accounting forthe plan per se as distinct from the administering entity Nor dothey cover defined contribution

services it receives from another entity In the presentcase the employer entity acquires the services of the employeesitself but another entity pays part of their cost Contribution by the General Fund to the SMI trustfundThe General Fund makes a contribution to the SMISupplementary Medical Insurance trust fund This appropriatedpayment is separate from the transfer of earmarked premiums and isnot a transfer of earmarked taxes or other income It does notarise from an exchange transaction because SMI does not sacrificeany value to the General Fund in exchange for the payment and theGeneral Fund does not receive anything of value from SMI Insteadthe payment constitutes a General Fund subsidy of the SMI trustfund Since the payment is not demanded or earned it is an otherfinancing source to SMI rather than a revenue Examples of other payments of a similar nature and alsoclassified as other financing sources are the payment by theGeneral Fund to the social security trust funds for militaryservice credits and for certain uninsured persons at least  yearsold and the payment by the General Fund to the Railroad RetirementBoard for the vested dual benefit payments received by certainretirees under both the railroad retirement and the social securitysystems The quinquennial military service credit adjustment paidbetween the General Fund and the social security trust funds islikewise an other financing source to the social security trustfunds but one that may be either positive or negative Transfer by CCC to Federal Crop Insurance CorporationTheCommodity Credit Corporation CCC makes transfers to the FederalCrop Insurance Corporation FCIC which it finances by anappropriation This payment does not arise from an exchangetransaction because FCIC does not sacrifice anything of value toCCC and CCC does not receive anything of value from FCIC Itdiffers from the contribution to SMI primarily in that it is paidby another program entity the CCC rather than directly by theGeneral Fund Since the payment is not demanded or earned it is another financing source to FCIC rather than a revenue Interchange between the Railroad Retirement Board and theSocial Security and Hospital Insurance trust fundsThe RailroadRetirement Board pays benefits equivalent to the amounts that wouldhave been paid if railroad workers had been covered under SocialSecurity since its inception plus additional amounts unique tothat program The railroad retirement program is partly financed byan annual financial interchange that takes place between theRailroad Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account a trust fundand the trust funds for oldage and survivors insurance disabilityinsurance and hospital insurance OASDHI The interchange isdesigned to place each of the OASDHI trust funds in the sameposition as it would have been if railroad employment had beencovered under Social Security since its inception The amount of the payment reflects the difference betweena the benefits that the OASDHI trust funds would have paid torailroad workers and their families if railroad employment had beencovered by OASDHI and b the payroll taxes that the OASDHI trustfunds would have received if railroad employment had been coveredby OASDHI If benefits would have exceeded taxes the OASDHI trustfunds make a payment to the Railroad Social Security EquivalentBenefit Account if benefits would have been less the OASDHI trustfunds receive a payment Currently OASI and DI make payments tothat Account and HI receives payment The interchange differs fromthe examples in the previous cases primarily in that a thepayment is between two trust funds and b the payment may be madein either direction The financial interchange does not arise from an exchangetransaction because it is a reallocation of resources among fundsall of which are financed primarily from nonexchange revenueFurthermore the nature of this reallocation is such that thetransferring entity does not receive anything of value and therecipient entity does not sacrifice anything of value Thereforethe recipient entity recognizes the transferin as an otherfinancing source and the transferring entity recognizes thetransferout as a negative financing source Transfer of cash and other capitalized assets withoutreimbursementCash and other capitalized assets may betransferred without reimbursement from one Government entity toanother Cash may include exchange revenue that is recognized bythe transferring entity in determining its net cost of operationsbut is required to be transferred to the General Fund or anotherentity other capitalized assets may include general propertyplant and equipment The receiving entity does not sacrificeanything of value and the transferring entity does not acquireanything of value Therefore the transfer is not an exchangetransaction The receiving entity recognizes the transferin as another financing source the transferring entity recognizes thetransferout as a negative financing source The amount recorded byboth entities is the transferring entitys book value of theasset Transfer of property plant and equipment withoutreimbursement types

its entiretyby both the transferring entity and the recipient entity thetransfer does not affect the net cost of operations or net positionof either entity and therefore in such a case it is not a revenuea gain or loss or other financing source However if the asset that is transferred was classified asgeneral PPE for the transferring entity but stewardshipPPE for the recipient entity it is recognized as atransferout a negative other financing source of capitalizedassets by the transferring entityREVALUATIONS Revaluation of capitalized property plant andequipmentCapitalized property plant and equipment PPEmay be removed from the general PPE accounts if it no longerprovides service in the operations of the entity because it hassuffered damage become obsolete in advance of expectations or isidentified as excess It is recorded as an asset at its expectednet realizable value Any difference between the book value and theexpected net realizable value is recognized as a gain or loss indetermining the net cost of operations because the revaluationresults from the entitys operations The expected net realizablevalue is adjusted at the end of each period and any furtherrevaluation is also recognized as a gain or loss in determining thenet cost of operations Since the revaluation does not affect obligations incurredbut does affect net cost an amount equal to the revaluation isrecognized in determining the reconciliation between obligationsincurred and net cost of operations A reconciliation is not neededin determining the change in net position because the revaluationaffects net cost and net position equally Revaluation of inventory and related propertyInventoryand related property may be revalued for such reasons asdetermination that the property is excess obsolete orunserviceable that stockpile materials have decayed or beendamaged that a loss is estimated on commodity purchase agreementsor that a change has occurred in the net realizable value ofcommodities valued at the lower of cost or net realizable valueThe amount of revaluation is recognized as a loss or a gain indetermining the net cost of operations because it results from theentitys operations Assets are correspondingly reduced orincreased Since the revaluation does not affect obligations incurredbut does affect net cost an amount equal to the revaluation isrecognized

nonexchange or exchange revenuedepending on its nature according to the applicable revenuestandards Sales of different types of Government assetsThe sale ofGovernment assets other than forfeited property is an exchangetransaction because each party receives and sacrifices somethingof value As a general rule any difference between the salesproceeds and book value is recognized as a gain or loss when theasset is sold The remainder of the transaction does not provide anet inflow of resources so no gain revenue or other financingsource is recognized If the sales proceeds equal book value thereis no gain or loss because the exchange of one asset for anotherof equal recorded value is not a net inflow of resources This general rule applies to property plant andequipment receivables other than direct loans foreclosedproperty associated with pre direct loans and loan guaranteesand miscellaneous assets It does not apply to inventory nor doesit apply to forfeited property as explained in

payment of feesthe loans receivable decrease by an equal amount or the loanguarantee liabilities increase by an equal amount The increase inone asset is offset by an equal decrease in another asset or

inflow from the repayment is not recognized as a revenue again or an other financing source Repayment of pre direct loansWhen pre directloans are repaid in whole or in part the entity exchanges oneasset loans receivable for another cash with equal value Thereis no net inflow of resources Therefore the amount of cash inflowequal to book value is not recognized as a revenue a gain or another financing source Repayment of receivables except direct loansWhenreceivables other than direct loans are paid or repaid in whole orin part the entity exchanges one asset loans receivable foranother cash with equal value There is no net inflow ofresources Therefore the amount of cash inflow equal to book valueis not recognized as a revenue a gain or an other financingsource Sales of direct loansThe sale of a direct loan is amodification according to the Federal Credit Reform Act of regardless of whether the loan being sold was obligated after FY or before FY  The book value loss or gain on a sale ofdirect loans equals the book value of the loans sold prior tosale minus the net proceeds of the sale It normally differs fromthe cost of modification which is recognized as an expense Anydifference between the book value loss or gain and the cost ofmodification is recognized as a gain or loss The amount of cashinflow equal to book value is not a net inflow of resources to theentity because it is an exchange of one asset for another of equalrecorded value Therefore the amount of cash inflow equal to bookvalue is not recognized as a revenue a gain or an other financingsourceIf the actual repayment is different from the previous estimatethe present value of the difference between cash inflows andoutflows over the term of the loancalculated as of the date ofdisbursementis reestimated and is recognized as a subsidy expenseor a reduction in subsidy expenseIf the loan is not repaid the unpaid amount is recognized as anadjustment to the bad debt allowance and does not affect revenuegains or other financing sourcesIf the receivable is not repaid the unpaid amount is recognizedas an adjustment to the bad debt allowance and does not affectrevenue gains or other financing sourcesThis difference is due to the different interest rates used todiscount future cash flows for calculating the subsidy cost andsubsidy allowance when the loan is disbursed and for calculatingthe cost of modification at a later time If the sale is withrecourse the present value of the estimated loss from the recourseis also recognized as an expenseSFFAS No  Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan Guaranteespara  and Appendix B Part IIB Sales of foreclosed property associated with postdirect loans and loan guaranteesThe net present value of thecash flow from the estimated sales

foreclosed theproperty is recognized as an asset at the net present value of itsestimated net cash flows When the foreclosed property is sold anydifference between the sales proceeds and the book value ie thenet present value as of the time of sale requires a reestimate ofthe subsidy expense which is recognized as a subsidy expense or areduction in subsidy expense The amount of cash flow equal

Stewardship ReportingSTATUSVolume IVersion  February   SUMMARYThis Statement establishes standards for reporting on theFederal Governments stewardship over  certain resourcesentrusted to it identified as stewardship property plant andequipment and stewardship investments and  certainresponsibilities assumed by it identified as the current serviceassessment The resources and responsibilities do not meet thecriteria for assets and liabilities that are required to bereported in the financial statements but are nonethelessimportant to an understanding of the operations and financialcondition of the Federal Government at the date of the financialstatements and in subsequent periods Because the Government hasbeen entrusted with and made accountable for these resources andresponsibilities they should be recognized in the financialreports of the Federal Government and of its componententitiesStewardship resources are investments by the Federal Governmentfor the benefit of the Nation When made they are treated asexpenses in the financial statements These expenses however areintended to provide longterm benefits to the public Thereforethis Statement requires that information on these resources bereported to highlight their longtermbenefit nature and todemonstrate accountability over them Depending on the nature ofthe resources stewardship reporting could consist of financial andnonfinancial dataThis Statement also establishes a standard for reportingprojections that will aid in assessing the sufficiency of futurebudgetary resources to sustain public services and meet obligationsas they come dueThis Statement establishes reporting requirements based on thecategories defined belowStewardship Property Plant and Equipment PPE  propertyowned by the Federal Government and meeting the definition of oneof the following three categoriesHeritage Assets  property plant and equipment ofhistorical natural cultural educational or artisticsignificanceFederal Mission PPE

forproperties financed by the Federal Government but owned by thestate and local governmentsCosts incurred for education and training programs thatare designed to increase or maintain national economic productivecapacity and research efforts to provide future benefits orreturns These include Human Capital  education and trainingprograms financed bythe Federal Government for the benefit of

providesProjections of current services provided by the Government aid inassessing the sufficiency of future budgetary resources to sustainpublic services and meet obligations as they come due Thisassessment termed a Current Services Assessment provides receiptand outlay data on the basis of projections of futureactivitiesAll stewardship information is deemed required supplementalstewardship information RSSI Audit requirements for RSSI willbe established in a collaborative effort by the Office ofManagement and Budget OMB and the General Accounting OfficeGAOTABLE OF CONTENTSCHAPTER  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Each standard is summarized briefly in a box followed by adetailed explanation of the standard However the standardscomprise the summaries in the boxes and the entire text of theexplanationsBACKGROUND AND RATIONALEThe Concepts Statement Objectives of Federal FinancialReporting was developed on the basis of an indepth assessment ofuser needs and is used to guide the Board in developing Federalaccounting and reporting standards The objectives cover fourareas budgetary integrity operating performance stewardship andsystems and controlThis Statement of accounting standards addresses theobjective of reporting on stewardship over certain resourcesentrusted to the Federal Government and responsibilities assumed byit The need for a report on the Federal Governments stewardshipover the resources entrusted to it and the responsibilities it hasassumed arises because of the unique nature of the FederalGovernment as described in the following sectionSTEWARDSHIP AND THE REPORTING OBJECTIVESFinancial position is a representation of an entityseconomic resources and the claims on those resources as of aparticular date In the private sector the principal objective ofreporting on financial position is to assess the viability of theentity the business firm and its potentialprofitabilityAssessing the overall performance of the FederalGovernment is not exclusively a matter of comparing revenue andexpense or its accumulated assets and liabilitiesThe Federal Governments viability and perpetuity areassumed It has unique access to financial resources and financingand the power to tax to borrow and to create money For theFederal Government financial performance is a vital issue buttraditional financial measures provide data that are appropriatefor assessing only some not all of the responsibilities for whichthe Government should be held accountable Since it exists not tomake a profit but to serve the needs of the citizens and to promotethe general welfare of the Nation other measures of accountabilityneed to be used Measures of accountability are to be reported forelements that are defined as stewardship property plant andequipment PPE stewardship investments and stewardshipresponsibilities These elements of stewardship exist because theFederal Government is dissimilar to industrial and commercialentitiesFinancial Condition The measures of accountability mentioned above help toportray the Governments financial condition Financial conditionis a broader and more forwardlooking concept than is financialposition Financial condition allows an assessment of an entity onthe basis of additional data that could include financial andnonfinancial information about current conditions These additionaldata provide a more complete indication of performance In somecases it may be necessary to present and characterize financialdata in ways that differ from traditional financial reporting andto supplement traditional data with nonfinancial data In othercases it may be necessary to rely almost entirely on nonfinancialdata to provide a more complete presentation of entity performanceMoreover assessment of financial condition could include analysisof trends demands commitments events and uncertaintiesStewardship PPE Stewardship PPE consists of items whose physicalproperties resemble those of general PPE traditionallycapitalized in financial statements However the nature of theseFederal physical assets that are classified as stewardship PPEdiffer from general PPE in that their values may beindeterminable or may have little meaning for example museumcollections monuments assets acquired in the formation of thenation or that allocating the cost of such assets for examplemilitary weapons systems and space exploration hardware toaccounting periods that benefit from the ownership of such assetsis meaningless However the Federal Government should be able todemonstrate accountability for stewardship PPE by reporting onits existence and on its condition by a reference to deferredmaintenance reported in the financial statements StewardshipPPE would include stewardship land that is land not acquiredfor or in connection with general property plant and equipmentheritage assets for example Federal monuments and memorials andhistorically or culturally significant property and Federalmission property plant and equipment for example spaceexploration and military weapons systemsStewardship Investments Stewardship investments are substantial investments madeby the Federal Government for the benefit of the nation Whenincurred they are treated as expenses in determining the net costsof operations However these items merit special treatment so thatreaders of Government financial reports know the extent of theseinvestments that are made for longterm benefit Such investmentswill be measured in terms of expenses incurred for certaineducation and training programs federally financed research anddevelopment and federally financed but not federally ownedproperty such as bridges and roadsChapter  of the Objectives of Federal Financial Reportingprovides a full discussion of financial position and financialcondition Because the Government has been entrusted with and madeaccountable for these resources they should be reported in thefinancial reports of the Government and of its component entitiesThis will help satisfy the stewardship objective defined in theconcepts statement Objectives of Federal Financial ReportingSFFAC No  The goal of the stewardship objective is that theFederal Government report on the broad outcomes of its actionsSuch reporting may provide information that could help report usersassess the impact of the Governments operations and investmentsfor the periodStewardship ResponsibilitiesA key aspect of the stewardship objective requires thatFederal reporting provide information that helps users determine whether the Governments financial condition improved ordeteriorated over the period and  whether future budgetaryresources will likely be sufficient to sustain public services andto meet obligations as they come dueInformation on stewardship responsibilities will aid inthese determinations It will provide an essential perspective onthe Governments commitment to discretionary and mandatoryprogramsReporting on this stewardship responsibility may beaccomplished in a stewardship section in the consolidated financialreport of the Federal GovernmentSTEWARDSHIP CATEGORIES OR ELEMENTS In defining the specific categories of items or elementsthat would appear as stewardship information the Board decided onthe following Property owned by the Federal Government and meeting thedefinition of one of the following three categoriesProperty plant and equipment of historical naturalcultural educational or artistic significance referred to asheritage assets for example the Washington Monument and theLincoln MemorialSee SFFAC No  pp Ibid pp Property plant and equipment that are integral to meeting aunique Federal mission referred to as Federal mission propertyplant and equipment PPE andInvestments in stewardship land that is land not acquiredfor or in connection with general property plant and equipmentfor example national forests parks and historic sites Someinvestments in stewardship land for example national parks willbe reported by both  the number of acres used as a park or anhistoric site in the stewardship land category and  by thenumber of physical units identified as national parks in theheritage assets category Such reporting would not be consideredduplication as the type of information reported on an item wouldbe different for each category of stewardship assetProperties financed by the Federal Government but ownedby state and local governments referred to as nonfederal physicalproperty for example highways and bridgesExpenses that are incurred for education and trainingthat are intended to increase national economic productive capacityor for research and development that are intended to provide futurebenefits or returns This includesInvestments in human capital that is education and trainingprograms provided by the Federal Government for example jobtraining programs and grants for higher educationInvestments in research and development for example researchon the effects of early medical intervention in delaying the onsetof AIDs symptoms in HIVpositive individuals and Federalinvestment in genetic code research to advance national medicalresearch Information on the projected financial impact on theGovernment of providing current services assuming a continuationof current programs This information will be in the form of acurrent services assessment providing future receipt and outlaydata on the basis of projections of future activitiesThe term Federal mission refers to activities that aretypically Federal such as National defense In addition Federalmission PPE is limited to PPE that would not typically beused by nonfederal entities Clearly any functions performed by aFederal entity could be broadly labeled Federal mission Thedefinition of this category however clarifies the characteristicsof PPE appropriately included in this categorya muchnarrower group than inferred by the categorys titleThe Board is including only surface land as supplementarystewardship information because the issues associated with otherthan surface land ie the natural resources on and under thatland are complex The Board is researching these complex issuesand will publish a separate exposure draft on a proposed accountingstandard for natural resources at a later datefor the Government as a whole and will include bothdiscretionary and mandatory programs and interest on debt The previous categories of items or elements result from orexist largely because of the Federal Governments role as asovereign power The components that they include are defined anddiscussed in detail in their respective chapters of thisstandardThe Nature of Stewardship ReportingThe Board recognizing the Federal Governments sizecomplexity diversity and impact on others has determined thatthe aforementioned information is needed in addition to thatincluded in financial statementsSuch information may not link directly with the basicfinancial statements because the data to be reported may be otherthan financial for example physical units or projections It willsupplement the basic financial statementsThis information as indicated in each of the standardswill be designated as required supplementary stewardshipinformation RSSI for the consolidated financial statements of theFederal Government and of the entities who have stewardshipresponsibilities over resources identified earlier in thisdocument The Board has chosen to call this RSSI to distinguish itfrom required supplementary information RSI for which auditresponsibilities are prescribed in existing professionalliterature The Board believes that OMB and GAO should establishand cause the implementation of the audit responsibilities forRSSISTEWARDSHIP INFORMATIONStewardship information may be presented in varyingformats depending on the nature of the Federal investments orclaims to Federal resources controlled by an entity Suchinformation is required for those entities  that controlstewardship resources and  whose financial statements purport tobe in accordance with Federal accounting principles as recommendedby FASAB and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury theDirector of OMB and the Comptroller GeneralExamples of selected portions of stewardship reportsections are included at Appendix BMEASUREMENTThe separate standards for each stewardship elementcontain specific guidance for that element In general howeverstewardship investments shall be measured on the same basis ofaccounting as used for financial statements including appropriateaccrual adjustments general and administrative overhead and ashare of the cost of facilities for exampledepreciationFor investments that are intended to maintain or increasethe economic productive capacity of the Nation that isinvestments in human capital research and development andnonfederal physical property trend data shall be presented Trenddata should reflect the full cost including allocation of facilityand administrative costs of the investmentFor stewardship land and heritage assets measurementwill be done on other than a financial basis For examplemeasurement may be on the basis of physical units such as acres ofland Specific data requirements are addressed in the individualstewardship standardsGenerally amounts shall be reported in nominal dollarsIf trend data that span many years are reported and the entitybelieves that constant dollar information would be meaningful fordata interpretation constant dollar data may be provided inaddition to nominal dollar dataSplit Grants Frequently stewardship elements arefinanced by grants In some cases the grants may have more thanone purpose For such grants the investment shall be allocatedamong stewardship elements on the basis of an estimate of theproportionate funding of the various grant objectives Ifallocation is not feasible the investment shall be reported on thebasis of the predominant use of the grantPerformance Indicators For some stewardship elementscategorization of these elements as investments is predicated onproducing outputs and outcomes The specific procedures includinga phasingin process for requiring such justification is containedin the individual respective standardsReporting Program Expenses Trend data reported onstewardship investment elements should reflect the full cost ofthe investment for the year being reported upon and the preceding years Additional years data also may be reported if such datawould better indicate the investment nature of an itemSee Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards SFFASNo  for a discussion of Federal cost accounting principles andstandardsAn example of a grant with a split purpose is a grant issued toa teaching hospital to perform both medical education and medicalresearchSee Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards SFFASNo  for a discussion of Federal cost accounting principles andstandardsIn some cases before the issuance of Federal accountingstandards entities have maintained records on the basis of outlaysrather than expenses It may be impracticable for such entities toreconstruct their accounts on the basis of expense In such casesentities may report data on an outlay basis for any years for whichexpense data are not available At the end of  years entitiesshould have sufficient expense data to be able to report expensesrather than outlaysReporting Deferred Maintenance Many state and localgovernments members of Congressional oversight committees andnational groups have raised the issue of the deterioratingcondition of federallyowned PPE because of deferredmaintenance associated with these assets The issue was addressedin association with PPE As a result a deferred maintenancestandard in Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment SFFASNo  establishes reporting requirements related to the conditionand future maintenance requirements for PPEThese requirements are flexible since differentconditions may be considered acceptable by different entities aswell as for different items of PPE held by the same entityThe deferred maintenance standard is applicable to all PPEwhether the PPE is reported as general PPE or stewardshipPPEREPORTING REQUIREMENTSWithin each of the standards minimum required and insome cases recommended reporting is described These requirementsand recommendations including a phasingin process for entitieswho may not have required data available at the implementation ofthe standards are contained in the individual standards Theserequirements describe the nature of items to be reported by Federalentities guidance on the form and content of agency financialreports including the specific guidance on the format in whichitems addressed in this Statement will be reported will beprescribed by OMBReporting should be at the major program or categorylevel individual transactions need not be reported unlesssignificant Additional reporting is encouraged when preparersbelieve such information would make the financial report moremeaningful or understandableSOCIAL INSURANCEThe Board first considered accounting and reporting forsocial insurance programs while considering SFFAS No  Accountingfor Liabilities of the Federal Government The Board concluded atthat time that the topic should be made part of the SupplementaryStewardship Reporting projectResearch and deliberations regarding social insurancehave continued as part of the Supplementary Stewardship Reportingproject However the Board recognizing the magnitude andcomplexity of these programs the strength of the views on theaccounting and reporting issues the significant attention beingfocused on these programs at the present time and the potentialfor change to the programs has againconcluded that additional consideration is appropriate beforeissuing final guidance Accordingly the Board has not includedguidance on social insurance in this Statement and has added aSocial Insurance Accounting project to its agendaAPPLICABILITY This standard requires that the consolidated financialreports of the Federal Government and the financial reports ofits component units contain RSSI relating toamounts invested in human capital research anddevelopment and nonfederal physical property andquantities stated in terms of physical units or dollarsof land heritage assets and Federal mission propertyAlthough FASABs sponsors do not set accounting standards forthe legislative or judicial branches Federal accounting standardswould be appropriate for themBecause the financial reports of the Federal Governmentpresent the aggregation of information about stewardshipinvestments and assets related to varied agencies and programsfurther deliberations by the Board are needed to reach a decisionon the amount and nature of information to be required under thisstandard for reporting in the consolidated financial reportAccordingly except for the standard described in Chapter Current Service Assessment the effective date of the stewardshipstandards as they apply to the consolidated financial report isdeferred pending that decision The effective date of the standardin Chapter  is for fiscal periods beginning after September  In the interim the consolidated financial reports shouldinclude such summary or selected information as is feasibleExperimentation is encouraged as is the reporting of suchadditional information as will enhance the financialreportSome Federal entities including those governmentcorporations listed in the Government Corporation Control Act andcertain others such as the US Postal Service are required by lawor policy to publish financial statements pursuant to the standardsissued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Someentities also may be required to prepare statements pursuant tostandards set by a regulatory agency That practice would not beaffected by this statement of standards For such entities thisstandard provides the following general principlesThe terms financial statements and consolidated financialstatements are used throughout this document to refer to the basicfinancial statements of a reporting entity the basic financialstatements normally include the balance sheet the statements ofnet cost changes in financial position financing budgetaryresources and custodial activities and the notes to the financialstatements The terms financial reports and consolidatedfinancial reports are used to refer to a document which wouldinclude the financial statements but which would also include itemssuch as a management discussion and analysis section a statementof program performance measures required supplemental informationor required supplementary stewardship information not included inthe financial statements or other supplemental financial andmanagement informationApplying Applicable Accounting Principles  Separatelyissued standalone generalpurpose financial statements on suchentities should apply applicable accounting principles that willbest meet user needs and comply with any relevant statutoryrequirements This principle would continue to be true forseparately issued statements even if pursuant to the provisionsbelow other information about these entities might need to bepresented when their financial statements are included withinreports of a larger Federal entityReporting Additional or Supplementary Information  Whenfinancial information on such entities is included ingeneralpurpose financial reports of a larger Federal reportingentity including Treasurys consolidated financial report anyapplicable standards recommended by the FASAB and issued by OMB andthe General Accounting Office GAO that call for additionalreporting or supplementary information should beappliedApplying Applicable Standards When Differences Arise When financial information on such entities is included in generalpurpose financial reports of a larger Federal reporting entityincluding Treasurys consolidated financial report standardsrecommended by FASAB and issued by OMB and GAO should be used ifthe difference arising from differences between Federal accountingstandards and FASBs would be material to users of the report ofthe larger entityCHAPTER  HERITAGE ASSETSHeritage AssetsHeritage assets shall be reported as required supplementarystewardship information accompanying the financial statements ofthe Federal Government and the component units of the FederalGovernment responsible for such assets Heritage assets shall bereported in terms of physical units rather than cost fair valueor other monetary valuesDEFINITION Heritage assets are PPE that are unique for one ormore of the following reasonshistorical or natural significancecultural educational or artistic for exampleaesthetic importance orsignificant architectural characteristicsHeritage assets are generally expected to be preservedindefinitely One example of evidence that a particular asset isheritage in nature is that it is listed on the National Register ofHistoric PlacesSome investments in heritage assets for example nationalparks will be reported by both  the number of physical unitsidentified as national parks in the heritage assets category andby  the number of acres used as a park or an historic site in thestewardship land category see Chapter  of this document Suchreporting would not be considered duplication as the type ofinformation reported on an item would be different for eachcategory of stewardship assetMEASUREMENTHeritage assets shall be quantified in terms of physicalunits for example number of items in collections or the number ofnational parks No asset amount shall be shown on the balancesheet of the Federal financial statements for heritageassetsThe costs of acquiring constructing improvingreconstructing or renovating heritage assets shall be consideredan expense in the period incurred when determiningthe net cost of operations The cost shall include all costsincurred to bring the heritage asset to its current condition andlocationMULTIUSE HERITAGE ASSETSNot all heritage assets are used solely for heritagepurposessome serve two purposes by providing reminders of ourheritage and by being used in daytoday government operationsunrelated to the assets themselves The cost of renovatingimproving or reconstructing operating components of heritageassets used in Government operations shall be included in generalPPE The renovation improvement or reconstruction costs tofacilitate Government operations for example installation ofcommunication wiring or redesign of office space would becapitalized and depreciated over its expected useful life The costshould not be depreciated over an unrealistically longlifeCosts of renovating or reconstructing the heritage assetthat cannot be associated directly with operations shall beconsidered heritage asset costs and included as expense incalculating net costsMINIMUM REPORTING The determination of the most relevant information to bepresented should be made by the preparer however reporting at theentity level shall be more specific than at the governmentwidelevel The following are examples of information that should beconsidered for presentationDescription of each major category of

stewardship informationaccompanying the financial statements of the Federal Government andthe component units of the Federal Government responsible for suchPPE Federal mission PPE shall be valued and reportedusing either the total cost or the latest acquisition costvaluation methodDEFINITIONFederal mission PPE includes items used to meet aFederal Government mission in which the specific PPE used isan integral part of the output of the mission PPE should beconsidered Federal mission PPE if it possesses at least one ofeach of the two types of characteristics presented below One typeof characteristic relates to the use of Federal mission PPEand the other relates to its useful lifeCharacteristics related to the use of the Federal missionPPE are that ithas no expected nongovernmental alternative usesoris held for use in the event of emergency war or naturaldisaster oris specifically designed for use in a program for whichthere is no other program or entity Federal or nonfederal usingsimilar PPE with which to compare costs Characteristics related to the useful life are that ithas an indeterminate or an unpredictable useful lifebecause of the unusual manner in which it is used improvedretired modified or maintained oris at a very high risk of being destroyed during use orof premature obsolescenceThe name Federal mission PPE may cause readers toerroneously assume that this category should include any PPEsupporting a Federal mission Federal mission PPE is limitedto those items specifically identified herein as well as any otheritems exhibiting at least one characteristic from each of the twogroups listedThis may be evidenced by the ability  to retire the PPEand later return it to service or  to continually upgrade thePPE to maintain its usefulnessFederal mission PPE excludes land whether the landis general PPE land or stewardship landFederal mission PPE however specifically includes weapons systems PPE for example fighter or attackaircraft submarines and tracked combat vehicles and  spaceexploration equipment for example space hardware and launchtracking and recovery facilities Weapons systems and spaceexploration equipment are defined in the followingparagraphsWeapons Systems Weapons systems are a combination of oneor more weapons with all related equipment materials servicespersonnel and means of delivery and deployment required forselfsufficiency This standard addresses only the PPEcomponent of weapons systems PPE included in weapons systemsare distinguished from general property plant and equipment heldby defense agencies and defense support agencies in that they areintended to be used directly by the armed forces to carry outcombat missions when necessary and to train inpeacetimeWeapons systems include only those assets owned bydefense agencies and defense support agencies that would otherwisemeet the property plant and equipment definition Items meetingother than the PPE asset category definitions are excludedfrom Federal mission PPE such as items of inventory oroperating materials and suppliesSpace Exploration Equipment Space exploration equipmentincludesitems that are intended to operate above

NoneAPPENDIX A BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS This appendix provides a discussion of the more significantcomments that the Board received from respondents to the exposuredraft Supplementary Stewardship Reporting dated August  andfrom testimony at a public hearing on the exposure draft that washeld December   Responses overall were generally favorable to the conceptof reporting stewardship information In some cases respondentshad questions about the specific reporting requirements orrequested clarification on particular items Where feasible theseareas were addressed or clarified in the final standards in thisStatement In the case of issues raised by the respondents thisappendix explains the basis of the Boards conclusionsTHE NATURE OF STEWARDSHIP REPORTING The exposure draft presented the Boards approach toreporting in a manner other than is done in the basic financialstatements for those items that it has categorized as stewardshipitems As the Board stated in the Introduction and Backgroundchapter of this Statement it believes that these stewardship itemswarrant specialized reporting to highlight their importance and toportray them in additional ways than provided by financialaccounting The Board designated a new category of reporting tohighlight the unique nature of stewardship reporting RequiredSupplemental Stewardship Information RSSI Some respondents believed that although reporting onstewardship items might be warranted a separate manner ofreporting might not They believed that stewardship reporting couldbe accommodated either within the basic financial statements forexample as a note or as Required Supplemental Information RSIThey did not see the need for the separate category of RSSI The Board however believes that a new category forreporting on stewardship items is more appropriate If stewardshipinformation were required to be reported in a note to the basicfinancial statements it would be subject to the same level ofaudit scrutiny as that of the basic financial statements Sincesome of the stewardship information is nonfinancial for examplephysical units and other data is based on projections orassumptions the same degree of audit coverage as that of the basicfinancial statements for these items may not be appropriate Suchdata is not drawn directly from the financial records Thusreliance on financial records for audit backup would not befeasible On the other hand the Board believes that certainstewardship information should receive more audit scrutiny than itwould if it were RSI For RSI the auditor reviews the data foroverall compliance with associated guidance and for consonance withthe basic financial statements The auditor usually providesindepth review of the RSI only if there appears to be some problemwith the data If he or she believes that the data is not fairlypresented the auditor still may issue a clean opinion on the basicfinancial statements while noting that there are problems with theRSI Therefore the Board has proposed that a new categoryRSSI be designated to cover stewardship reporting By developingthis new category it is anticipated that audit standards will bedeveloped to address the specific items in that category Althoughthe Board does not have authority to set audit standards itestablished RSSI with the expectation that OMB and GAO will incollaboration determine appropriate audit procedures for thisinformationSOCIAL INSURANCE Consideration of guidance for the recognition measurementand display of obligations for social insurance programs hascontinued to present the Board with significant vexing theoreticaland practical problems The Board notes the strength of feelings ofrespondents and commentators some of whom believe a liabilityshould be recognized for amounts that will be paid in futureperiods to or on behalf of current or future program beneficiariesand others who believe that there is no obligation associated withthese programs that meets the definition of a liability other thanamounts due and payable at the end of an accounting periodadditionally some favor disclosure of projected data relating tothe magnitude of the present value of future net benefit paymentsat a particular date while others favor cash flow information for along period of time The Board notes too the magnitude andcomplexity of these programs and the extreme sensitivity ofprojections relating to the programs to assumptions whose range ofpossibilities is large More importantly the Board notes thatsocial insurance programs are presently being studied and discussedfrequently and seriously within government and by the public areport and recommendations are expected shortly from the Quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security The prospects ofsignificant changes to the programs are reasonably high After deliberating the issue the Board has concluded thatadditional investigation and further deliberation is required andhas directed the FASAB staff to continue to research socialinsurance issues focusing especially on identifying thecharacteristics of programs which should cause them to be subjectto the guidance provided in a Statement on Social Insurance theappropriate display of information in the financial statements theidentification of additional information if any which should berequired for social insurance programs the means for measurementof financial data included in such additional information and thedesirability of nonfinancial indicators ratios of data to GDP orcovered payroll to describe the status of programs or theimplications of potential changes to or needs of the programsTheBoard has instructed the staff to be mindful of all currentdevelopments in structuring its research and itsrecommendationsEXPENSING STEWARDSHIP PPE Echoing their earlier comments to the Boards ExposureDraft Accounting for Property Plant and Equipment somerespondents expressed concern that expensing rather thancapitalizing costs associated with stewardship PPE wouldlessen the value of the operating statement as a tool forperformance measurement since it would overstate the cost in theyear an asset is acquired The Board however believes that capitalizing anddepreciating stewardship PPE provides information that is oflittle usefulness Stewardship PPE includes heritage assetsFederal mission PPE and stewardship land Period costsrelated to stewardship PPE are of diminished usefulnessbecause of uncertain useful life eg heritage assets Federalmission PPE uncertain historical cost basis egstewardship land or probability of being destroyed in use egFederal mission PPE Therefore the Board believes thatattempting to capitalize and depreciate stewardship PPE is notwarranted It believes that reporting on information related to theexistence and the condition of the stewardship PPE has morerelevance to decisionmakers and other users of the financialreportCOSTING OF FEDERAL MISSION PPE Respondents to the Boards question on whether thealternatives of presenting costs of Federal mission PPE interms of either total historical or latest acquisition costgenerally believed that both options should not be allowed Somebelieved that use of alternative methods would not ensureconsistency in reporting Others believed that only totalhistorical costs should be used Still others believed that totalhistorical cost should be the longterm goal with the use oflatest acquisition cost allowed only until such historical costdata would be available The Board however recognizes that significant practicalproblems may arise if an agency is compelled to adopt a specifiedcosting approach for reporting stewardship assets and that suchcost approach would not be used for computing the net cost ofoperations Therefore it believes that its decision to accepteither the historical cost or latest acquisition cost method isappropriate However it also emphasizes that once a method ischosen an entity should switch to the other method only withappropriate justificationREPORTING EXPENSE OR OUTLAY DATA The standards require that expense data be reported forinvestments in human capital research and development andnonfederal physical property The standards also provide for aperiod of  years to transition to reporting expense data for thoseagencies that currently maintain only outlay data Some Boardmembers suggested that since some agencies currently maintain onlyoutlay data requiring that only outlay data be reported might bemore practical However the responses reflected a clear consensusfor reporting expenses with little or no support for reportingoutlays only and a minority preferring to report both expenses andoutlays Therefore the standards as proposed remainunchangedREQUEST FOR MORE SPECIFICITY IN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS When the Board developed the standards for stewardshipreporting its intention was to provide overall guidance ondefinitions recognition measurement and minimum and recommendedreporting This broad guidance was intended to provide the basicreporting requirements while allowing each entity maximumflexibility in such areas as determining what constitutes theindividual stewardship items for that entity which costs aredirectly attributable to the stewardship item and how best toreport on multiuse items so that users will gain the best pictureof the entitys financial and performance information The Board believes that the desire for more specificguidance expressed by several respondents stems from the beliefthat without such guidance an entitys determination of how toapply the standards could be questioned Nevertheless the Boardreiterates its position that entities should be provided maximumflexibility when applying the stewardship standards Howeverentities should make the determination of how best to apply thestewardship standards based on a thorough analysis of theirindividual entity including its mission financial practices andthe impact of its mission and operation on financial report usersand on the Nation Finally all entity determinations of theapplicability of stewardship standards should be thoroughlydocumentedISSUES FOR WHICH CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE PROPOSED STANDARDS Multiple Category Reporting Some respondents wereconcerned that there would be double counting if as proposed bythe standards some stewardship items would be reported in twoseparate categories for example Yellowstone National Park wouldbe reported as a heritage asset and as stewardship land Reporting supplementary stewardship information in twocategories will not be deemed double counting This is becausewhere multiple reporting is required the units of measure aredifferent for each of the stewardship categories In the exampleabove Yellowstone National Park would be reported under acategory such as National Parks as one of the total number ofheritage assets under the auspices of the Department of theInterior it also would be reported by the number of acres that itoccupies under the stewardship land category for the Department Toclarify this point the discussion of the process of multiplereporting was expanded in the statement to explain that the Boarddoes not consider this reporting as double counting Reporting the Fair Value for Stewardship PPETransferred to State or Local Governments Many respondentsquestioned the need for and the costbenefit of requiring thatthe fair value of stewardship PPE transferred to state andlocal governments be reported They stated that monetary values forstewardship PPE are not required to be reported because suchvalues are either difficult to obtain eg lack of historicalcost data on land acquired at the birth of the Nation or notmeaningful eg the historical cost to build the WashingtonMonument Therefore they questioned the costbenefit of requiringthat the fair value of stewardship property transferred to stateand local governments be determined and reported The Board agreed that the fair value of stewardshipproperty transferred to state and local governments need not bedetermined and reported The standards have been revised to requirea description of the property transfer transaction if the fairvalue is known nothing would preclude reporting itEFFECTIVE DATE FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In considering required reporting of stewardshipinformation the Board became increasingly aware of the need to behighly selective in proposing requirements for the consolidatedfinancial report of the Federal Government It recognized thepotential for implementation problems in the first few years afterthe effective date of this statement In addition to the normalproblems associated with adapting to new standards several ofthese standards provide for a transition period during whichagencies may or in some cases may not report investments in humancapital research and development and nonfederal physical propertyif investments are reported for each of five years as called for inthis statement they may be reported for earlier years during thetransition period on the basis of either outlays or expense Themerit of reporting the aggregate of information prepared ondifferent bases is questionable Further the information required to be reported by thesestandards goes beyond that customarily accompanying financialreports of governments or commercial enterprises Standards relatedto heritage assets and stewardship land call for reporting in termsof physical units eg number of parks or acres of land ratherthan in terms of historical cost Implementation problems areforeseen at the consolidated statement level because of differingmeasures Also the Board is concerned with the possibility ofestablishing requirements so detailed as to render the consolidatedfinancial report unwieldy unfriendly to the potential user andobfuscating of important information Because of these possible implementation problems and theneed to consider other disclosures or presentations the Boardexpressed a desire for further deliberations relative to theconsolidated financial report of the Federal Government Accordingly the effective date of this statement will befor fiscal years beginning after September   as it relatesto financial statements of component units of the FederalGovernment this same effective date applies to chapter  as itrelates to the consolidated financial statements of the FederalGovernment The effective date of the statement as it applies tothe consolidated financial statements except for chapter  isdeferred pending further deliberations of the Board In theinterim the consolidated financial reports should include suchsummary or selected information as is feasible Experimentation isencouraged as is the reporting of such additional information aswill enhance the financial reportREPORTING OF INFORMATION NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THESTANDARDS Some respondents requested that the standards provide forreporting additional information such as transfers of stewardshipproperty to foreign governments stewardship land sold to theprivate sector the Federal Governments interest in such things asproperty held by nonfederal entities or patents generated throughFederal research and development funds and foreign contributionsto Federal programs In developing the standards for stewardship reporting theBoard concentrated on providing guidance in the principal areas ofstewardship resources that have materiality for the majority ofFederal entities and for the consolidated financial reporting forthe Nation The Boards intent was to ensure that these significantareas if material for an entity would be reported regularly andin a consistent manner In some cases an entity may have other resources orobligations that were not specifically addressed in the stewardshipstandards but that the entity believes may be material to thepresentation of its stewardship information In such cases if thereporting of such additional data would be useful and relevant toreaders and would provide a better indication of the resources andobligations of the entity the Board encourages such reportingAPPENDIX B SAMPLE REPORTSNOTEThe sample report sections in Appendix B are intended toillustrate the type of reporting contemplated by the Board Certaindata are taken from various reports for one or more recent yearsand are actual data Other data have been estimated byjudgmentally extrapolating from actual data Still other data andprogram references have been fabricated
