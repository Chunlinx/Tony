              oh im sorry   its okay you can get started there   okay i think LA Law   oh thats probably what i was going to say   and uh Dallas i im a   okay   im a veteran of all of Dallas shows   oh uhhuh   its very embarrassing   oh yeah where where are you calling from   Dallas   Dallas yeah im from Rowlett     oh okay i just moved here last April     oh really   and uh i got my husband i got i got married to a TIer and uh well the first thing my mom and i did when we moved out here was go to Southfork it was very embarrassing   really i was going to ask you if youve been out to Southfork   they have a museum there of all the Dallas uh uh people and they have they even have a a genealogy chart of all of the people who married who and whose children are whose and they even went so far as to put dotted lines on there as to who had an affair with who   uhhuh huh   it was pretty bad bad because i understood all of it     okay i i cant say im that much of a faithful Dallas follower maybe its because because i live here and i know how hokey it is i dont know       one of my uh uh i went to school out in Plano and one of my my classmates married one of the uh uh one of the Duncans that actually owned Southfork when it started   oh yeah   so and i think she was in some of the shows for a while as extra and stuff so   yeah that wasnt a very good thing that happened to that family   yeah     they kind of went in there and took over   well what are you going to do theyre theyre coming to the end of their season uh   well thats what im doing May third im going to sit right here watch it     i was going to say theres going to be no more Dallas reruns     actually i havent watched it much this season in the last couple of years ive been on that uh downward trend   yeah of course theyre uh theyre probably going to set it up for some kind of sequel or something in the future and uh   yeah those TV movies or something   yeah its got to come back   it was funny i i spent a a year overseas a few years ago and all the TV was i was in Japan and all the TV shows were in Japanese   uhhuh   but they showed reruns of Dallas and it was great because i could turn it on and all of the people were very familiar to me and id seen all of the shows so i knew what was going on   so you didnt need to know the language   huhuh but it it was it was really nice when you move to such a foreign culture to see all these familiar faces   how about that true and hear hear the weird voices   yeah all those dubs its terrible   it like yeah somebody one time was talking about John Wayne movies with these weird Japanese voices and       its hard to imagine well what do you think about whats going on on LA Law this year its   well i   have you seen it the past couple of weeks   i cant remember the last time i saw it i know that um Susan Dey is with Jimmy Smits   yeah and shes pregnant did you know that   yeah and that just she doesnt belong with him     and that they kicked Michael Kuzak out did you know that   no hes not with the firm anymore   no he uh the the im trying to remember Leland decided to extend Brackmans uh reign as a senior partner   yeah   and the rest of the partners all got up in arms about it and Michael met with them and said and said you know we got to do something about this we need to make a proposal let somebody else be the leader and he kind of elected himself and everybody else went along with it and they they uh gave it to Leland and he hit the roof and um he and Brackman talked about it and and Brackman decided to try and do away with him so he fired him because he he violated one of their policies of going behind a senior partners back or something so they fired him they chased him off with the security guards theyre fighting out that battle now hes firm formed his own firm   really   he uh what else did he do he did a lot of nasty nasty stuff behind their back yeah he stole Grace and Victor theyve gone with him um   wow   and um who are the other two he stole two associates   um the the tax attorney   Abby and Jonathan he he took Abby and Jonathan with him   yeah really   yeah and he he went to uh he went to the bank and he took um i cant remember the guy the guy he defended for murder Earl you know they had a lien against his house so hed pay his legal bills do you remember that   the the black guy that   yeah   he was a teacher   uhhuh   yeah   they they they put a lien against his house so hed pay his legal bills because it was like three or four hundred thousand dollars or something   whoa   well Michael reduced his legal fees to twenty thousand dollars   yeah   so that they cut that out so they they couldnt have a lien on his house anymore so he did away with that and then he went to the bank because the bank gave him apparently some extra credit because they had that lien well s ince they didnt have the lien anymore they couldnt have the credit from the bank so that that got the firm in hot water   oh   and then then Michael went to court and and uh petitioned that they needed to go into solvency because they were so financially in bad shape   uhhuh   and uh they all showed up in court um Leland was going to try a motion make a motion before that so they ended up both being in court in front of the judge pleading their case and um i think i think Michael was doing it on the one hand and the guy that do you remember the guy that that uh Grace had an affair with the other lawyer that she had an affair with for a while kind of an older guy she   at the firm   no he wasnt at the firm he was like Rosalyn Chases lawyer before   oh   it was earlier in the season she had an affair with this other lawyer   no i guess i didnt see those   and and anyway Leland Leland apparently has hired him on now and hes and hes defending this case   jeez   and what happened at the end is the judge um um uh Michael wanted wanted the firm put in receivership and the judge wouldnt do it but he said he hes going to give a like a ten day uh evaluation and he was going to put it in the hands of a businessman to to run it and see if the firm was salvageable or not   uhhuh   and and both parties had to come up with with lists of people that were suitable to to run it and he rejected both of the lists and came up with his own person       youll youll never guess who this person is   who   think of the worst well now it might be hard but think of the the worst person thats been on the show uhhuh in in the past two years besides Rosalyn shes dead and gone   yeah shes that was weird  that was very weird um the worst person   goofy   i dont know   youll never get it its its uh was it Roxanne   Roxanne the the secretary   Roxannes exhusband       David Meyer   well hes got a lot of business smarts though   yeah i know thats who he put in charge of the firm you     i think what she did to him was a travesty   yeah but hes going to be  hes going to be running the firm for the next i dont know ten days or whatever to evaluate   thats funny       boy theyve really got their uh       talk about a genealogy chart   yeah thats pretty pretty strange well they theyve already said that um who is it i guess its Susan Dey and and uh whoever plays Kuzak isnt coming back next year so some of this some of this has to do with why theyre not coming back i guess   yeah well is um the tax attorney and his wife still married married   yeah theyre going to stay there in fact um Susan Dey and and uh the the wife had had a confrontation about it   oh   why why they didnt invite them and and the the firm that Kuzak founded is just a litigation firm and they said well we wanted we wanted you but we didnt really want Stuart   because hes not a litigationist and we didnt figure you you would come without him and and were going to be fighting against each other so   right       oh   so its just kind of weird   that thats a weird marriage   yeah   theyre married in real life   i know       i know   theyve had i was surprised when they started having big problems and then i only caught part of the episode where he went on that uh nature deal   uhhuh   and and he got real into it i guess   yeah  yeah that was kind of bizarre yeah its interesting to talk about their marriage their marriage in real life because she had breast cancer and that   oh she did   yeah and that was real tough for him and there were some times on the show where there were some real emotional things going on with the
