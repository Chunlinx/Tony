        uh it was interesting i just read in the paper the other day that they finally sent up the the uh former Soviets whatever you call them now       recently set up some relief for the guy thats been up orbiting the mirror space station for the last ten months   oh right   right i guess he had some culture shock and all the changes that took place while he was in space   boy i would think so thats incredible but could you imagine being in a in such an enclosed area for such a long period of time and totally isolated   umhum yeah i dont think yeah its its pretty difficult to imagine i think that they dont have the same considerations for the human being as we do in this country   no no i dont think so either i i was also kind of surprised that uh i dont maybe maybe there were technical uh limitations on what could be done but it it seemed like a perfect opportunity for the uh United States space program to uh at least offer to get involved with them in in send up some sort of a relief or supplies or something and   umhum   get some sort of a union going   well i think uh maybe something like that may be in the works in the future trying to get some joint ventures between the two countries in terms of space exploration   yeah i hope so id like to see something like that   yeah i think uh you know the they have a lot of resources over there and probably some cheaper labor and things where we could benefit by purchasing booster rockets or maybe something on  that we can probably get from them cheaper than we can produce ourselves   right how do you feel as far as spending uh the tremendous amounts of money that need to be spent to keep the program going how do you feel about   well i dont know i think its kind of hard to determine uh the truth i mean you listen to some sides of the story and they they dont they want to cut funding because they feel that the rewards of exploring space are very limited and then theres others who say we can learn a great deal its kind of hard to figure out whats true and whats not true   right yeah it really is its uh id certainly hate to see anything come to a grinding halt   umhum   although i guess uh certain logic could be applied to figure out how much spending it can do in any given year or period of years   right   but id like to see you hear talk about this uh future space station that may be built may serve as a a uh intermediate point between like a trip to Mars or something like that and   umhum   seems like the next next big step that needs to be taken is interplanetary travel but that also seems so   right   um i dont know like the thing that some the figment of somebodys imagination   yeah definitely at this point it is i have a friend who works for McDonald Douglas in California and theres a prime contractor on the on that space station   oh   and um i know recently i their funding was at least guaranteed for another year   oh is that right   so theyre going to continue but ive also read a lot of bad things about it how theyre talking about the value of the space station is very limited in the amount of information that can be gathered is is minimal but now now thats only one side of the story you know im sure if you ask someone from McDonald Douglas they would tell you theres a lot more to be learned from it   oh really i would think so id certainly think so and then you have the unfortunate mix between military politics and scientific exploration that   right   theyre uh starting up star wars again evidently and that gets i dont know i think a lot of people lump that into the category of space travel even though it really has nothing to do with   umhum   uh scientific quest for knowledge its more uh paranoid   yeah   preventative thing for the military   well i guess i some of the i mean i see a good unmanned type space exploration sending uh satellites and or uh unmanned vehicles into orbit or to other planets like Voyager and that sort of thing that seems to be pretty valuable and maybe more cost effective than trying to put human beings into space   definitely definitely in fact it seems uh that a a lot of those benefits were unexpected as far as they had plans for these things and they sent them up years and years ago and they never expected them to be still transmitting data back   right   thats incredible some of the pictures that have come back   yeah and and in a lot of ways its improving the technology in terms of um signal processing and and data transmission and trying to determine uh a picture from the information the very weak information theyre getting back from these signals   yeah yeah i agree i think thats definitely been worth while and like you said its very cost effective and   and thats   probably yields as much information as as having somebody actually up there   umhum   although i sure wouldnt mind being the guy thats actually up there   oh really   yeah yeah i think so   i dont know i dont know if its quite as glamorous as it it seems like it would be   i i dont think its glamorous i probably wouldnt enjoy it all the time while it was happening but boy could you imagine looking back
