work of a group of young novelists busily turning theconventional Jewish identity crisis on its head For these writerslets callthem the philotraditionaliststhe modern world that lured the Philip Rothsand Saul Bellows and Norman Mailers away from their childhood enclaves doesntglisten with its old comehither In the three decades since the heyday of theJewishAmerican novel secularity has grown tarnished It is now seen asleading to selfabsorbed selfdestruction rather than to individualfulfillment What the new generation embraces is the past a godly past hedgedin by community and ritual that

readers taleof being forced out of her sect by her own intellectual and sexual curiosityBut in her second novel Giving Up America  which comes out this monthshe all but rejects that rejection The narrator is an unhappy ad copy writerwhose callow husband has fallen for a wouldbe Miss America contestant Shemust return to her family to reimmerse herself in the eternal Hasidic truthsbefore she can make something like peace with her life            America the country Europes rabbis condemned as thetrayfe medina the unholy land the faithless landis now producing aliterature of faith But hasnt there always been a literature of Jewish faithWhat about Bernard Malamud with his discombobulated folk Jews and IsaacBashevis Singer with his tortured Polish intellectuals and Lithuanianrabbinical courts The difference has everything to do with the passage oftime The philotraditionalists the best of them anyway are bringing lifeand imagination to a kind of writing all but given up for moribund andbesides theyre producing a literature of American faith No longer isreligious practice or a sense of Jewish continuity the prerogative of displacedEuropeans gazing with horror upon the vacuousness of their assimilatedchildren Cynthia Ozick the Americanborn doyenne of contemporary observantJewish writers used to make her heroes and heroines refugees from the Nazisstruggling to fortify their shredded piety against the American profanity Buteven she has gone native In a brilliant novel published last year ThePuttermesser Papers  her eponymous heroine Ruth Puttermesser becomesmayor of New York City and embraces a Whitmanesque vision of urbanharmonyJews and Christians and everyone togetherbefore being undone by arapacious golem            Then there are the childrenthemselves who are much less vacuous than predicted and insist that they toocan have a connection to the past The brutally funny Steve Stern  LazarMalkin Enters Heaven  Harry Kaplans Adventures Underground  APlague of Dreamers  does this by inventing a shtetl that outSingersSinger in its weirdness and filth and then putting it in preWorld War IIMemphis Tenn Thane Rosenbaum in Elijah Visible  grants hischaracters who are the children of Holocaust survivors the right to suffertheir own highly American litany of postHolocaust disorders            Oddlyenough it was Singer who wrote the prototext of American postassimilationismShadows on the Hudson  which was only published posthumously earlierthis year though it was written in the s and set even earlier It is astunning heartbreaking novel the darkest and most modern of his workslargely because it is the most bitter about modernity Its antihero HertzGrein an erudite European refugee and serial deserter of women turns his backon a secular life gone hideously awry and migrates to Israel joining the mostextreme sect of ultraOrthodox he can find This is a New World sort of moveeven if made by a refugee and in Israel not America European Jewish migrswhether cultured cosmopolitans or members of the pious bourgeoisie dontsuddenly convert to fundamentalism thats a specialty of godlessAmericans            Now theres Allegra Goodman whoseenthusiastically reviewed first novel Kaaterskill Falls  appears poisedto become the crossover Jewish novel of the year The book takes place overthree summers in the late s in and around a mitnaged rationalistantimystical nonHasidic ultraOrthodox sect the Kirschners who followedtheir rabbi from Frankfurt to Washington Heights just before World War II andhave taken to summering in a hamlet in the Eastern Catskills Dont mistakethis for the Western Catskillsthe Borscht Belt The Eastern Catskills is anot particularly Jewish and now largely forgotten resort region that was oncethe height of chic the Hamptons of the  th century as well ashome to the Hudson River School of painters The novels title alludes to afamous painting by Thomas Cole that hangs in a nearby museum            In short the grandeur ofthe pastJewish Americanis the theme here The older generation includingthe rabbi possesses the old European graces Theyre erudite and sophisticatedand carry their rituals off with comparable ease Ease that is compared withthe next generation which is Goodmans real focus The AmericanbornKirschners are more rigid less worldly than their parents Even the rabbifrets about them They are good people he tells his son But they are verysimple   They are afraid of the Mind and to read They dont readSchiller and the Shakespeare How can I say it to you They keep the one thingthe religious alive It is the most important but they have lost the otherThey have forgotten the poetry There is not one of them who is what we used tocall an Educated Man            Goodmanhas two advantages over her characters With an advanced degree in literatureshe has read Schiller and Shakespeare and she is writing  yearslater when American Judaism has grown less awkward about itself In fact thesuccess of her novel lies in its casualness the way it makes the extremes ofreligious practice seem cozily normal Neither Potok nor Abraham can immersethe reader in the minutiae of Hasidic life the way Goodman does in theparticulars of separatist German ultraOrthodoxy            Another refreshing feature of Goodmans storytelling isthat unlike other members of fundamentalist sects one might find in novelsher characters dont chafe at their restrictions or not too much At thebeginning of the novel the heroine Elizabeth Shulman feels so at home in herJewish skin that God and the scriptures worship and ritual are all simplepractical things for her Indeed shes one of the few deeply observantcharacters youre likely to encounter who does not romanticize religion The sacred is not mysterious to her Rather she romanticizes the secularPoetry universities and paintings fill her with awe Its typical ofGoodmans blend of the sublime and the haimish homey that whenElizabeth experiences an epiphany while looking at Coles picture it is therevelation of a most unambitious ambition She wants to open a kosher grocerystore In an ultraOrthodox setting of course thats not a simple step Itrequires for example permission from the rabbi and renting from anantiSemitic landlord By the end of the book Shulman has bumped up againstthe edges of her life but she doesnt yearn to escape it exactly She hasmerely learned that her leaders are capable of stupid mistakes in theirdealings with her She has no intention of leaving first because her doubt isnot enough to sever her from her husband and children and second because thatsnot the kind of story it is            The novel has its flawsGoodmans explanations of Jewish ritual sometimes veer from the helpful to thecondescendingly overexplicit as if she were writing for young adults Shulmanaside you could find oneline descriptions of Goodmans main characters in anyhalfdozen AmericanJewish novels the rabbi with two sons one brilliant andprodigal one duller but more loyal the Holocaust survivor numbed by his pastthe daughters tempted by the twin heresies of feminism and Zionism Israel isviewed as a nation of faithless sinners by these ultraOrthodox Jews theassimilationist Jew who comes to a bad end But Goodman makes them believableat least despite bits of soggy sentimentality she makes you care Theexception is the cast of nonJewish locals who are almost all soap operaishwhite trash And whatever ones quibbles Goodman should be credited withdoing what Singer and Malamud and even Ozick were never really able to domaking the most rigorous form of Judaism seem plausible as an Americanlife
