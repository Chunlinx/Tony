                been about ten years since i graduated from high school i got a GED i was a drop out up until that point     uhhuh   and uh as my memory serves me school was not that um didnt achieve its goals as being an educational institution very well and i would suppose that the trend in government is for things to get worse kind of like uh chaos and regular deterioration so i dont not having seen anything to change my mind i would assume its gotten worse in the meantime   yeah i graduated about the same time you did and um i graduated early only and i was lucky because i dont think i would have graduated at all i was skipping and everything   yeah   up to that point and i just happened to have enough credit hours so i could get out   yeah i had really reached the point where id quit going entirely i was tired of it was off working somewhere   umhum   there was almost no challenge to it at all   i was on the college track doing all the classes and i was done   uh um   it was boring they werent interested   yeah i had started in that uh that track but just got sick of it and turned into a juvenile delinquent instead   umhum   went off and joined the military and then uh came back to college it just the material was so repetitive it was stuff we already seen probably half a who knows how many times before and it was just presented so dryly and i suppose that if um if youre going to pay teachers the salary that theyre paid thats thats the level of education thats going to be presented   thats true we have to pay our teachers more and give them more incentive to interest the children   yeah   um yeah i really  i really believe the same thing i mean here i am now just now  finishing up college it took me that long to get interested to go back   um   you know and but i find college a whole different ball game   yeah absolutely its a stress test   it is but its so stimulating i mean       those teachers really are at least mine of course im in nursing so   um     ours is a lot of life threatening but um i it it isnt i i dont miss classes i love it   yeah yeah i agree its a whole another class of everything the level of education the uh excitement and the the interesting instructors their level of understanding the material everythings different   maybe we ought to um offer this kind of enrichment to our high school students   now how would you recommend doing that   well if somehow we could make give them a certain amount of independence cause thats part of college   yeah   right um and then simply say this is up to you to achieve this   sounds a lot like the um what do they call lets see uh fire fox Foxfire method   i havent heard about that   thats the one where uh some guy its here in Georgia north Georgia several years ago ten twenty years ago walked into a class room and they the students retained command and he just kind of threw up his hands and said basically do what you want to do and developed this uh program where the students pretty much did what they wanted to do the teacher was just there to kindly loosely kind of loosely guide them um along and to make sure that they werent getting   umhum   getting off into weird senseless subject areas and stuff like that and i think there was some kind of sociology class along the lines of um   umhum   what did they do they went out and collected stories and culture of the area in southern Appalachian uh mountains   umhum   and published a bunch of books and the guys real famous now and in fact i just read recently that some school here in north Georgia decided to completely um adopt the Foxfire method all the classes are that way   oh really   and they say that the results are just tremendous its a whole another um magnitude of improvement over regular public schools      see and that and it works   yeah i wish there had been something like that years ago when we were younger   me too i wish they had computers       yeah theyve made a an amazing change   i think i think elementary school is educational is stimulating for children and i think we lose them somewhere between junior high and high school   a friend here in town just recently helped a um third grader with his science fair project  and he was describing some of the interaction   umhum   uh between the the teachers there and the students and the teachers there and himself and other people like him   umhum   and was really disturbed with the uh mentality of the people there they treated him like uh he was one of the kids you know they had their little domain   um   i remember he brought up a story about how he needed a desk to set up the  uh the science fair project that he and this other guy worked on and they couldnt find one anywhere and they found one in a room and the instructor there was really possessive of it and wouldnt let him use it   oh youre kidding   yeah   well then that goes to maybe not having the funds for things
