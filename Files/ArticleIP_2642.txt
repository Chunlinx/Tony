                                 Airline Deregulations FairWeather Friends            Two decades after Congressfirst deregulated the airline industry Americas major airlines are startingto sound more than a bit like St Augustine Give us competition Lord Butnot yet            The drive to freeze outcompetition can be seen most obviously in the new mergers and alliances thatare shrinking the number of airlines serving any one airport American Airlinesis trying to get European Commission approval for an alliance with BritishAirways while Northwest Airlinesalready partnered with Dutch airlineKLMrecently announced plans for an alliance with Continental AirlinesAlliances provide many of the benefits of mergersadded routes globalconnections oligopoly pricingwithout a lot of the costs In a different agethey might have been called minicartels And it seems likely that the next fewyears will see a continued industry consolidation            Lessobvious but more telling evidence of the majors resistance to real competitioncan be found in their massive lobbying efforts to protect their currentpositions Those efforts are needed because despite the seemingly inexorabledrive toward oligopoly in the industry lowpriced competitors keep springingup to try to take away their business The model for these startups is theremarkable success of Southwest Airlines It has been able to turn flights thatare low on frills but high on goofiness flight attendants singing dumbcontests and all the rest into a gold mine by keeping costs low and poachingthe majors business on particular routes Across the country airlines such asReno Air and Legend Airlines are trying to carve out regional niches withinwhich they can challenge the industry giants            One way to deal with these annoying littlegnats is simply to acquire them though that runs the risk of bringing theantitrust bloodhounds snooping around Another option is to turn them intofeeder airlines which allow the majors to offer service from major hubs tosmaller airports The third choice is simply to freeze the upstarts out bykeeping them off the runwaysand the majors have most takeoff and landingslots at goodsize airports safely within their grasp            AtOHare Airport for instance American and United Airlines together control percent of flights Northwest and Continental together will own  percent ofthe air traffic at Detroit and  percent at Minneapolis Delta Air Linesenjoys a dominant position in Atlanta and American has a near monopoly onDallasFort Worth There is a certain logic to this arrangementwith thenumber of passengers flying to any one location relatively limited engaging incutthroat competition in every city makes less sense for the majors thanparceling out the nation among themselves And most airlines do fly to nearlyever major city though perhaps not exactly when you want them to            However much sense the hub system makes from amarketprotecting angle and as an efficient means of routing air traffic itsanticompetitive consequences are undeniable While deregulation undoubtedlyhas been a good thing overall and while supersaver fares are oftenastonishingly low the last few years have seen a dramatic rise in the price oftickets purchased without any advance notice what they call business faressince only business travelers can afford them By some accounts businessfares are as much as  percent higher than they were just two years ago            Thatsnot because its become more expensive to carry business passengers either Infact since ticketing systems have become more sophisticated airlines can do amuch better job of managing demand and filling seats But those savings havenot been passed along to customers Instead since the supply of airline seatsis limited as demand rises the airlines are able to charge passengers moreatleast those passengers who absolutely positively have to be in Tampatomorrow            In theory of course this oligopoly pricingshould conjure new airlines into existence bringing supply more in line withdemand and eventually harmonizing fares with costs But there are a number ofthings preventing that from happening In the first place the creation offrequentflyer programs has let the rich get richer in the sense thatcustomers only reap the benefits of those programs if they fly the same airlineeach time More importantly the physical universe limits the number oftakeoffs and landings any single airport can handle in a day The majors have astranglehold on those slots and theyve invested a lot of energy and money inensuring that they continue to own them            There isanother choice which is that entire new airports could spring up or smallerairports could expand But here too the majors have been vigilant InDallasFort Worth for instance American has fought fiercely against theproposed expansion of Love Field where JFKs plane landed in November Since  the socalled Wright Amendment sponsored by that paragon oflegislative propriety former Speaker Jim Wright kept airlines from flying outof Love to anywhere but Texas four neighboring states Last year Congresspassed a law adding three states to that list and letting small planes seats or less fly anywhere in the country DallasFort Worth backed byAmerican immediately sued everyone involved even as American ran newspaperads warning of intense congestion lots of delays and more audaciouslythat the North Texas economy will be less vigorous than it is today Howadding lowfare flights explicitly targeting business passengers was going tocripple the Dallas economy was not made precisely clear            What the LoveFort Worth fight has madeclear is the basic disingenuousness of the majors when it comes toderegulation While they have pushed hard for open skies policies in Japanand Europe and lobbied hard against government antitrust intervention theyhave been more than happy to use the legislative process to protect what amountto sinecures The Love Field imbroglio in fact has presented the curiousspectacle of House Majority Leader Dick Armey arguing that increasedcompetition will threaten the regions economic health an odd conclusion fromCongress most fervent supporter of free markets            Still the disingenuousnessis in a sense inherent in the industry itself since airlines rely on publicairspace and for the most part public airports for their business And thismakes the whole question of what constitutes regulation a complicated one Onesolution being proposed for instance would take some landing and takeoffslots at major airports away from the industry giants and auction them off tosmaller lowfare airlines Now is that deregulation or is it reregulationThe majors insist its the latter But insofar as dispersing the slots wouldfoster competition a strong case can be made that its the former Either wayits a plan that makes sense            Because air space islimited theres an inclination to believe that airlines are natural monopoliesor oligopolies and that flooding the market with competitors will actually makeair travel less not more efficient But the vast majority of airports are along way from being saturated in terms of possible routes and wheneverlowfare carriers arrive costs quickly drop More to the point even as themajor airlines have been reaping large profits over the last four years theirproductivity has not risen at all suggesting that consolidation is notimproving efficiency Its no surprise that the majors want open skies when itsuits them and closed skies when it doesnt But real competition shouldbe the  th anniversary gift bestowed on these fairweather friendsof deregulation
