                                 Big Sister Anna Quindlen            Culturebox never dreamed when New York Times OpEd columnist andsuburban mom Anna Quindlen abandoned journalism for fictionwriting five yearsago that it would be nice to have her back But consider the hole she leftbehind her in the pundit universe The columns of her successor at theTimes  Maureen Dowd consist of Heathers like pronunciamentosupon the coolness of this politician and the uncoolness of that one eachpunctuated by a saucy flounce Quindlens predecessor in the slot atNewsweek she began to fill this week the late Meg Greenfield issuedclosely argued bulletins from somewhere deep inside a Washington dinner partyQuindlen is neither saucy nor one step ahead of the conventional wisdom buther virtues are ones that Culturebox suspects its unhealthy to do withoutShes substantive and stern shes loyal to husband and kids she makes peacenot war she favors oldfashioned horse sense over brilliance  To seeourselves as others see us was the line my grandmother would always throw outwhen she was crabby and I was full of myself is the sort of thing shes wontto declarewisely selfdeprecatingly and only somewhat preachily Cultureboxwould count herself lucky to have Anna Quindlen as a big sister though shedprobably throttle the girl after a year or two            Lets clear up another common misconception while were at it Bigsisterish though she may be Quindlens is not the voice of feminism in ourtime Its easy to mistake it for that and her critics generally do makingher a springboard for an attack on feminism in general She draws on her ownexperience thereby making the personal political and was for a long time theonly female voice on the white male Times OpEd page She favors whatone critic Karen Lehrman calls motherhood politicsshes for stuff thatsgood for kids and against stuff thats bad for them But feminism is anideology which is to say a relatively coherent intellectual position a set ofarguments attached to a political objective So weighty an agenda demands aconsistency Quindlen has not so far evinced Insofar as shes a feministshes a pop feministan Oprah or Lifetime feminist a cheerleader forwomen in all their travails But we read Quindlen if we do for her peppystyle and that emerges out of another tradition entirelynot the reformistrhetoric of Susan B Anthony and Betty Friedan but the homespun folksy andoften surprisingly liberal tones of an earlier era in American journalism whennewspaper editorialists and magazine editors and advice columnists elevated theanecdote of daily life to the status of gospel and did more than just aboutanyone else to invent our  th century idea of everydayness            In short Quindlen is a sentimentalist which is not an insult inCultureboxs book since to harden ones heart to sentimentalism is to takeoneself beyond the reach of much of American culture Some of those whosesensibility Quindlen shares happen be femaleAnn Landers Dear Abby and MaryWorth the wellcoiffed wellborn newspaper comicstrip heroine who has beendispensing sage advice to her less welladapted neighbors since  Butothers are male such as the author and illustrator who create Mary Worth anewevery day or George Horace Lorimer an editor of the old magazine theSaturday Evening Post and an aphorist whose nuggets of wisdom sounduncannily Quindlenesque Education is about the only thing lying around loosein the world and its about the only thing a fellow can have as much of heswilling to haul away is one of his more famous ones Another Quindlenlikefigure was William Allen White the great turnofthecentury editor of theEmporia Kansas Gazette  who deployed his awshucks tone to attackheartland knownothingism and populism but whose greatest column is widelyacknowledged to be his elegy to his daughter who died after she ran into alowhanging branch while riding a horse            Ann Landers and her sister believe in good behavior White believed in theimportance of humor dignity and not being provincial what does Quindlen feelstrongly about Editorials are supposed to be the literature of opinion butfor the key to Quindlens core beliefs you must turn to her novels These areas morally instructive in their way as the works of another far greatersentimentalist Harriet Beecher Stowe author of Uncle Toms Cabin Quindlens first novel Object Lessons  is a comingofage story aboutthe perils of letting others tell you what to do in life The homily isprovided bywho elsethe heroines best friends smart and unusually poisedbig sister Just remember that sometimes you drift into things and then youcant get out of them the sister advises the novels protagonist Not todecide is to decide One True Thing  the story of a woman who comeshome to take care of her dying mother and winds up accused of euthanasiaechoes that lesson but ups the ante If youre passive enough to let yourparents dump their problems on you they can darn near destroy your lifeQuindlens latest novel Black and Blue  makes the consequences ofletting someone else tell you what to do even more horrifyingly explicit Itsthe movieoftheweektype saga of woman on the run from her abusive husbandQuindlens message is clear You have to figure out who you are think foryourself take some responsibility for crying out loud            As convictions go its not the most original around but its not aterrible one either Quindlens first column in Newsweek is more of thesame This time the denmother persona is underscored by the photograph thataccompanies the piece of Quindlen with sensibly cropped hair The editorial isa sigh of disgust at the whole Brooklyn Museum mess Its slightly smarter thanmost on this subject with more of a sense of history she tosses the New YorkSociety for the Suppression of Vice into the mix But ah yes here comes thegrandmotherly language Oh for pitys sake here we go again Heres theliberal common sense In other news cops are being accused of savagerypriests of impropriety and thousands of children are failing in the New YorkCity schools And civic leaders both political and religious are using theirbully pulpits for this So what if Quindlens about a week late to the storyThe point is shes right as she usually is It wouldnt hurt us to eat ourfiber when she tells us to or to grow up either
