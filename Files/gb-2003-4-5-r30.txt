                    Background        Analysis of the initial draft of the human genome        revealed that  of the sequence is transposable elements            The expansion of the human genome that resulted        from the mobilization of these transposable elements        suggests they hold secrets of our evolution and increase        the plasticity and variation in our genome In some cases        transposable elements may have been domesticated by their        host to serve clear functional roles                    Most human transposable elements are        retrotransposons        Among the retrotransposons in the human genome is the        LINE L element A fulllength L insertion in the        genome is approximately  nucleotides long and consists        of a  untranslated region UTR two open reading frames        ORFs and a  UTR terminating in a polyA tail            The second ORF of L encodes three domains critical for L        propagation endonuclease EN     reverse        transcriptase RT      and a  terminal        zincfingerlike domain     The EN and RT nick a        target site in DNA and reverse transcribe L RNA        respectively to integrate into a new genomic locus               this process is known as targetsiteprimed        reverse transcription TPRT It is believed that the        tendency of EN to nick target DNA at the consensus        AATTTT exposes a Trich sequence to which the        polyA tail of an L transcripts can anneal thereby        priming reverse transcription        A new L        insertion is usually flanked by short direct repeats        derived from the target DNA locus upon L integration             these repeats are referred to as targetsite        duplications TSDs        The role of L in shaping the human genome is        unmistakable Not only does L sequence itself contribute        at least  megabases Mb to our genome  of the total        length     but copies of the         Alu and SVA transposable elements and        processed pseudogenes are also believed to have inserted        into the genome by borrowing the EN and RT proteins encoded        by L           In addition to        selfmobilization and mobilization of other transposable        elements Ls can also move unique flanking DNA sequence to        another locus in the genome in a process known as         transduction This occurs when an L transcript reads into        a portion of the downstream flanking sequence This         sequence becomes transduced along with the L sequence to        a new genomic locus a hypothesized cause of the        imprecision of the  end of the L transcript is the weak        polyadenylation signal in the L element     Clear        indications of  transduction have been documented in        cases where an L inserted into the dystrophin gene                    APC    and         CYBB     All these        diseaseproducing L insertions the boundaries of which        were defined by flanking TSDs contained novel sequences        downstream of the L sequence itself In addition it has        been suggested that the multiple copies of exon  of the        cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR        gene found in the human genome may have proliferated via        Lmediated transduction     In most of these cases        the progenitor L element could be identified on the basis        of the sequence of the transduced DNA segment        A proposed consequence of L  transduction is exon        shuffling       That is an exon downstream of an        L may be comobilized with that same L and inserted at a        new locus such that the exon is integrated into another        gene Moran         et al demonstrated this        experimentally in cultured cells by cloning a reporter gene        containing a splice acceptor downstream from the        polyadenylation signal of an intact L element            This engineered L retrotransposed into transcriptionally        active genomic loci allowing the comobilized reporter to        be expressed after being spliced into a transcript        expressed in these cells effectively creating a chimeric        mRNA            We have previously found that nearly  of recent L        insertions in the human genome have TSDs that are        consistent with  transduction     That is the         TSD of these Ls with transductionderived sequence        LTDs is preceded by a polyA tail and located up to        several hundred nucleotides downstream from the end of the        L  UTR      On the other hand standard L        insertions have TSDs that follow a polyA tail immediately        flanking the L sequence For L elements that have        transduced sequence sibling progenitor andor        descendant Ls can be identified by comparing the        transduced sequence to the sequence downstream of other L        elements in the genome        Using a recently developed algorithm TSDfinder              we have precisely identified L insertions in the        human genome whose sequence signature suggests an LTD We        then determined which of these transduced sequences shared        high similarity with one or more other genomic loci that        were also located immediately downstream of an L In this        way we built families of Ls potentially derived from the        same progenitor element We found that many potential        family members of LTDs were merely duplications         Bona fide transduced sequences were        analyzed for functional annotation such as coding regions        of genes in the human genome In studying the architecture        of the transduced sequences we found that only a        fraction had a recognizable polyadenylation signal For        some of the other transduced sequences in lieu of a        polyadenylation signal the pairwise alignment between the        presumed progenitor element plus its downstream sequence        and a descendant LTD ended in polyA or a related Arich        sequence These sequence structures may indicate internal        priming of the L RT at Arich tracts of a transcript        during the process of TPRT                    Results                  Finding LTDs          We used the RepeatMasker    and TSDfinder               programs to identify  L elements that had a          sequence structure consistent with  transduction in a          recent build of the human genome These Ls had TSDs at          least nine nucleotides long preceded by polyA they          were classified as LTDs on the basis of having at least           nucleotides of sequence between the end of the  UTR          and the start of the polyA tail that immediately          preceded the  TSD These LTDs represented  of all          Ls for which we were able to identify TSDs                              Identifying related Ls          For these transduced sequences to be legitimate          they had to be located downstream of another L elsewhere          in the genome Otherwise the mechanism for their          mobilization or duplication in the genome might not be          Ldependent To test for this we collected  kilobases          kb of sequence downstream from each  intact L that          we found in the genome     formatted this collection          of flanking sequences as a BLAST database     and          queried each putative transduced sequence against it see          Materials and methods          When a putative transduced sequence was found to be          very similar to the downstream sequence of another L in          the genome certain criteria had to be met in order to          merit further analysis First the two Ls could not be          on the same chromosome and adjacent otherwise the match          was likely to be trivial and due to shared sequence lying          downstream of both of the Ls Figure a Furthermore          the downstream sequences had to be equal to or greater          than  identical Figure b the length of the          alignment had to be equal to or greater than  of the          putative transduced sequence length Figure c and the          orientation of the matching downstream sequences with          respect to the upstream L had to be the same Figure          ad The start positions for both downstream sequences          in their pairwise alignment were required to be within           nucleotides of each other Figure e Finally if a          putative transduced sequence passed all these tests          we checked to ensure that it was not part of a segmental          duplication in the genome Figure f see Materials and          methods for details This step was necessary because Ls          can be and often are part of larger segmental          duplications in the genome in this case identity          between the downstream sequences of two such Ls cannot          be attributed to  transduction without significant          analysis by hand and the sequence identity will          generally continue well beyond the  TSD An inordinate          number of our putative LTDs were within genomic          duplications located on the Y chromosome whereas only          two such occurrences were found on the generich          chromosome  data not shown Generally the frequency          of duplications found on each chromosome was in agreement          with a previous study of segmental duplications in the          human genome sequence     Although exceptions to          some of the above criteria could be envisaged such that a          match to a putative transduced sequence could be          legitimate we settled on these conservative criteria to          winnow the results As outlined in Figure  this          analysis greatly reduced the number of robust LTDs          these remaining LTDs were considered           bona fide LTDs for the purposes          of this study          For our final analysis  families remained In the          case of families containing the Ls  and           both of these LTDs found the other as a family          member therefore the two families were consolidated into          a single family Table  family id  Furthermore we          observed some overlap in the families representing the          LTDs   and X We realized that           and  were duplicates and pooled them and          their family members into the X family family id           In the end we found a total of  families made up          of  L elements Table                           Families of L elements          The average size of the final highconfidence L          families was  members The length distribution of          these           bona fide transduced sequences is          shown in Figure  The vast majority of the transduced          sequences were less than  nucleotides and the median          length was  nucleotides          For each family of L elements we tried to determine          the relationship between the family members That is an          LTD is either a sibling of the other family members          found or it is the child of a progenitor element In          addition an LTD could be the progenitor of subsequent          LTDs giving rise to composite transduction events For          an L to be a           bona fide progenitor element of a          LTD it must be longer than or of the same length as          the L element of the LTD Furthermore in order to          have been transcribed and transposed to give rise to          progeny elements the progenitor L must in principle be          long enough to include the internal promoter in the           UTR The majority of Ls in the genome are  truncated              and over time a fulllength L may be disrupted          by mutation insertion of another transposable element          or other DNA rearrangements Consequently in our set of           families only  have a nearly fulllength candidate          for the progenitor element their family ids are                   and  Table  For the          remainder of the families although downstream sequences          were similar and TSDs marked the end of aligned          sequences the Ls in a given family were either shorter          than the L for which a transduced sequence was found or          too short to have been transcribed from the internal L          promoter This would imply that in many of our cases          Ls in a family are siblings that arose from the same          progenitor L          Four of the LTDs in our final set appeared to be          composite transpositions That is we identified an L          with downstream sequence that matched the proximal part          of the transduced sequence but we did not find any          sequence downstream from an L that matched the distal          end of the transduced sequence                          Functional annotation of the transduced          sequences          We next studied the location of all the transduced          sequences in Table on the set of annotated NT contigs          assembled at the National Center for Biotechnology          Information NCBI In particular we were interested to          see if any transduced sequences were annotated as an          exon lending direct support to the mechanism of          Lmediated exon shuffling       None of the          transduced sequences downstream of any of the L family          members in Table was annotated as an exonic sequence Of          the  sequences that make up these families  were          annotated as intronic sequences One of the sequences was          within  nucleotides of the start of an mRNA          annotation predicted by automated computational analysis          L id  and gene LOC that is similar to a          putative proteintyrosine phosphatase Thus it is          possible that this transduced sequence contributes          important regulatory elements to the promoter region          influencing the expression of this gene However it is          important to note that because our studies are confined          to relatively young elements with TSDs our failure to          identify such examples by no means rules out exon          shuffling by  transduction as a potentially important          evolutionary mechanism For example one such event          appears to have occurred  million years ago Mya          with exon  of           CFTR  the caveat being that there          is no L element upstream of this particular exon in           CFTR itself     In our          analysis we found three transduced sequences with          similarity to           CFTR exon  however two of them          were part of a segmental duplication and the third had a          nearby sequencing gap precluding assessment of its          duplication status                          Polyadenylation signals          To understand the mechanism by which our set of          transduced sequences were mobilized by an L we examined          them for a polyadenylation signal upstream of the          terminal polyA tail We manually inspected these          sequences for the presence of either AATAAA or ATTAAA          polyadenylation signals no more than  nucleotides          upstream of the polyA tail that preceded the  TSD              We were able to identify a polyadenylation signal          in  of our  examples of  transduction events Table          and Figure a          For five of the transduced sequences lacking a clear          polyadenylation signal the alignment between the          transduced sequence and family members ended at an          Arich sequence the  TSD of the transduction event          was found immediately downstream of this Arich sequence          in the DNA Figure b A similar sequence structure was          reported by Ovchinnikov           et al  for a transduction event              Several possible explanations for this sequence          structure are addressed in the Discussion One          explanation given by Ovchinnikov           et al     is that the          transcripts may have been internally primed at an Arich          sequence see Additional data file and     a          different type of internal priming is also required by a          current model for  inversion of Ls              If internal priming is a mechanism by which standard          L transcripts could be copied into the genome we would          expect to find truncated L elements in the genome          whose  ends coincide with internal Arich regions of          the L sequence To investigate this possibility we          analyzed a set of  L insertions in the human          genome     The  end positions of these Ls were          pooled into bins of  nucleotides along the L sequence          and their distribution is shown in Figure  The          proportion of As in each nucleotide bin of the L          reference sequence is also shown The great majority of          L sequences had an intact  end and we observed no          clear trend of premature  ends that correspond to          Arich tracts in the L sequence          It is possible that the L sequence has evolved to          avoid long internal tracts of As in order to prevent          internal priming of the transcript The L consensus          sequence has a  A content not including the  UTR          We calculated the probability of finding an          eightnucleotidelong tract of As in a DNA sequence with          such a sequence composition is  However the longest          stretch of As found in the L reference sequence is          seven probability of  and there are four such          tracts          Finally we observed that for two of the LTDs that          do not have a polyadenylation signal the sequence that          the TSDfinder program defined as the polyA tail is          patterned that is the tail is composed of Arich          simple repeats for example AAATAAAT     Since          these polyA tails themselves contain polyadenylation          signals it is possible that their assignments as polyA          tails are false positives and the real tail formed by          polyadenylation has shortened over time and is not          detectable       Four of the remaining LTDs          for which no polyadenylation signal was found appeared to          result from multiple sequential transduction events we          did not have family members that align with the  end of          the transduced sequence to determine whether the polyA          stretch could have been encoded in DNA                            Discussion        In this study we used computational methods to analyze        human Ls whose sequence structure was consistent with         transduction The vast majority of these putative LTDs        could not be thoroughly evaluated for family members        because of gaps in the genome sequence excessive        repetitive DNA content sequence duplications and other        practical limitations Therefore we are unable to        calculate the overall rate of transduction events Of the        putative  transduced sequences   lacked        detectable BLAST hits in our database of sequences        downstream from Ls Possible reasons for this are first        that the sequence is unique in the human genome and was        never  transduced false positive second that the        sequence has a counterpart in the unsequenced portion of        the human genome third the loss of the fulllength        progenitor L due to recombination     or fourth that        the progenitor L sequence suffered from extensive        mutations that precluded its detection as a  intact L        and therefore the downstream sequence was not included in        our BLAST database        It is surprising how few of the examples of putative        LTDs can be directly verified by finding either        progenitorprogeny or sibling pairs This can be understood        by considering the facts that the human population is        highly outbred and L elements are preferentially         cis acting      Progenitor        elements for LTDs must be transpositionally competent and        thus are likely to be relatively young Their youth means        that they are likely to be present in the human population        in an unfixed heterozygous state and in a relatively        small population Once such an element spawns a progeny        element the progenitor element as well as the progeny        element has a high likelihood of extinction due to genetic        drift the donor and the progeny elements will be separated        from each other by outcrossing see    for further        discussion Alternatively Boissinot         et al have hypothesized that        fulllength L elements may be selectively removed from the        genome by recombination and thus not be found            We were unable to build families around a high        proportion of our initial LTDs because of their residence        in duplicated genomic regions This finding is consistent        with data showing an abundance of both interchromosomal and        intrachromosomal duplications in the human genome            It is unclear how many of these duplications are due to        errors in genome assembly and how many represent authentic        segmental duplications correctly assembling duplications        as a genuine landscape features of the genome sequence is a        formidable informatics challenge     In the future as        better more accurate genome builds become available        particularly with regard to the presence of duplications        and other rearrangements and the annotation of genes and        their promoter regions becomes more thorough and correct        it will be important to repeat this study for the whole        genome sequence        Although in a relatively recent genome build we did not        find any clear examples of transduced exons we did find        one transduced sequence located less than  kb upstream        from a putative gene This particular transduced sequence        could contribute to the regulatory regions of that gene To        find examples of exons shuffled via L retrotransposition        an analysis similar to the method we used in this study may        have to be performed with older subfamilies of Ls        According to RepeatMasker annotation all the LTDs in        Table are of a primatespecific lineage and it is        believed that the ancestral primate genome the structure        of which is thought to be very similar to the modern human        genome existed  Mya     Thus at the earliest        point in time that we can reliably detect intact L        elements most human genes may have been largely        established That is older Ls and older families of LINEs        may have had more influence on the exon composition of        genes which themselves are generally rather old        Nevertheless until more complete genome sequences are        available for comparative genomic analyses we can only        speculate on the mechanism by which genes have been        altered sometimes contributing to the formation of a new        species Furthermore although GC and generich regions        generally lack Ls     it has been hypothesized that at        any given time during the evolution of the human genome        Ls have inserted randomly but over time they have been        selected against in GCrich regions     If this is        true it may be difficult to find evidence in our genome of        Lmediated exon shuffling        Some Ls with transduced sequence lack a        polyadenylation signal but a common stretch of As delineate        the end of an alignment between family members Figure b        One explanation for this sequence structure is that the        transcripts were polyadenylated at the same location and        the polyadenylation signal mutated beyond recognition after        the insertion event occurred interestingly Ovchinnikov         et al  reported that polyadenylation        signals tend to degrade rapidly after L insertion            A second explanation is that the polyA sequence is        encoded in DNA and either the transcript was degraded up to        the position of the Arich sequence or RNA polymerase II        failed to elongate the message past the Arich sequence        the resulting transcript would then resemble one that had        been polyadenylated Alternatively there may be a        propensity for the L transcript to break at Arich        sequences resulting in an Arich  end that would mimic a         polyadenylated transcript        Interestingly a recently proposed mechanism of         inversion of L elements requires that firststrand cDNA        synthesis be primed internally on the L transcript            Therefore it is possible that the cDNA synthesis of a        transducing transcript may also be primed at an internal        Arich site as suggested by Ovchinnikov         et al     see Additional data        file Since the L EN consensus site is AATTTT the        first cut would expose a Trich sequence on the target        sequence from which an Arich template could be primed for        reverse transcription Indeed the TSDs for the        transduction events that lack a polyadenylation signal        are Arich at their  ends Table  indicating that the        target site at which priming occurred would have been        Trich        We did not find evidence of internal priming for        standard L insertions predicted to produce  truncated L        elements with well defined endpoints Rather L elements        that are  truncated were mostly interrupted by insertions        of another transposable element Lack of internal priming        on a standard L transcript may be due to interference by        the L ORF protein that has been reported to bind        specifically to L RNA     Moreover it is possible        that the L transcript has a secondary structure that would        inhibit an Arich region from being available as a template        for reverse transcription whereas a  tail on the L        transcript especially if derived from transduced sequence        may be much more accessible Finally in the L sequence        minus the  UTR the length of the longest internal        Atract seven nucleotides is shorter than would be        expected by random chance Thus L may have evolved        multiple mechanisms to avoid internal priming on Arich        tracts which would generate defective elements while        allowing it to occur in the flanking sequences where        polyadenylation signals might or might not be found                    Materials and methods                  Identifying LTDs          The human genomic DNA sequence records used were the          set of contigs assembled at the NCBI    as of           August  build  L elements in the contigs were          annotated using RepeatMasker    with a custom library          containing only the L element GenBank accession          number L in this way we dealt primarily with          young L elements     The TSDfinder program               was run on the RepeatMasker out output files in          order to find the TSDs of the L elements thereby          refining the L boundaries Each time a  intact L          insertion was found no more than  nucleotides missing          from the  end of the  UTR the  kb of sequence          downstream from the L was collected A total of           such kb sequences were collected These sequences were          placed into a file and formatted as a BLAST database          formatdb parameters n ThrPrSeqDB p F V T o T          During the same run of the TSDfinder program LTDs          were identified To be classified as an LTD the          distance between the end of the L  UTR and the start          of the  TSD had to be greater than  nucleotides not          counting the length of the polyA tail preceding the TSD          nor the number of nucleotides missing from the end of the          L  UTR according to the RepeatMasker annotation of the          L element The classification of an L insertion as an          LTD was only allowed when a  TSD closer to the L          indicating a standard insertion event could not be found          see       The coordinates of the candidate          transduced regions the gi record and the begin and end          coordinates were stored for later analysis                          Analyzing putative transduced sequences          Transduced sequences were masked to avoid multiple          ambiguous matches The masking was accomplished using the          default settings of RepeatMasker    parameter          xsmall For   of the  LTDs the          putative transduced sequence was nearly completely          masked The blastn program    was run for the          putative transduced sequences against ThrPrSeqDB          parameters d ThrPrSeqDB e  J T U T F m DR          Z  By doing so we ensured that any significant          match in the genome was also downstream of a potential          progenitor L for any particular transduced sequence          A series of Perl scripts was used to examine the BLAST          results see rationale in Figure  To test for          duplications the  kb of downstream sequence for each          putative LTD and the potentially related Ls          identified by BLAST were collected These sequences were          input into blseq    parameters g T F m DR S           e  X  q  If the alignment between the          sequences extended beyond the end of the putative          transduced sequence the sequence was labeled as a          duplication and was not analyzed any further Some          sequences were removed from analysis because of nearby          sequencing gaps that precluded a conclusion regarding the          duplication status Finally for some alignments produced          by blseq the alignment was less than  identical or          was considered too poor an alignment to continue further          analysis with that particular set of Ls          The duplication status could not be properly assessed          for  of the initial putative transduced sequences and          they were consequently removed from consideration One          reason for ambiguity of the duplication status was gaps          in the genome sequence if either the query or the          subject L had a stretch of more than  Ns in the  kb          of downstream flanking sequence indicating a gap in          genome sequence these were excluded from the analysis          because they tended to interfere with the assessment of          duplication and confound the automatic analysis No proof          of mapping to a genomic duplication was detected for           of the  initial  transduction candidates and their          respective family members These  families were made up          of  total members The DNA sequence of each member of          these families was collected and multiple alignments          among the family members were performed using the          clustalx and GeneDoc software       Manual          inspection of the alignment of the family member          sequences revealed that  of these families had more          than  members and it was immediately clear that the          matches with the putative transduced sequences in these          families were based solely on patchy alignments of          largely lowcomplexity sequence For the remaining           families  were eliminated because of lowcomplexity          matches only largely polyA sequence or previously          missed duplications in the  flank One of the families          was eliminated because both L elements were full length          yet one of them had a nucleotide insertion in its           UTR and the other did not indicating that these Ls were          not directly related      Finally for nine          families although alignment of transduced sequence          with a family member was clearly delineated by the           TSD we found sequence duplication in the  flank of the          Ls These families with Ls exhibiting identity in the           flank were eliminated from further analysis as the          Ls may represent the same insertion event that was part          of a segmental duplication in the genome whose endpoint          happened to coincide with the  TSD          GenBank headers of the appropriate gi record NT          contigs were checked for whether the final           bona fide transduced sequences were          included in the annotation of any mRNA or CDS                          Adenine content of Ls          The Ls used to generate the data in Figure represent          all Ls that were found in the human genome using          RepeatMasker    with the L sequence as a custom          library see     To calculate the probability that          the length of a stretch of pure A nucleotides in the L          sequence was less than           y
