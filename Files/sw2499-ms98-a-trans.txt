        and all right what have you seen   okay the latest movie ive seen that i thought was fantastic was Dances With Wolves   thats i knew you were going to say that i wanted i want to go see that   oh man i i just finally ended up going to see it uh and  one day my husband had the kids and i just went because we couldnt we could never get to go see it together because its so long by the time we had a  babysitter for that long   gosh   so i finally just went to see it and i just thought it was fantastic   yeah i i i watched uh Costner on the Academy Awards i was really happy that he got i was hoping he was going to get Best Actor uh but he he he did pretty good on that one   yeah yeah that was quite a the buffalo scene in that thing was so real its like  i mean it just blew me away   yeah yeah id i bet yeah there several of them that are out right now that i want to see uh Dances uh Silence of the Lambs   yeah uh im im afraid to go see that one that one looks so scary just from the previews i thought gosh id probably have nightmares for the next six months   nah nah nah i mean thats what people   its supposed to be good though i know some friends who went to see it   yeah   they said it was really riveting   yeah well you know they they thats what they said about The Exorcist you know no no its terrible youll have nightmares you know i watched last weekend me and my roommate we we laughed about it   well youre not a thirteen year old i dont know i saw it when i was a kid and i thought oh man     well ill tell well i guess i i guess it was because id read the book before i saw the movie   oh uhhuh   and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was yeah hes a very good writer and he had a way of putting you in that scene you know it was   oh really huh gosh oh boy   yeah and of course i was i was living alone at the time and it was late at night and scary and  you know  you start hearing noises you know   oh gosh call the crisis line yeah i bet   and theres rats in the attic you know   oh gosh   uh lets see there was a couple of others that are out and i cant remember   i saw one i thought was crummy with that new uh Michael J Fox movie The Hard Way where he plays a a actor thats uh like the huh   yeah i i didnt i didnt even like the previews on that   oh i know it was well i ended up at the theater and there was didnt seem to be anything else on  i wanted to see so ill try that but it wasnt worth anything i didnt care for that at all     no i i dont much care for Michael J Fox anyway   yeah well the last two i saw him in one of those Back to the Future Part Three deals and that was crummy also i didnt think that was any good so   yeah i saw the original Back to the Future and then i i know i hardly ever go see a sequel   yeah   i mean i think i think the only ive ever seen a sequel was Two Thousand and One   oh boy   uh Two Thousand and Ten was far better   yeah yeah   Two Thousand and One was a good movie if you had read the book   well i hadnt read it and i couldnt figure what was going on half the time so   yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean the the book was so much uh theres just things all you can do is put it in words you cant put it in pictures and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you could say what is this   yeah yeah yeah     you know whats the significance of the apes you know   yeah yeah i should probably go back and read the book now  that i just saw the movie again not too long ago   oh the book is really good i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again and thats one of them its its so well written   wow huh huh huh well i have one i bet you havent seen if you dont have kids Otis and Milo   oh youre right i havent   oh that is that is the most precious movie it has was to see it on the big screen because its just the most gorgeous nature scenes youve ever seen in your life and its all this its the story of this little cat and dog and its not like cutesy its just uh its just so realistic everything they do you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things and it was   huh oh those a real dog and cat huh   a real dog and cat and all the other animals they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where theyre raised and then the cat gets um on this treacherous journey he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river and he winds up all over creation i dont know where in the world it is somewhere in China somewhere i think that it was filmed   huh   but uh its just really an incredible thing   sounds sounds sort of like The Incredible Journey   yeah it was pretty wild  and of course the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it   uhhuh   but theres no you know nothing else  to keep it going but it really keeps   huh   keeps me going i ive seen it twice now   yeah that that sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film   huh yeah it was like the best of the Walt Disney ones Walt Disneys kind of gotten worse in my opinion in the past few years   oh yeah not anymore i mean i i i was raised on Walt Disney films you know   yeah   Old Yeller uh Big Red   yeah all those old good ones that you you know wish they had on more now but   yeah when i was a little kid i saw The Incredible Journey on Christmas Eve and it was so good   oh boy hm   it was so good that i had forgotten that it was Christmas Eve i mean thats something for a kid   thats pretty good really   and that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time ill tell you     lets see what are some other ones ive seen lately im trying to remember i cant oh i just saw one on the video oh um have you seen The Gods Must Be Crazy Part Two   no   that is a riot yeah the first one was really good but the second one  is really good too i was really surprised   is it   yeah i didnt much care for the first one maybe thats   no i thought it was funny but thats my sense of humor i guess   well i ill have to go get that one i guess     its hard to find movies that arent terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore and im just i guess im just middl e America or something i just go to be entertained and   yeah its its   and not really interested in some of the like the Terminator or some of the Schwarzenegger  stuff i just   yeah i i get so tired of you know these you know sequels number nine number ten number fourteen   yeah Freddys Revenge Part Twenty Five  or whatever   yeah you know yeah you know Freddy Eats a Nuclear Warhead you know i im just   yeah i never yeah   i im so sick and tired of that i just cant believe it its like Rocky films i i havent seen a one i cant stand Stallone   yeah yeah ive never seen any of those yeah i cant either he seems so macho i just   yeah and i i was afraid that Rambo was going to do the same thing that Rocky was going to do you know go into fourteen hundred episodes   yeah yeah   now i dont i hardly ever watch TV if i ever get the hankering to see something ive got i dont know maybe about thirty or forty movies and i just   yeah when theyre so cheap too at the video stores that you can   yeah i dont even rent them you know i i figure if i find a movie i like ill buy it because i just watch them over and over again   thats like my husband does that he can watch them over and over and im theres very few i would want to see that many times so he he once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over   yeah i yeah my my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh Excalibur i i loved that film um   oh yeah that was a good one i havent seen that one in a long time   its just so well done and i lived over in England for four years that was the first place i ever saw it and it was just gosh it was so good   yeah oh boy uhhuh   it was it was filmed in Ireland   oh huh   and they got pretty scenery in Ireland yeah its nice   yeah i bet gosh   and i ive been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthurs castle was   oh boy so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that   yeah it was yeah it was unimpressive to look at i mean the whole thing was about the size of a a medium house  yeah it wasnt no   oh really well when i was in England years ago and i went to to like Shakespeares and you know StratfordOnAvon and all that  and it was like you couldnt stand up inside of it because it was so short the ceilings were so short but   oh yeah yeah yeah yeah theres some nice stuff over there to see i i spent four years traveling around and didnt see you know hardly anything i just   yeah yeah oh boy   i need to go over there and stay about twenty years so i can just travel go around all the places Stonehenge of course you know every everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge   yeah yeah yeah   okay big deal heres some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field okay  its boring   did you see any movies over there  i remember i went to see Don Quixote over there when it came out it came out right around the time with Sophia Loren       and that was a riot to see that   you know something i come to think of it i dont think i went to the movies one time   yeah because when youre touristing you probably dont want to take the time to   i uh where i lived uh it was a little town called Newmarket   go see a movie but   about seventy miles north of London and there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us and they had a little uh theater company   huh oh boy uhhuh   there and we use to go go out to that about once a week yeah a really nice place you know amateurs but really quite good uh but that was interesting course used to   oh boy yeah that sounds great   go to London quite a lot and see shows down there   yeah   uh but other than that i just didnt have time to go to the movies you know   yeah   never show any anyway anything that i ever wanted i rented a lot of videos  because the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds and who wants who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies   uhhuh oh boy   probably some of them did   a lot of a lot of people did but it would have to be a good show   yeah its hard to know what the good movies are anymore because sometimes the reviews you just cant go by and   yeah yeah i i use they they they have all these neat phrases you know you know you know like critically acclaimed thats what they when the thing hasnt won any award   yeah   oh i see   you know they cant   its kind of like waterfront property or something if youre you know if youre two miles away from water   yeah yeah yeah from Love Canal   water view   waterfront property here at Love Canal you know   yeah   but you know critically acclaimed oh good grief give me a break       thats what i mean theres a lot of reasons why i dont go to movies and primarily i mean i now im probably going to going to upset you but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me   uhhuh
