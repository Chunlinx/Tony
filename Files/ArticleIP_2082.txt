                                 Clintons Medicare Cuts            During the first presidential and vicepresidential debates Bob Dole and Jack Kemp were hit by Medicare attacks fromBill Clinton and Al Gore some  times Thats an average of one Medicareattack every four minutes            Doles sins Not only did hewant to slash  billion from the programmore than needed to protect theMedicare trust fundhe wanted to hike premiums force seniors to pay moreout of pocket for care and push them into managed care Dole and House SpeakerNewt Gingrich the president and vice president said wanted Medicare towither on the vine All these were as Gore put it on Meet the Pressrecently extremist measures that would have devastated Medicare            Thank God Clinton was thereto stop it            Doleslimp response was that he would honor his mothers word not to cut Medicare Heneednt be so defensive Three years ago Clinton himself proposed basically thesame package of reforms for Medicarea fact everyone seems to have forgottensince it was embedded in his massive illfated Health Security Act Heres therundown                           Big Cuts vs Slower Growth  Considerthis exchange in the veep debate            Jack KempThe president himself suggested that the reduction in the growth of Medicareover the next five or six years ought to be held to  percent Under theRepublican plan irrespective of the numbers it will grow at  or even morepercent            Al Gore I think Mr Kemphas unintentionally made a mistake in saying that President Clinton called fora reduction to  percent  It is not the presidents position            Nobody bothered to check outthis one But the fact is that in  Clinton boasted he could cut Medicaregrowth to  percent while protecting the program            Heres Clinton speaking tothe American Association of Retired Persons in October that year TodayMedicaid and Medicare are going up at three times the rate of inflation Wepropose to let it go up at two times the rate of inflation Given that priceswere expected to climb  percent a year Clinton meant  percent growth forMedicare            That is not a Medicare orMedicaid cut he reassured seniors So when you hear all this business aboutcuts let me caution you that that is not what is going on We are going tohave increases in Medicare and Medicaid and a reduction in the rate ofgrowth            A draft summary of the HealthSecurity Act released in September of  contained a chart showingprojected growth for Medicare slowing to less than  percent by  and lessthan  percent by  And in its independent review of the Clinton planhealthcare consulting firm LewinVHI noted that the act attempts to slow thegrowth in public and private health spending to the rate of growth in the CPIplus an allowance for population growth That puts Medicare growth at justover  percent a year            Far from devastating thisslowdown was the White House said at the time good for seniors Ira Magazinertold a press briefing that slowing the rate of growth actually benefitsbeneficiaries considerably because it slows the rate of growth of the premiumsthey have to pay            But looked at in the termsthe White House uses today Clinton was proposing cuts in Medicare spendingbeyond the  billion Republicans dared propose            Like theGOP plan Clinton wanted to take a big chunk of savings from Medicareprovidersdoctors and hospitalsby cutting back payments to them                           More Cuts Than Needed  At one pointClinton warned that the GOP cuts were more than was necessary to repair theMedicare trust fund The implied political point was that Medicare cuts weregoing to pay for tax cuts for the rich            Clintons Health SecurityAct however also cut Medicare more than was needed to repair the trust fundMost of the savings from Medicare were to be plowed back into new federalhealth programs As the Congressional Budget Office put it Reductions inMedicare spending would provide a major part of the funding for theAdministrations proposal More than a quarter of it by White Housecalculations                           Raise Costs toSeniors  Several times during the debates Clinton and Gore said that theRepublicans Medicarereform plan would have boosted costs to seniors Itwould have charged seniors more for outofpocket costs as well as more inpremiums Clinton said at one point            Under Clintons HealthSecurity Act more than a quarter of the savings came out of the hides ofseniors They were to be charged higher premiums for Medicare Part B theprogram that covers physician services New copayments were to be added forsome Medicare services that are now  percent covered Over six years thosecosts to seniors would have totaled  billion            To besure Clinton concentrated the premium hikes for Part B on thewelltodothose seniors earning  a year or more The rest would payonly a quarter of the premium cost with taxpayers picking up the rest The GOPset the contribution rate at just under onethird of the full cost but theyalso means tested the premiums so that seniors with incomes over would pay a bigger chunk                           Push Seniors Into Managed Care  SenDoles Medicare plan  would have forced a lot of seniors into managed careClinton said Thats something of a misrepresentation The GOP plan would haveexpanded the managedcare options open to seniors and encouraged them to takeit Today seniors can stick with Medicare or opt for Health MaintenanceOrganization HMO coverage with the government ponying up the premiums TheGOP plan would have opened that door to the rest of the alphabet soup ofprivate managedcare plans such as preferredprovider organizationspointofservice plans and physician hospital organizations            So would Clintons reforms and even his more recent Medicare proposals One section in his HealthSecurity Act was titled Encouraging Managed Care Under Medicare ProgramClintons current reform proposal suggests expanding managedcare options forseniors The only difference between the Republicans and Clinton on this scoreis that the GOP wanted to give seniors one extra optionto enroll in amedical savings account plan            Bothparties used basically the same regulatory machinery to try to make their planswork in the market without creating a huge adverse selectionproblemhealthier seniors opting into lowercost plans The Republicansmachinery in fact was borrowed almost verbatim from Clintons planwhich ina double twist the GOP had previously attacked as unworkable                           Let Medicare Wither on the Vine Clintontwice said that Medicare would wither on the vine under Republican reformsThe reference is to a comment by House Speaker Newt Gingrich who said that theGOP wanted the Medicare bureaucracy to wither on the vine as seniorsopted for the private plans But the quote has been misused by Democrats eversince            In any case Clinton alsoforecast the decline of the Medicare bureaucracy New retirees under his HealthSecurity Act would be able to stick with the plan they had when they workedThe government would pay the premiums instead of the employer Current retireescould choose a private managedcare plan According to the Congressional BudgetOffice Clintons plan would have moved nearly  million seniors from Medicareinto private plans in  alone            To be fair the White Housewanted to sweeten the Medicare pot at the same time it was making these cuts byadding a prescriptiondrug benefit            It has also claimed sincethat its proposed cuts in Medicare were acceptable because they were in thecontext of universal health care reform But that wasnt the argument it madeat the time Hillary Rodham Clinton told a Senate panel in  that savings inMedicare were easy because we have too many examples now of how it can be donebetter at lower costs with the same or better quality and thats what werecounting on
