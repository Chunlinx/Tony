                    Background        The prostate gland is part of the male genitalia and its        function is to secrete fluid that is released with the        ejaculate during copulation The prostate surrounds the        urethra just distal to the urinary bladder and proximal to        the external urethral sphincter    and is composed of        smooth muscle and secretory alveoli Nervous innervation of        the prostate is believed to be mainly sympathetic            These nerves descend through the hypogastric nerves and        synapse on postganglionic neurons in the pelvic plexus        major pelvic ganglion in the rat from which the prostate        receives direct innervation The sympathetic nervous        innervation is split into two portions postganglionic        adrenergic nerves that synapse on blood vessels and the        smooth muscle that surround the alveoli and sympathetic        cholinergic nerves that innervate the glandular epithelium        Thus control of prostatic secretion is mediated by a        sympathetic cholinergic pathway Evidence for        parasympathetic innervation of the prostate is present but        its function is largely unknown Speculation suggests some        form of control of the volume or composition of the        secretion     There is also evidence for the presence        of periprostatic ganglia and capsular ganglia respectively        outside and inside the prostatic capsule    but not much        is known about their pharmacology or function        The urinary bladder functions to store and expel urine            It has both sympathetic and parasympathetic        innervation The parasympathetic innervation arises from        preganglionic neurons located in the distal lumbar and        proximal sacral spinal cord segments L and S in the rat             and whose axons are found in the pelvic nerve and        synapse on postganglionic neurons in the pelvic plexus        Parasympathetic impulses are the main excitatory influence        and contract the bladder causing emptying The sympathetic        innervation is mainly concerned with the storage function        of the bladder            Thus there is major and fundamentally different        innervation of the bladder and the prostate However in        humans the prostate can affect the micturition function        since when a man ages and the prostate enlarges it        constricts the urethral lumen This condition is commonly        known as benign prostatic hypertrophy and seriously affects        the micturition function of the bladder Although the        effect of prostatic enlargement on the bladder is primarily        mechanical it is possible that in time it might also alter        the neuronal circuitry that mediates micturition In view        of the aforementioned considerations and despite prior        knowledge about the separate functions and innervation of        these two organs we thought it worthwhile to examine the        neuroanatomical organization of the bladder and the        prostate simultaneously within a single venue We undertook        this study to answer questions not previously addressed by        other investigations namely  Are the lumbosacral        parasympathetic and sympathetic preganglionic neurons that        innervate the bladder different from those that innervate        the prostate or to what extent do they dually innervate        these organs  Are the lumbosacral interneurons that are        part of the pathways innervating these two organs separate        groups of interneurons or do they participate in the        innervation of the two organs  Are the supraspinal        areas involved in innervating these organs separate or do        they contribute to the innervation of these two organs To        do this we have employed the unique technique of two        immunohistochemically distinguishable pseudorabies viruses        which will simultaneously be injected one to each organ        as neuroanatomical tracers to determine each of the central        nervous system distributions                         Results                  Major pelvic ganglion          The major pelvic ganglion contains the postganglionic          neurons that innervate both the urinary bladder and the          prostate Therefore these neurons are the first neurons          to be labeled by virus arriving from either of the          injected organs Figure depicts bladder and prostate          neurons in the major pelvic ganglion three days post          infection The neurons labeled by virus from the prostate          were larger than those that were labeled by virus from          the bladder Also shown are adrenergic prostate neurons          that were stained by the antiserum to tyrosine          hydroxylase as well as prostate neurons that are not          adrenergic A count of these prostate neurons revealed          that only  were adrenergic                          Spinal cord          The different categories of labeled neurons were B          neurons labeled by virus injected into the urinary          bladder P neurons labeled by virus injected into the          prostate BChAT or BCh neurons labeled by virus          injected into the urinary bladder that were also          cholinergic PChAT or PCh neurons labeled by virus          injected into the prostate that were also cholinergic          DBL neurons labeled by both viruses no doublelabeled          neurons were also cholinergic The areas in which these          different categories of neurons were located are IML          intermediolateral area DGC dorsal gray commissure SDH          superficial dorsal horn Note that all cholinergic          neurons BChAT and PChAT were considered to be          preganglionic neurons Viruslabeled neurons that were          not also cholinergic were by definition          interneurons          Viruslabeled neurons in lumbosacral spinal cord first          appeared  days postinfection Table and Figures           and display the means and standard errors of numbers of          labeled neurons found in the LL and LS segments of          the spinal cord as a function of incubation time The          table and figures demonstrate the following points           There were many more neurons labeled by the virus          from the bladder than by the virus from the prostate          Virus from the bladder labeled a mean total of           neurons The majority of these  were found in          LS Virus from the prostate labeled a total of           neurons The majority of these  were found in          LL           There were few doublelabeled neurons  They          were found after  days in LL and LS with the          majority in LS They were located in the dorsal gray          commissure DGC and the intermediolateral area IML          with the majority in DGC The doubles were exclusively          interneurons No preganglionic neurons were doubles           Neurons located in the superficial dorsal horn           were only labeled from injections into the bladder          and were only found in LS Figure A and only after           days           With increasing incubation time more neurons of all          types were labeled Table and Figures and  These          increases occurred mainly through the labeling of larger          numbers of interneurons For example in LL the number          of interneurons prostate  bladder at  days was           The number of interneurons at  days was  an          increase by a factor of about  These are to be          compared to the numbers of preganglionic cholinergic          neurons prostate  bladder of  at  days and           at  days an increase by a factor of only  The mean          total number of interneurons was  compared to the mean          number of all labeled neurons of           The corresponding numbers in LS were  at           days  at  days for the interneurons and  at           days and  at  days for the preganglionic          cholinergic neurons The mean total number of          interneurons was  compared to a total number of          labeled neurons of           Doublelabeled neurons were found in the cord in the          dorsal gray commissure and intermediolateral regions          DGCIML Preganglionic neurons labeled by virus from          the prostate were only found in the LL cord and were          divided between the DGC and the IML with the larger          fraction in the DGC No preganglionic neurons innervating          the prostate were found in LS Preganglionic neurons          labeled by virus from the bladder were mainly found in          the LS cord and mainly IML Some were located in LL

three days post          infection Viruslabeled bladder neurons red were          mainly located in the LS whereas viruslabeled          prostate neurons green were mainly located in LL          Also shown are non viruslabeled cholinergic neurons          blue located mainly in the ventral horn and the          intermediolateral areas          Figure displays photomicrographs of viruslabeled and

     In the brain labeled virus neurons first appeared four          days postinfection Labeled neurons were found in the          raphe nuclei gigantocellular reticular nucleus A          adrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus sub coeruleus          Barringtons nucleus periaquaductal gray red nucleus          paraventricular nucleus lateral thalamus and medial          preoptic area Approximately equal numbers of bladder and          prostate neurons were found in all locations except for          Barringtons nucleus and the medial preoptic area The          later two regions contained mainly neurons labeled by          virus from the bladder and only a few labeled by virus          from the prostate Figure displays examples of          viruslabeled bladder and prostate neurons from five of          these areas Many neurons labeled from the bladder or          prostate were found in the raphe nuclei the A          adrenergic nucleus the locus coeruleus and the          paraventricular nucleus In each of these areas there          were examples of doubly labeled neurons In the red          nucleus not shown mainly neurons labeled by virus from          the bladder were observed with only a few labeled by          virus from the prostate                            Discussion        The use of two immunohistochemically distinguishable        viruses allows one to detect central nervous system        neurons within a single tissue section that were labeled        by both viruses and therefore to examine the possibility of        interactions between the two organs that have been        injected        One consideration that must be addressed concerns the        rates of infection along the routes traveled by the two        viruses used in these experiments Although precise        experiments designed to address this question have not been        published preliminary results in our laboratory        demonstrate that the two viruses infect the same neurons at        about the same rate Therefore until more precise data is        available we shall assume that these rates are the same        and that therefore numbers of neurons in a particular        location infected by the viruses can be compared        A second question concerns whether both viruses can        simultaneously infect a single neuron This point has not        been directly addressed in specific experiments but        previously published works       have demonstrated        examples of double labeled neurons in brain and spinal        cord We shall therefore assume that there is some proof        that responds to this point        In general neurons that are associated with the prostate        or the bladder were found in those areas intermediolateral        and dorsal gray commissure known to be associated with        autonomic function        The first neurons to be labeled from either the bladder        or the prostate were located in the major pelvic ganglion        There were no pelvic ganglion neurons infected by both        viruses Seventy seven percent of those that were        associated with the prostate were also adrenergic as would        be expected since the prostate is under sympathetic        control This compares to  reported by Keast    in        her study of fluorogoldlabeled rat prostate neurons The        remaining  could also receive their innervation from the        hypogastric nerve but in addition could be cholinergic        thus representing a sympatheticcholinergic pathway that        might be related to the production of prostatic fluid            However there is evidence for cholinergic fibers           and muscarinic receptors on the epithelial tissue        surrounding the alveolar lumens    supporting this        concept        The main finding in this experiment is that the CNS        distribution of bladder is different from the prostate In        the spinal cord the LL segments cells were mainly        labeled by virus from the prostate As shown in Table         there were few prostate preganglionic neurons located in        the LS segments at any time points This is        understandable since the prostate is mainly under        sympathetic control The report by Keast    of prostate        neurons in the major pelvic ganglion contacted by fibers        running in the pelvic nerve suggests though only        indirectly that these come from preganglionic neurons in        the intermediolateral region of the LS spinal cord and        that therefore more such neurons labeled by the virus        injected into the prostate should have been found We do        not have an explanation of why we did not see more prostate        preganglionic neurons in LS However a recent report            demonstrated the existence of afferent fibers that        contacted the postganglionic neurons in the major pelvic        ganglion Therefore there is evidence that fibers other        than those from sacral preganglionic neurons contact these        neurons and additional investigation is needed to        completely resolve the question        The bladder receives its major innervation from the        LS segments and that is where most of the preganglionic        neurons labeled by virus from the bladder were found There        were only a relatively small number of doublelabeled        interneurons The majority of these were found in the LS        segments In the brain all areas examined except for two        contained cells labeled by the bladder virus or the        prostate virus and there were always a few that were        labeled by both viruses There was no area that was        specifically labeled by the virus that was injected into        the prostate Barringtons nucleus contained mainly cells        infected by bladder virus These neurons directly innervate        the preganglionic neurons in the sacral parasympathetic        nucleus that supply the excitatory impulses to the bladder        and are among the first neurons in the brain to be labeled        from the spinal cord Our present findings do not agree        with previous published results     which demonstrate        labeling of Barringtons nucleus by virus from the        prostate In those studies the virus used was the Bartha        strain of pseudorabies virus that is more virulent than the        viruses used in the current work     It is possible        that the Bartha strain results in a much more extensive        labeling of central structures and demonstrates that if a        long enough time elapses from the initial infection to the        time of observation many brain structures will be labeled        For example pseudorabies virus injected into the trachea           labeled neurons in Barringtons nucleus after an        incubation time of six to seven days and pseudorabies virus        injected into the pancreas    labeled neurons in        Barringtons nucleus after an incubation time of six days        This demonstrates the importance of following the spread of        virus as a function of time carefully to find those areas        that are labeled first The second area that did not        receive any virus from the prostate is the medial preoptic        area This area is directly and reciprocally connected to        Barringtons nucleus ie the pontine micturition center           and will therefore have neurons that are infected        with the bladder virus but not with the prostate virus                    Conclusions        Unlike the distributions observed for bladder and        external urethral sphincter    where there was        considerable overlap as well as a large number of        doublelabeled neurons the results for bladder and        prostate in this work are quite different There is very        little overlap of the two distributions and very few        doublelabeled neurons This result implies that there is        little mutual interactive control of these two pelvic        visceral organs and their functions are clearly separate        and independent                    Materials and Methods                  Surgery          All procedures involving rats were performed in          compliance with the USDA Animal Welfare Act and          amendments thereto and the revised Guide for the Care and          Use of Laboratory Animals DHEW NIH and were approved by          the Animal Studies Subcommittee of the BayPine Veterans          Administration Medical Center Animals used in these          experiments were male SpragueDawley rats  gm          The rat was anesthetized with Halothane initially at           in  O              CO            in a plastic box and when the          animal had succumbed via a plastic nose cone at a          maintenance level of  An abdominal incision was made          to expose both the urinary bladder and the prostate                          Pseudorabies double labeling procedure          The unique design of these experiments is the use of          two immunohistochemically distinguishable pseudorabies          viruses This enables the investigator to examine the          neuronal distribution of two possibly functionally          related organs within a single spinal cord section and to          suggest putative interactions between them The two          pseudorabies viruses used in these experiments were          PRVBartha Blu and PRV and were donated by Dr LW          Enquist PRVBartha Blu BaBlu is a modified Bartha          virus that contains a gene expressing galactosidase and          can be detected with an appropriate antiserum PRV          PRVGFP is a Bartha virus modified to contain the green          fluorescent protein GFP and can be visualized with the          appropriate excitation wavelength or with a polyclonal          antiserum against GFP Each virus had a titer of about           plaqueforming units per ml The PRVGFP virus was          injected into the ventral wall of the urinary bladder          detrusor and the BaBlu virus was injected into the          ventral lobes of the prostate In some experiments the          order of viruses was reversed with BaBlu injected into          the urinary bladder and PRVGFP injected into the          prostate Results were not dependent upon which virus was          injected into the organ Injections were made with a           ml insulin syringe with a gauge tapered needle          BectonDickinson Co Two injections of  l each were          made into each organ under visual control with the          operating microscope In order to avoid the possibility          of spread of virus between the two organs the injection          to the bladder was confined to the bladder body and was          not near the prostate The injections were observed to be          confined to the tissue injected To further reduce the          possibility of spread to nearby tissues other than those          injected the areas were washed with saline and the          liquid blotted after each injection Five groups each          comprising at least three animals were infected and          allowed to survive for     and  days post          infection One animal in each group had the viruses          reversed At the end of these periods animals were          anesthetized with pentobarbital  mgkg ip and          perfused transcardially with  ml of cold Krebs ringer          followed with  ml of cold  paraformaldehyde in          phosphate buffer pH  Major pelvic ganglia spinal          cord and brain were removed and stored in cold fixative          until ready for sectioning Twentyfour hours prior to          sectioning the tissue was exposed to a

and thawmounted on gelatinized slides          Major pelvic ganglia sections from experiments where the          prostate was infected with the BaBlu virus were          processed with antiserum against galactosidase see          below and also with an antiserum against tyrosine          hydroxylase to identify those neurons that were          adrenergic Cryostat sections  microns from spinal          cord and brain were cut and stored in phosphate buffer          Spinal cord sections were collected sequentially in          individual bins each containing six sections The brain          was cut in half and both portions mounted on a block          Brain sections were collected sequentially in individual          bins each containing two cuts each consisting of one          section from each brain portion Slides were prepared          containing a complete series of sections representing          either the spinal cord segments or the brain In the case          of the spinal cord one section of the six in each bin was          mounted In the case of the brain one section from each          pair was mounted thus representing a complete profile of          the brain The

with          galactosidase appeared red under epifluorescent          illumination If they were also cholinergic they appeared          blue under epifluorescent illumination Neurons labeled          by PRVGFP were detectable because they were          autofluorescent Neurons were divided into three          categories BaBlu positive PRVGFP positive or both          BaBlu and PRVGFP positive Neurons that were          cholinergic were also noted All these types of neuron          could be detected within a single section using          epifluorescent illumination with appropriate filters          Counts of each type of neuron were made from each section          of a complete spinal cord series The counts were          combined for all the animals in each group averaged and          a standard error computed Maps showing the location and          character of the different types of labeled neurons were          made with the MDPLOT software Minnesota Datametrics
