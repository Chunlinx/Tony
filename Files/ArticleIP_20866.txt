                                                            The VastConspiracy That Cried Wolf                        As usual Dan Quayle put it best Do we reallywant to ask or answer all these irrelevant questions about what someone may ormay not have done  or  years ago Quite frankly the American people dontcare he told the New York Times recently And quite frankly its notthat important Whats important is who you are today what youre going todo            Quite right What doesit matter if for example Bill Clinton forced himself on Juanita Broaddrickway back in  Whom a man may have raped in the privacy of her hotel roomwhen he was attorney general of Arkansas has nothing to do with his ability tolead the nation into the  st century If an elected official isdoing a good job how he relaxes during his free time is not a legitimatepublic concern            Clinton denies the accusation and there are good reasonsnot to believe it see  But it would have been better if he had said withsimple dignity none of your business Texas Gov George W Bush and SenJohn McCain RAriz are winning press plaudits for refusing to answer pressquestions about past private peccadilloes Exhausted by the Year of Flytrap wehave all decided that politicians private lives should stay private            Some might demur thatrape is not a peccadillo It is among other things illegal But so are potsmoking and cocaine snorting which are high on the list of private behaviorpoliticians are getting little gold stars for refusing to discuss Is rape aworse crime than using drugs Well many might think so but you wouldnt knowit from the way most politicians talk about drugs In declining to talk abouthis own drug experience George W made the interesting point that he didntwant to give young people today the unfortunate though accurate impressionthat you could do whatever he did when young and still end up governor ofTexas Certainly this argument applies in the case of alleged rape by apresident even more currently popular than the governor of Texas            It is obvious why the liberal perverts and druggies of theDemocratic Party favor a curtain being drawn on politicians private lives Buthow did Republican politicianspure of body and spiritget into thisposition One way is by repeating the mantra its not about sex just once ortwice too often They thought they had him by the legalities on perjury andobstruction of justice and in attempting to win converts to their cause theymay have been more dismissive than they intended about the sex thing Too latetoo late            Then theres LarryFlynt A few conservative voices such as the Weekly Standard and theWall Street Journal editorial page remained steadfast in theirhysterical disapproval of the presidents private sexual behavior and remainedadamant that it is a legitimate public issue But even theylike allpoliticians of both parties almost all the media and most of thecitizenrywere hysterical and adamant that Larry Flynt should not be allowedto draw public attention to the private sexual behavior of anyone else TheJournal even insisted that Flynt should be prosecuted forblackmail            Why If a category of information is legitimately useful injudging an elected public official how can it be illegitimate and outrageousto gather and publish such information Maybe they decided that Clinton was agood place to stop When your side has launched an offensive been driven backand nervously awaits a counteroffensive its not a bad time for an armisticeThat would be hypocritical of course But newspapers have the right to practicehypocrisy in the privacy of their own editorial pages            But did the VastRightWing Conspiracy tragically call for a ceasefire just as the ultimateweapon was about to be delivered into their hands Did they dig a tunnel towithin an inch of freedom from their Clinton imprisonment when they gave upDid they finally have an accusation that would shock a seemingly unshockablepublic Rape Those few elements of the VRWC that havent been drained offightFox News for exampleare flogging the Juanita Broaddrick story with atleast a bit of the old spirit and are puzzled that even this hasnt worked            It is puzzling The evidence is flakya woman who has bothconfirmed and denied the story corroborators with their own reasons toliebut major scandals have been built on less Yes were all suffering fromscandal fatigue but rape            The explanation ispartly the froginhotwater phenomenon hell jump out if you drop him inboiling water but not if you put him in cold water and slowly heat it toboiling Clinton has faced an escalating series of seriousaccusationsserious in the sense that they were all plausible and some weretrue One or another of them might have stuck but each one inured the publicto the next Clinton skillfully augmented this process by pacing anyadmissions he has been forced to make so that each new one was just a smallaccretion on a large pile of old news            Clinton though has also faced a continuing barrage ofunserious allegationsimplausible and untrue Hes been accused of  amongother things The effect of these stories from the nether regions of the VastRightWing Conspiracy has been like crying wolf When youve heard thepresident preposterously accused of murder so often you just yawn when hesaccused of rape            So now we are living in the world everyone has longclaimed to want where we judge politicians based only on the issues and theirpublic records of governance Some might feel that healthy indifference to whatpoliticians do in their private lives has gone too far when it coversallegations of rape But theyll get used to it
