        so i personally uh do consider the Soviet Union a threat i i i think that although theres been some fundamental changes and that theres uh uh the uh the mood for change that theres a lot of change left to happen and that theres still uh communism which is fundamentally opposed to democracy and theres still missiles   umhum   yeah   yeah well i mean thats thats certainly true i guess im im confused uh by what it means to be a threat to the United States and so im not sure i even recognize the United States as anything to be threatened um   oh really   the uh i guess the main issue is is that it it seems to me that the Soviet Union is breaking up into its own internal problems   yes   um and it would certainly be nice if the various um republics seceded on the other hand i also think it would be very nice if the various states in our union seceded uh but thats beside the point uh     right   and its much less than clear to me that as a military power um theres going to be anything left uh given that anything like that happens   right   uh theyve got enough problems keeping their own people happy to worry about you know nuking other people who arent bothering them   right well i guess that that that brings up a question is it their i think in in the long term we could see a a situation where there are in  incredible civil wars and that the the structure of the country breaks down and theres strife and much much death   umhum   but until that happens between between now and then theres a lot of other uh events that could happen including a resurgence of communism with uh violent uh backlash against democracy which which is where we could be in threatened i guess youd say   i guess im communist why is why is communism antiethical to democracy i can understand why its antiethical to capitalism   im sorry you youre right im am meaning to say capitalism   okay uh all right but weve already got a lot of anticapitalism in this country   yes thats true uhhuh   um   but not necessarily enough from the Soviet Unions peoples point of view   that could be that could be   i yeah   uh but certainly the latest rumors in Congress right now is lets soak the rich some more so we can spread out the money   yeah   and thats certainly communism as far as i can tell   right   uh       so um you know they might be perfectly happy to sit back and wait for it to happen   thats right   um and they so so i guess since the primary question is whether or not its a military problem thats less than clear to me i mean if theyre smart theyre just going to let us head toward communism on our own very merry way   thats right   and there seems to be enough people in our country who are happy to do that sort of thing because they think theyd get more out of it that way   right umhum   um so from that point of view i dont consider them a threat   i see   i dont think theyre going to you know somehow import communism to us   i i agree with that i dont believe that will happen the um well one thing thats current of interest is is if the Soviet Unions structure does break down and there is civil war at the end of those civil wars or during those civil wars in whose hands will those missiles be   umhum right   and there are a lot of them uh scattered throughout the many many republics   thats true thats that can be a frightening thought   right almost a terroristic thought   um yep yep   you know come help us or well bomb you   yeah um of course thats not a good way to win friends but yeah i mean i i think theres also the whole third world issue uh with him   thats   with uh the Soviet Union having um supported uh Iraq   right   uh previously and and so there theres a whole lot of political possibilities um but you know just just to put this in perspective i mean George Bush was recently in the hospital and so for a moment Dan Quayle might have been  uh having his finger on the trigger and God knows what that would have done uh     thats right i know its almost amazing how little you hear about Dan Quayle and when you do its usually totally   yeah its a joke   yeah yeah he still wants to send people to Mars   right   the guys uh lame lame lame lame to say the least   yeah   oh well so thats uh what whats going to be real interesting is if when they have the next presidential elections   umhum   if Bush is going to run with Quayle again   yeah   or if hes going to run with someone else which i think would be uh i wonder if thats if theres precedent for that where uh theres uh same president but a different vice president   uh i think so i cant think off hand who   is it but without something like death or impeachment   yeah   i i i cant recall   i mean i just cant imagine voting for anybody that has Quayle on their ticket   yeah thats right i guess in the last elections it was it was the lesser of several evils but from the   right and also he was basically unknown so i mean youre just like okay so its its Bush and somebody else   yeah thats right yeah oh well so lets see back to the that key issue uh   umhum   the the other part of the question was what would uh what would have to happen to convince me   right right   and id say seems to me uh that the missiles are the threat     umhum   and so what would have to happen is a complete disarmament   umhum   uh and uh thats i you know id love to see that happen but i doubt its going to happen in the next fifty years   you dont think so   i dont no personally i i i really as i said i would really love to see it happen but i just   i just i cant see them maintaining the missile bases in fact i think if the Soviet government starts retreating you know because of these civil wars and stuff the first thing theyre going to do is close down the mi ssile bases in the republics   umhum oh under the fear   because theyre not going to want them to fall into the Republics hands   i see under the fear that that uh Moscow Moscow gets bombed first thats a good point thats a very good point in fact   might be used against them thats right and so i think just from that theres going to be some limited amounts of disarmament theyll still be republics with the missiles the ones that are under the firmer control of the of the Soviets   right   uh but certainly you know like Lithuania and stuff i think would lose the irs   yes i see thats a good great point okay well so   so it was good talking to you   yeah it was nice talking to you too Brian good day byebye   okeydoke bye
