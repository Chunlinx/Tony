                    Background        The importance of bacterial infections that complicate        the clinical course of patients with human immunodeficiency        virus HIV infection has been recognized since the        beginning of the AIDS epidemic      Several factors        predispose patients with HIV infection to bacterial        infections These factors include abnormalities in humoral        and cellmediated immunity phagocytic cell dysfunction        and skin and mucous membrane defects     The presence        of neutropenia     use of central venous catheters             low CD lymphocyte count and intravenous drug use           are cited as risk factors for bacteremic infections in        patients with HIV infection Bacterial infections are        responsible for the immediate cause of death of up to         of patients with HIV infection     The purpose of this        study was to describe the bacterial pathogens causing blood        stream infection identify the risk factors for the        development of blood stream infection and determine the        impact of blood stream infection on the outcome of        hospitalized patients with HIV                    Methods        This prospective observational study included         consecutive hospital admissions of  adults with HIV        infection treated at the University Medical Center        Jacksonville Florida from April  through March         All adults with HIV infection who were admitted to the        hospital were included in the study The University Medical        Center is a bed innercity teaching hospital        affiliated with the University of Florida Because of the        hospitals innercity location most of the patients were        African American The need for informed consent was waived        by the institutional review board of the hospital        The isolation of a bacterium in  or more blood cultures        was diagnostic of bacterial blood stream infection Blood        isolates of coagulasenegative staphylococci         Corynebacterium species         Bacillus species         Propionibacterium species         Peptostreptococcus species         Clostridium species and unidentified        Grampositive rods were considered contaminated if a single        blood culture yielded the organism or the clinician did not        initiate treatment considering it not a true infection        Mycobacterial infections were excluded from the study The        place of acquisition of the blood stream infection was        defined as nosocomial if the infection developed after         hours of hospitalization or within  days of previous        hospitalization We collected data on age sex race        exposure category for HIV infection place of acquisition        white

intensive care unit admission status        length of hospital stay and inhospital mortality The        source of the blood stream infection was identified by the        isolation of the same pathogenic organism from both the        source and the blood The APACHE II score and predicted        mortality rate for each hospital admission were calculated            The standardized mortality ratio was determined by        dividing the actual mortality by the predicted mortality        For the purpose of this study each admission was analyzed        independently        StatView  computer software SAS Institute Cary NC        was used for statistical analysis Each mean was expressed        with its standard deviation Comparisons between groups        were made using logistic regression analysis and Student         t  MannWhitney         U    and Fisher exact tests When        available the continuitycorrected         P values were used for  analysis         P values less than  were        considered significant                    Results        Table provides demographic exposure category and        health status data on  hospital admissions of         patients with HIV infection

episodes of blood stream infection Of these  infections          were community acquired and   were        nosocomial Twentyone of the  admissions  during        the first year of the study had blood stream infection        compared with  of  admissions  during the second        year and  of  admissions  during the third year          P   The sources of        bacteremia were identified in  patients  and        included pneumonia in  urinary tract infection in         peritonitis in  and cellulitis pancreatitis central        venous catheter cholangitis and arthritis in  each In         patient  organisms         Salmonella typhi and         Klebsiella pneumoniae  were isolated        from the blood during the same hospitalization both were        community acquired The pathogens causing blood stream        infection are listed in Table  Six patients had         episodes of blood stream infection during the study period        all during different hospitalizations One patient had         episodes of         Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia and        another patient had  episodes of         S typhi bacteremia        There were no significant differences in age sex and        risk factors for HIV infection between patients with and        without blood stream infection Table  The median CD        lymphocyte count for injection drug users was           L compared with

consisting of mortality        as a dependent variable and APACHE II score and presence of        blood stream infection as independent variables showed that        both blood stream infection odds ratio   CI         and APACHE II score odds ratio   CI         were independently associated with mortality        Among patients with blood stream infection survivors had a        lower APACHE II

infection is listed        in Table  Among the  patients with blood stream        infection multiple logistic regression analysis using a        model of mortality as a dependent variable and APACHE II        score CD lymphocyte count and place of acquisition of        the infection as independent variables showed that higher        APACHE II scores odds ratio   CI  and        nosocomial acquisition odds ratio   CI         but not CD lymphocyte count odds ratio          CI  were independently associated        with mortality The intensive care unit admission rate of        patients

patients with blood stream infection was  during the        third year of the study compared with  and  during        the first and second years respectively          P                      Discussion        This study describes the incidence of bacterial blood        stream infection as well as its causative pathogens risk        factors for its development and its impact on outcome in        hospitalized patients with HIV Blood stream infection        developed in  of the patients of these infections         were community acquired and  were nosocomial The        incidence rate of blood stream infection was higher in        African Americans and Hispanics compared with whites There        were no significant differences in sex age and CD        lymphocyte count between patients with and patients        without blood stream infection The APACHE II score and        white blood cell count of patients with blood stream        infection were higher than those of patients without blood        stream infection The mortality and ICU admission rates of        patients with blood stream infection were higher and their        length of hospital stay longer than those of patients        without blood stream infection Among patients with blood        stream infection the mortality rate of the        communityacquired group was lower than that of the        nosocomial group        Bacteremia is more common in hospitalized HIVpositive        patients than in HIVnegative patients     The        incidence of nonmycobacterial bacteremias in hospitalized        patients with HIV ranges from  to        Most        blood stream infections in patients with HIV are community        acquired      In developed countries the incidence        rate of HIVassociated bacteremia has declined after the        introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy        HAART      In the present study the incidence of        blood stream infection among hospitalized patients with HIV        was  and most of these infections were community        acquired Despite the availability of HAART during the        later period of our study we did not find a decline in the        rate of bacteremia in our patient population However the        mortality rate of the patients with blood stream infection        declined during the third year of the study reflecting the        potential benefit of HAART        African American race Hispanic race and high APACHE II        score were found to be risk factors for blood stream        infection in hospitalized patients with HIV infection in        the present study Because there were only few Hispanics in        the present study and the African Americans were more        likely than the whites to be injection drug users we do        not think there is an independent association between race        and bacteremia Previous studies have shown injection drug        use to be a risk factor for bacteremia      However        like the study by Tumbarello et al     our study did        not find injection drug use to be a risk factor for blood        stream bacterial infection The earlier stage of HIV        infection in the injection drug users in our study may        explain their lower bacteremia rate Neutropenia is        reported to be a risk factor for the development of        bacterial infection in patients with HIV infection                However in our study neither the prevalence of        leukopenia nor the total white blood cell count was lower        in patients with blood stream bacterial infection compared        with patients without blood stream bacterial infection In        fact the white blood cell count was higher in patients        with than in patients without bacterial blood stream        infection Unlike other studies which showed the CD        lymphocyte count to be low in HIVpositive patients with        blood stream bacterial infection      the CD        lymphocyte count did not differ between patients with and        patients without bacterial blood stream infection in the        present study The lack of association between bacteremia        and low CD lymphocyte count or leukopenia in the present        study may reflect the earlier stage of HIV infection in our        patient population        Previous studies have shown the presence of central        venous catheters to be a risk factor for bacterial blood        stream infection          In the present        study an intravascular catheter was the source of the        blood stream infection in only  patient this was probably        due to infrequent use of central venous catheters and        shorter length of hospital stay As in the study by        Tumbarello et al     higher severity of illness        measured by APACHE II score was associated in the present        study with the development of bacterial blood stream        infection        The common sources of blood stream infection in patients        with HIV infection include the lungs skin subcutaneous        tissue and intravascular catheters        In        the present study the most common source of bacteremia was        pneumonia        Grampositive bacteria are responsible for most of the        bacteremias in hospitalized HIVpositive patients            More grampositive than gramnegative organisms were        isolated from the blood stream of our subjects Many        studies have shown         Staphylococcus species to be the most        common isolates in blood         In our study         Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most        common isolate The rate of pneumococcal bacteremia is        about fold higher in patients with than in patients        without HIV infection     Because most of the blood        stream infections were community acquired and the most        common source of infection was pneumonia         Staphylococci were less frequent than                S pneumoniae and         Escherichia coli                 P aeruginosa is being recognized more        frequently as causing both communityacquired and        nosocomial bacteremia in patients with HIV infection                 Hospitalization neutropenia antibiotic        therapy steroid use and low CD lymphocyte count are        risk factors for         P aeruginosa bacteremia in patients        with HIV infection      Previously we reported that                P aeruginosa is the most common        pathogen causing bacterial pneumonia in our patients            However compared with pneumococcal pneumonia         Pseudomonas pneumonia is less likely        to be associated with bacteremia     The annual        incidence rate of         P aeruginosa infection in patients        with HIV infection is estimated to be  cases per         admissions             P aeruginosa has been reported to be        the causative agent of  to  of bacteremias in        hospitalized patients with HIV infection       In        the present study         P aeruginosa was responsible for         of the bacteremias        In patients with HIV infection although bacteremia in        general is more frequently associated with growth of        grampositive pathogens genitourinary sepsis is more        frequently related to the detection of gramnegative        bacteria     Our finding of         E coli to be the most common        gramnegative organism differs from findings in previous        studies In a recent study of blood stream infection of        hospitalized patients with HIV         E coli was not even mentioned among        the common etiologic agents     In the present study a        significant number of the patients with blood stream        infection were women who are at higher risk for        genitourinary infection The relatively high number of        women may explain the high rates of         E coli blood stream infection in our        study        The present study showed that the presentation with or        the development of blood stream infection in hospitalized        patients with HIV leads to poor outcome as evidenced by        increased mortality length of hospital stay and intensive        care unit admission rate Hospital mortality rates of        HIVpositive patients with blood stream infection range        from  to            In the present        study the hospital mortality rate of patients with blood        stream infection was  Among patients with blood stream        infection we found the association of increased mortality        with high APACHE II score and hospital acquisition of the        infection but not with low CD lymphocyte count Because        nosocomial bacteremia is likely to develop in patients with        a complicated hospital course and lead to multiple organ        dysfunction its association with an increased mortality        rate is not surprising Previous studies of HIVpositive        patients with blood stream infection have shown that a high        APACHE II score predicts an increased risk of death             Although we did not find a significant association        between mortality and CD lymphocyte count a previous        study showed that a low CD lymphocyte count is associated        with increased mortality in patients with nosocomial blood        stream infection            Our study has several limitations The risk factors for        HIV infection were not identified in  most probably        because of the health care providers and patients lack of        openness with regard to sexual activity Because we were        unable to document the patients antiretroviral therapy and        previous antimicrobial treatment or chemoprophylaxis we        could not assess their impact on the incidence etiology        and outcome of bacterial blood stream infection In many        patients the source of the blood stream infection was not        identified Finally because the study was limited to a        single center the results may not apply to other patient        populations                    Conclusions        Bacteremia occurs in  of adult patients with HIV        infection who require admission to the hospital Most of        the bacteremias are community acquired The most common        grampositive organism isolated from the blood stream of        patients with HIV infection is         S pneumoniae  and the most common        gramnegative organism is         E coli  The APACHE II score of        patients with blood stream infection is higher than that of        patients without blood stream infection The presence of        blood stream infection is associated with an increased        mortality rate length of hospital stay and intensive care        unit admission rate Recognition of the incidence        etiology and risk factors of blood stream infection in        patients with HIV infection can lead to preventive and        therapeutic measures that may reduce the associated        increased mortality and morbidity                    Competing interests        None declared
