                                 The Not Yet AroundtheWorld Balloonists            Of all the sorry moments inthe aroundtheworld balloon raceand God knows there have been thesorriest occurred last week On Jan  the Global Hilton balloon burst ahelium tank  minutes after takeoff and Dick Rutan and his copilot wereforced to bail out at  feet They parachuted directly into a cactuspatch Rutan you may remember is one of the true adventurers of the age In he piloted the Voyager airplane on its astonishing nonstoparoundtheworld journey Now  years later the aviation pioneer is pickingcactus spines out of his face the latest casualty of the worlds mostpointless competition What is the great balloon race The irrepressiblepursuing the irrelevant            HowardHughes sped around the world by plane and Ted Turner has squandered plenty ofhis millions on Americas Cup yachts But today ballooning is the pastime ofthe gentleman adventurer Winter is aroundtheworld balloon seasonits whenthe jet stream runs consistently west to eastso the last few weeks havewitnessed and the next few weeks will witness an orgy of circumnavigationattempts A few days before Rutans crash commodities trader Steve Fossettgave up his effort when his balloon ran out of fuel over Russia A few daysbefore that architect Kevin Uliassi aborted his flight after his balloon blewa hole during takeoff In the next few weeks eccentric Brit billionaire RichardBranson whose last balloon took off without him and Swiss balloonist BertrandPiccard are each expected to launch their multimilliondollar airshipsUliassi too wants to relaunch his balloon            The balloonists have captured the public imagination andnot without reason The nonstop aroundtheworld balloon flight is the onlyremaining aviation milestone The expeditions make great television Theyunfold slowly over several days and the visuals of sunkissed balloons arefabulous The balloonists seem genuinely heroic They endure cramped quartersand subzero temperatures and they face real danger In  Belarus jets shotdown a racing balloon killing its two pilots while China North Korea andLibya are all thought to be hostile to balloon flyovers And there is somethingcharmingly antiquated about the venture No ballooning story is completewithout reference to Phileas Fogg in Around the World in Eighty Days  Sohere it is AnheuserBusch hearkening back to the aviation prizes of thes has ponied up  million for the first person to circumnavigate by half for the balloonist half for the charity of his choice            Balloonists and journalists are calling the race the Last Great AdventureBut that phrase does violence to the notion of adventure Once upon a timeadventuring was a purposeful activity Magellan circled the earth in order toopen it to trade Lewis and Clark went west to build a country Flyingadventurers too recorded genuine necessary accomplishments CharlesLindberghs crossing wasnt just a stunt It made real the idea oftransatlantic air travel Hughes aroundtheworld flights made real the ideaof global air travel Even Voyager had a scientific aim It vindicatedthe notion of ultralight planes and proved the value of ultralightmaterials            The aroundtheworld balloon race by contrastis a nonsensical exercise We have climbed as high as we can and sunk as deepas we can Weve gone as far north as possible and as far south Weve brokenthe sound barrier on land and in water circled the globe by water and by airNow it has come to this The balloon race is the hotdogeating contest ofaviation No one has ever bothered to break the ballooning record becausetheres no reason to do it Balloons are a uniquely terrible mode oftransportation They are impossible to steer slow and dangerous They arealso hideously expensive The journey has no realworld utility Passengerballoons can contribute nothing to transportation or science Will a successfulcircumnavigation usher in an era of commercial balloon airlines            Thisinsignificance is a shame because todays adventurers are as brave as theirpredecessors The balloonists are adrenalin junkies but brainy ones Bransonthe genius behind Virgin is as bold with his life as with his businesses Hehas crossed both the Atlantic and Pacific by speedboat and balloonAlong the way hes crashed in and been rescued from the Canadian Arctic andthe Atlantic Fossett whos worth only  million to  million is equallyinsouciant He has driven in the Le Mans Hour Race raced sled dogs in theIditarod completed the Ironman triathlon run an ultramarathon and set theballooning distance and endurance records Rutan was a Vietnam fighter jock andtest pilot Piccard is a champion hangglider and professional balloon racerPiccards family history is Exhibit No  in the decline of the greatadventure His grandfather Auguste Piccard invented the submersible bathyscaphand was the first person to balloon into the stratosphere His father JacquesPiccard set the underwater depth record in another submersible Jacques alsoinvented the tourist submarine The thirdgeneration Piccard no less adaredevil is reduced to competitive ballooning            Balloon experts give Branson Piccard or Rutan decent oddsto complete the circumnavigation eventually All three have pressurizedgondolas that allow them to travel fast through the high jet stream All havedeep pockets There are doubts about Fossett and Uliassi who fly inunpressurized gondolas Their balloons must travel slowly at lower altitudesand they are more exposed to the cold Fossett and Uliassi are also flyingsolo making them vulnerable to fatigue on a twoweek trip            In any case lets hope thatsomeone finishes the race soon so the balloonists can move on tosomething worthwhilesuch as say the Mars Prize America wants a manned Marsoutpost Instead of giving NASA  billion to build one Newt Gingrich hassuggested that the United States offer a billion reward for the privateorganization that does it first Branson has mulled over the idea of going intospace Why not the Red Planet Its color after all matches his omnipresentVirgin logo The Mars Prizethats an adventure worthy of Bransons courageAnd thats an adventure that mankind could actually use
