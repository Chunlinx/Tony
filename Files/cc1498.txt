                    Introduction        This paper was presented at the th European Congress        of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases  May         Stockholm Sweden        Sepsis can be defined as a systemic response to        infection   The incidence of sepsis worldwide is on the        increase Sepsis and its sequels are the leading causes of        death in intensive care units Mortality rates are higher        for patients with preexisting disease medical conditions        care in the intensive care unit and multiple organ failure           Despite steady improvements in antibiotic therapy        and intensive care management during the past decade        mortality has remained close to  This high mortality        rate has continued to stimulate interest in pharmacological        agents that might reduce morbidity and mortality                    Steroid therapy in patients with sepsis is still        controversial In the s stress doses of hydrocortisone        for the treatment of sepsis were investigated but no        advantages could be shown in a doubleblind multicenter        study   This led to the discontinuation of steroid        replacement therapy for sepsis In the s therapy with        pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids was widely used in        patients with sepsis and septic shock The most compelling        evidence in favor of corticosteroid treatment was reported        by Schumer   in his prospective randomized study of        steroid administration to patients with septic shock These        data indicate that methylprednisolone  mgkg or        dexamethasone  mgkg reduced the mortality rate from         to  However later in the mids        pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids for the treatment        of sepsis were investigated extensively until several        clinical trials gave negative results            Moreover there is some evidence that the use of highdose        glucocorticoids in sepsis might be harmful          Many studies have demonstrated that elevated cortisol        levels in sepsis and the degree of elevation are related to        the severity of illness   Basal and corticotropin        ACTHstimulated cortisol levels correlate with the        severity of illness and very high cortisol levels often        signify a poor prognosis   In sepsis the        hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis is activated through        systemic and neural pathways Circulating cytokines such as        tumor necrosis factor  interleukin and interleukin        activate the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis        independently and when combined have synergistic effects                 Sepsis can also cause adrenal insufficiency AI which        is associated with increased mortality   In recent        years several authors have proposed a syndrome of occult        AI in septic shock in the presence of normal or even        elevated serum cortisol concentrations This hypothesis is        based on many studies investigating the adrenocortical        response of patients with septic shock to  mg of ACTH        Up to  of seriously ill patients have been suggested to        have occult or unrecognized AI   The prevalence of        occult AI a cortisol increment after a short ACTH test of        less than  mgdl in severe sepsis was estimated at about         and the day mortality rate at about    A few        studies have indicated that stress doses of hydrocortisone        improve hemodynamics in patients with hyperdynamic septic        shock which is unresponsive to conventional therapy           However the use of a physiological dose of steroid in        patients with sepsis severe sepsis and septic shock has        not yet been completely evaluated We therefore performed a        placebocontrolled randomized doubleblind singlecenter        study        The aim of this study was to assess basal cortisol        concentrations and the cortisol response to ACTH        stimulation as well as their prognostic importance and        also to determine the effects of the physiologicaldose        steroid therapy on mortality in patients with sepsis                    Methods                  Study design          The study protocol was approved by the Institutional          Review Board of Erciyes University and informed consent          was obtained from the patients relatives This          placebocontrolled randomized doubleblind          singlecenter study was performed at the Department of          Medical Intensive Care Unit and the Department of          Infectious Diseases of Erciyes University Medical School          during a year period from May  to April                           Patient selection          Patients over  years old and diagnosed with sepsis          were included consecutively in the study The diagnosis          of sepsis was based on the definition of the American          College of Chest PhysiciansSociety of Critical Care          Medicine Consensus Conference Report   The severity          of illness was classified according to this definition          Table           Criteria for exclusion from the study were as follows          already known preexisting adrenal disease or          adrenalectomy known malignancies tuberculosis that          might have involved the adrenal gland and administration          of steroids within the  months before the admission In          addition patients with burns hemorrhagic shock or those          who had suffered myocardial infarction were not          included                          Treatment protocol          Patients enrolled in the study were treated with          standard therapy used in the treatment of sepsis and          septic shock This therapy could include the following          administration of antibiotics fluid replacement          vasoactive drugs mechanical ventilatory support and          any other form of supportive therapy deemed necessary by          the primary physicians Soon after the presumptive          diagnosis of severe sepsis initial laboratory specimens          were obtained and within  hours the patients were          randomized to treatment with prednisolone or placebo          groups The treatment groups were determined by a          computergenerated randomization procedure The steroid          therapy group received prednisolone at a physiological          dose Prednisolone was given intravenously at            mg and   mg for  days The standard therapy          group received a placebo infusion containing          physiological saline solution in an identical manner          Patients and their primary physicians were blinded as to          which therapy was administered                          Data collection          An ACTH stimulation test was performed with  g of          tetracosactrin synacthene Ciba Geigy Germany given          intravenously Blood samples were taken immediately          before the test and at  and  minutes afterwards          After centrifugation plasma samples were stored at C          until assayed ACTH stimulation test was repeated on the          th day in the patients who survived Plasma cortisol          concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay with a          commercially available kit ICN Biomedicals Inc Costa          Mesa California USA Intraassay coefficients of          variation were for control A  control B  and          control C  Interassay coefficients of variation          were for control A  control B  control C           The cortisol response was defined as the difference          between the basal and peak cortisol concentrations          Normal adrenal function was defined as a plasma cortisol          level before or at  or  minutes after the injection          of ACTH above  gdl The cases with peak cortisol          levels lower than  gdl were considered to be AI               Occult AI was defined as an increase in          cortisol after a ACTH test of less than  gdl a          cortisol response of no more than  gdl                       Communityacquired sepsis had its onset within           hours of the patients admission to the hospital whereas          hospitalacquired sepsis began  hours or later after          admission The estimated prognosis of any preexisting          underlying diseases had been classified according to the          classification of McCabe and Jackson            Observed initial findings that related to disseminated          intravascular coagulation respiratory insufficiency          altered mental status and renal cardiac and liver          failure were noted    The severity of the illness          was assessed with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health          Evaluation II APACHEII scoring system   The          Sequential Organ Failure Assessment SOFA score            was added to the study protocol by amendment and          retrospectively from the raw data Infections were          diagnosed according to clinical and microbiological          criteria Blood samples for cultures were obtained by the          same investigator O Yildiz and inoculated into a          standard culture medium BACTEC  Patients were          evaluated at enrollment and at the th hour and on the          rd th th th st

primary endpoint of the study was day mortality          from all causes The secondary endpoint consisted of          adverse occurrences including possible complications of          drug therapy and morbid events such as the progression of          initial infection and the development of secondary          infection Secondary infection was defined as the          identification of a new site of infection or the          emergence of a different organism at the same site          generally requiring a change in antibiotic          management          All medications given to the patients any          complications the duration of hospitalization the          mortality rate and the causes of death were recorded and          compared between the groups We also compared average          values of basal cortisol peak cortisol and cortisol          responses to ACTH between survivors and nonsurvivors on          the first day Moreover basal cortisol levels on the st          and th days were compared in patients who recovered in          each group                          Statistical analysis          Students           t test and the MannWhitney           U multivariate analysis test were          used for continuous variables  and Fishers  tests          were used for proportions and logistic regression was          used for effects of factors on mortality Values

patients with sepsis severe sepsis and septic          shock were included in this study The mean age of          patients was    years in the standard therapy          group and    years in the

higher          than that in the patients with communityacquired sepsis          in both groups but this difference was not statistically          significant The relationship between mortality and

mortality rates among patients with a cortisol          level over  gdl were   of  in the steroid          therapy group and   of  in the standard therapy          group              P   Although there was an          increase in the level of basal cortisol in patients with          sepsis  of  patients  had occult AI The          mortality rates in patients with occult AI were   of

Sepsis is a severe and lifethreatening disease Septic        shock is associated with a mortality rate of more than         Despite improvements in the overall management of such        patients including intensive fluid resuscitation        broadspectrum antibiotic therapy and lifesupport        devices mortality rates have not improved during the past        decade   In this randomized doubleblind study of the        physiological dose of intravenous prednisolone or placebo        in the treatment of sepsis we observed an important        difference in mortality rates between both groups The        mortality rates were  in the steroid therapy group and         in the standard treatment group There was a trend        towards a decrease in the mortality rate of the patients        with sepsis who received physiologicaldose steroid        therapy However the differences were not statisti cally        significant          P   Several factors were        suspected to be associated with mortality in sepsis           Annane         et al   reported that SOFA        score high plasma cortisol levels and weak response of        cortisol to ACTH were also associated with mortality        However we found that only SOFA score was related to        mortality independently of other factors OR   CI         in the multivariate analysis        Briegel         et al   showed that stress doses        of hydrocortisone reduce the time for the reversal of        shock the number of organ system failures and the length        of mechanical ventilation in patients with septic shock        This finding underlines the fact that an impaired        adrenocortical function contributes to vascular        hyporesponsiveness in septic shock In contrast to other        studies our study was performed in patients with sepsis        severe sepsis and septic shock with the use of        physiologicaldose prednisolone with or without vasopressor        support Because the administration of prednisolone does        not affect the circadian adrenocortical patterns and the        results of an ACTH stimulation test in adults we preferred        to use this drug   In this study we did not completely        evaluate the effect of the steroid on patients with        vasopressordependent septic shock However in a few        patients a physiological dose of prednisolone reduces the        time for the reversal of shock as defined by the cessation        of vasopressor therapy        It is known that the plasma cortisol level increases in        critical illnesses and that basal cortisol levels have a        positive correlation with severity of illness and        prognosis However some investigators              showed that patients with sepsis and high baseline        cortisol levels had a lower cortisol response to the ACTH        stimulation test Our entire study group had higher mean        random basal and stimulated cortisol levels than those seen        in outpatients The difference between the basal cortisol        levels on the st and th days in patients who recovered        was statistically significant          P   Table  We have        also shown that basal cortisol levels correlate with the        severity of the illness and that very high cortisol        levels signify a poor prognosis in the standard therapy        group Fig         Clinically significant AI is unusual in outpatients The        studies of adrenal function in critically ill patients        report conflicting incidences of AI ranging from  to             Our results show a low incidence of AI in        septic patients One of our  patients had abnormal basal        and peak cortisol levels less than  gdl and died This        condition was evaluated as AI In the advancing process        from sepsis to septic shock we concluded that AI was not        so frequent as supposed        In recent years several authors have proposed a        syndrome of occult AI in septic shock in the presence of        normal or even elevated serum cortisol concentrations        Annane         et al   reported that  of        patients with severe sepsis had occult AI In the present        study   of the  patients had a subnormal cortisol        response occult AI Five patients in the steroid        treatment group had an inadequate cortisol response two of        them died However five of nine patients in the standard        treatment group who showed inadequate cortisol response        died No statistical differences were observed in mortality        rates between the patients who had occult AI            P   Fig         In conclusion a physiological dose of intravenous        prednisolone had a tendency towards a decrease in        mortality in the patients with sepsis but the difference        between the two groups was not significant Because our        study had a small sample size and showed heterogeneity in        population in terms of clinical severity treatment with        physiologicaldose steroid in sepsis should be evaluated in        a larger group of patients                    Key messages         There was an increase in the level of basal cortisol        in patients with sepsis         In the advancing process from sepsis to septic shock        adrenal insufficiency was not so frequent as supposed         Sepsis can cause occult adrenal insufficiency in the        presence of normal or even elevated serum cortisol        concentrations         Physiologicaldose prednisolone therapy had a tendency        towards a decrease in mortality in the patients with        sepsis                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        AI  adrenal insufficiency APACHE  Acute
