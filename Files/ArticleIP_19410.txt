                                 Schlock and Load            You know what sort of movieMessage in a Bottle will be from its opening montage A shimmery orangesunset over water Waves in slow motion crashing Rain on the ocean Floatingon the bubbly a bottle Fade to puffy clouds Then a woman Theresa RobinWright Penn jogs along an empty beach and spies that bottle She kneels downand removes itgingerly tenderlyfrom the wet sand Now heres the clincherthe holy touch She pats the sand on the beach back down Good sand Blessedsand            Shed probably have saida prayer except shes too busy reading the missive in the bottle which hasbeen lovingly composed on a manual typewriter Dear Catherine  itbegins Ive lost                my bearings Ive never been lost before  Thefog rolls in Theresa is hooked Im sorry I didnt hold you with so muchstrength that even God couldnt pull you away  As a friend of Theresassums it up Every woman in the world wants to be loved like that            Who is this supremely sensitive and poetically piningparamour I trust Im not spoiling the surprise when I tell you that hestopbilled Kevin Costner complete with sandy hair and a slightly deeper tanthan the one he sported as a golf pro in Tin Cup  He bears the Harlequinmoniker Garret Blake and works on boats in the Outer Banks of North Carolinaand speaks with winsome gentlenessbut he can throw a punch when he has toNot that he has to around Theresa who traces him through his stationery andshows up pretending that shes interested in boats The one hes shining up nowis a beauty but it wasnt always that way Garret She was neglectedunappreciated Theresa I know how she feels Garret taking her in Idoubt it The last is said in a courtly fashion because Garret is no lechHes too busy poetically pining for his lost Catherine and its difficult tolech and pine poetically simultaneously            These are twoextraordinarily beautiful literate soulful kindly lonely people of roughlythe same age The challenge facing screenwriter Gerald DiPego is to createimpediments enough to keep them apart for two hours or so Issues must be lefthanging Where is Catherine anyhow Why does a belligerent yokel John Savagewant to bust Garrets head Most momentously When will Theresa tell Garretthat she first came poking around his boat because shed found his letter andalready knew the depth of his heart When he stumbles on the truth will hefeel violated Will he storm out into a pouring rain Will she pursue himpleading weeping trying to explain that it was God who threw that bottle outof the sea and into her path Will Garret manage to put Catherine behind himbefore he loses Theresa too or will fate keep them tragically separated            Whether you attend Message in a Bottle with a hankieor a vomit bag depends of course on your own predilections Mine run lesstoward schlock romances than schlock thrillers but hey I can recognize anexpertly engineered inspirational soap opera when I see one The movie basedon a bestselling novel by Nicholas Sparks preys on the unsatisfied longingsin us all were it to satisfy any of them too quickly its spell would evaporatein a second Its probably just as well for the films commercial prospectsthat the director Luis Mandoki  When a Man Loves a Woman  does notappear to have a mind with multiple tracks He and his great cinematographerCaleb Deschanel focus all their energy and resources on the task of lyricallywithholding your gratification            Its no mystery why this vehicle appealed toCostner who also coproduced the picture The woman does all the emotingwhile the manpassive overly containedreaps the rewards Robin Wright Pennemotes well Shes a good nononsense actress who can disappear into a partand whose beauty needs no Hollywood embellishment But theres nothingdistinctive about herno funky residues of personality that signal thedifference between a gorgeous actress and a movie star She and Costner aremeant to be elemental in their attractiveness but they also demonstrate thattheres a perilously thin line between the elemental and the simpleminded            What a waste to usecolorful actors such as Illeana Douglas and Robbie Coltrane as blah secondbananas And what could have possessed the moviemakers to cast the topmost oftop bananas Paul Newman as Costners dada crotchety albeit caring voiceof wisdom Yes Id rather watch Newman than say Wilford Brimley but thereal tragedy here is reducing Newman to hovering on the periphery anddelivering old codger lines such as Young lady if I were  years younger If Message in a Bottle is finally about holding onto whats mostdear before its too late shouldnt we be chucking Costner into the briny andclinging to Newman            If Message in a Bottle plays like an inflatedHarlequin romance Payback plays like an inflated Pocket Books pulpBased on Richard Starks The Hunter  the same novel that providednarrative fodder for John Boormans avantgarde noir Point Blank Payback has a syntax much more oldfashioned than its predecessor Inmore or less linear fashion it tells the story of a violent thief Porter MelGibson who left for dead after a doublecross reemerges with an implacabledetermination to avenge himself on his expartner Val Gregg Henry andreclaim some  that is rightfully hisrightfully in the sense that hesthe one who actually stole it                           Payback soundedlike a good time The director and cowriter Brian Helgeland also cowroteLA Confidential  and gave Gibson one of his wildest roles everin his script for Conspiracy Theory which the actor hit out ofthe park striking a note of authentic paranoia that put him leagues ahead ofmost action stars Gibsons pretty good in Payback  too Where LeeMarvin in Point Blank was an automaton Gibson oscillates betweenbugeyed monomania and hangdog embarrassment When he realizes for instancethat he has no choice but to bust someones head he prefaces the brutal actwith a look of weariness even sorrow for the blood hes about to draw            God help me I had a decent time at Payback  But Idont offer that admission proudlyits more in the spirit of Look howdebased my taste has become after decades of sitting through crap thrillersThe shambling Gibson beats peoples heads in gets his own head beaten inbeats some more peoples heads in and drives away The end Helgeland has setthe film in a metropolis of uncertain period the s the s and has keptThe Hunter s absurdist archetypal lingothe crime syndicate goes bythe name of the Outfitbut the film has no mythic resonances and it hasbeen photographed in a brackish bluetinted monochromatic style thats meantto be expressive but just looks cheap            For some reason Porters revenge doesnt stop atVal but continues up the ladder of the Outfit as he clamors to collect his None of the movies distinguished crime honchosWilliam Devane JamesCoburn Kris Kristoffersoncan understand why hes risking his and otherslives in pursuit of such a paltry sum The problem with the movie is thatHelgeland doesnt seem to understand it either Its just a line on which tohang a lot of shootings headbashings and explosions The only moments ofconviction come from an AsianAmerican dominatrix called Pearl Lucy Liu whobrings far more glee to the task of beating people up than the pictures staror director If the audience could have half as much fun as Pearl is havingPayback would be a kick
