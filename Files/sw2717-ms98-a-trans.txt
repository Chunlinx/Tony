            ill let you go first   oh well whats there to say doesnt seem like its being carried out very well in my opinion seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that i dont see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody   yeah it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty   yeah   yeah i know what you mean um i in Maryland they they do have capital punishment and uh ive seen uh a lot of people get convicted sentenced and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals   yeah uhhuh well from what i understand i saw a statistic just a few days ago um so far this year year or was it during the last year somewhere during a years time i think it was they executed twenty five people in the nation meanwhile there were twenty five hundred people on death row so i i and its building up you know theyre theyre convicting them faster than theyre executing them so its really building up   yeah whats amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years and uh here in Maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons   uhhuh yeah everybodys got that   uh just yeah but i mean in here its uh to the point where they were letting prisoners go   uhhuh   uh commuting the sentences of those that were in in jail for lesser crimes   yeah   in order to put more people in into the jails and it was just uh amazing   uhhuh   to me and of course they made a big deal out of the the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out   yeah   and being rearrested and   isnt isnt Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was   uh i cant remember refresh my memory   it was uh that was the one that was used so much in the campaign in the political in the presidential race uh may it may not have been Maryland it may have been Massachusetts i dont remember   um i dont remember myself   anyway well the question is you know do you think it it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if its done right   um i think if they if they started executing them on a regular basis uh that i think it might make a difference right now i dont see it making a difference i dont see someone not going out there   if it   and committing murder because theyre afraid theyre going to get sentenced to death i mean most people out there committing murders like dont care   uhhuh   they just dont care   yeah well i think in large measure the reason they dont care its not because the punishment but so many of the people that commit crimes dont get punished   yeah   the police dont catch them or the courts dont convict them or or they dont serve very much of the time and so uh you know their their success rate is very high crime does pay cash you can make a good living at it   yeah yeah and theres uh theres a lot of people here in Baltimore that uh have and we just had uh a real big cocaine bust and of course you know theyre theyre playing it up real big that it was looked like it was a very very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy   yeah   but i mean uh Baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year i think theyve got over a hundred dead already this year   last year it was DC i guess Baltimore caught them   well its kind of its kind of moved up and you have to remember that it it it uh theres i think X number of people out there that are going to commit murders   uhhuh   and uh once you kill off a few of them  i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder   yeah yeah the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know the the violent people going against each other and so they you know societys not going to put them to death well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to uh i think i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently   yeah   i mean i i personally think life imprisonment i dont think much of life of life imprisonment first of all its never turns out to be life but second you know why should we the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole well that means youre going to put them in a cage you think its never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then why bother just execute them because thats that way youre sure theyll never ever going to walk the streets again   yeah   so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole id say uh give them the death penalty so   yeah you know it makes sense um you know you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but i mean uh so few and far between uh you know makes good TV movies and thats about it   yeah and and also um the the thing i dont like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that its not based on what is true and what is false but rather its on  the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell   yeah   and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly  towards finding out the truth than they currently are and and that way we can be sure you know we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened   yeah   and and base the verdict sentence on what the person did not on what were allowed to let the jury hear   yeah i had my uh my fatherinlaw participated in a uh a jury trial he was he was actually on the jury and uh this man was accused of killing uh i think it was two people uh and shooting a uh policeman um point blank in the face of course he didnt die and uh this was during a holdup of a uh uh a restaurant and it came out during the trial that um they had tried to rob another place   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple cookies and uh you know jumbo cookies and and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didnt work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started you know shooting people   just started shooting people   you know its   because they botched the first job and   yeah   so now theyre going to get even   yeah and get even with who i mean you know stupid guys   yeah   and uh it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy   uhhuh   and of course you know they tried to make the cop look out like he was uh a uh no good rotten drunk   yeah   i mean it was amazing   so what was the verdict what was the results there   oh he was found guilty yeah he uh   oh   last i heard he uh he beat a push for the death penalty now whether they finally got it or not i dont know i kind of uh   uhhuh   stopped listening after a while   uhhuh   um you know he would come home and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to decide you know after     the the penalty phase yeah theyve decide the penalty separately from the verdict   he had to go right and uh yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know lets burn him     uhhuh   and thats you know thats the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were       were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but i mean when it all came down they just within an hour decided the mans fate   yeah well you know you just have to decide you know what you well theres really two separate decisions there i guess one is did it really happen the way the the prosecutor said it happened you know is this man really guilty and you have to decide that but then you have to decide you know as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing   yeah   and that will i ive never been on a jury ive never had that experience im not sure id look forward to making that kind of decision about a mans life   yeah yeah well it it it went pretty pretty quick from what he said   uhhuh   but i mean theres theres theres a lot of other crimes out there i mean besides murder i think uh now if youre dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something   yeah   uh it theres uh a death penalty associated with it   well the thing id be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence i mean yeah i can handle people people selling drugs you know its its wrong but it its not worth somebody getting executed for but we hear so much about the violence and how its not safe to walk the streets because somebody you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing   uhhuh   and the people id most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life that you know you never know when theyre going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesnt really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not   yeah yeah i agree   and so i go lets these are the kind of people i would like to yeah get out of here and get out of circulation and say i dont we dont accept your kind in our society   yeah i agree i ive i have uh a low tolerance for that kind of uh that kind of person and uh as far as uh you know there are some some other crimes that i think uh you know kidnapping um you know when they i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh fine and penalty associated with it but   uhhuh   um some of these people are just out and out brutal i some of the cases ive heard about over the years
