        Kathy you you know im i was thinking about basketball teams and um the funny thing is when i was in college at BYU i followed the school team and um     hi uhhuh   and then when i graduated and we got married and everything i really kind of lost interest in following teams have you been following any   not too much um who is it from the Mavericks that just wasnt there some controversy about one of their players that didnt get to play so now he doesnt he didnt get to play the whole game so now he doesnt want to play at all or something   oh no i know theyre always having um i mean i cant believe the amount of money that the players make in the first place and i mean i know that they have a short um career and everything   its crazy right but even so i mean i dont think i will make a million in or three million  in a life time let alone a season   thats true its really a lot but uh my sister always gets um season tickets to the Utah Jazz and um   yep uhhuh   so she watches their games a lot and and everything but i dont believe weve ever been involved with any team that you know makes it to the playoffs   yeah yeah we came from Oakland i went to BYU also   too much uhhuh you did   yep any way and see um we use to go to some of the the games there but we really havent done much with the Mavericks here   well i was at uh BYU when they made it to the playoffs and i think they played Notre Dame or something   yeah   um for the big game i cant remember now that was so seems like it was eons ago it was like ten years ago i think and um i remember   uhhuh yeah yeah did you know let me think who was on that team there was a Dave Callus or a Gordon Breun remember those names   um isnt that the one that was like the star player was Danny Ainge i think he started playing for the Boston Boston Celtics after that   yeah Celtics right right   and um  and um and there was another the center its been so long i cant think of anyones name but um i i was there that year and enjoyed that game and uh but mostly like i say i havent been following the teams and dont know whos got what record   yeah right so do you play for your ward team   i havent played uh since i broke my knee cap  but um i did play in high school i was on our high school girls team   oh oh uhhuh where did you go to high school   well i lived in Missouri and i went and i played for Parkview High School in Missouri in Springfield Missouri and i played um a forward   oh uhhuh   and um i enjoyed that then and thats i always loved sports do you play for your ward   yeah um i kind of stopped playing for my ward because i didnt like the sportsmanship with the stake   the problem that is a problem   so i play for a Richardson City league now   uhhuh   but as far as knowing anything about professional teams you know when they said to put put down what youre interested in i i wasnt really thinking about  talking about   no well i was thinking about my own personal basketball experiences as opposed to professional because id rather play than watch any thing   right  right right   and um so im you know like i   do you have any players that you like watching   well i um i have one i dont like his name his last name was Sampson do you remember him and he because he came to Houston when i lived there and um to play for the Houston team and he was really   yeah   i thought a bad sport and uh and i havent followed like i say   yeah it really only takes one player to really give any team a bad rap you know one that   umhum umhum yeah thats really true but um   publicity bound you know that   well and i also dont want to spend so much of my time um memorizing statistics   right   and um keeping you know  being wrapped up in a team and caring whether they win or lose in the sense that it makes a big difference in my life you know because i just dont have that kind of time     yeah thats right you know once it gets into the finals then i i kind of root for one or the other but up until then you know   umhum thats true and and you know i get i have interest in the games but im satisfied to watch a score in the newspaper or on you know the sports news report or something   yeah the highlights   right rather than just like you say watch clips from the game   do you have kids that play   no i my both my children are little theyre just in kindergarten and first grade   yeah yeah   so no they dont play and um and my husband loves baseball which i dont really prefer but   oh yeah   so we havent uh havent dont been into basketball too much but anyway   oh did you stay with now what team is it from Houston   now i can remember even what they were called um   i wanna say Spurs but is that right   no i dont think so no it was the Astros the Astros were the baseball team and the Oilers Rockets yes thats it the Rockets   yeah Rockets   yeah   yeah i uh you know we saw a game
