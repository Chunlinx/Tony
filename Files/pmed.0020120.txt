                            The case report by Nautiyal et al  is an instructive reminder that the first episode        of an acute painful Horner Syndrome should prompt imaging of the ipsilateral internal        carotid artery since carotid dissection as well as other conditions such as highgrade        stenosis needs to be ruled out Unfortunately the authors perpetuate the extremely common        misconception that enophthalmos accompanies ptosis and miosis in human Horner Syndrome It        is only an illusion of enophthalmos caused by the ptosis This is evident in the left eye        of their patient in Figure  of the case report        Actual measurement with exophthalmometry clearly demonstrates the lack of enophthalmos        As stated by Loewenfeld  p  Animals such as cats rats or dogs have        enophthalmos on the side of the sympathetic lesion But in man the enophthalmos is only        apparent The small palpebral fissure makes the eye look sunken in on the affected side        but the position of the globe in the orbit remains virtually unchanged This has been found        by all workers who have measured the supposed enophthalmos objectively Loewenfeld cites        four supportive references        Thompson and Miller  p  provide four additional references that the        enophthalmos is apparent rather than real
