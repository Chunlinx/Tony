                                 The Right To Be a Boor            With the Paula Jones caseand the sexual harassment debate wearing thin a new crisis looms on theemployment horizon demanding our urgent attention According to a recent calledDiversity in the Power Elite Have Women and Minorities Reached theTop  highly placed corporate white men are fretting over the slow butsteady rise of women blacks and Latinos to elite positions in the workplaceAre they worried that these new arrivals will take away their jobs NoAccording to the study what they fear is that women and minorities wont begood at playing golf            OKaccusing a man of golf anxiety isnt quite the same as alleging that he loweredhis pants in front of a subordinate and requested service But far from makinga trivial point the diversity study shows that the prosecutorial way we thinkabout gender in the workplace may not always be helpful During the past fewmonths Kenneth Starrs limitless pursuit of Clinton has caused sensible peopleto wonder if weve let the battle against sexual harassment turn into a witchhunt I agree that courts arent equipped to resolve many issues of gender onthe jobnot because the results are unjust but because theyre unsubtle            How could the courts possibly deal with golf anxietySurely a person has every right to converse with colleagues who play golfSurely he also has a right to assume that a new employee doesnt play golfLikewise hes entitled to appear shy or unfriendly around her and perhapsunintentionally hamper her ability to network inside the company and even thenassume she lacks initiative and give her a mediocre job evaluation But suchobtuse behavior even if legal causes suffering and its worth talking aboutaway from the blunt guiltyorinnocent logic of the law            Arrivingas it does on the tail end of the Paula Jones disaster Frances K Conleysmemoir of sexism at Stanford may encounter a kind of sexualconflict fatigueand miss the attention it deserves Its a treasure trove of messy not alwayscourtworthy genderjob dilemmas that nevertheless need to be explored Conleythe first tenured woman professor of neurosurgery in the country tells how sheleft Stanford University School of Medicine back in  after  years ofcontented teaching and research Traditionally of course neurosurgery hasbeen the elite macho pinnacle of medicineits Navy SEALs So at first glancewhen you consider how steely Conley had to be to rise in the field the eventthat provoked her to leave sounds pretty innocuous A colleague named GerrySilverberg got promoted to be head of the program Conley whod worked withGerry since they were in medical school thought he was a jerk            Sounds so far like a depressing but routinepower contest Where did sex come in Stirred by her anger Conley eventuallybegan to face facts about Gerry that she had suppressed over two decades inorder to concentrate on work She recalled how in years past during traininghe made a juvenile habit of propositioning her in front of other malestudentsreally propositioning her thrusting his pelvis in her face andsaying how much shed like it In recent years hed interrupted her duringcomplex brain surgery and shouted laughing Hows it going hon All in allGerry was a charmer            Conleyhad to admit that while Gerry had no rivals as a pig he was hardly alone inhis insensitivity When she was a med student all but a couple of generousmale advisers had told her paternalistically to give up her neurosurgerydreams and stick with a nice female discipline like obstetrics One day shefinally got the courage to knock on the door of the department chair and ask ifshe could join the program He answered the door with his pantsstring undoneand a glance at the couch indicated hed been screwing his secretary As ayoung faculty member she attended weekly lunches because thats where thenetworking action was They were gross childish stag affairs In plain sightof everyone one colleague would caress her thigh daring her to make him stopand inviting all the men in the room to giggle Then the urologists at thetable would speculate about who among their colleagues could get it up            One may ask why Conley put up with this for so long Its afair question Until the spring of  she says shed basically identifiedwith men Wrapped and totally immersed within the competitive cocoon ofacademic medicine living every day at a great distance from the real worldI was all but oblivious to the fact that a womans movement had started andselfishly had no idea how other women in my own world were faring Conleyswriting voice even has something of a macho swagger and once in a while ithits a false note as if she were building her broad case against the medicalprofession in order to get back at Gerry the vulgar meanie At times too thecool expertise vs righteousness wit vs no sense of humor become almost toovivid as if she werent a reallife polemicist so much as an intriguingfictional character            But hereswhere the case gets really fascinating Conley says she never intended to takelegal action She just felt Gerry would make an intolerable leader and when hegot promoted she impulsively resigned Then she naively sent a rambling opedpiece to the San Francisco Chronicle  outliningin general termsnaming no namesthe sexist atmosphere at Stanford The piece wasnt publishedright away Instead a reporter called wheedled an interview out of her andwithout informing her ran a frontpage story about her claimsNightline    NPR etc came along and ran storiesportraying her as a crusader against sexual harassmenta loaded phrase witha specific legal import which she had never used            Now all this happened just a few months beforeAnita Hill announced to a TV audience that Clarence Thomas had left a pubichair in her Coke In retrospect the media transformation of Conleys caselooks like a rehearsal for its circuslike approach to HillThomas Conley hadhoped to spark a general discussion of sexism in the medical academicprofession Instead the media claim of sexual harassment reorganized the debateinto a contest of personal adversaries Stanford as big and powerfulinstitutions tend to do called for hearings Conley feeling that she shouldsee through what she had unleashed returned to work in a Cold War atmosphereA two year agony of factfinding panels and legal actions ensued with losersboth male and female Scapegoat men were singled out for behavior theirprofession had never before discouraged women who told of being pressured forsex found themselves alone laughed at or forced by the hostile environment toleave            It tookages to resolve but in the end Gerry didnt get to be department chair thoughthe two are somewhat horrifyingly still colleagues Conley after becoming akind of national clearinghouse for complaints about sexism in medical schoolstraveled the college circuit to discuss flaws in both theory and practice ofmedical instruction But often she says the resulting reforms have beencosmetica token lowlevel bureaucrat assigned to hear problems with noforum to do anything about them Which isnt surprising Who would want to gothrough this kind of divisive battle every time an allegation came up            Thats one problem with our current approach to sexualharassment As weve just seen in the Paula Jones case its exhaustingEveryone gets tired of the ransacking of private lives the cynical search forulterior motives the weighing of imperfect evidence after a while people arelikely to say Just let it go Theres another problem too The focus onlegalistic descriptions of punishable human behavior ignores unconsciousbehavior the habits many men are accustomed to that dont call for punishmentbut are still harmfulwhat Conley says occurs within the reverberatingcircuitry of maleness The best parts of Conleys book are about deepinstitutional resistance to change the way that otherwise admirable maleprofessors understandably draw on their training of  years ago which assumedthe  kilogram male body as the human norm and left them totally ignorant offemale health problems the way training in elite specialties like neurosurgerystill promotes a specific kind of cowboy bravado which encourages women tobail out for gynecology On these issues Conley raises difficult importantquestions Unfortunately crude history will more likely reduce her to anotherrole as a pioneer of the hesaidshesaid s                           If youmissed the links in the text click to read
