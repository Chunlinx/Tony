                                  Hillary vs Bill            If Hillary Clinton runs forthe US Senate in New York next year shell have two crucial advantages Oneis that her last name is Clinton The other is that her first name isnt BillThe emerging spin behind her candidacy is that shes her husbands moralopposite Shes been his victim shes been faithful and now its her turnBut thats only one dimension in which the Clintons differ Republicans whooppose Hillary Clintons candidacy are gearing up to exploit anotherdifference her comparative liberalism on matters of policy            A year ago Republicanattacks on Hillary Clintons involvement in Whitewater and Filegate might havehurt her But nowadays talking about those scandals reminds people less of theClintons suspicious behavior than of the GOPs impeachment jihad Indeed partof the logic behind her candidacy is to ride the antiimpeachment backlashMrs Clinton would serve as a constant reminder of the GOP effort to oust herhusband observes the Wall Street Journal  She could help driveDemocratic voters to the polls sweeping several of New Yorks congressionalRepublicans out of office A scandalbased Republican attack would only makethings worse If their campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton is to simply bean extension of the Starr investigation Sen Bob Torricelli DNJ theDemocrats Senate campaign chairman warned on Meet the Press  theyregoing to take a sizable Hillary lead and make it into a rout            Its true that the public remains angry at Mrs Clintonshusband But the genius of her candidacy is that she gets to ride thatbacklash too Her advisers told the New York Times that shes veryenticed by the idea of at last having an independent voice particularly afterher husband  publicly humiliated her last year This story line plays tomoralists as well as to feminists If youre mad at the president the argumentgoes support the woman he cheated on            The media have fallenhead over heels for this spin Her Turn says Newsweek s cover ARace of Her Own agrees Time  A New York Times editorial saysher candidacy could allow her to untangle herself from the political side ofher marriage and compete for a power base that is all her own Many women mightante up a campaign contribution just in the hopes of seeing Mrs Clinton swornin on the day that her husband becomes unemployed  If the Presidentannounces that it is now Hillarys turn to shine and his to take on the jobsof campaign cheerleader and family breadwinner even many of the couplescritics would agree it is about time            The pose of the wronged but everfaithful wife also helpsHillary Clinton in two other ways It raises her to an even higher pedestalprompting the media to ask not whether shes up to the job of senator butwhether shes too good for it Meanwhile the pedestal lifts her above thecharge of carpetbagging Torricelli says she would be part of a greattradition of icons who have used New Yorks Senate seats as a platform fromwhich to enlighten the whole nation            Hillary Clintons likelyRepublican opponent New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani understands the peril of theimpeachment mess and is wisely steering clear of it I was one who didntbelieve that President Clinton should have been impeached so no I would notbring it up the mayor declared on This Week  Instead he vowed toconfront his likely foe on issues such as taxes welfare reform nationalhealth insurance and her advocacy of a Palestinian state SuperficiallyGiulianis argument is that shes too liberal But he has added a clever twistto the argument turning Hillary Clintons strategy on its head Shesdifferent from her husband all right says the mayor The difference is thatshes out of the mainstream            On This Week  Giuliani twice likened his own viewsto those of President Clinton and contrasted them with Hillarys more radicalviews On the Middle East said Giuliani Im in the same position as theWhite House and Mrs Clinton is out there much more heavily favoring thePalestinians Later when asked about his initiative to require homelesspeople to get jobs or leave their homeless shelters Giuliani said theinitiative emerges from the mandates of the welfare reform bill that wassigned by President Clinton And what it says is that when you seek shelter we will engage you in a process of trying to find work for you as opposed toletting you become dependent As for Hillary Clinton the mayor allowed Shemay be in a different position            Mrs Clintons strategists worry openly about thisline of attack Lets say she disagrees with her husband on trade policy onemember of her team told the Times  It will be trumpeted as a big dealIn a mock strategy memo published in Newsweek  former Clinton adviserGeorge Stephanopoulos asked her What if the president undercuts your mosteffective campaign issue by making a deal with Republicans on partialprivatization of Social Security and tax cuts Will you take a stand or standby your man            Therein lies her dilemmaOn Meet the Press  former Nixon strategist Bill Safire explained how shecould beat the extremism rap She can do what her husband has done over theyears and that is reassess things  She can make a visit to Israel beembraced get a lot of pictures over there and move from the left toward thecenter talking more about getting people off welfare and balancing budgetsTorricelli is already working on this script saying Clinton would make veryclear that she supports this peace process  from the perspective of anadministration that has probably been more helpful to Israel and its securitythan any president in American history One step to the left two steps to theright Thats what people love about her husbands politicsand what they hateabout his character
