She doesnt compare thereverse that is installing Windows from scratch on a machine with Linuxpreinstalled on it It is no piece of cake if not downright impossible forthe average user to perform this sort of install Installing Linux on a PC withWindows already loaded is far easier            In fact people like Truitt do not generallyinstall their own operating systems of any type and make heavy use of helpdesks on a daytoday basis to keep their systems running She talks aboutconfiguring printers connecting to networks and so forth on LinuxI wonderif she has ever done the same on a Windows machine Very few computer usersinstall their own operating systems these days they buy their computers withthe system preloaded There are plenty of vendors who sell Intel boxes withLinux preinstalled including Dell VA Research and so on            Truitt writes compare that with Windows  for a full setup  for an upgrade or bundled for free as part of nearlyevery nonMacintosh computer I think that it is pretty nonsensical to makethe statement that Windows is free under any circumstances Nor does Truittnote that when you get Linux from any of a variety of sources you get far morethan just the OS that Windows  users are accustomed to You get a fulldevelopment system with an unlimited serverbased OS The equivalent softwarewould cost upward of  if you were to try to duplicate it fromMicrosoftan unlimited client version of Windows NT costs  Thedatabases programming tools and applications included in Linux are worth manythousands moreif you can find them at all for Windows NT            If you

   Free forAll                        I just read Andrew Shumans  and I feel I have towrite to make a few points The very first paragraph contains a stunning numberof errors Linus Torvalds is the original author of the Linux kernel but he isby no means the author of Linux There are literally thousands ofpeople both programmers and nonprogrammers who have made contributions tothe Linux distributions Linux is not derived from an operating systemcalled GNU GNU is not an operating system but a software suite that runs onmany operating systems mostly Unixbased OSs but Windows is also supportedby many of the packages The proper name for Linux is Linux not GNULinuxAnd just for your information there is a GNU operating system indevelopment its called the HURD and it is different in a number of respectsfrom Unix            Shuman makes the claim that just because software isfreely distributable the authors have no means of recompense for their workThat is simply untruethere are many ways that software can remain free butstill allow the authors to get paid just look at RedHat or Netscape            Then Shuman claims that Linux provides no graphicaluser interface The truth is that you have a choiceif you want a textinterface you can have it if you prefer a graphical interface thats fine tooShuman also makes the totally unsubstantiated and untrue claims that there isvery little in the way of application software for Linux and that very fewpeople use it The latest estimates of the number of Linux users run into themillionshow can that be so few            Then Shuman claims that free software is less testedthan commercial software I use both commercial software and free software inthe course of my work Im adminstrator of a large number of NT and Unixcomputer systems and its pretty clear to me that its the freesoftware that is rigorously tested and the commercial software that getsreleased just as soon as it appears to run Why Because the incentive to anauthor of free software is to make her package the best so releasinginadequately tested software will do the authors personal reputation no goodat all The incentive to a commercial author is to get the application on theshelf so she can derive income from it if Version  happens to have bugs init the bug fixes become a selling point for Version             Im not anticommercialsoftware or even antiMicrosoft I am in favor of choice and freedom thoughand your article doesnt exactly encourage readers to exercise their choice andfreedom             SteveBennett                        Lancaster England                           Zero ZeroSum                        It doesnt make a big difference to meor Isuspect to most Linux userswhether Truitt Shuman or any other Windowsusers like Linux or not see  Most Linux contributors dont primarilycare about competing with Microsoft or decreasing Bill Gatess wealth orgiving away something for free Linux contributors simply are creating systemsthey themselves enjoy using and find productive                        The main reason Linux users are increasinglyconcerned about Microsoft is because Microsoft increasingly attempts to setproprietary standards for how data are exchanged That is technical and legaldocuments are often found in Microsoft Word formats access to online andbanking services often requires the use of Microsoftonly software multimediadata often come in Microsoftonly formats and hardware often only ships withMicrosoftonly drivers This is not because Microsoftbased systems arenecessarily better but because Microsoft is the biggest player and thatswhat companies are going to focus their efforts on when writing drivers andsoftware there are after all only limited resources for writing drivers andfrontend software            So the concerns Linux users have about Windows arerelated to whether network effects involving proprietary content formats aregoing to exclude them from some areas of public and commercial life Just likeTruitt would not enjoy being forced to struggle with Linux most Linux usersdont enjoy being forced to do their work on Windows using its WIMPinterface            Microsoft needs tobecome more sensitive to concerns about interoperability and open standardsRecent efforts by Microsoft in the areas of XML and other Web standards areencouraging Clear support for Sun Java would also be good and would in thelong run benefit Microsoft I hope that as Microsoft matures so will itsattitude toward standards and cooperation The computer market is big enoughthat it does not

Elegance is not synonymous with simple Rather it refers to the mostterse solution to a problem Such a solution will tend to be cryptic tothe uninitiated Therefore elegant is most often used by those

           Emperor Has NoClothes                        Please note in your fascinating  on harakirithat there is one point on which I believe you are mistaken In feudal Japanesesociety the person who would order suicides in place of executions was theshogun or military leader of Japan Emperors excepting the period from thelate  th century to the end of World War II have yielded little ifany power in Japanese society            One fascinating exampleof ritual suicide in  th century Japan that still regularly appearsin movies and television in Japan is the story of the  samurai According tothis actual historical account an adviser to a Tokugawa period shogunantagonized a rival to the point where this rival drew his sword This alloccurred in front of the shogun which meant serious trouble becausedisplaying a weapon in the shoguns presence was punishable by death Despitethe fact that he was forced into this situation the offending adviser wassentenced to death and committed suicide as you described in your magazineAfter this  of the condemned officials samurai decided to take revengeThey coordinated an attack on the enemy adviser and murdered him Honor calledon them to avenge their masters death but the laws forbade murder Afterregaining their masters honor all  samurai went to their masters grave andalso committed harakiri to take responsibility for breaking the law The siteof these samurais graves is still a wellvisited location in Tokyo                           MikeCojerian                        Princeton NJ
