                                 Nerd vs Nebbish            You can talk aboutglobalization the sexual revolution or the civil rights movement But one ofthe greatest upheavals of the century is the liberation of the nerd Many havenoted the rise of the Silicon Valley programmer and the iconification of BillGates Few have placed these developments in context Nerds once defined assquares and losers now also lord over Washington Newt Gingrich Al Gore andHollywood Steven Spielberg Quentin Tarantino            Just asthe womens rights movement revolutionized malefemale relations so also hasthis movement created its own turmoil With the advent of the power nerd wecan no longer say for certain what makes a nerd a nerd Or to put it anotherway what now separates the nerds from the nebbishes The time has come toreassess and redefine the loser            Nobodynot William Safire not the Oxford EnglishDictionary has concretely pinned down the origin of the word nerd One theory traces it to a throwaway passage in Dr Seuss lesserknown childrens book If I Ran the Zoo  Another considers it a variation ofthe s putdown nerts to you  as in nuts to you A third derives itfrom turd             Whateverits origins the appellation rose to prominence in the s the High Age ofConformity when boomers employed it to condemn the most conformist of theconformists the squarest of the squares And the phrase conjured up a specificimage the greasy pocketprotected teen in thick hornrimmed glasses            Clearly the unstylish klutzy bookworm hasexisted throughout history Einstein is an obvious example of a nerd whopredated the term But nerdiness became well defined only after the birth ofits oppositecoolnessduring the prosperous postwar era as the middle classexpanded to include vast new segments of the population These newconstituencies adopted bourgeois values among them a fixation withfashionwhats cool and whats not Nerdy was not            But thepopular understanding of nerdinessthat a nerd is an uncool persondoesntstand the test of time In particular it doesnt survive the s an era theNew York Times deemed was characterized by nerd chic By the middle ofthe gogo decade fashion magazines touted the popularity of nerdcoutureplaid plants horn rims and oxford shirts buttoned all the way to thetop Further witness the proliferation of s teen movies valorizing nerdsRevenge of the Nerds  Weird Science  and Real Genius  toname a few Underlying this transformation of the nerds image was atransformation of the nerds economic status With their entry into newhightech industries many nerds suddenly became millionerds            Let me posit a more durable definition than the nerdcoolopposition Nerdiness is connoisseurship gone awry The essentialcharacteristic of nerds is that they lack a normal understanding of style andsocial graces The essential reason they get this way is that as youths theychannel their mental energies into a particular areafilm computerspoliticsat the expense of learning social conventions Nerds may or may notcarry their adolescent obsession into adulthood but the scars of theirobsession remain palpable Note Rare is the person who becomes a nerd laterin life Bill Clinton for instance may have developed an unusual passion forpolicy in his s but it never interfered with his social being            Thepopular parlance conflates nerd with nebbish  But the overlapbetween the two concepts is not large more on the order of this            While one could build a Nerd Hall of Famenebbishes are almost always anonymous By definition nebbishes are whinerslacking selfconfidence generally inept and on the losing end of socialtransactionsall characteristics that work against their ever achieving fameThe only famous nebbishes are fictional characters George Costanza IsaacBashevis Singers Gimple the Fool George McFly in Back to the Future and virtually anyone played by Woody Allen or Rick Moranis            Other attributes Nebbishes are necessarily schlumpy never handsome or physically robust  Theterm is usually applied to menoften implying effeminacy But it would not beinaccurate to describe a woman as a nebbish or as nebbishy  Few nebbishesare actually nerds or intellectualssome Woody Allen characters excepted Theylack the nerds enterprise and obsessivesness By contrast many nerds can behandsome Gore or selfconfident to the point of arrogance GatesGingrich            At theheart of the nerdnebbish divide is pity Nebbishes are too pathetic to warrantactual disdain They are too easy a target On the other hand nerds evokeenvy We hate them because they are smarter or more studious or more focusedthan we are Nerds are genuinely threatening            It is no accident that the word nebbish originatedin Yiddish a language without a nation that is spoken by a people repeatedlybeaten down by pogroms and thus in a good position to empathize with nebbishesSo to pose the obvious question Is there something inherently Jewish aboutthe nebbish According to the great Yiddish linguist Max Weinreich Jewsappropriated the word nebbich from their Slavic neighbors in the th century Indeed other European nations with similar historiesof subjugation maintain similar words In Ukrainian for instance the wordbidni refers to an unfortunate pitiable soul Italian haspoverino  The fact that nebbish made it into English owes much to JewishBorscht Belt comedians becoming s TV stars            Nebbishes will never ascendto the heights of nerds There will be no Revenge of the Nebbishes  nonebbish liberation A nebbish could never gain real power More easily one canimagine nebbishes banding together to promote a nebbish agenda kvetching thatthey are systematically discriminated against demanding Nebbish Studies atuniversities and complaining that history textbooks treat them as losers Butonly a schmegegge would ever bet on a nebbish                           Thanks to Charles
