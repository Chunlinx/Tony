                                 The Unexamined Game Is Not Worth Watching            As an achiever I constantlylook for new techniques of achievement and seek to minimize behaviors with lowachievement yield Thus it is only natural that I have begun to worry about theamount of time I spend watching sports on televisionan activity that does notmeasurably advance any of my personal or professional agendas            Most alarmingly sports havebecome a steel curtain between me and my family My wife and three daughtersshun me when I turn on a ballgame Occasionally I try to relate to the kidsby asking them to fetch Daddy a beer but I sense that they are driftingawaythat I have become for them every bit as useless burdensome andlowyielding in immediate practical utility as they are for me            I realized that somethinghad to change I needed to take firm decisive action            And so Imade a solemn vow I would teach my wife and kids to watch sports with me            Yes I would And something more I would become a bettermore sophisticated more deeply engaged viewer of TV sports I would become aman for whom sports viewership is not just a bad habit but a skill            I have sought counsel fromexperts and engaged in rigorous tests in my own home What follows are somesimple precepts for Next Level sports viewership            The very first thing you mustdo before we get into any actual viewing techniques is ask yourself whysports are an important part of your life Why do sports matter Do you likesports because they show that effort practice and innovation lead to positiveresults Because sports are an outlet for our primitive barbarian hostilitiesBecause in sports we discover a dramatic metaphor for our desire to move intonew terrain and reach goals that can be statistically measured The answer toall these questions is Dont be stupid You watch sports for the simple reasonthat sports dont matter a jot You like sports precisely because of theirutter insignificance You find this relaxing Always remember the preeminentrule of the sports junkie                            Dontstart thinking like George Will                        Next you must configureyour viewing area For help in this regard I called Steve Sabol president ofNFL Films Inc the company that produces Inside the NFL for HBO SabolI knew watches a heroic amount of football from which he gleans thehighlights for his films NFL Films has a signature style Sweaty gruntingmuddy men move in super slow motion while the baritone narrator describes theevents as though the fate of nations hung in the balance Sabol a formercollege football player says Thats the way I wanted to show the game withthe snot spraying the sweat flying Football is a very visceral sport Beforewe started it was always filmed from the top and it looked like a little chessset            His viewing procedures arequite advanced Every Sunday he watches three games at once I have a littlecockpit thats built in my den Theres one set the predominant game thatson a inch TV and I have two inch TVs that are slanted inward So itslike a cockpit You have to have good peripheral vision and you have to reallyconcentrate            So thats the next tip                            Getmore and bigger televisions                        If you have only a singleinch television and you cant afford to upgrade just sit a lot closer Ifyou get close enough to the set its almost as good as going out and buying amultithousanddollar home theater            Sabol said he has to take theoccasional pit stop but even that is conveniently arranged            Thebathrooms right by the set If I have to take a piss I can still see thescreen                            Keepyour eye on the screen at all times even when you are trying to trim a childstoenails                        Sabol said he sits in aRelaxaback chair a kind of recliner but cautions that this is not for thenovice The worstcase scenario for the sports viewer is the unplanned napThose are dangerous I only recommend those for the more experienced viewersYou need stamina to do this You need a good nights sleep You have to becareful about having too big a breakfast because that will put you to sleepThe trick is to have a series of small snacks for a hour period                            Cometo the television rested Dont eat mealsgraze                        Sabol reckons that on agiven Sunday he starts watching at  am and doesnt stop until  pm atthe end of the cableTV broadcast Before his divorce his wife didnt quiteunderstand that this was work he says            Now comes the harder stuffthe actual watchingthe seeing if you willof the actions on the screen Youmust keep in mind that you are not directly watching an event but rather arewatching a produced and directed telecast of an event manipulated by talentedbut not infallible professionals To better understand how a sports program isput together I called Rudy Martzke the TV sports columnist for USAToday  who watches between  and  hours of TV sports a week on theinch Pioneer screen in his family room            Martzke is full of facts andwelleducated opinions The typical Monday Night Football broadcast usesabout  cameras compared with only about eight for Foxs primary game Sundayafternoon Goodyears Steadycam allows sharpfocus blimp shots even when theblimp is being blown all over the sky the glowing puck used on Fox hockeygames is officially called Fox Trax Bob Costas at NBC is the best host in thebusiness and Al Michaels at ABC is the best playbyplay guy            Unseen to viewers butextremely important are the producers and directors            The director is the guy whocalls the shots you see on the screen Hes the one who inserts the graphicssays Martzke Got a guy sitting next to him whos called the technicaldirector The director when he yells out the instructions cut to thispicture that picture this camera that camera the guy who follows him upphysically is the technical director The producer sits to the left of thedirector The producer is the one who gets in the replays the one whos incharge of the format of the show He makes sure all those commercial breaks getin so theyre paid            Obviously only Rudy Martzkeever thinks twice about these people but this creates a chance for you tosound authoritative when someone challenges you on your sportsviewershipexpertise Let other people talk about who caught what pass or made whattackle you can say things like Sandy Grossman uses downandyardage graphicsbetter than any director in the game            The point of all thisis                            Neverlet anyone know that youve forgotten the                name of theannouncer                        The hardest part of all isknowing what to look for when you watch television In basketball for examplethe referee will often blow the whistle and call illegal defense which fewviewers ever see in advance This is because they are only watching the ballIllegal defense occurs when a defender plays zone rather than mantoman Thusyou should always look for someone whos just guarding a patch of the courtstanding around looking suspicious When you detect an illegal defense beforethe referee makes the call you have completely arrived as a TV sportsviewer            In baseball dont just watchthe flight of the ball from the pitchers hand toward the batter Look directlyat the pitchers hand and see if you can see what kind of grip hes usingthatwill tell you whether its a curve slider fastball splitter knuckleball orwhatever            In golf look at the wristsand elbows of the golfer as he or she putts The great ones have almost nomovement in their arms wrists and hands other than the gentlest of pendulumswings            In hockey change channelsYou will never see the puck            When Sabol watches a footballgame he scrutinizes an area in front of the runner and including the runnerIts a semicircle with a radius of about  yards he estimates                           Expand your zone of attention                        In preliminary tests with myown family I determined that they have a long long long way to go beforethey are majorleague sports fans One Sunday I plunked my two oldest daughtersin chairs directly in front of the set and channelsurfed from baseball tobasketball to womens golf to figure skating During the basketball game mymediumsized daughter who is not quite  said of Joe Dumars Is that agirl So the first thing we will do with this particular daughter is work ongender identification            Both daughters meanwhilehave decided to become figure skaters when they grow up You can see that thisis drifting into a scary area I might teach them to watch sports ontelevision but they might decide that sports includes massive doses of BrianBoitano and Oksana Baiul My natural inclination is to watch figure skatingquadrennially            Mary my wife is simply alost cause She is an extremely discerning person who can detect the mostsubtle spice in a bowl of soup or a whisper of colored thread in a suit jacketbut for some reason she can stare at a basketball game on television and missthe important details such as the ball going into the hoop            What just happened Idemanded to know after Michael Jordan made a jump shot during a Chicago Bullsgame            I dont know I was stillthinking about the last commercial she said                            Dontpay attention to the commercials the                squeakiness of the basketballcourt the spitting in the dugout the sweating or fluids of any kind                        Once thetechniques of viewing are mastered there remains a major step analysis Thereis no point in watching if one is not really seeing anything Sabol gave me afinal tip that I will carry with me the rest of my years                           Prepare                        You have to come into thegame prepared You have to come into watching the game with your own gameplan Sabol said What are you going to look for What are the keys to thegame            Its a rule from scouting Beprepared Think ahead Anticipate problems and possible solutions If you pickup the book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People  you will seethat one of the habits is be proactive Do not wait for the ballgame ontelevision to come to you You can go to the ballgame mentally emotionallyproactively You can be a better sports viewer than anyone on your blockanyone with
