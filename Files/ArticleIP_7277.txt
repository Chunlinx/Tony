tooaffectionate When were eating in public she likes to play footsie under thetable That would be OKI enjoy playing footsiebut she likes to tease me bydigging her heel into my bare toes I usually wear sandals often when Imordering She then watches me squirm to appear nonchalant in front of ourserver My question is this How do I gently ask her to play nice withouthurting her feelings                                       Ouch ThatHurts                        DearOuch            Without hurting herfeelings It sounds to Prudie like your dominatrix friend ispassiveaggressive with only a tiny quotient of the passive            Prudiedoes not like to be bossy but she strongly suggests you do the followingsince she divines you are not going to change your shoes Next time MissIntelligent Attractive and Affectionate decides to stab you with her heelscream bloody murderand dont hold back You will attract momentary attentionfrom the other diners but it will be worth it This maneuver is calledsending her neurosis back to her If the darling girl asks why you have neverhollered before simply tell her you were not interested in playing her gamesbut now you are            Prudie

happenstanceforces one into consulting with someone on the boss staff I dont mean to beindelicate but retching was very close at hand when that person talkedPrudie this vile odor was beyond belief                                       SincerelyDorothy SShreveport La                        DearDor            Prudie too has livedthrough this a few times What she has done is try to seem casual and arrangeher hand so it covers her nose One wants to be helpful and alert the personbut it is a very difficult thing to do            If it ismore than a passing acquaintance you might want to risk the personsembarrassment in order to be helpful with a remark something like I hope youdont take offense but I feel sure you would want to know that somehow yourbreath has turned sour or your lunch is lingering or whatever you arecomfortable saying Granted it is easier to get away quickly and saynothing            Prudie breathlessly                                             DearPrudie                                                      Recently you published aletter asking if you must use skills not in your job descriptionjust because you have them This is in fact a legal question In Virginia foran employee of a private company absent contractual provisions to thecontrary the answer would be a resounding yes Not only can employers askthey can require it and if you refuse more than once to do something youremployer has asked just because nobody put it in your job description youmight even be denied unemployment benefits when they fire you                                       In my experienceemployers tend to be relatively uninterested in people whining about whatsomeone else should be doing In the case of the fellow who wrote I would givepriority to my own work but help out to the extent that I could withoutneglecting my tasks It is generally safe to check what the boss wants                                       Thisis not legal advice do not rely upon it If you have a problem seek the adviceof an attorney usual disclaimers etc etc                                       AEG                        DearAE            Thank youfor your expertise about employment law at least in Virginia The wild cardyou may have overlooked is that our computerexpert correspondent was not beingasked by his boss to help everybody Instead coworkers themselves werefalling on his neck seeking help In addition to job description issues ourwriter was trying to determine where goodguyness intersected with doormathoodAnd you raise a pertinent point for Prudie She is not practicing
