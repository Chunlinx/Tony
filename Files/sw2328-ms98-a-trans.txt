                    do you have children   my children are thirty three twenty nine and twenty five   okay   and i uh am spending more time with my twenty five year old because at this point he happens to be single and always has been single and living at home uh while hes trying to uh   uhhuh uhhuh     find a nice girl and get married  theyre little right right theyre a little hard to come by so anyway hes still here uh   thats a hard process isnt it   the only thing i can say about the raising of these little things is that my sonsinlaw seem to be so much more involved than my husband ever was or the husbands of our age group   uhhuh uhhuh im kind of at the other extreme i have a nine month old and one that will be born in October   oh how wonderful we had uh an October baby on the fifteenth May   uhhuh oh really yeah thats when my nephews birthday is and he goes well you should have it on the fifteenth so well see     yeah  well my husbands is on the fourteenth so we did miss that one day by a few hours there but we didnt care at that point so     yeah at its that close   so do you find your husband more involved than your father was with you   yeah i he definitely i had an unusual situation with in my home my father was was alcoholic but uh and very withdrawn at that and so my husband is ten times more involved and we have more of a   um     uh i guess a Christian based home and so we try to make the family as important as we can     uhhuh   and uh uh and i guess you dont have to have a Christian based home to to feel that way but thats just part of our priorities thats right  it certainly gives you some some specific specific goals to work towards but uh   Christianity doesnt hurt us any does it umhum   he helps a lot with her he helps feeding her changing her and playing with her and and i think he has to be conscious of of uh needing to spend time with her if not then he gets wrapped up in the TV and the newspaper and whatever else and he says oh i didnt spend time with Emily   uhhuh uhhuh   but if he forgets i try to to help him remember   uhhuh and perhaps Emily will when shes a little older     i think so   uhhuh uh how do you find uh with an alcoholic father how do you find how what effect do you think that has on your life as an adult     i think uh ive been reading a lot lately about the alcohol children of alcoholics syndrome i dont know if youve heard of that or not   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh trying to relate that to me and i think because i had a strong Christian background personally it affected me differently than it affected my sisters and i see myself uh with some of those qualities but with not quite as much anger   uhhuh uhhuh   as i see them towards him or towards my mother with certain things and uh   uhhuh   as far as me personally i think it made me appreciate my husband more because he doesnt do certain things that my dad did so i   uhhuh uhhuh the reason im asking is because i have a dear dear friend whose father was alcoholic and at fifty she and she was an only child at fifty shes still still having a lot of difficulty in her relationship with her husband that she feels stems from how she was treated by her father   uhhuh   and how she feels that she has to control everything and from her readings she feels that that comes from the fact that her father was alcoholic over which of course she had no control   uhhuh i think thats thats how i feel too i feel a need to dominate certain things and i try real hard not to be to too domineering with with Emily     uhhuh   because i dont want to my mother was also a domineering type of personality because she had to take over the things that my dad fell short in   uhhuh   and i find you know i think okay i want Emily to be this way and this is what im going to do to make her be that way and then i think no you cant do that   uhhuh   she has to develop her own personality and so sometimes i i have to step back and say okay we want to encourage her we want to influence her but we dont want to control her   uhhuh   and so far it hasnt been too hard but she hasnt been making a whole lot of decisions on her own yet and so you know i guess im im just going to have to be real conscious of that as i as she gets older and does start making decisions     uhhuh   and be conscious that i need to give her options but not make the decisions for her   uhhuh and you dont feel that your relationship with your father has unduly uh influenced your relationship with your husband then   um i i look at myself and i have three sisters theres four daughters in the family i look at myself compared to my sisters families   um   and see that one of them married an abusive husband one of them married an alcoholic uh the other one married into a pretty stable relationship   uh       and mine is pretty stable or much more stable i think probably than any of them but now i waited until i was thirty to get married and they all married at eighteen but uh   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh you didnt need to get away from home then     um well my dad in his alcoholism he was kind of irritating and it there were a few times he was violent towards my mother but it was almost he like if he had any opinions to give he would tell my mother and she would tell us and so we had almost no direct relationship with him i mean he was there and and we you know did little things together as a family but on the whole there was no   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   no direct communication no show of affection no even no show of anger unless it he was you know really really drunk   uhhuh my father my husband was like that but that was because he was working all the time establishing a business and running it certainly he i mean he got off work and he came home   oh uhhuh   and he ate dinner and his work was outside and in the winter time by the time he was warm he was asleep so it wasnt that he was   uhhuh   neglectful of his children by choice there just was no time and energy left for them by the time he put in his workday which started like at five thirty and ended at six thirty uh   uhhuh   you know alcoholism wasnt a problem resentment whatever was was not a problem at all because each one of our children was planned and he seemed to be the one who initiated having children so certainly he wanted the m   uhhuh   he just didnt have the energy to deal with them and of course now uh hes very excited hes retired and hes spending time with his grandchildren which shows how much he wished that he could have with his own   uhhuh yeah i see my father relating much better to the grandchildren than he did to us   so he has overcome alcoholism at this point     not completely no he he still has a problem with it and he goes in stages   oh umhum   but he still you know he will pick up my one of my granddaughters and say you know give her a hug and say i love you and the first time he said i love you to me was when i had been away from home for almost a year and a half   oh but he said it   yeah it i said i love you dad i miss you and then he said was able to say it back and and i was twenty four and thats the first time id heard him say anything you know similar to that   uhhuh yeah the first time i heard my older daughter tell and she is our most expressive tell my husband that she loved him he said well i certainly hope so     um   so he but then he came from a background where he is so much more open with his children than his father was with him his father was just a very quiet withdrawn person and i assume very shy as is my husband   uhhuh uhhuh   uh he shows his feelings but he cannot express it and i think thats kind of sad in a way i see other fathers put their arms around their daughters or their sons and   yeah   we have two daughters and a son and uh he just cant do that and i i know that he would if he could and i i kind of feel sorry for him because i think he misses a lot and   uhhuh   as i say our our sonsinlaw are so open and caring and giving to their children and i wonder if its because theyre there when they delivered theyre delivered if that   they went through that entire process yeah   right if that maybe starts in the delivery room with a chain that my generation missed out on   uhhuh i think too that with us as women being out of the home where im not working now i didnt work until about from about the time Emily about four months before she was born   uhhuh   and but so many women are having children and returning to the work field that the the dads you know have to to follow through or a third person has to come in and follow through with with the the care and the dads are are doing more   uhhuh uhhuh   and that bond is starting you know like you said right at the beginning and then developing its not breaking at any point   uhhuh   at least it shouldnt and and and and in a good family it isnt unfortunately theres so many families where there isnt a father in the home its just yeah thats right yeah   uhhuh or a mother some of them the fathers are raising the children   yeah so   its certainly not a good situation but im sure its not one that the the the families chose i mean im sure they felt they had no choice at our stage in life weve seen   uhhuh   a lot of our friends go through divorces uh you know weve been married thirty five years and so thats how old our friends are   uhhuh   and theyre on their second marriage and theyve got his kids and her kids and i think my gosh all the pain theyve caused themselves and their children i just   uhhuh   you know of course everything wasnt always rosy for us but you know we stayed together and at this point our children are saying gosh im glad you did that   uhhuh   so i think it makes for a more solid basis for them or i hope so at least   yeah yeah they see you go through the problems and still come out okay working together   umhum and they see that with my husbands retirement a little over a year ago were having a wonderful time and i think they look at that and and uh and that way i think were doing a lot for our grandchildren   uhhuh yes yeah well that sounds good my background is in sociology and so i see a lot of unwed mothers   umhum
