                                 Yugo Home             Ever since the UnitedStates began contemplating doing something about war and ethnic cleansing inthe collapsing state of Yugoslavia in  all sides have invoked history as aguide to action Those who opposed involvement in Bosnia in the early sandwho doubt that NATO can bring peace to Kosovo todayargue that the long recordof intractable ethnic tension among the Balkan peoples means we should stayout Any settlement they say is doomed to be temporary Robert Kaplans bookBalkan Ghosts  which advances this thesis regarding Bosnia reportedlyconvinced President Clinton to steer clear of military action there for atime            Interventionists alsoinvoke history They note the longstanding claim of ethnic Albanians to theterritory of Kosovo dating back to  BC when the Albanians supposedancestors the Illyrians settled there This ancient history forms the basisof demands for selfdetermination on the part of the longsuffering AlbanianKosovars But the Serbs too stake a historical claim Their Slavic forebearsmigrated to Kosovo around AD  and they contend that Serbs have livedthere ever since            In fact each of these assertions is subject toqualification as is made clear in Noel Malcolms masterly but misnamedKosovo A Short History my main source along with Hugh Poultons TheBalkans Minorities and States in Conflict  The tie of todays AlbanianKosovars to the ancient Illyrians is fairly attenuated And while Slavs didmove into the area around  when the Bulgarian Empire conquered the Balkansthe Serbs didnt gain control of Kosovo until the  th century whena dynasty of their leaders known as the Nemanjids invaded it after a period ofByzantine rule            For two centuries theNemanjids basked in their Balkan kingdom Serb nationalists today are fond ofnoting that in  it was in Kosovo that the Serbian Prince Lazar and hisarmies made their last stand against the invading Ottoman Empire at the Battleof Kosovo Theyre less likely to note that the Albanians of Kosovo foughtalongside them Explicit references to the Albanian people as opposed to theIllyrians begin to appear around the  th century            During Turkeys year rule most of KosovosAlbaniansand Albanias Albanians also subjects of the OttomanEmpireconverted to Islam The Serbs remained Orthodox Christians That may beone reason that the Serbs sought independence first In  they rose up andin  broke free Kosovo however remained largely content under Turkishrule Serbs believing that Kosovo still rightfully belonged to them didbriefly conquer it in  when along with Russia the new Serbian state madewar on Turkey But under the RussianOttoman armistice a year later Serbia wasforced to withdraw            At this point theAlbaniansof both Kosovo and Albania propercommenced their socallednational awakening A group called the League of Prizren named for theKosovo town where it met lobbied for autonomy within the Ottoman Empire Ageneration later this movement flowered into insurrection as Albaniansthroughout the western pocket of the Balkans revolted Albania securedstatehood in  but before the status of Kosovo could be resolved theentire region was rocked in quick succession by the First Balkan War the Second Balkan War  and for good measure World War I             First to invade Kosovo in these years were the Serbs TheSerbs were knocked out by the Austrians who were knocked out by the FrenchThe French handed the province back to their allies the Serbs After the warthe Allies following Wilsonian ideals of selfdetermination straightened upEurope into tidy nationstates With minimal thought on the part of themapmakers Kosovo was folded into Serbia which joined five neighboring Balkanterritories to form the new state of Yugoslavia Albania appealed to the Alliesfor control of Kosovo but considered an insignificant state was rebuffed indeference to Serbian claims            As the largest republicin the multinational state Serbia dominated Yugoslavia Its capital ofBelgrade for example was the nations capital too Under Serbian rule Kosovoagain became a battleground In the late  th century Serbiannationalists had built up national myths about the heroics of Prince Lazar andcast Kosovos status as a Jerusalemlike holy land populated with Orthodoxreligious shrines Throughout the s and s the central government inBelgrade pushed Albanians out of the region and moved Serbs inefforts theAlbanian majority resisted often to their peril            In World War II Kosovo again resembled Europes GrandCentral Station The Axis powers rolled in and carved up the region AlbaniasFascist government headed by a puppet of Mussolinis seized the biggestchunk while Bulgaria and Germany each occupied a strip Communist partisansretook the province in  and when the war ended the partisan leader JosipBroz Tito became dictator of the reconstituted Yugoslav federation TheCommunists considered ceding Kosovo to Albania but instead decided that itshould revert to its antebellum status quo They deemed Kosovo not anautonomous republic but a province of Serbia            In the name of Yugoslav unity Tito suppressed mostassertions of ethnic identity He jailed or killed thousands of AlbanianKosovars and banned Albanianlanguage publications But he was to some degreean equal opportunity tyrant He also halted Serbian efforts to settle KosovoIn  with uprisings sweeping the globe student protests triggered a waveof demands for greater Kosovar autonomy Tito acceded to a series of reformsculminating in a new Yugoslav Constitution in  which gave Kosovo controlover much of its internal affairs That year marked the high point for Kosovaraspirations to independence and it remains the benchmark for NATOs demand atRambouillet for a restoration of Kosovos pre autonomy            Tito died in  Thenext year Albanian Kosovar students erupted again with some Kosovarsclamoring for republichood Belgrade no longer restrained by Titos aversionto exacerbating ethnic conflict cracked down Polarization followed SlobodanMilosevicfirst as a Communist and then as a Serbian nationalistwhipped upantiAlbanian sentiment In  he stripped Kosovo of its cherished autonomyMeanwhile Albanian Kosovars proclaimed their territory a republic and throughchannels violent and nonviolent sought actual independence UnrelentingMilosevic undertook the massacres of the last year which finally precipitatedNATOs bombing            That in a nutshell is the history of Kosovo If you canfind a solution to todays mess in there let me know Take a snapshot at BC and the Albanians can claim it look at AD  and its a Serbiankingdom The United States prefers to use the  benchmark Milosevic pointsto  But even at those points the snapshot looks pretty blurry            Before NATO began bombingYugoslavia March  the proposed Rambouillet solutionrestoring Kosovosautonomy but not granting it independenceseemed like a plausible outcome Nowits hard to imagine Kosovars accepting any kind of Serbian rule Ifvictorious NATO may grant Kosovo independence or perhaps divide it up Historywont decide Kosovos fate Our actions in the weeks ahead will decidehistory
