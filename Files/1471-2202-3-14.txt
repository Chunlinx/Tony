                    Background                  Attention Network Task ANT as a suitable          endophenotype for genetic studies          While each of the attentional measures described above          is well suited for genetic studies we have chosen an          alternate assay for genetic studies of attention Our          approach is based functional neuroimaging studies which          have yielded evidence on neural areas involved in aspects          of attention      Imaging data have supported the          presence of three networks related to different aspect of          attention These networks carry out the functions of          alerting orienting and executive control               Alerting is defined as achieving and maintaining a state          of high sensitivity to incoming stimuli orienting is the          selection of information from sensory input and          executive control is defined as involving the mechanisms          for resolving conflict among thoughts feelings and          responses Functional imaging studies have shown that          maintaining an alert state involves activation of right          frontal and parietal lobes while orienting to visual          stimuli activates areas of the pulvinar superior          colliculus and posterior parietal lobe Executive          function tasks activate frontal areas such as the          anterior cingulate cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex          an area for which certain anatomical aspects have been          shown to be highly heritable     Recently we          described the Attention Network Test ANT that measures          the efficiency of these three major neural networks              The ANT is advantageous for genetic studies insofar          as it distinguishes between separate functions of          attention alerting orienting and executive that are          correlated with the activation of these specific          neuroanatomical circuits The heritability of the ANT has          been examined in a preliminary twin study using normal          adult twins     The efficiency of the executive          network was found to be highly heritable h           F   while lower heritabilities          were observed for alerting and median reaction time h           F   and  respectively The          heritabilities of these measures suggest that candidate          gene association studies are reasonable to pursue It          remains an open question however whether such candidate          genes will relate to overall attentional performance and          reaction time or whether the candidate genes will show          specific associations with specific neural networks          As an initial assessment of this approach we chose          four candidate genes DRD DAT COMT and MAOA that are          among the most widely studied and repeatedly associated          with various psychiatric disorders where attention is          found to be disrupted The longstanding interest in these          candidate genes stems mainly from pharmacological          evidence implicating dopamine and norepinephrine in          attentional processes as well as biochemical studies that          have related alleleic variants to differences in protein          activity and expression levels Studies showing the          expression of dopamine receptors in the anterior          cingulate cortex    and that activation of          mesocortical dopaminergic neurons via apomorphine          enhances activity in the prefrontal cortex              suggest that dopaminergic modulation influences the          efficiency of the executive attention network Similarly          pharmacological studies with alert monkeys have related          the alerting network to the brains norepinepherine          system whose cell bodies are located in the locus          coeruleus Drugs like clonidine and guanfacine act to          block norepinepherine and reduce or eliminate the normal          effect of warning signals on reaction time but have no          influence on orienting to the target location                                       Dopamine D receptor DRD          The dopamine D receptor is located on chromosome          p     Many association studies have evaluated a           basepair variable nucleotide tandem repeat VNTR          polymorphism in exon III The most common isoform of the          DRD contains repeats while two less common isoforms          contain repeats and repeats Pharmacological studies          show that the repeat isoform is less responsive to          dopamine stimulation     Recently a formal meta          analysis    was conducted on the growing body of          literature of this DRD polymorphism and its association          with ADHD Based on  case control studies  positive          and  familybased studies  positive the meta          analysis concluded that a statistically significant          association between ADHD and the repeat allele of DRD          existed with a relative risk of  for  casecontrol          studies and  for  familybased studies In addition          to the exon III polymorphism Barr and colleagues             examined the distributions of a bp repeat           kilobases upstream to the transcription start site and a          single nucleotide polymorphism SNP defined by a C to T          substitution at position  in ADHD populations The          T allele results in  less DRD transcription              Studies looking at polymorphisms in DRD and infant          attention    as well as disorders such as obsessive          compulsive disorder     Tourette syndrome    and          schizophrenia    as well as underlying dimensions of          novelty seeking      attachment    and          temperament    have also shown associations In this          study we examine each of these polymorphisms                          Dopamine transporter DAT          The dopamine transporter DAT or SLCA gene is          located on chromosome p     Methylphenidate          the primary stimulant used in pharmacological treatment          of ADHD was shown by PET imaging to block the dopamine          transporter     ADHD patients have also been found          to show higher levels of DAT in the striatum              The most well studied polymorphism is a VNTR in the           untranslated region of the DAT gene     Since this          VNTR is not in the coding region of the DAT gene it does          not affect the protein sequence of the dopamine          transporter but may affect the translational efficiency          and thus the amount of protein expressed Subjects          homozygous for the repeat allele showed significantly          lower dopamine transporter binding than carriers of the          repeat allele     Cook    summarized the          results of an additional  familybased studies in a          meta analysis and concluded that the association between          the DAT gene and ADHD was highly significant p            Associations with other disorders including          bipolar disorder     alcoholism    and          temperamental dimensions    have been found                          CatecholamineOmethyl transferase COMT          The catecholOmethyltransferase COMT gene is          located on chromosome q    and catalyzes the          degradation of catecholamines in conjuction with          monoamine oxidase In the prefrontal cortex the          breakdown of synaptic dopamine through the COMT pathway          is more critical since PFC is characterized by greater          extracellular diffusion  slower clearance of          dopamine than elsewhere in the brain     The most          widely examined polymorphisms in COMT were identified by          Lachman    who found a GtoA change at codons           and  of the COMT gene resulting in          ValinetoMethionine substitutions which account for           to fold differences in COMT activity in red blood cells          and liver A recent finding showed that COMT genotype was          related to performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test          of executive cognition     In addition those          subjects with the Methionine alleles needed less          prefrontal cortical activity as judged by fMRI to show          the same level of performance on the Nback task The          Valine allele was shown to be preferentially transmitted          to ADHD probands and was associated with impulsive false          alarm errors on a continuous performance task              Several studies on obsessive compulsive disorder have          found associations with COMT                 Associations with bipolar disorder    and          temperamental dimensions    have also been          reported                          Monoamine oxidase MAOA          The MAOA and MAOB genes are located on the X          chromosome Xp    and code for enzymes that          catalyze the deamination of biogenic amines including the          neurotransmitters norephinephrine dopamine and          serotonin MAOA shows expression primarily in neurons and          preferentially catalyzes the deamination of serotonin and          noradrenaline Because of its metabolic role drugs which          interfere with MAOA such as clorgyline have been used to          treat ADHD     The most notable of MAOA polymorphism          was a nonsense mutation that led to a complete loss of          MAOA function in males showing extreme forms of impulsive          behavior and aggression     More recently the          association with aggression was replicated in a study          showing that maltreated children with certain alleles of          MAOA were more likely to show aggressive behaviors              MAOA male knockout mice also show high levels of          aggression     Less severe genetic variants are          known to exist in MAOA which have been studied as          candidates to explain various dimensions of psychiatric          illness The MAOA genelinked polymorphic region          MAOALPR is a  bp repetitive sequence that resides           kb upstream of the start codon The  and repeat          copy alleles are the most common and the   and          repeat copy alleles are rare Transfection experiments          show that the repeat allele results in a fold lower          transcriptional induction than the repeat allele              The second polymorphism we examined is a silent C to T          change at position  in exon  MAOA associations          with ADHD     bipolar disorder      panic          disorder    and alcoholism     have been          reported                            Results                  Population distributions of RT alerting and          executive scores          Table Isummarizes attention network scores and overall          reaction time RT for the subject population The          distributions not shown for each endophenotype are          roughly bell shaped symmetrical and show that          approximately   of the variation lies within           standard deviation This suggests that standard          parametric statistical tests are appropriate for          subsequent analysis An examination of pairwise          correlation coefficients for each network shows no          significant correlation between alerting and orienting or          executive attention and orienting suggesting that these          attention networks are largely independent Both alerting          and executive attention scores showed correlations with          mean reaction time P   and  respectively as          well as a negative correlation with each other r            P   This negative correlation appears to          arise because with no warning the subjects are generally          slower to respond and some conflict resolution may occur          during the longer overall RT To reduce the potential          confounding effect of overall RT raw attention network          scores were divided by overall RT and resulting ratio          scores were used in the genetic analysis          Since the ANT relies on RT measurements it is          important to consider how nongenetic factors such as age          and intrinsic factors such as speed accuracy tradeoffs          might potentially contribute to overall variation before          proceeding to draw genetic inferences Previous studies          have demonstrated the overall slowing of reaction times          in aged subjects     The mean population age here             years is well below an aged range and no correlation          was observed between age and reaction time data not          shown Speed accuracy tradeoffs constitute another          potential confound If a subject responds too quickly          more errors are likely to be committed On the other          hand the same subject may intentionally slow down to          reduce errors and overall reaction times will be higher          Traditionally this phenomena is addressed by the use of           d as a dependent variable In the          study here accuracy rates were high for all conditions           permitting the use of RTs and corresponding          ratio scores Lastly it is also possible that gender          differences exist in overall RT The population was          composed of males   and females  and no          significant sex differences as judged by ttest were          seen for overall reaction time alerting and executive          attention                          DRD          Genotypic analysis of the DRD gene showed that the          exon III bp repeat allele was present at frequencies          of  repeat  repeat and  repeat          Other rare variants were also present but not included in          the analysis The bp repeat alleles were present at          frequencies of  long and  short and the CT          SNP at  was present at frequencies of  and           respectively Chisquare analyses of observed and          expected frequencies of each genotypic class showed no          linkage disequilibrium between the exon III repeat and          the  site or the  bp repeat polymorphism The lack          of disequilibrium between these sites and the repeat          has been observed previously      The distribution          of alerting score executive attention score and overall          reaction time as a function of each genotypic class were          examined by ANOVA linear regression and nonlinear          regression analysis Each polymorphism was considered          independently under a model where alleles were treated as          additive AA vs AB vs BB and also as dominant AA vs          AB  BB The bp repeat showed no significant          association with any attention network score or overall          reaction time The CT SNP at  showed an additive          influence on executive attention as shown in Figure          Bwhere the mean executive attention scores of the CC          and TT genotypic classes showed a nominally significant          difference P   The exon III VNTR was also          examined in this manner In this case each genotypic          class of repeats      were treated          independently No significant associations between          genotypic classes and attention network scores nor          overall reaction time were observed Each genotypic class          was also grouped into various larger classes present          vs absent etc The results for one such grouping are          shown in Figure A A ttest for equality of means equal          variances not assumed shows that those subjects carrying          a repeat show significantly P   higher          executive attention scores than the  and  classes          combined Univariate linear regression of genotypes shows          that DRD exon III genotypic variation contributes           Rsquared value to the overall variation in executive          attention score                          COMT          The Methionine alleles were present at a frequency of           No statistical trends or effects for overall          reaction time or alerting were found As shown in Figure          A a modest statistical trend toward additively higher          executive attention scores was seen and a posthoc          analysis shows that the  homozygous classes ValVal and          MetMet show only slightly different executive attention          scores P   Prior reports of sex differences in          COMT expression in humans    as well as effects of          gender on behavior in COMT lossoffunction mouse models             and reports of preferential transmission of the          low activity Methionine alleles in females with OCD             suggested that gender could interact with ANT          performance When males and females were analyzed as          independent populations no significant associations were          seen for overall reaction time or any of the network          scores for either males or females Females homozygous          for the low activity Methionine allele did however show          the highest executive attention scores among all Sex           Genotypic classes                          DAT          The repeat allele was present at a frequency of           and the repeat allele at  As shown in Figure          B subjects homozygous for the rare repeat allele          showed modestly lower score than the pooled scores for          the more common repeat homozygotes and           heterozygotes No trends were seen for accuracy mean RT          andor the efficiency of alerting                          MAOA          Genotypes obtained at the promoter repeat LPR          polymorphism showed frequencies of  repeat and           repeat and genoptypes at the CT polymorphism          showed frequencies of  C allele and  T          allele Since MAOA is located on the Xchromosome males          are genetically hemizygous and females are functionally          hemizygous due to random Xinactivation For this reason          heterozygous females were excluded from the analysis          This permitted a comparison of hemizygous male and          homozygous female repeat vs repeat classes only No          significant main effect or trend was observed for either          MAOA polymorphism and overall reaction time As shown in          Figure A the MAOLPR showed a significant influence on          alerting P   and on executive attention P            as seen in Figure B The CT polymorphism          showed no significant association with alerting but          shows a modest association with executive attention P            When the executive attention scores for          subjects carrying the CT T LPR repeat          haplotype were compared with executive attention scores          for subjects carrying the CT C LPR repeat          haplotype modestly significant differences P            were observed This haplotype accounted for approximately           of the total variation                          Comparison of high vs low dopamine          alleles          Previous biochemical studies on MAO and COMT have          shown that the COMT Valine isoforms have fold higher          levels of enzymatic activity than the Methionine isoform          Biochemical studies on the MAOLPR promoter repeat have          shown that the repeat allele has fold higher levels          of expression than the repeat allele This biochemical          evidence permits a noninvasive inference of relative          dopamine levels among subjects In order to assess the          role of dopamine on executive attention network          efficiency it would be useful to compare the          distributions of executive attention scores for these           polymorphisms and ask whether those individuals who are          expected to have higher levels of dopamine COMT          Methionine and MAOA repeat show differences in          executive attention when compared to those individuals          with lower levels of dopamine Figure shows the          distributions for  subjects who carry the ValVal and           genotype and  subjects who carry the MetMet and           genotypes at COMT and MAOA respectively A posthoc          analysis showed that the difference in efficiency between          these subjects is highly significant P   and          that this particular combination of alleles contributes           to the overall variation No significant differences          were found between either the extreme high or low          genotypic classes and each of the numerous heterozygous          and compound heterozygous genotypic classes whose mean          efficiency values fell within the extremes data not          shown                            Discussion                  Recommendations for molecular genetic studies on          the ANT          The ANT is freely available for public download              For investigators who wish to probe the genetic basis          of executive attention this study highlights many design          and implementation issues Firstly it is evident that          individual polymorphisms exert extremely weak main          effects The results of this study show that a population          of even  subjects lacks the needed statistical power          since the modest statistical associations are well below          the standards set for the reporting of true association              In order to adhere strictly to these guidelines          power estimates suggest that N   subjects will be          needed to reach these criteria for genetic studies of          executive attention using the ANT Other statistical          approaches such as nonlinear models or nonparametic          tests may prove to be more sensitive when examining          single polymorphisms or multiple polymorphic sites within          a gene Lastly caution should be used when interpreting          genetic association data on single polymorphisms since          spurious associations may arise due to linkage          disequilibrium at closely linked genetic loci One          encouraging aspect of this study however is the finding          that no associations or statistical trends were observed          for global measures of performance such as overall          reaction time This suggests that there may be          specificity in the role of genetic factors in          contributing to specific neural functions                            Conclusions        Modest statistical associations of variation in        executive attention were observed with genetic        polymorphisms in candidate genes that affect dopaminergic        signalling These associations were not seen for global        measures of performance such as reaction time but rather        for the efficiency of specific anatomically characterised        neural networks This suggests that the ANT is a suitable        endophenotypic assay for further large scale studies on the        genetics of executive attention                    Methods                  Subjects          Subjects were recruited in the vicinity of New York          Hospital via newspaper advertisement  subjects who          were recruited from the vicinity of Peking University and          participated in a previous heritability study were also          included Paid volunteers traveled to the Department of          Psychiatry to undergo a pretest interview Subjects with          a history of psychopathology andor taking medication          were excluded A total of  adult subjects ages           years old met inclusion criteria All participants          reported normal or corrected to normal vision While          smoking preference was recorded only  subjects reported          smoking regularly                          Behavioral data          The ANT was performed as previously described              Briefly participants viewed the stimuli and responses          were collected via two mouse buttons Stimuli consisted          of a row of  visually presented horizontal black lines          with arrowheads pointing leftward or rightward against a          gray background where the target was a leftward or          rightward arrowhead at the center This target was          flanked on either side by two arrows in the same          direction congruent condition or in the opposite          direction incongruent condition or by lines neutral          condition          The participants task was to identify the direction          of the centrally presented arrow by pressing one button          for the left direction and a second button for the right          direction Cues consisted of a  msec asterisk          presented  msec before the target There were four cue          conditions  nocue participants were shown a cross          which was the same as the first fixation for  ms           centralcue which was at the central fixation point           doublecue in which cues were presented on the two          possible target locations simultaneously both above and          below the fixation point and  spatialcue cue was          presented right on the target location either above          below the central fixation point          A session consisted of a trial practice block and          three experimental blocks of trials Each experimental          block consisted of  trials  conditions  warning          levels   target locations   target directions            congruency conditions with repetitions The          presentation of trials was in a random order          Participants were instructed to focus on a centrally          located fixation cross throughout the task and to          response as fast also as accurately as possible                          Calculation of attention network          efficiencies          Values for attention network efficiency were          calculated from the raw reaction time data as previously          described Medians were calculated for each test          conditions  cue levels by  target levels           conditions in total to avoid the influence of the          outliers The alerting effect was calculated by          subtracting the mean RT of the conditions with double cue          from the mean RT of the conditions with no cue Since          neither of these conditions provides information on the          spatial location of the target the subtraction gives a          pure measure of alerting The orienting effect was          calculated by subtracting the mean RT of the conditions          with spatial updown cue from the mean RT of the          conditions with center cue In both conditions the          subject is alert but only the spatial cue provided          spatial information on where to orient The executive          effect was calculated by subtracting the mean RT of          congruent conditions from the mean RT of incongruent          conditions                          Genetic sample collection and genotyping          methods          Buccal swabs were obtained via buccal cell brush from          consenting subjects and prepared as directed by the          manufacturer We used the MasterAMP  Buccal Swab DNA          Extraction Kit Epicentre Technologies Madison WI          Yields range from  to  g of DNA from each buccal          sample Yields were determined spectrophotometrically by          absorbance at  nm Taq polymerase PCR buffer and          dNTPs were obtained from QIAGEN and used at recommended          concentrations for a  ul PCR reaction PCR reactions          and restriction digests PCRRFLP are optimized for each          marker and performed on the PTC Programmable Thermal          Controller MJ Research outfitted with a heated lid for          oilfree amplifications For most markers a touchdown          PCR cycling regimen and the addition of DMSO  final          vv was used in order to automatically optimize the          hybridization stringency Gel electrophoresis in either          LE or Metaphor agarose followed by staining in ethidium          bromide was used to resolve and visualise DNA          fragments          For genotyping of the DRD exon III VNTR primers were          used at  uM and were designed as described in              Forward GCGACTACGTGGTCTACTCG Reverse          AGGACCCTCATGGCCTTG Many investigators have noted          difficulties in obtaining reliable and specific          amplification of this polymorphism when using template          DNA from buccal swabs We substituted Qsolution QIAGEN          and an optimized touchdown thermocycling regime to          achieve reliable and robust amplification For genotyping          of the DRD bp tandem duplication upstream of the          startcodon as described in     we used Forward          GTTGTCTGTCTTTTCTCATTGTTTCCATTG Reverse          GAAGGAGCAGGCACCGTGAGC primers For genotyping of          the DRD C to T change at position  as described in              Forward CGGGGGCTGAGCACCAGAGGCTGCT and          Reverse GCATCGACGCCAGCGCCATCCTACC were used          followed by digestion with FspI For genotyping of the          DAT  bprepeat VNTR polymorphism in the           untranslated region as described in     Forward          TGTGGTGTAGGGAACGGCCTGAG Reverse          CTTCCTGGAGGTCACGGCTCAAGG primers were used For          genotyping of the COMT Val to Met change at position           as described in     Forward          ACTGTGGCTACTCAGCTGTG and Reverse          CCTTTTTCCAGGTCTGACAA primers were used followed by          restriction digestion with NlaIII For genotyping of the          MAOA bp repeat in promotor as described Sabol et al           Forward ACAGCCTGACCGTGGAGAAG and Reverse          GAACGGACGCTCCATTCGGA primers were used The C to T          change at poition  in exon  was genotyped according          to     Forward TTAAATGGTCTCGGGAAGG and          Reverse GCCCAATGACACAGCCTTT primers were used          followed by digestion with EcoRV                          Statistical analysis of genetic vs behavioral          variation          Attention network scores were calculated using MS          Excel In order to perform genotype by network score          associations biallelic loci were assigned a  for AA          homozygotes a  for AB heterozygotes and a  for          BB heterozygotes SPSS was used to perform oneway          ANOVAs and tailed ttests where genotype was considered          an independent variable Dominant effects were assessed          by grouping genotypic classes Based on earlier analyses          of the small effect size of the DRD exon III VNTR          polymorphism we estimated statistical power for          genotypic associations for different sample sizes and the          allele frequencies present and absent  and           respectively A minimum significance level for type I          errors alpha of P   is based on the          recommendations of Lander and Kruglyak     Using a          computerbased power determination algorithm a minimum          sample size of N   is required to achieve a power of           A power of  was estimated for the current sample          size Linkage disequilibrium between pairs of alleles was          determined using the method of Weir     In this          method allele frequencies were compared to expected          genotypic frequencies via chisquare analysis with a null          hypothesis of no disequilibrium                            Authors
