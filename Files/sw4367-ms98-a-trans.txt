        now   okay   well lets see i see im gonna im gonna be guilty of not being able to say a whole lot about this im not real i dont have a budget  uh what i basically am a do is i i have a a job which which i which makes more money than i need to to work with   uhhuh   and so the money i have left over is pretty much put into investments   okay   so im real guilty of uh of not really doing a whole lot of planning as to how im going to set things aside it just it either goes into investment or it goes into things that i want or it goes or it goes uh goes into the bills you know one or the other i just keep a balance on the checking book and thats it   uhhuh right okay well thats good position to be in i guess if you dont have to worry about budgeting that whats left over goes to investments       so you dont you dont then actually plan that this month im gonna invest five hundred or five thousand or whatever it might be   well the one thing ive always done is ive put uh uh on my on my uh from when i started even since since the very beginning i always said that i would put five hundred dollars aside every month   uhhuh so you always put aside at least five hundred dollars okay well i guess thats sort of a budget then at least partial   right and right oh it it is a budget i mean i certainly consider it to be a budget but i was just under the idea that uh   yeah   i knew i could i would be able to do that and that uh you you have to be uh responsible for your own   umhum   uh  retirement and welfare and so i said okay this you know i i can do this so i will do that you know so it early you know when i first started in that you know quite a few years ago i said i i know that i will always be able to afford this   right umhum   and i said that well you know if i if i start making a significant more amount of money i i would put more into it   umhum sure sure   and make a new budget but ive uh its cost of living has gone up in in with respect to my salary or better  so ive actually probably making less money than i was when i started   right umhum okay   so although i have not changed i have not changed that number even though you know cost of living has made it equivalently less   right right sure well i think thats true of all of us the um well my wife and i both work and we do plan   yeah right umhum   uh we try to plan major purchases and we have agreed that we dont spend over a hundred dollars on anything without talking with the other one so i wouldnt just go out and buy a   well that   you know a i dont know a new computer  uh without   well certainly certainly your in a family situation you youd expect a little bit more uh uh you more structured and   well thats true thats true uh certainly when youre single you dont have to worry about consulting with someone else and uh that type of thing   yeah right i just kind of consult  with uh uh me myself and i you know   uhhuh sure sure you have a committee meeting of all yourself me myself and i okay   right thats right  uh   yeah i see   so that makes that makes it a lot that makes it of course a lot easier um and ive always been fairly conscientious ive never really   uhhuh   i i dont buy anything really on a whim i do buy things   okay   that that i want even though i may not they may not be something that i really need but i always find the best price for it and i look around for a long time and and let it let myself get past that that initial state   umhum sure so youre careful rather than just extravagant and just grab anything that happens to meet your fancy   right right you know i i i dont just sit there oh i like that i got to get it no i i say now give myself a little time to sit there and say do i really want it and if i really want it then i try to look for a good price for it   right right sure sure   and then i buy it   okay well we do that same kind of planning in that if were going to get something you know whatever it may be and were comfortable and have most the things we need or want the   but i do   wed you know certainly shop around before buying the new computer or the new VCR or something even once we had planned that thats what we were going to get we wouldnt just go read the ad in the paper and run right down and buy it or something even if wed planned to get the thing   umhum right my ive always  you know thats what what  an accusation that an awful lot of people make towards our
