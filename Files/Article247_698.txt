                                 Tape Measure            Everyone leads with the presidential tape although true to its Rashomonspirit no two papers see in it quite the same thing The Washington Post flags it as Clinton Decries Attempt toSet Me Up The New York Timessays Tape Shows Nation a Clinton Irate and Sad The Los AngelesTimes and USA Today play it somewhat straighter with their topheadlines merely stating that the tape was nationally aired although thepapers use their subheadlines to interpret the event The LAT sees acomposed chief executive offering new insights into his version of eventswhile USAT stresses that the initial reaction of the public and Congressprompted by the tape suggested that Clintons risk of impeachment was notthereby increased Indeed USAT cites a posttape poll finding thattwothirds of Americans dont want President Clinton impeached up from percent the day before the tapes airing            To varying degrees the papers all note that the taped testimony did notfeature the politically explosive emotions or overthetop sex talk that hadbeen rumored last week USAT notes that contrary to leaks the tapecontained no angry eruptions And the NYT s RW Apple makes the pointthat the grand jury appearance was marked by Clintons fuller and moreconvincing expressions of personal regret plus more fondness for MonicaLewinsky than the nationally televised speech he gave a few hours later Applewrites that if the speech had been more like the testimony in this regardClinton might well have put the whole matter to rest            A key to the relative success Clinton achieved in his grand jury appearanceis noted by the LAT  unlike ordinary witnesses Clinton was frequentlyallowed by the prosecutors to go on at great length without directly respondingto questions Which given that Clinton had agreed to appear for only fourhours also meant he was able to avoid some lines of questioning altogether byeating the clock Or just as unusually note all the papers Clinton simplydidnt answer some questions at all For instance the NYT reports thatwhen Clinton suggested that the grand jurors themselves wielded a definition ofsex that like his required sexual intercourse some of the jurors sent backword that no they wanted him to address more specifically what he and Lewinskydid but Clinton politely refused            Everybody suggests that the among the most implausible moments in Clintonstestimony came when he tried to save his testimony from perjury by advocatingarcane definitions of such words as is and alone In conjunction withClintons attempt to finetune the notion of sexual relations so that itrequired intercourse the WP helpfully notes that in a recent TimeCNNpoll  percent of the respondents said they consider oral sex sex Clintonsanswers included the enunciation of his own philosophy of such testimony betruthful but not helpful say whats true but if possible make it misleadingBut Clinton came out of such logicchopping to a peroration pitched primarilyto the grand jurors that was notes the NYT  worthy of a campaignspeech            A WP editorial says that the videotape does not change theunfortunate fundamentals of the case And so the paper maintains that theonly thing to do is for Congress to open a formal impeachment inquiry TheNYT editorial on the subject says the performance might have doneClinton some good but is still one of the most lowrent moments in WhiteHouse history The editorial concludes that any shortofimpeachmentresolution requires that Clinton stop demanding that the American peopleendorse his lying We can afford says the editorial to be a nation offorgivers but not of enablers            Everybody picks over the new Lewinsky material released yesterday Thebiggest new news everybody has is that keeping the dress unwashed was LindaTripps idea one which she implemented by convincing Lewinsky shed gotten tooheavy to wear the dress and hence didnt need to wash it Theres also the wordthat Lewinskys notes of her Clinton visits and calls are so extensive thatthey even included a spread so to speak sheet USAT s account says hermemory for details was so good that she rattled off for prosecutors what sheand Vernon Jordan had to eat at their breakfast meeting some months prior            World recordholder and  Olympic champion Florence GriffithJoyner diedin her sleep yesterday The story makes the LAT  USAT  andWP fronts and runs inside at the NYT  The widespread rumors abouther use of steroids during her career made relevant by her death of heartfailure at age  are mentioned prominently by USAT and the NYT not at all by the WP             The Wall Street Journal Work Week column says that theClinton testimony tapes were a big distraction in the American workplaceyesterday Trouble is the column cites just a single workplacethat ofsomething called Amcat Corp in New Britain Conn Why this outfit and no otherBut the item does go on to mention that about half of the  people whoused the Internet on Monday to view CNNs testimony download were at the officeat the time
