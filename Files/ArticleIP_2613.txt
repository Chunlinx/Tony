                                 You Name It            Nike used to be known asBlue Ribbon Sports Whats now Sara Lee used to be Consolidated Foods AndExxon was once Standard Oil Company of New Jersey These were name changes thatworked But for all the ones that do there are  or  that dont Each yearhundreds of US corporations change their names In a corporate culture drivenby the mystique of brands and in a country obsessed by the possibility ofselfinvention that comes as no surprise What does surprise is just howirrational are the hopes and how feeble the performance of corporations thatdecide a new name is all that stands between them and fiscal nirvana            Mostcorporate name changes are the result of mergers and acquisitions But thesetend to be unimaginative Corporations have tended either to smoosh namestogetherthus Lockheed and Martin Marietta became Lockheed Martin McDonnelland Douglas Aircraft became McDonnell Douglas Northrop and Grumman became well you get the idea The result is straightforward if not alwaysfelicitous monikers Or the smaller company simply adopts the bigger companysname For instance all indications are that the BoeingMcDonnell Douglasmerger will produce a new company called Boeing            One notable exception was the  merger of Sperry andBurroughs which created a new company called Unisys At the time the name wasmuch mocked violating as it did the precept that you dont choose words endingin the sound iss  because people associate it with disease Butalthough the company has gone to the dogs its name now looks stylish in aretro way At least thats what I imagine Unisys executives saying tothemselves when they seek comfort in the face of the companys falling profitmargins            The realdebacles in the field of corporate name changes have been utterly selfimposednot forced by a merger or other change of circumstance They are the corporateequivalents of middleaged men buying Corvettes Almost without exception whencorporations have tried to reinvent themselves as more sophisticated andcomplex entities they have chosen names distinguished only by theirobliqueness and lack of intuitive appeal The desire for reinvention seems toarise most often when companies hear the siren call of synergy and start toexpand beyond their core businesses And they seem to be guided by onefundamental rule What you call yourself should have nothing to do with anyproduct you make            The most unforgettable example of this rule was UnitedAirlines baffling adoption of the name Allegis in  just after CEO RichardFerris had spent  billion acquiring Hertz and Hilton Ferris wanted Allegisto become a world travel powerhouse but within a year he was gonecushionedto be sure by a  million golden parachuteand United became United againIts tempting to say that only in retrospect does Allegis seem like such astupid name but the truth is that it seemed like a stupid choice even thenHell to begin with it violated the iss  rule When a ChicagoTribune reporter randomly surveyed shoppers at a mall soon after the namewas chosen one said Isnt that a new disease while another insisted Imsure Ive seen that name on my medicine More strikingly a  study ofconsumers showed that Allegis ranked in the bottom  percent of corporateidentities both in terms of name recognition and in terms of the esteemaccorded to the name by people who recognized it United Airlines on the otherhandthe old name the company threw in the trashwas in the top  percent inawareness and the top  percent in esteem It isnt easy to be that wrong butFerris managed it            And he did it with fanfare Whats most amusing aboutcorporate name changes is the dubious reasoning and overwrought rhetoric thatinevitably accompany them The Unitedexcuse me Allegisspokesman explainedat the time We are a travel company not just a transportation company Thename change clearly identifies us as the only corporation that can offertravelers doortodoor service Of course Allegis  doortodoor travelservice How could we have been so blind Even better was the explanationoffered by Lippincott and Margulies the identitymanagement firm that cameup with the name It said that Allegis conveys the central corporate missionof service and guardianship  through its relation to the word allegiantmeaning loyal or faithful and aegis meaning protection and sponsorship Thatmight be more convincing had the word allegiant ever in the history of theEnglish language been used in a sentence            Maybe evenfunnier is when executives celebrate the emptysignifier status of theircompanies new names Sounding like a student of Ferdinand Saussure the Frenchsemiotician retired chairman David Lennox said of Navistar the name chosenfor the former International Harvester One of the pluses of Navistar is youcan make it mean whatever your imagination wants it to mean When WasteManagement Inc changed its name to WMX Technologies CEO Dean Buntrockinsisted that adopting the nondescriptive name meant the company was growingup and raising our profile One can only speculate how executives of acompany called Combined Insurance explained to themselves their decision toadopt the name Aon            Coming up with a name like Navistar iscertainly creative and trashing a valuable label like International Harvesteris certainly destructive but the process hardly adds up to Joseph Schumpetersfamous definition of capitalism as a process of creative destruction Andits not cheap United spent more than  million in the move to Allegis andback When Swift and Co became Esmark in the company finally decided toget out from under the cloud of bad publicity created by Upton Sinclairsexpos The Jungle  published in it cost more than  millionChanging Esso Jersey Standard to Exxon cost an incredible  millionNissan spent  million on its threeyear campaign to ditch Datsun            The fact that bad names doseem to hurt companies is to be sure evidence of a sort that names matter Arose by the name of Allegis would almost certainly not smell as sweetBut its clear that corporations are as faddish in their choice of names asparents are Just as waves of Ashleys and Brittanys are succeeded by hordes ofMaxes and Sadies so the postmodern bricolage names of the s and s havebeen replaced by the retro labels of the s WMX Technologies is WasteManagement Inc again IC Industries which makes Whitmans Chocolates is nowcalled Whitmans United Brands now bears the name of its best productChiquita And Microsoft I hear is changing its name to Slate Inc
