                    Background        Vacuolartype H ATPases are enzymes responsible for        the energization of membranes and the acidification of        compartments within the eukaryotic cell via the        establishment of proton and electrochemical gradients at        the expense of ATP The vacuolar type H ATPase in plants        is a large multimeric enzyme complex whose function is to        pump protons across a membrane via primary active        transport Vacuolar type ATPases are homologs of the Ftype        ATP synthases and probably convert the free energy of        hydrolysis of the highenergy phosphate bond into        rotational motion             Vacuolar type H        ATPases are critical for the maintenance of homeostasis        in eukaryotic cells             In plant cells VATPases are responsible for the        deacidification of the cytosol and the energization of        secondary transport processes across the tonoplast as well        as in the endocytotic and secretory pathways     In        addition the vacuolar type ATPase is thought to be        primarily responsible for the acidification and expansion        of the large central vacuole        In plants a        critical event in growth and development is the maturation        and expansion of the central vacuole Upon maturation the        vacuolar contents can comprise more than eighty percent of        the total cell volume     Primarily filled with water        the vacuole also is a repository for a wide variety of        solutes fulfilling numerous important metabolic functions        The influx of water and metabolites into the vacuole is        dependent in part on the generation of a proton motive        force across the tonoplast        Vacuolar type H ATPases are large multimeric enzyme        complexes of  kDa consisting of  or more different        proteins Structurally they can be divided into integral        V           and peripheral V           membrane sectors     The        peripheral membrane sector is located on the cytoplasmic        side of the membrane and is composed of at least five        different subunits including the catalytic subunit subunit        A The V          peripheral sector is further divided        into a head group and stalk region The V          integral sector is embedded in the        membrane and consists of at least  different subunits        Subunit A of the vacuolartype H ATPase is the        catalytic subunit The subunit A protein is approximately         kDa in most organisms studied and is a hydrophilic        peptide located in the head group of the V          peripheral sector in three copies per        holoenzyme     This subunit contains a nucleotide        binding motif and functions to bind and hydrolyze ATP            In addition subunit A contains a highly conserved        cysteine residue located within the enzymes catalytic        center that may be involved in regulation of the holoenzyme               Cloning sequencing and characteristics        of subunit A of the VType ATPase from         Arabidopsis thaliana have been        previously reported            Small multigene families of VATPase subunit A are known        to exist in flowering plants and algae The catalytic        subunit exists as two distinct genes with highly conserved        exons and intron boundaries in twelve species of plants            In the flowering plant         Daucus carota carrot evidence        exists for two distinct isoforms for the catalytic subunit        one of which is tonoplast specific while the other is        localized to the Golgi     In addition two distinct        mRNAs have been isolated from cotton          Gossypium hirsutum      Two        subunit A mRNAs are expressed in the unicellular alga         Acetabularia acetabulum             Isoforms of other VATPase subunits are also known from        plants including subunit B       the proteolipid        subunit        and subunits D and E                   What is lacking in our knowledge of vacuolar type        ATPases is a sense of what purpose these multigene family        proteins may serve in the cellular milieu and how they        participate in the growth development and metabolism of        higher plants It has been proposed that multigene families        might be encoding functionally distinct isoforms of        VATPase subunits These isoforms may be required to        provide unique functions or regulatory constraints within        the varied microcompartments requiring VATPases                In addition different isoforms may be        responsible for targeting to varied subcellular        compartments           Furthermore it is        possible that gene family members may behave in a        differential manner with respect to environmental stress                   Three enzymes are primarily responsible for the        maintenance of proton flux across the tonoplast in plants        the vacuolar H ATPase the H pumping pyrophosphatase           and the Na H antiporter      All three        enzymes have been implicated in allowing plants to cope        with environmental stress conditions        Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to        evaluate the role vacuolar type ATPases play in allowing        plants to cope with environmental stress These endeavors        have primarily concentrated on salt and cold stress Cold        tolerant         Brassica napus a close relative of         Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated an        increase in both subunit A mRNA and protein in response to        chilling at C     This chilling also resulted in a        concomitant increase in cell sap osmotic pressure and        endogenous ABA accumulation These researchers indicated        that         Arabidopsis also was a cold tolerant        plant which exhibited a similar response with respect to        VATPase subunit A mRNA however they provided no data In        rice          Oryza sativa  chilling plants at        C resulted in a two fold increase in vacuolar type        ATPase activity evaluated by in vitro assay of isolated        membranes     This study did not analyze changes in        protein level in the isolated membranes in response to        chilling Cold sensitive mung bean seedlings          Vigna radiata  subjected to chilling        at C for  hours contrastingly showed no increase in        vacuolar type ATPase activity in isolated membranes            In addition these researchers found no change in the        amount of VATPase protein levels in response to        chilling        The facultative CAM plant         Mesembryanthemum        crystallinum displays a differential organ level        response to salt stress while still engaged in C          photosynthesis     Subjecting        plants to  mM NaCl resulted in an approximately two fold        increase in the transcript levels of subunits A B and the        proteolipid in roots prior to the shift to Crassulacean        acid metabolism Fully expanded leaves exhibited an        increase only for the proteolipid mRNA an increase of        approximately three fold over non salt stressed plants            Cell suspension cultures when subjected to salt stress        exhibited increase in activity of both PType and VType        ATPases without concomitant increase in protein levels            Transcript levels of subunit E of the VATPase in         Mesembryanthemum crystallinum were        recently shown to increase in leaves but not roots of salt        stressed plants with a concomitant increase in protein        levels in leaves     On the other hand subunit E in         Hordeum vulgare showed no effect on        mRNA level in response to salt stress     The effects        of salt stress on VATPases has also been investigated in        tobacco          Nicotiana tabacum  suspension cells        Subjecting NaCl adapted cells to salt stress resulted in an        approximately four fold increase in both proton transport        and ATP hydrolysis on isolated membranes compared to        unadapted cells     Remarkably this increase in        overall VATPase activity coincided with an apparent        reduction in the amount of enzyme on the tonoplast This        apparently contradictory finding may be the result of        physical changes in the enzyme itself or changes in the        lipid environment     Especially confounding is the        finding that mRNA levels for subunit A increase two to four        fold in response to the same levels of salt stress in        tobacco suspension cells     Experiments with tomato                 Lycopersicon esculentum  showed        similar results with respect to induction of mRNA for        subunit A with an approximately two to four fold increase        seen with respect to salt stress     Recent work in        the resurrection plant         Tortula ruralis indicated that        transcript levels of the proteolipid subunit c increased        in response to salt stress but that there was no        corresponding increase in protein levels            The limited work done to evaluate the role of VATPases        in drought stress has provided conflicting results Drought        stress in winter         Brassica napus resulted in a very        similar response as cold stress that is a dramatic        increase in subunit A mRNA     However drought stress        in         Lycopersicon esculentum resulted in        no apparent increase in mRNA levels for subunit A                   None of the previously mentioned efforts into evaluating        the role of vacuolar type ATPases in environmental stress        acclimation take into account the fact that subunits A B        and the proteolipid are most certainly present as small        gene families in the plants studied Furthermore it is        possible that these gene family members may behave in a        differential manner with respect to stress The only work        published previously on VATPase subunit isoforms and        stress is concerned with the proteolipid gene family in         Arabidopsis thaliana Three        proteolipid genes were evaluated for their response to salt        stress as well as etiolation     All three genes        exhibited an approximately two fold increase in mRNA levels        in response to salt stress  mM However with respect        to etiolation two isoforms showed no response while the        third demonstrated an increase in mRNA levels        A number of genes in plants have been found to contain        multiple poly A attachment sites yielding different        transcripts from a single gene Several examples have        recently emerged where differentially polyadenylated genes        have transcripts that are post transcriptionally regulated        based on sugar sensing In rice          Oryza sativa  two transcripts        generated off an  amylase gene exhibit differential        stability based on sucrose availability     A cell        wall invertase gene          Incw  in Maize          Zea mays  is expressed as two        transcripts differing in  ends The two transcripts are        differentially expressed in response to sugars     In        this study we explore the possibility that differentially        polyadenylated transcripts of the VATPase subunit A        encoding gene show different responses with respect to        etiolation salt or chilling stress                    Results and discussion        A vacuolar type H ATPase subunit A cDNA has been        previously identified and sequenced GenBank accession        number U     The cDNA was identified as subunit        A of the vacuolar type H ATPase via identity with other        previously sequenced subunit A genes from other organisms        The primary nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the         A thaliana subunit A cDNA showed a        high degree of identity with subunit A cDNA sequenced from        other organisms This cDNA encoded a putative open reading        frame consistent with that of other subunit A genes and was        shown to have all the motifs common to subunit A            This high degree of conservation was evident across taxa as        diverse as animals plants fungi and protozoa                   Genome blot analysis was utilized to determine the        number of genes in the         A thaliana genome corresponding to        subunit A of the vacuolar type ATPase Genomic DNA was        isolated as described subjected to restriction enzyme        digestion and immobilized on a positively charged nylon        membrane Ten single restriction enzyme digestions were        performed Hybridization was conducted at moderate        stringency with a  base pair homologous         A thaliana cDNA probe corresponding        to subunit A of the vacuolar type ATPase Results indicated        hybridization to only a single band for nine out of the ten        enzymes Fig  The         Hae III digest showed faint        hybridization to a second band that was later shown to be        the result of a         Hae III site located in the region of        the probe results not shown        All evidences acquired to date failed to indicate the        presence of a second VATPase subunit A gene in         A thaliana Whole genome blot        analysis detected a single gene in the         A thaliana genome Extensive        screening of a cDNA library derived from all organs and        multiple developmental stages of the plant revealed only a        single subunit A cDNA A polymerase chain reaction based        screen failed to detect an intron length polymorphism        results not shown between two subunit A genes found to be        present in other plants     Lastly extensive database        searches of GenBank the         Arabidopsis EST database and the         Arabidopsis Genome Initiative TAIR        httpwwwarabidopsisorg report only a single subunit A        gene in the current version of the         Arabidopsis genome chromosome  BAC        FK        This situation of a single subunit A gene appears to be        unusual in plants Admittedly only a small subset of plants        has been examined in detail Of the species examined to        date three have only a single subunit A gene detected the        alga         Coleochaete scutata sugar beet          Beta vulgarise      and         A thaliana     Flowering plants        shown to have at least two subunit A genes include oat          Avena sativa  carrot          Daucus carota  tobacco          Nicotiana tabacum  tomato          Lycopersicon esculentum  cotton          Gossypium hirsutum  magnolia          Magnolia virginana          Hydrastis canadensis Chenopodium        rubrum and clematis          Clematis liguisticfolio  In        addition the unicellular alga         Acetabularia acetabulum has two        VATPase subunit A genes        RNA blot analysis was performed to determine the organ        level expression pattern of the subunit A gene Vacuolar        type ATPases are housekeeping enzymes critical for the        maintenance of homeostasis Therefore it is expected that        all living plant cells require VATPase function Since         A thaliana seemed to possess only a        single gene for subunit A of the VATPase it was expected        that this gene should be expressed in all organs tested        Whole RNA was harvested from leaves bolts siliques        flowers axenically grown seedlings and axenically grown        roots RNA was denatured with glyoxal fractionated via        agarose gel electrophoresis and immobilized on a        positively charged nylon membrane Hybridization was        conducted at high stringency with a  base pair        homologous cDNA probe labeled with digoxigenin In        agreement with our expectations results indicated high        levels of expression in all organs tested Fig  with        slightly higher levels of subunit A mRNA present in        seedlings This is most likely due to the fact that        seedlings are the most rapidly growing and metabolizing        stage of the plant tested Seedlings are undergoing        dramatic and rapid vacuole biogenesis to allow for rapid        growth at this stage of development and therefore would be        expected to require a higher level of subunit A expression        than other more terminally differentiated organs Roots        leaves bolts and flowers showed approximately equivalent        amounts of signal with somewhat lower levels in        siliques        Most eukaryotic mRNAs are characterized by the presence        of a poly A tail a series of adenine residues post        transcriptionally attached to the  untranslated region        The primary function of the poly A tail is thought to be        in message stability assisted by a series of poly A        binding proteins     In addition the poly A tail in        conjunction with the  cap may be required for efficient        translation of plant mRNAs            Subunit A of the vacuolar type H ATPase in         A thaliana was shown to exhibit        multi site polyadenylation Sequencing the  ends of seven        independent clones isolated from the PRL cDNA library and        one EST obtained through the         Arabidopsis EST database revealed        four different length transcripts produced from the single        subunit A gene based on different poly A tail attachment        sites Fig  Multiple polyadenylation sites are fairly        common in plant mRNAs but this phenomenon is rare in animal        genes      Since the         A thaliana VATPase subunit A gene        produced at least four different transcripts all producing        the same protein and is one of two flowering plants        observed to date not to have a multigene family for this        subunit experiments were designed to determine if muiti        site polyadenylation might be a mechanism for gene        regulation in plants        VATPase proteolipid isoforms were shown to exhibit        differential transcript expression levels in response to        environmental stresses     This fact implies a        possible role for these isoforms in allowing the plant to        deal with stress Experiments were designed to determine        if in         A thaliana differentially        polyadenylated transcripts could be regulated in response        to stress        First it was critical to confirm that subunit A        transcript levels were at all responsive to environmental        stress conditions Three environmental stresses were chosen        including  mM NaCl etiolation for four days and        chilling at  degrees for four days In all three        situations axenic sevendayold seedlings grown on agar        were evaluated Seven day old seedlings were chosen for        their short growth time limited space requirements and        ease in culturing In addition the facts that they are        rapidly growing and metabolizing were shown to produce        ample quantities of subunit A transcript and possess        several organs including roots hypocotyls and cotyledons        made them an attractive choice for analysis        Whole RNA blot analysis was used first to evaluate the        overall response of subunit A to stress conditions RNA was        extracted from stress treated seedlings and nontreated        control plants Hybridization was performed as previously        described Results indicated a subunit A transcript        response to stress An approximate  fold increase in        transcript level was detected in seedlings subjected to        salt and chilling stress compared to control plants Fig         Etiolated seedlings showed essentially equivalent        amounts of subunit A transcript compared to controls Since        etiolation results in rapid elongation of seedlings it was        expected that there would be a concomitant increase in        subunit A messenger RNA as seen with proteolipid subunit        mRNA in         A thaliana    and subunit A        message levels in rapidly expanding cotton          Gossypium hirsutum  fibers            Equivalent loading of whole RNA was evaluated via        spectrophotometry measuring absorption at  nm using a        PerkinElmer Lambda spectrophotometer and by visual        confirmation using non denaturing ethidium bromide stained        agarose gel electrophoresis results not shown        Having established that overall subunit A transcript        levels were responsive to environmental stress conditions        an assay was designed to examine the response of the four        individual lengthed transcripts to the same stress        conditions The goal was to determine if any of the four        were differentially expressed in response to stress A PCR        based approach was taken to evaluate transcript levels for        the four different subunit A mRNAs Primer pairs were        designed Table  that would only amplify one of the four        transcripts This was accomplished by anchoring the        downstream primer in the poly A tail The upstream primer        was located in the coding region of the subunit A cDNA        Anchoring the downstream primer in the poly A tail        prevented that oligonucleotide from priming at any other        site since  out of  nucleotides were Ts at the  end        The primer pairs were designed such that the four        amplification products would differ in size by        approximately  base pairs for ease of visualization on        agarose gels and blots Fig and Fig  Primer pair T        and T corresponds to transcript and produce an        amplification product of  base pairs Primer pair T        and T corresponds to transcript and amplify a band of         base pairs Primers T and T correspond to        transcript and amplify a  base pair product Lastly        primer pair T and T corresponds to transcript and        produce a  base pair amplification product The        transcript amplification product which is the smallest        and nested within the other three acted as probe to detect        all four transcripts This nesting was accomplished to        avoid differences in signal during hybridization based on        different probe lengths and labeling efficiency        A control experiment was performed prior to the actual        stress analysis to ensure that the primer pairs amplified        the correct transcript only and that the transcript probe        would detect all four amplification products Whole RNA was        extracted from seedlings and cDNA was generated using oligo        dT as described in materials and methods Subunit A        transcripts were amplified from the generated cDNA with the        appropriate primer pairs and transferred to solid support        Hybridization was performed at high stringency with the        transcript amplification product as probe The results of        this experiment indicated that all four primer pairs        amplified only a single band of the appropriate and        expected size and that the transcript probe adequately        hybridized to all four amplification products Fig         The differential expression of subunit A transcripts was        evaluated in response to salt cold stress and etiolation        Complementary DNAs were generated from sevendayold        seedlings subjected to individual stress conditions        Transcripts  were evaluated via RTPCR using transcript        specific primers Amplification products were immobilized        on solid support and hybridized with the transcript        amplification product The results of this experiment        indicate that all four transcripts behaved identically with        respect to individual stress conditions Fig  All four        transcripts showed approximately  fold increases in        response to  mM sodium chloride stress compared to        untreated controls Similarly treatment of plants at six        degrees for four days resulted in a similar increase in        signal for all four transcripts Etiolation resulted in        slightly higher message levels for transcripts   and         compared to controls The lesser degree of increase for        transcript might be due to near saturation of the signal        The latter might be due to the higher abundance of the        transcript or due to more efficient amplification of the        transcript primer set Transcript seems to show        slightly less signal than control plants but the        autoradiograph is somewhat under developed These results        are in agreement with the whole RNA stress blot analysis        Apparent quantitative differences in upregulation between        transcripts shown in Fig  might be due to differential        amplification efficiency of the four different primer sets        and do not necessarily represent true differential        upregulation of the four transcripts The data can only be        evaluated quantitatively between samples amplified with the        same primer set In summation no significant differential        regulation of the four subunit A transcripts was detected        in seedlings in response to the three stress conditions        evaluated                    Conclusions        Evidence gathered to date indicates the presence of a        single gene encoding subunit A of the vacuolar type H        ATPase in         A thaliana The search for        additional subunit A genes was conducted using whole genome        blot analysis screening a lambda PRL cDNA library        intron length polymorphism analysis and extensive computer        searches of the         Arabidopsis Expressed Sequence Tag        database GenBank and the         Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Most        flowering plants evaluated to date have a small multigene        family encoding subunit A of the vacuolar type H ATPase        The small size of the         A thaliana genome may be indicative        of a trend toward streamlining of DNA in this plant which        may have eliminated a redundant subunit A gene over        evolutionary time Subunit A genes and subsequently        proteins are highly conserved Therefore it is not likely        that a subunit A gene would have escaped the screen by        having a low degree of nucleotide identity        Vacuolar type ATPases are housekeeping enzymes probably        needed in all living plant cells The single         A thaliana subunit A gene was shown        by whole RNA blot analysis to be transcribed in all organs        of the plant tested The organs analyzed included roots        leaves bolts siliques and flowers In addition        relatively high levels of transcript were found in whole        seedlings These results support the notion of a single        subunit A gene in         A thaliana that is transcribed in        all cells of the plant        Numerous examples are present in the literature see           and references therein of changes in transcript        protein or activity levels of vacuolar type H ATPases in        response to environmental stress These results indicate a        potential role for the vacuolar type H ATPase in        maintenance of homeostasis during times of environmental        stress Whole RNA blot analysis performed on seedlings        exposed to environmental stress conditions indicated that        transcript levels of subunit A were responsive to salt and        cold stress treatments Transcript levels were shown to        increase approximately  fold in seedlings treated with        cold and salt stress Etiolation did not produce as        significant a change in transcript level as salt and cold        stress        The single vacuolar type H ATPase subunit A gene        detected in         A thaliana can produce at least four        different length transcripts by using different        polyadenylation sites These transcripts differ only in        their  untranslated region and produce identical        proteins The presence of regulatory elements in the end        of the subunit A gene could be a potential mechanism by        which this protein is post transcriptionally regulated        However the evidence gathered in this work indicates        that the four different transcripts generated off the        single subunit A gene are not significantly differentially        regulated in response to salt chilling or etiolation in        axenically grown seedlings Multi site polyadenylation does        not appear to be a mechanism for posttranscriptional        control of gene expression for subunit A of the vacuolar        type H ATPase in         A
