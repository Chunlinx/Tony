                                 Ghosts of Nijinksy            Figure skating began tocaptivate me and my friends when we were  We watched Sonja Henie in themovies we were taken to ice shows we took lessons and we had strong viewsabout what we wished to wear while practicing our axels at the public rinkFigure skating wasnt a real sport comradely and combative like childrens icehockey which we played in boring skates and unlovely clothes on a frozen pondIt was a romantic and competitive display emphatically a girl thing Adorableoutfits were a large part of the whole idea            They obviously stillare and not just for girls My interest in skating withered and died before Iwas  but my evergreen interest in outfits keeps me staring avidly at what isbeing worn on the ice at the Winter Olympics even though I now lack much graspof the rules of the game I mainly notice that things have come a long waysince I was  Classic figure skating is now complicated by the development ofsensational ice dancing in several categories The oldfashioned romanticdisplay has been profitably invigorated with sex fashion and progressivetechnical excitement to say nothing of unceasing soapoperatic drama playedout among the participants and spun out in the media            Womens costumes have shed all fakeNordictouches suggesting conventional winter or conventional cuteness Gone

notable is the waymens costumes for this quasisport have largely kept their dignity whilewomens have burst into hysterics The physical risks have become very greatfor male ice dancers but their clothes stay conservative When they dontscathing commentary appears in the press The young Russian gold medalist IlyaKulik got raves for his dazzling skating and nothing but scorn for theyellowandblack giraffeprint shirt he wore with more scorn for the gauzywings on the abstractly designed torso of his other costume Artur Dmitrievanother Russian gold medalist also got negative press for his plungingneckline and wrapped sash apparently too outrageous for pairs skating Theghost of Vaslav Nijinsky seems to haunt these young Russians in their searchfor supreme skill at multiple turns in midair and in their willingness to wearbrilliant superballet gear            The Russian Ballet convention for male costumewas established all over the world in the last century and it allowed any sortof glorious finery above the waist even with long plain legs below Laterunder the innovative direction of Sergei Diaghilev Nijinskys Rose andFaun costumes among others gave rise to a host of abstract creations forthe male body These have appeared on the dance stage throughout this centuryand are now to be seen on Damien Woetzel Mark Morris and others But none ofthis imaginative freedom seems to have reached the ice except on Russians            On the other hand acouple of weeks ago the costume of Frenchman Philippe Candeloro alluded to thetradition of theater rather than that of dance Candeloro also avoidedprolonged whirls in midair offering some dashing  th century mimedswordplay instead Thighhigh black boots rose startlingly up from his skatesset off by a lacedup

matching bright blue bejeweledRenaissance outfits            But in most cases the ballroom conventiongoverns the clothes for traditional pairs skating and affects ice dancing tookeeping male ice performers looking fairly sober Mens skating costumes arestrictly simple and symmetrical beginning with long black trousers thatinvoke Fred Astaire even when worn with a loose rolledsleeved openneckedblack shirt or with various Star Trek effects above the waist Maleskating costume like male evening dress is still meant to offset thefantastic extremes of the womens costumes which run to exposure asymmetryand fluttering ornament just like Ginger Rogers dancing dresses in the earlys Sparkles now seem OK for everything even for mens black pants and neatjackets Metallic fabric rhinestones or sequins may coat both him and herthe better to mesmerize us equally as we track them flashing past Not forskates thoughno glitz on the business end            There is an astonishingarray of inventions in womens costumes where all the most dangerous aestheticrisks are currently being taken But some things are constant For pairsskating womens skates must be white and unfortunately very big These usedto look fine with furtrimmed jackets but they look quite different withminiballdresses or virtual underwear and they looked grotesque on tinyOksana Baiul in her pink swanqueen outfit at Lillehammer Norway in thetoodirect reference to traditional ballet suddenly made her skates lookungainly For ice dancing skates are often fleshcolored to match the tightsand the leg may sweep all the way to the end            Costumes have more scopehowever some tend toward approximations of current fashion with manyponytails little bandeaux under boleros and several bare midriffs along withSM trappings in better or worse arrangements and a range of recent andremote historical allusions Whatever the costume it must go with tights andskates it should enhance the skaters performance and the rules say it musthave a skirt But this can mean two panels fore and aft eight overlappingpanels a flippy circle a footlong sheath with a slit a stiff inch flangea kneelength drift of chiffon Above the waist we might see an asymmetricalpatch of salmon pink and another of black making one breast look heavy and theother one look absent or we can see the simple blackvelvet scoopneck topabove the fluttering yellow silk skirt worn by Oksana Kazakova the two colorsperfectly balanced by the two flashing white skates below A dress in anybright single color tends to be great two colors in several patchy sectionstends to be dreadful especially when mixed with patches of bare skin Slantedhemlines are bad slit skirts are good A ponytail with a lot of feathers orfluff holding it together is no good hair that neatly caps the head whetherin a bob or a bun is very good Anything that looks as if it might get in apartners mouth and eyes or slap his face is bad any material that caressesthe thighs is better than a fabric that smacks them I could go on but Illwait until next winter
