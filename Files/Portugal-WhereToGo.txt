relatively short amount of time and distance covered allows visitors to sample varied regions and attractions including famed beaches rugged mountains splendid castles traditional rural villages and gorgeous medieval cities Most visitors still focus on the charming capital Lisbon and the alluring sunny beaches of the Algarve but theres much more to PortugalLisbonFor years Lisbon has enjoyed a reputation as a relatively quiet town without the hustle bustle and general hassle of other major European cities While there are still ample remnants of that easygoing charm the gap is quickly closing the city now hardly lacks for traffic and noisePortugals capital city is the countrys largest with a population of more than  million Due to a massive earthquake that obliterated much of the

EuropeAlfama  Baixa districtsNearby the atmospheric medieval Alfama district is Lisbons most picturesque and fascinating area It spills down the side of a hill between the Castelo de So Jorge and the Tagus with all the color and bustle of an Arab bazaar The bairro district in fact a legacy of the Moors is a charming labyrinth of crooked streets cobbled alleyways decaying old houses and palaces fish stalls and fado music clubs The Alfama was one of the few areas to survive the earthquake Another majestic view of the city is from a charming park Miradouro de Santa Luzia just down the hill from the castle Lisbons S Patriarcal cathedral appears out of nowhere at a bend in the road most easily reached from the center by continuing east on the extension of Rua da Conceio Begun as a

Liberdade is the airy and ornate Estao de So Bento far too handsome to be a mere railway hub Completed in  its lobby is decorated with wonderful azulejo tile panels depicting important scenes from the citys history making it a legitimate tourist attractionJust south of the railway station is the Cathedral District The thcentury Romanesque S Cathedral is bare and austeremore fortress than church In the th century an attempt was made to improve its plodding appearance with some baroque additions but the church remains rather lifeless Inside the cathedral a beautiful baroque silver altarpiece is worth a look as is the rose window Within these granite walls Joo I married his English bride Philippa of Lancaster in  the scene is depicted in azulejos in So Bento railway station thus sealing the ancient alliance between Portugal and Englandan alliance with particular strength in Porto due to the overwhelming English involvement in the port wine tradeNearby the CasaMuseu Guerra Junqueiro

The highlight is the Salo rabe Arab Room where the Moorish style of the Alhambra in Granada was lavishly recreatedNext door is the citys finest church the Igreja de So Francisco on Rua do Infante D Henrique Conventionally Gothic on the outside the churchs interior is like an explosion in a gold factory Gilded rococo details swathe the walls from ground to ceiling The most impressive feature is the Tree of Jesse an elaborately carved gilded and painted thcentury wood sculpture on the northern wall The attentiongetting piece depicts the family geneaology of Christ Opposite the church is a small but interesting museum with relics of the old monastery and catacombsAlso near the Bolsa is the Casa do Infante supposedly the site if not the actual building where Henry the Navigator was born see page  This entire block was recently under extensive restoration to become a large city museum Citizens of Porto are very proud of their association with Henry especially since their city was where the fleet for the  assault on Ceuta was fitted out For this patriotic venture against the Moors of North Africa the people of Porto surrendered the finest cuts of meat in their stores to the navy and lived on tripe instead thus earning their honorable nickname of tripeiros literally tripe eaters as people from Porto are commonly knownSome of Portos other interesting museums are northwest

PortoPortos nearest beaches lie to the west where the Douro passes a large sandbar and meets the sea at Foz do Douro Mouth of the Douro In the th century Foz was a very popular resort but the water is now heavily polluted Nevertheless the beaches and restaurants still make an enjoyable day out and a scenic old tram number  provides excursions from the resort to the thcentury Castelo do Queijo

Lisbon from the Algarve Though it frequently gets passed over by those hellbent on getting to the southern beaches the Alentejo is one of Portugals most fascinating and historic regions Although it accounts for approximately one third of the countrys land area these vast sunbaked plains are sparsely populated The slowmoving lifestyle has given rise to jokes about its equally slow inhabitants such as the one about the Alentejano who keeps an empty bottle in the fridge for his friends who dont drink In fact the Alentejo is far more sophisticated and varied than it may first appear with an excellent winemaking tradition large aristocratic estates and some of the countrys historic cities such as vora Massive medieval fortresses stand watch atop steep hills along the Spanish border and

above the plains The Rossio Praa Marqus de Pombal forms the heart of the lower town and is home to the hustle and bustle of a Saturday market one of the regions liveliest where you can buy the famous pottery of Estremoz tasty local cheese and any of the other agricultural products of the Alentejo There is a tourist office on the square as well as an interesting Museu Rural Rural Museum displaying a wealth of idiosyncratic local gadgets and pottery Also here is the beautiful marblefaced Cmara Municipal Town Hall converted from an old convent with impressive azulejo panelsThe upper town is reached through medieval walls Lording over the town is the thcentury Torre das Trs Coroas castle keep or Tower of Three Crowns visible for miles around Inside is the azulejocovered chapel of Rainha Santa Isabel dedicated to the memory of Dom Diniss sainted queen To one side is the whitemarble Royal Palace now one of the countrys finest and most indemand pousadasBorba on the road to Elvas and Spain is more downtoearth though its marble buildings betray the source of the local wealth The people of Borba make their living from extracting marble from quarries as well as producing fine red and white wines Every November the town hosts a gregarious wine festival Just up the road  km  miles away is a third marble town Vila Viosa The pretty town is most remarkable for its impressive thcentury Pao Ducal Ducal Palace of the Bragana family the last of Portugals royal dynasties The Pao used to be the favorite country house of the family who often preferred hunting in the enormous surrounding park to the fuss of Lisbon or the cold of their palace in Bragana in northern Portugal see page  The guided tour in Portuguese only provides an intimate glimpse of the royal apartments as they would have appeared before the assassination of Carlos I in  Next door to the palace is the pousada in a gorgeously restored thcentury convent Further east and nearer to Spain is the mighty frontier fortress town of Elvas The castle wallsamong the bestpreserved in Portugalwere modernized in the th century and given the characteristic star shape that distinguishes the work of Vauban the French military architect From the ramparts are superb views of the Portuguese plains and Spain across the border Nearby is the oldest section of town with steep cobblestoned streets and hanging laundry Extending from the citys walls is the Aqueduto da Amoreira an aqueduct some  km  miles long that took  years to complete The towns largest church on Praa da Repblica is the richly painted Nossa Senhora da Assuno with an elaborate Manueline portal and belltower overlooking the square Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos another church closer to the castle has an octagonal shape that reflects the influence of the architecture of the Knights Templar and the remarkable dome is covered in beautiful thcentury azulejos Northeastern AlentejoPortalegre is the prosperous nononsense capital of the northern Alentejo located near the hills and neolithic monuments of the Serra de So Mamede  km  miles north of Estremoz Its past wealth based on carpet and silk production accounts for the graceful thcentury mansions lining the Rua  de Junho By far the most interesting sight in town though is the Fbrica Real de Tapearias Tapestry Factory housed in a thcentury Jesuit school where dozens of women use great handlooms to weave carpets from thousands of different shades of woolHorse fans should be sure to visit Alter do Cho  km miles southeast of Portalegre the location of the Coudelaria de Alter Real Royal Stud Farm where Portugals finest horses are bred If you arrive in the morning you can watch the Lusitanian and Alter do Cho horses being fed There is also an interesting museum and the town has a fine restored castleFlr da Rosa and Crato are two small agricultural towns west of Portalegre In the former is one of the best examples of how the state pousada chain is adapting modern architecture to historic buildings The inn now occupying the thcentury Convento de Flr da Rosa is extraordinary Outside of town on the road to Aldeia da Mata is one of the bestpreserved dolmens in Portugal a mysterious prehistoric chamber sitting unobtrusively in rolling pastoral lands In Crato is a stately square with an interesting Varanda do Gro Prior with stone arches under a terrace once used for outdoor Mass and a municipal museum of local handicrafts and artifacts two doors down Above town are the curious ruins of the castle now undergoing extensive restoration North of Portalegre is the pleasant town Castelo de Vide whose thcentury castle is surrounded by gleaming houses that nuzzle against the steeply sloping hill Further down the hill the winding alleyways of the Judiaria Jewish Quarter have survived and make a great place for wandering Among these houses is the countrys oldest surviving synagogue dating from the th century For centuries the fresh springs at Fonte de Vila close to the handsome main square the Praa Dom Pedro V have been another of Castelo de Vides many attractionsA steep winding road leads to the dramatically situated medieval walled village Marvo Perched on an outcrop overlooking Spain the easygoing town is the highest in Portugal at  m ft The thcentury castle walls appear woven right into the natural rock the views from atop the ramparts of both the whitewashed town and surrounding area are stunning Its not hard to understand why the fortress proved virtually impenetrable Marvo has almost all the charm of bidos see page  but without the slickness or tour bus crowds Just outside the castle entrance is a handsome Museu Municipal with nice archaeological finds religious artifacts and altarpieces and regional costumes Baixo Lower AlentejoOf Roman origin it was a regional capital under Julius Caesar the agricultural city of Beja  km miles south of vora is at the hub of roads that lead to Lisbon the Algarve and across the Alentejo The old town is particularly attractiveThe decoratively crenellated Torre de Menagem in the castle dates to the th century and provides a good lookout over the extensive wheatfields of the region The citys most interesting sight is the Convento de Nossa Senhora da Conceio with its fine Manueline carving bright Moorishstyle azulejos splendid Baroque chapel and an explosion of rococo gold leaf The former convent houses an interesting regional museum with a good archaeological and painting collection There is also a unique Museu Visigtico Visigothic Art Museum in Santo Amaro Bejas oldest church The new Pousada de So Fransisco has been admirably converted from another convent once derelictThe charming sleepy town of Serpa rises neatly above the plains  km  miles east of Beja on the route to Spain Beyond the formidable Porta da Beja a monumental gate in the city wall small streets wend among bright white houses Many of the buildings hide small cheese factories which produce Serpas famous ewes milk cheese The towns castle was partially destroyed by a Spanish attack in  but still affords enjoyable views The walls continue past a privately owned thcentury mansion and on to a slender aqueduct which ends in an ancient well with a working chainpulley system for drawing water A small ethnographic museum displays the wares of the agricultural and industrial workers of the areaFrom Serpa a rewarding drive takes you south toward the eastern Algarve through a hilly and sparsely populated landscape where shepherds tend their flocks Along the way is Mrtola an ancient whitewashed town founded by the Phoenicians built up by the Romans and later seized by the Moors Perched on a ridge at the junction of the River Guadiana and the smaller Oeiras the town is protected by Moorish walls and topped by a rather dilapidated castle with a profusion of storks nests Mrtola bursts with history Its church the Igreja Matriz betrays a previous incarnation as a mosque with a prayer niche mihrab while the town hall now a museum is constructed on Roman foundations The Guadiana River continues as far as the Algarve forming part of the border with Spain The road that follows its banks is one of the most beautiful access routes between the Alentejo and the AlgarveCoastal AlentejoThe Alentejo coast a popular holiday destination with the Portuguese has a character slightly different from that of the even more popular Algarve The water here is colder and the winds and waves greater but it is also noticeably quieter more relaxed and less expensive Often the best beaches are those near a river estuary thus giving visitors the choice of surfing in the Atlantic or swimming in the calmer waters of the riverThe northernmost point of the coastal Alentejo is the narrow sandy peninsula of Tria  km  miles northwest of the attractive town of Alccer do Sal Tria has beaches on both the Sado estuary and the ocean but the town has been heavily developed in recent years to accommodate ferries from Setbal see page  Even so it is worth visiting the remains of the Roman fishing village of Cetobriga You can escape the crowds on the beaches of the ocean sideFurther to the south and slightly inland is the town of Santiago do Cacm hemmed in by lowlying hills on three sides and crowned by a hilltop castle which holds a macabre cemetery full of disinterred bones Scattered about the surrounding hills is a profusion of windmill towers which without their white canvas sails look for all the world like ancient cannons The lagoons of Santo Andr and Melides are both easily accessible from Santiago do Cacm and boast long stretches of beach ocean and lagoon swimming and small beachside communitiesTHE ALGARVETo many international visitors the Algarve is Portugal but the Portuguese see the Algarve as a distinct anomaly The areas distinctive character owes much to its strong Moorish heritage and its Mediterranean climate so different from most other parts of the country The regions popularity with millions of vacationers has produced an explosion of purposebuilt holiday villages The Algarve is blessed with a number of spectacular beaches a wonderfully sunny climate many excellent sporting facilities and even a handful of quiet and untouristed areasAccess from one part of the Algarve to another is along the EN road which runs most of the length of the coast The section of coast stretching from Faro eastwards to Spain known as the Sotavento Coast is made up of salt marshes and lagoons with beautiful sandy beaches on the barrier islands just offshore The most intensively developed part stretches westward from Faro to Portimo Here the long beaches are all backed by scores of busy largescale tourist resortsThe more dramatic Barlavento Coast extends west from Portimo and is characterized by a twisting shoreline indented with coves and windsculpted cliffs The coast comes to an end at Cabo So Vicente known to the medieval Portuguese as the End of the World The west coast of the Algarve is wilder colder windier and considerably emptier even though it has its fair share of wonderful beaches Inland youll find Roman and Moorish monuments numerous fruit orchards and the scenic wooded hillsides of the serras that separate the Algarve from the Alentejo Barlavento CoastThe hardscrabble town of Sagres and the area around it are remote rugged and desertlike with only a relative smattering of hotels restaurants and other facilities aimed at tourists It is like the Algarves outpost which is precisely why it has so many admirers Prince Henry the Navigator established his Navigation School here though some protest that it was farther east near Lagos The town has a picturesque working harbor and a cute little square Praa Repblica and is ringed by informal and in summer hopping nightspotsThe best beaches near Sagres Mareta Martinhal Beliche Tonel and Telheiro are sheltered and not overcrowded Beyond the village of Sagres a great rocky peninsula hangs above a brooding ocean Henry and his sailors are said to have set up camp at the Fortaleza de Sagres fortress that sits on the promontory though little of the original structure has survived Inside is a small thcentury chapel Nossa Senhora da Graa and what looks to be a huge stone sun dial known as the Rosa dos Ventos rose compass A couple of kilometers one mile west of Sagres are the more authentic remains of another fortress Fortaleza do Beliche At the tip of the windswept cliffs of Cabo de So Vicente the lighthouse built in  on the site of a convent chapel has a beam visible up to  km  miles away Lagos the principal resort of the western Algarve is the rare beach town that offers something for everyone By night Lagos is lively with outdoor restaurant terraces and bars and by day it combines a rich historical past with a busy present Attractive beaches are on the outskirts of town so it is not a classic resort in the mold of Praia da Rocha The wellrestored fortress Forte da Ponte da Bandeira once guarded the entrance to the harbor in the th century Many of the streets rising towards the top of town are narrow cobbled and more accustomed to donkeys than rental cars Though Lagos town still retains a good part of its original wallsmost of them from the th century but partRoman in placesthey have been rebuilt and expanded over the centuries Lagos was an important trading port under the Moors but the town enjoyed its heyday after the Reconquest when it was proclaimed the capital of the Algarve On Rua General Alberta da Silveira the tiny chapel Igreja de Santo Antnio an exuberant gilt Baroque work and one of the Algarves finest churches was rebuilt soon after the earthquake The entrance to the church is actually through the curious and eclectic museum next door Museu Regional de Lagos Rooms display sacred art archaeological remains the original charter of Lagos holy vestments and a bizarre collection of creatures like a science experiment gone bad an eightlegged goat kid preserved in formaldehyde a oneeyed sheep a cat with two faces The main street of Lagos is the charming cobbled Rua  de Abril packed with restaurants bars and antiques and ceramics shops The beaches near Lagos range from Meia Praia  km  mile to the east a long  km miles flat stretch to pocketsized coves just west of the city Weird and wonderful rock formations and steep cliffs that glow orange at sunset have made them some of the most photographed in Europe head for Praia de Dona Ana and Praia do Camilo both small pretty and crowded street signs indicate the way to eachAt the southern tip just before the road turns west to Sagres are the coasts most spectacular sights Ponta da Piedade Point of Piety is the mother of all stack and cliff formations along the Algarve a stunning terracotta family of bridges terraces and grottoes Portimo second only to Faro in size in the Algarve is the most workmanlike town on the coast But nestled around it are some of the Algarves finest beaches and that has transformed the area into one of the coasts most popular resorts Praia da Rocha and Praia Trs Irmos in particular are lined with hotels and beachgoersMost of Portimos local color is down by the port a haven of fishing activity The top fishcanning spot on the Algarve Portimo is renowned for its restaurants specializing in sardinhas grelhadas grilled sardines In the center of town Largo  de Dezembro is a thcentury park with  splendid blueandwhite azulejo benches each illustrating a pivotal event in the history of Portugal Along Rua Machado dos Santos is the handsome Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Conceio sitting atop a small hill and incline of steps The yellow and white church originally constructed in the th century has a beautiful Gothic portico with carved capitals though it looks like a colonial church you might find in Brazil due to its reconstruction and remodeling in the th and th centuries From the center of town head to the waterfront especially if its anywhere near time for lunch or dinner You can almost follow your nose toward the heady aroma of grilled sardines It will take you to the dockside lined with simple restaurants one after the other all serving an abundance of delicious smoky sardines and other freshcaught fish Just  km  miles down river from Portimo is Praia da Rocha which became a holiday village for wealthy Portuguese families back at the end of the th century It was discovered by the British in the s when this beach of rocks strewn with extravagantly shaped eroded stacks provided an inspirational refuge for writers and intellectuals The long km mile golden beach remains the main attraction At the very eastern end of the resort guarding the River Arade is the historic Fortaleza de Santa Catarina de Ribamar St Catherines Fortress built in  to defend Silves and Portimo against the Moors The opposite end of Praia da Rochas long stretch is known as Praia do Vau The splendid rock formations and coves continue but this end of the beach is quieter and less developed than the eastern endJust west Praia de Trs Irmos is the slightly upscale beach cousin of Praia da Rocha The eastern end of the beach is a beautiful cove hemmed in by cliffs and ochre rocks Beyond it the beach stretches to Alvor a classic Algarvian fishermens village Narrow cobbled streets plunge downhill to a quay and market where boats bob at anchor on a wide marshy lagoon At the top of the hill on Rua da Igreja is Igreja Matriz a charming thcentury church with a delicately carved Manueline portico perhaps the finest on the Algarve North of Portimo and extending across the western half of the province is the Serra de Monchique a mountain range that protects the coast from the hot plains farther north The serra is a verdant landscape of cork pine and chestnut trees and lowlying areas are covered in blankets of colorful wildflowers The first stop on the scenic journey along route  is the spa village of Caldas de Monchique known since Roman times for its therapeutic waters North of Caldas the road weaves uphill quickly rising  m  ft in  km  miles past terraced farmlands and forests of eucalyptus oak and cork Monchique is a small market town known for its handicrafts and the famous Manueline portico of its thcentury Igreja Matriz The road continues upwards towards Fia almost  m  ft above sea level affording one of the best views in southern Portugal On a clear day you can see from the bay of Portimo to the Sagres peninsula and pick out the rocky outcrops of the Lagos beachesSilves is the former Moorish capital of the Algarve More than eight centuries ago Silves then known as Chelb was one of the strongest outposts in thcentury Arab Iberia a magnificent city with palaces gardens bazaars and a huge red castle on a hill Silves is now just a dusty backwater but the glorious setting remains The Castelo dos Mouros Moors Castle took shape after the Reconquest though it preserves distinctly Moorish lines Next to the castle is the impressive Gothic S Velha Old Cathedral of Silves built by the liberating Christian crusaders Opposite the S is the thcentury Igreja da Misericrdia with a classic Manuelinestyle side door The imposing Torreo da Porta da Cidade Turret of the City Gate gives you a good idea of how seriously defense of the city was taken The charming resort of Carvoeiro an archetypal small Barlavento resort has a tiny beach at the bottom of a pretty valley The original village of Carvoeiro is now fairly commercialized but to many people it remains one of the coasts most attractive resortsInland just off the main road is the attractive little village of Porches with some classic white Algarvian houses and filigreed chimneys Porches is famous throughout Portugal for its handpainted pottery though you wont find much in the village itself The shops of greatest renown are along the EN  route One of the most photographed beaches along this stretch is Nossa Senhora da Rocha Our Lady of the Rock The rock in question is a promontory boldly jutting out into the sea surmounted by a little white fishermens church The beach of Armao de Pra is one of the longest in the Algarvea flat golden stretch to the east picturesque rock stacks and small coves to the west The massive development on the east end of town though has pretty much run roughshod over the natural beauty of the area all but eclipsing the former fishing villageAlbufeira at one time a picturesque fishermens town has grown wildly in recent years to become the leading resort in the Algarve Its clifftop position and labyrinthine street plan provided an easily defensible spot for the Moors and Albufeira proved one of the last towns to fall during the Reconquest Modern Albufeira has fallen prey to mass tourismbars cafs and nightspots pump out music day and night The excellent beaches west of town are relatively uncrowded The best are So Rafael and Coelha Castelo and Gal three small beautiful covesOne of the most picturesque towns in the province is the lovely village Alte about  km  miles north of Albufeira The architectural highlight of the village is the beautiful thcentury Igreja Matriz entered through a classic Manueline portal The rest of Alte is the Algarve of picture postcardswhitewashed houses along narrow streets colorful windows filigreed chimney pots and redtiled roofs Loosely grouped with Albufeira are beaches to the east Here the coastline features the last of the dramatic rock formations that have made the Algarve so famous Falsia is a beautiful beach framed by high cliffs but to get to it you need to negotiate the grounds of the Sheraton Algarve whose elevator down to the beach is for guests only There are more excellent beaches at Santa Eulalia Balaia Praia da Oura and So Joo The center of activity along this beach hinterland is the infamous stripa long street of bustling bars restaurants and nightspots leading up to the hilltop area known as Montechoro Nearby Vilamoura is a wholly planned and sanitized tourist undertaking with highrise hotels and sprawling villas that line manicured golf courses to the thhole club bar and the Algarves biggest marina Its a major draw for those who have their clubs ready for a golfing vacation several of the Algarves best courses have been sculpted out of the area A little farther west Quarteira once a quiet fishing village is today virtually unrecognizable subsumed under an onslaught of rows and rows of apartment buildings East of Vilamoura and Quarteira the terrain begins to change The rugged rocky lines of the Barlavento coast west of Faro give way to long flat beaches of the east The small crossroads town of Almancil has shops cafs and businesses many of which are dedicated to serving English expatriates A few miles south on the coast are two of the Algarves most luxurious and exclusive resorts Vale do Lobo and Quinta do LagoVale do Lobo is a mazelike villa community with a nice beach and a variety of golf and tennis resort hotels Quinta do Lago a few miles down the coast has one of the finest golf courses on the Algarve designed delicately along the Ria Formosa Nature Preserve The beach can be reached across a long nostalgic wooden bridge that crosses over wetlands and bird sanctuaries Back toward Almancil is one of the Algarves top attractions About  km  miles west of Faro a simple white church stands out on a small hill overlooking the thundering highway A sign simply says S Lourenoindicating the turnoff to So Loureno do Matto Church of St Lawrence of the Woods Inside is one of the most extraordinary displays of azulejo design youll ever see Every square inch of the Baroque thcentury churchits walls vaulted ceiling and cupolais covered with handpainted blueandwhite ceramic tiles Most date from the early th century and depict biblical scenes detailing the life of St Lawrence The ensemble is a stunning sight not to be missedLoul north of Almancil is a prosperous town known for its leather lace and copper goods Tour groups come from far and wide to shop at the colorful bustling market Just below the permanent market halls on the main Praa da Repblica youll find a wellpreserved section of the medieval castle walls which were much damaged by the  earthquake Also worth visiting are the Igreja Matriz So Clemente a thcentury Gothic church with thcentury azulejo tiles the Convento da Graa with a terrific Manueline portal and Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Conceio a small church prized for its Baroque altar and ceramic tiles In the streets directly below the castle walls you may well hear the sounds of craftsmen beating copperfrom whom you can buy direct If you are in the Algarve in springtime dont miss the Loul Carnival The parades Battle of Flowers and musical celebrations are the best of their kind in the regionSo Brs de Alportel is another market town and site of one of only two government pousadas inns along the Algarve in the midst of rolling orchards of fig olive and orange trees You may wish to pay a visit to the charming Museu Etnogrfico do Trajo Algrvio Museum of Algarvian Costumes where exhibits of local dress are well staged in a large old house  m  yds or so off the main squareOn the road toward Faro is a pair of historical sights The Palcio de Esti is a most curious find The charming Rococo palace found through a small side gate just to the left of the church steps in the town center once belonged to the Dukes of Esti Begun in the midth century its now abandoned and visibly dilapidated and only the gardens are open to the public Yet it is a spectacular sight Its faded glory includes balustrade terraces and staircases with splendid bursts of bougainvillea busts of historic characters impaled on the parapets brightly colored wall tiles and formal gardens The Portuguese government aims to construct a pousada inn here The dusty Villa Romana de Milreu Roman ruins of Milreu are  km  mile down the road from the village toward Faro a small sign on the side of the road reads Ruinas de Milreu The tall semicircular tower ruin is thought to have been a temple to pagan water gods at one time however by the fifth century it had clearly been converted to a churchFaro the provincial capital of the Algarve is bypassed by many tourists though the town has a greater wealth of cultural and historic monuments than any other Algarvian town and a picturesque old quarterThe main entrance to the circular old town near the harbor is the thcentury Arco da Vila a charming arch and bell tower Beyond the arch a cobbled street worn slick by centuries of tramping feet leads up to the splendid expanse of the Largo da S Cathedral Squarebest seen in the evening when floodlit and free of cars The Ss unusual cathedral tower main portico and two interior chapels are all that remain of the original thcentury Gothic building Inside is one of the Algarves most important collections of th and thcentury sacred art Climb the tower for fine views over the whole of Faro The Convento de Nossa Senhora da Assuno Convent of Our Lady of the Assumption the first Renaissance building in the Algarve contains what is arguably the most beautiful cloister in southern Portugal The convent has been beautifully restored as a museum devoted to archaeology the Museu Arqueolgico Infante Dom Henrique The principal exhibit is a yearold Roman floor mosaic measuring  m  ft long and  m  ft wide Central Faros main thoroughfare is Rua de Santo Antnio At its far end is the Museu Etnogrfico Ethnographic Museum with displays of local handicrafts and reconstructions of rooms in a typical Algarvian house The museum sits on the edge of Faros Mouraria or old Moorish quarter The new town an expansion dating from the th century is west of here Igreja de So Pedro Church of St Peter built in the th century has a carved Baroque retable and a couple of Rococo chapelsBut Faros finest church is Igreja do Carmo Carmelite Church The promise of its twin belltowers and stately faade is matched by a beautiful gilded interior but the greatest attraction is the macabre Capela dos Ossos Chapel of Bones This thcentury curiosity like a similar chapel in the town of vora farther north is constructed of the skulls and bones of monks unearthed from the friars cemetery Depending on your tolerance for such things it is either fascinating or sick beyond beliefThe Sotavento CoastHeading east from the provincial capital of Faro the first settlement of any size you will come to is the colorful fishing town of Olho Olho used to be described as the little white Cubist town of the Algarve its architecture likened to that of North African towns The parish church which also goes by the name of Nossa Senhora do Rosrio was founded by King Dom Pedro II in  The small chapel at the rear Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos Our Lady of the Afflicted is where women often pray when their fishermen husbands are away at seaInstead of the redtiled roofs and filigreed chimneys seen elsewhere in the Algarve the Olho skyline comprises flattopped roofs of terraces called aoeitas The Olho fish market is one of the Algarves best especially famous for its mussels and other shellfish With its triumverate of Moorish Reconquista and Renaissance roots clearly visible Tavira one of the true gems of the Algarve is one of the regions most historically rich cities In the s Tavira had the largest population on the Algarve This tunafishing port with its selfassured town of historic churches imposing classicalstyle mansions and beautiful riverfront gardens probably dates back ar least as far as the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians In fact its sevenarched stone bridge of Roman origin is still in use Taviras castle in the center of the casco histrico old quarter was a defensive structure built by the Moors The walls look directly onto the Igreja de Santa Maria do Castelo Church of St Mary of the Castle most likely built on the site of the old mosque The Gothic portal is the only original thcentury element of the building to have survived the devastating  earthquake Across the square the ochrecolored former convent Convento da Graa is being converted into a pousada inn by the Portuguese governmentJust down the hill off Rua Galeria near the river is the beautiful thcentury Igreja da Misericrdia Church of Mercy a spectacular Renaissance edifice with a carved portico Rua da Liberdade Taviras main street is lined with stately thcentury mansions A nice excursion from Tavira is to the nearby island Ilha de Tavira where there is a huge and thoroughly appealing beach backed by sand dunes Jetties leave from a point Quatro guas a couple of kilometers one mile east of townBack on the mainland a turnoff of the main road east EN still of Tavira leads a small number of visitors to Cacela Velha a perfectly enchanting little whitewashed village overlooking the sea It has an thcentury church a telephone booth a cemetery an old well and a handful of welltended blueandwhite houses festooned with flowers East of here lie the highrise canyons of Monte Gordo The raison dtre of all the development is a long but not especially attractive sandy beach which stretches undisturbed for some  km  miles The Guadiana River which runs into the Atlantic  km  miles east of Monte Gordo served as a natural frontier for some  years forming the boundary between the Roman provinces of Lusitania Portugal and Baetica southern Spain This geographical context explains the strategic importance of Castro Marim a fortress town occupied by the Moors for five centuries A little to the south the sleepy but quietly dignified town of Vila Real de Santo Antnio the Royal Town of St Anthony is the last of the Algarves beach towns before Spain The town was built from scratch in just five months in  aping the grid layout of Lisbons Baixa lower city The town square Praa do Marqus do Pombal is the tour de force of Vila Real with blackandwhite pavement radiating from an obelisk in the center of the square like rays from the sun Vila Real de Santo Antnios main appeal is the ferry to Ayamonte across the water in Spain The trip takes just  minutesless time than it would take to drive to and over the new bridgeand the white town of Ayamonte is a fine sight as you approach it from the river Crossing into Spain you will need to take your passportNorth from Sagres along the west coast is the one part of the Algarve that may well escape intensive development simply because although the beaches are pleasant and the coastline dramatic the water is colder and the wind stronger For those interested in surfing or solitude this coast may be ideal Aljezurs ruined Moorish castle looks over the town which makes a good base for neighboring beaches such as the enormous rocky cove at Arrifana and the wider dune beach of Monte Clerigo both of which also have their own small tourist complexes Further north Odeceixe is a pretty village set in a small river valley which continues down to a wide cliffbacked beach at the estuary
