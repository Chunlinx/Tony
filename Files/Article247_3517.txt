                                 Alan Greenspan Finds Enlightenment                        As has become usual Alan Greenspans speech last Friday at the gathering ofthe worlds central bankers in Jackson Hole Wyo has been ardentlyscrutinized by both the financial press and investors anxious to figure outwhether the Federal Reserve is planning to raise interest rates anytime soonWhats occasioned the most notice fittingly enough was Greenspans argumentthat central bankers needed to pay attention to asset priceslike oh thestock marketin addition to the prices of normal goods and services if thebankers want to have a handle on what may drive inflation in the future            Some commentators have also remarked that Greenspans speech far from beinga stark warning as Reuters termed it was a tempered acknowledgement thateven central bankers have a hard time figuring out when markets are overvaluedThat in turn suggests that Greenspan understands now that his irrationalexuberance speech of three years ago was precisely what it was one personsattempt to outthink a market that it is very difficult to outthink Whatsespecially curious about this is that one would have thought this was aconclusion a supposedly ardent devotee of the free market would have reached along time ago            Greenspan of course has never ascribed to himself at least not inpublicwho knows what he thinks as he sits contentedly in his bathtub thelevel of wisdom and farsightedness that the media have come to grant him Hisremarks are typically shrouded and hedged and though it is of course the jobof the Fed to restrain inflation and promote economic growth which requireshim to make at least educated guesses about the future Greenspan generallydoes seem well aware of the limits of his own knowledge            This is as it should be since a fundamental principle of a freemarketeconomy is that the market knows more than any individual within it ButGreenspans comments on the stock marketincluding but not limited to theirrational exuberance speechhave been oddly dismissive of that principleand oddly certain that something like a bubble was in place In his speech onFriday though Greenspan acknowledged that market prices are determined bymillions of investors many of whom are highly knowledgeable about theprospects for the specific companies that make up the market indices            Even more important perhaps he suggested that the unprecedented rise instock prices over the past five years in particular was due to a substantivechange in the way the market discounted the future Obviously we dont knowexactly what that change is but it does seem as if stockmarket investorstoday think stocks are less risky than they once did believe that inflation isnot a longterm threat and believe that the economic dominance of Americancorporationsand the extraordinary recent growth in corporate profitscan beextended for a long period of time Put those things together and you end upwith a strong case for higher stock prices Any or all of those assumptions maybe wrong of course but in pointing to the discounting process in particularGreenspan did something important which was get away from the simple idea ofirrationality and move toward a more rigorous analysis of whats beenhappening            The other thing Greenspans speech signaled is that the Fed is notgoing to jack up interest rates just to prick a stockmarket bubble imaginedor not In emphasizing that the best and clearest use of monetary policy isto revive an economy in the wake of a deflationary crash by cuttingrates Greenspan seemed to acknowledge that the Fed was illequipped to be inthe business of figuring out what stock prices should be The point of watchingasset prices for the Fed is to understand whether the wealth effect is helpingrev the economy beyond sustainable growth Its not to scold investors We maybe heading for a crash though I dont think so But if we are well getthere all on our own Greenspan wont be giving us a push
