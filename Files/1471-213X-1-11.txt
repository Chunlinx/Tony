                    Background        During last two decades the contribution of specialized        mesenchymal cells ie fibroblastderived vascular        pericytes monocytederived cells MDC and lymphocytes        to the proliferation differentiation and aging of        tissuespecific cells in various epithelial parenchymal        and muscle tissues has gained increasing interest                   Recent developments in the        understanding of the role of mesenchymal cells and their        products in regulation of proliferation and differentiation        of tissue cells were initiated more than seventy years ago        when Alexis Carrel demonstrated that leukocyte extracts        like embryonic tissue extracts stimulate multiplication of        fibroblasts         in vitro and suggested that        leukocytes can bring growth activating substances to        tissuespecific cells   Later in the s and s        lymphocytes were shown to promote tissue growth and        regeneration reviewed in Ref   In spite of these        achievements our understanding of the interactions between        mesenchymal and tissuespecific cells is still in its        beginning While a lot of work has been done on the role of        various growth factors and cytokines produced by        mesenchymal cells on the cell cycle and death         in vitro               little is known about interactions between mesenchymal and        tissuespecific cells         in vivo         The role of mesenchymal cells in homeostasis of normal        tissues and cancer is still poorly understood Our        studies      and those of others               demonstrate that the interaction between mesenchymal        cells and tissuespecific cells is complex The nature of        the interactions may depend on the tissue type eg        liver brain and muscle with very long lived differentiated        cells vs epidermis ectocervix and vagina where cells        growth and die at a relatively rapid rate Alternatively        it may depend on the prevention stop effect or        allowancestimulation of differentiation of cells into the        suicidal state apoptosis by mesenchymal cells in a given        epithelium   The relationship of mesenchymal and        epithelial cells appears to be tissuespecific and        established during the critical period of development        which coincides with the end of the immune adaptation          Specialized mesenchymal cells such as pericytes MDC and T        lymphocytes may significantly influence the        differentiation and aging of epithelial cells The extent        to which epithelial cells are stimulated to differentiate        by mesenchymal cells is dependent on the extent to which        the particular tissue differentiates during the critical        period of development   We have also suggested that        advanced differentiation of epithelial cells may require        certain cytokines released from T cells and DC undergoing        suicide          The terminal stage of cell differentiation is apoptosis        during which cells undergo DNA fragmentation and die        Apoptosis is an active process and it is induced by p        which inhibits cell growth and activates and represses gene        transcription   Proapoptotic function of p appears        to be regulated by         ras protooncogene Cells transformed        with mutated         ras exhibit a defect in the signal        transduction pathway regulating p function and alteration        in the expression of apoptotic bax or antiapoptotic        proteins bcl          In human ectocervix the interactions between cells of        mesenchymal origin and these of epithelial origin change        when examined in a cross section from the basal immature        layer where stem cells reside to the outermost layers        where the epithelial cells are oldest and highest        differentiated Hence the ectocervix represents a suitable        model for the investigation of mesenchymal cell association        with the differentiating and aging epithelial cells         in vivo         The data presented here indicate that phylogenetically        and ontogenetically developed hierarchy of mesenchymal        cells MDC pericytes T cells and immunoglobulins IgM        IgG accompanies differentiation of epithelial cells from        immature into the mature and aged phenotype        Intraepithelial T lymphocytes and mature DC exhibit        suicide and immunoglobulins are associated with aging and        apoptosis of epithelial cells                    Results and discussion                  Mesenchymal cells          The stratified epithelium of uterine ectocervix          consists of four layers of epithelial cells Fig A          The basal layer            b  is formed by a single row of          basal or stem cells Parabasal layer            pb  is formed by several layers of          parabasal young epithelial cells Intermediate layer            im  consists of multiple layers of          mature epithelial cells Superficial layer            s  is formed by several layers of          aged cells These four morphologically distinct layers          are divided by three interfaces  bpb pbim and ims          interface The parabasal and intermediate layers can be          divided into the lower mid and upper layers the          superficial layer into the lower and upper layers          Mesenchymal cells are present in the lamina propria          and some invade among epithelial cells Staining for CD          Fig A shows small primitive MDC in lamina propria but          not within the epithelium Detail Fig B shows          association of CD cells with the basement membrane and          extension among basal epithelial cells Recent study has          shown that CD a lipopolysaccharide receptor is itself          involved in the stimulation of cell proliferation            Similar association of CD primitive MDC with          proliferating Ki epithelial cells was detected in          ovarian cancers unpublished data In ectocervix the          staining for Ki inset Fig A shows that this marker          of proliferation is expressed in the nuclei of parabasal          cells adjacent to the bpb interface This indicates that          in the stratified epithelium of ectocervix the Ki is          still expressed in the postmitotic cells leaving the          basal layer and entering differentiation          Fig Cshows staining for Thy glycoprotein also          called Thy differentiation protein   of          fibroblasts and pericytes associated with          microvasculature arrows adjacent to the basement          membrane Detail of Thy staining Fig D shows that          pericytes secrete intercellular vesicles which migrate          among basal epithelial cells to the bpb interface where          they collapse into empty structures spikes Fig E          and detail F show that major histocompatibility complex          MHC class I molecules are not expressed by basal          epithelial cells but they are strongly expressed          throughout the parabasal layer including lower parabasal          cells Hence targets for Thy vesicles appear to be          parabasal cells adjacent to the bpb interface ie          epithelial cells expressing MHC class I and entering          differentiation          The intercellular Thy vesicles have been shown by          immunoelectron microscopy to exhibit Thy surface          expression and to contain a substance lacking Thy          staining   They may represent a unique paracrine          mechanism so called targeted delivery by which          certain growth factor vesicle content is delivered by          chemotaxis to certain typestage specific target cells          expressing receptor for Thy ligand However the          receptor for Thy has not been yet identified          Targeted delivery of some growth factors by          intercellular Thy vesicles can be enabled by tissue          specificity of Thy glycoprotein carbohydrate moieties            Thy differentiation protein consists of a single          Ig domain and represents one of the most primitive and          ancestral members of immunoglobulin Ig superfamily The          Igrelated molecules have a diversity of functions but          in most cases the common denominator is a recognition at          the cell surface            It has been suggested that the involvement of          Igrelated molecules in tissue interactions is more          primitive than their involvement in the immune system and          the immune functions evolved from the sets of molecules          mediating tissue interactions   Also the only          function of Thy and other Igrelated molecules is to          mediate recognition with the consequences of recognition          being due to the differentiated state of the cells It          requires that the correct ligand and receptor are          expressed on the appropriate cells at the right time                     MHC class I and class II molecules are other members          of Ig superfamily Fig Ashows that large quantities of          HLADR molecules are secreted by precursors of dendritic          cells DC among epithelial cells in the mid parabasal          layer arrows This sitespecific HLADR secretion is          particularly evident when DC precursors are compared with          inactive MDC in lamina propria Ip or mature DC in          intermediate epithelial layers arrowheads          T cells expressing CD which is another member of Ig          superfamily accumulate in lamina propria enter          epithelium and migrate through parabasal epithelial          layers arrow Fig B expressing MHC class I Fig E          toward the pbim interface dashed line T cells          entering lower intermediate layers exhibit fragmentation          arrowheads No T cells were detected in the mid          intermediate layers or at the epithelium surface          CD epitope of MDC mucinlike molecule belonging to          the lysosomalassociated membrane protein family            was expressed by MDC in the lamina propria Fig C          However within epithelium the CD appeared during          transformation of DC precursors into mature DC in the          upper parabasal layers arrow Mature DC black          arrowheads secreted CD among intermediate epithelial          cells and CD mucinlike molecules accompanied aging of          epithelial cells white arrowheads including surface          layers          Staining for CDa an Igrelated molecule          characteristic for Langerhans cells was not detected in          lamina propria Fig D Dendritic cell precursors          arrows and mature DC black arrowheads were stained          Mature DC reaching mid intermediate layers exhibited          fragmentation white arrowheads similar to that of T          cells in lower intermediate layers          Fig Aand A Cand D show that MDC associated with          stratified epithelium of ectocervix exhibit          differentiation associated with morphological changes and          show changes in immunohistochemical features          Interestingly although lamina propria of ectocervix          showed the presence of primitive CD moderately          HLADR and well differentiated MDC CD the          monocytederived cells entering epithelium appear to          initiate a new differentiation associated with CDa          expression and HLADR and CD secretion                          Immunoglobulins          Natural autoantibodies are present in the blood of          normal healthy individuals and they are almost          exclusively IgM antibodies although some IgG and IgA          natural autoantibodies can also be detected that bind to          a variety of selfantigens including self IgG             When compared to IgG the IgM molecules appear earlier in          phylogeny and ontogeny             Staining of ectocervical epithelium for IgM is shown          in Fig E Basal and lower parabasal layers were          unstained but IgM binding increased toward the pbim          interface  Fig E In the intermediate layers          similar increase of IgM binding was detected toward the          ims interface  In the superficial layers most          prominent staining was found at the epithelium surface           Hence there was a high affinity of IgM toward the          upper cells in the parabasal intermediate and surface          layers white arrowheads          The IgG did not bind to the basal parabasal or          intermediate cells but showed binding to the entire          superficial layer arrowhead Fig F These data          indicate that natural autoantibodies exhibit a          stagespecific binding to epithelial cells Similar          stagespecific binding to epidermis was also detected for          natural IgM and IgG autoantibodies in normal human sera                                     Dual color immunohistochemistry experiments          Basal and parabasal layers of normal ectocervical          epithelium show the presence of T cells and MDC A          possibility exists that beside interaction with          epithelial cells these mesenchymal cell types may          interact themselves Hence we employed dual color          immunohistochemistry for HLADR and CD epitopes Fig          Ashows distribution of HLADR MDC dark field visible          light and Fig Balso demonstrates CD T cells dark          field fluorescence It is apparent that MDC interact          with epithelial cells adjacent to the basement membrane          open white arrow and migrate from lamina propria into          the epithelium white arrowhead Migration of T cells          through the basement membrane is also evident yellow          arrowheads          T cells invading epithelium accumulate in the basal          layer and some of them enter parabasal layer with the          assistance of MDC solid white arrows Under the pbim          interface dashed line T cells are associated with the          differentiation of mature DC solid yellow arrow The T          cells passing pbim interface exhibit HLADR expression          open short yellow arrows In the lower intermediate          layers the T cells exhibit diminution in size open long          yellow arrow These data indicate that MDC and T cells          continuously migrate into the epithelium interact among          themselves in the parabasal layer and show dramatic          changes at the pbim interface          Fig shows pbim interface in detail with HLADR MDC          A CD T cells B and both C Under interface the T          cells assist differentiation of DC white arrowheads and          exhibit an unusual elongated shape accompanied by HLADR          expression white arrows Above interface the mature DC          yellow arrowhead accompany fragmentation of T cells          yellow arrows These data indicate that transition of          parabasal into intermediate epithelial cells at the pbim          interface is associated with transformation of DC          precursors into mature DC with the assistance of          activated HLADR T cells The T cells entering          intermediate layers show a loss of HLADR expression and          commit suicide with apoptotic fragmentation under the          assistance of mature DC                          Apoptosisassociated proteins in ectocervical          epithelium          In addition to CD we also studied changes of CD T          cell marker Fig A and detail in B show          fragmentation of T cells arrowheads among lower          intermediate layers Fig Cdemonstrates a lack of T          cells at the epithelium surface In contrast to T cells          fragmentation of mature DC occurred more distantly from          the pbim interface among mid intermediate layers Fig          Dand E No dendritic cells were detected at the          epithelium surface Fig F          Apoptotic cell death is accompanied by expression of          p and ras proteins    Arrowheads in Fig          Gindicate p staining of cell fragments at the pbim          interface and dashed box and Fig Hcell fragments among          mid layers of intermediate epithelial cells p          expression was also detected in epithelial cells          undergoing apoptosis at the surface Fig I Staining          for ras Fig JKL showed similar features          Altogether these observations indicate that          intraepithelial T cells and mature DC underwent apoptotic          fragmentation among differentiating epithelial cells          Except epithelium surface no p and ras expression was          detected in differentiating epithelial cells                          Complete and restricted mesenchymalepithelial          network          It is here shown that mesenchymalepithelial          interactions in stratified epithelium of ectocervix          exhibit stagespecific interactions between mesenchymal          and epithelial cells They also include interactions of          mesenchymal cells themselves either in lamina propria in          association with microvasculature adjacent to the          basement membrane or in epithelium in association with          particular stage of differentiation of epithelial          cells          The stratified epithelium of ectocervix exhibits          morphologically distinct stages of differentiation with          well defined interfaces and parabasal intermediate and          superficial layers can be subdivided further lower mid          and upper layers of parabasal and intermediate cells and          lower and upper layers of surface cells Hence the          mesenchymalepithelial interactions should involve          epithelialepithelial interactions between and within          epithelial layers Some of these interactions like          diminution of contact inhibition can be considered as          downstream initiators of tissue regeneration          We speculate that activation of basal stem cells          toward proliferation is not a spontaneous process          resulting from diminution of contact inhibition but          requires an involvement of so called basic Tissue          Control Unit           TCU of the Tissue Control System            The TCU is associated with microvasculature and          consists of three elements perivascular MDC pericytes          and autonomic innervation Extensions of MDC among basal          epithelial cells see Fig B indicate that they may be          involved in the recognition of demands of epithelium for          regeneration Perivascular MDC interact with pericytes            which are accompanied by autonomic innervation            The innervation is involved in the regulation of          tissue quantity possibly through the regulation of          activity of pericytes   From this point of view one          should consider an involvement of epithelialmesenchymal          and mesenchymalneural interactions as components of          mesenchymalepithelial network          In the ectocervix epithelial cells differentiate from          immature toward aged cells which undergo apoptosis with          p and ras expression Fig Iand L This is          accompanied by mesenchymal cells which interact          themselves and undergo differentiation and apoptotic          fragmentation within epithelium and by binding of IgM          and IgG Such situation can be viewed as a complete          mesenchymalepithelial network Fig           On the other hand epithelial parenchymal and muscle          cells in many other tissues are somehow prevented from          apoptosis yet most of them do not exhibit infiltration          by T cells and apoptosis of mesenchymal cells under          physiological conditions They do however contain basic          TCUs associated with microvasculature In addition to          tissue regeneration the TCU is supposed to regulate          differentiation of endothelial cells involved in homing          of tissue committed T cells and MDC Fig  The latter          have been proposed to carry epigenetically encoded stop          effect which stimulates differentiation of adult tissues          to certain stage but prevents advanced differentiation          and aging see Ref    Such restricted          mesenchymalepithelial network still allows          regeneration but ensures preservation of tissue cells in          the optimal stage of differentiation          Epigenetic programing of the stop effect appears to          depend on the extent of differentiation of tissue cells          during critical period of development such as          termination of the immune adaptation In simple terms if          the differentiation of tissue cells is suppressed          immature cells will persist during adulthood muscular          dystrophy and if it is accelerated premature aging          will occur degenerative diseases                              Conclusions        Our observations indicate that the phylogenetically and        ontogenetically developed hierarchy of mesenchymal cells        MDC pericytes T cells and immunoglobulins IgM IgG        accompanies differentiation of epithelial cells from        immature into the mature and aged phenotype In agreement        with views of others   we propose that the complex of        interactions involved Fig  is not uniquely concerned        with immunity but it includes basic interactions which        stimulate differentiation of mesenchymal and epithelial        cells Involvement of immune systemrelated elements MDC        T cells and B cells in regulation of epithelium        differentiation represents a basic mechanism of immune        physiology toward self from which the immune surveillance        toward nonself has evolved Accordingly when required the        intraepithelial mesenchymal cells regulating tissue        differentiation may be converted into effectors of immunity        against infected epithelial cells Further studies of the        mesenchymalepithelial network may bring novel approaches        to the prevention and therapy of tissue dysfunctions        characterized by permanent tissue immaturity muscular        dystrophy or accelerated aging degenerative        diseases                    Materials and methods                  Tissues          Fresh samples from uterine ectocervix were obtained          from women

experiments were          performed by using two unlabeled primary antibodies and          the combined peroxidasefluorescein isothiocyanate FITC          technique This was done by visualization of the first          unlabeled antibody HLADR by the peroxidaseconjugated          antibody as above   without hematoxylin          counterstain The slides were then incubated with the          second unlabeled antibody washed incubated with          FITCconjugated second antibody washed again and mounted          in aqueous medium   The antibody reagents in the          second labeling sequence do not react with those in the          first sequence because the latter are altered by the          reaction product of diaminobenzidine            PeroxidaseFITC technique allows separate visualization          of peroxidase in visible light either transmitted or          darkfield illumination visualization of FITC alone in          incident fluorescence and combined visualization of          peroxidaseFITC in darkfield transmitted fluorescence          Microphotography was performed using color negative          films and negatives scanned to obtain positive images          ported
