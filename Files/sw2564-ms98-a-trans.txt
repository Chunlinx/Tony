        okay Jay i was thinking about um this topic and i was remembering that guy that does an advertisement on the radio about drug testing and marijuana whether or not marijuana causes any trouble or not and he was saying how the train had wrecked   right   because the guy had been under the influence and he said whether you think you know you might think that it doesnt effect anybody but it does   right exactly   so i think its a good idea is what im trying to say   well i i do too and uh uh i work for Texas Instruments and and they have a mandatory drug testing before you hire in and uh i enjoy that environment i i want to be in in a you know drug free environment and i think thats a great way of uh of promoting it   yeah   is to have the drug testing   no   i can see now when youve been there a while though they were talking about random testing it seems like if theres no reason to suspect you   right   that i might be offended if they asked me to come in and be tested you know what i mean   would you see TI just started that policy uh they they have a random uh drug testing policy and uh uh its random in the fact that you dont know when youre going to be called but everybody will be called   and how often are they doing it   and uh you mean like uh how how often would you be called up   uhhuh   uh you may be called up twenty times and one person will only be called up once but uh   you mean in a years time or what     uh over the whole process i thisll be an ongoing uh process uh from now on but in uh a years time you might be called up i dont know twice or three times and nobody called up any uh but uh the way they have it set up or the way i understand is that they want everyone theyve got it set up where all current employees uh will be called on a random basis but uh you know its very likely that some may be called more uh more than others   uhhuh because theyd be suspect or what   no just because of the random process of it and uh i dont know they did talked about the the statistics of it and how theyve tried to figure out uh you know to eliminate those problems but anytime its uh its a purely random sample uh you will have people called more more than others   uhhuh well how do you feel about that   but im im all for it because uh you know uh i want a a drug free environment i dont want a uh even though i do work in the the office im uh a financial analyst im probably in no danger as far as any chemicals or anything uh or machinery but i still want people in the in the office uh to have a professional demeanor about them and uh and not be under the influence influence when they come in to work and you know i guess if they have the urge and and have that habit they can do that on their own time but uh i feel like when when were at work uh you know its a team atmosphere and i i think that would distract from the team   what if they did it though on their own time and its still  it stays in your body for such a long time   well thats thats true and and to me theyre still under under the influence if its in their body and uh i dont know i thats i have a strong feeling that im against drugs and so if uh anyone is using drugs uh uh and its in their system when theyre tested then uh you know and TI has uh a pretty uh liberal they if youre tested positive then they automatically uh test you again and uh if that one comes back positive then they send you to a uh a drug rehab which TI pays for and uh   oh thats real good thats real good   uh huh whats that   drug rehab and theyll send you to it so if they did have a problem they can get over it i agree with that   right and uh uh so they send you to that and then they monitor you i i believe on a weekly basis you have to go in and take a test for and this goes on for several months   uhhuh   and uh if they if you can prove to them that youve i dont know cleaned your act up or whatever then then uh they wont terminate you but any any time during that time if they do uh if you do test positive then uh its automatic termination   hm   so uh   did you see that special about uh all these people that work on the road crews theyre putting these bridges up and so many of them had tested positive for drugs and they they havent been putting these bridges together correctly and like yeah and then uh on the lines for putting your automobiles together same thing theyre under the influence and theyre not doing the job right   are you serious right   now thats scary isnt it   oh man thats right well and you know the same could be true at TI if somebodys putting a missile together and they uh you know mess it up and then that puts       maybe a pilot or somebody at jeopardy and uh i dont know i   uhhuh   i think any more that uh drugs are so prevalent you know in our society that that uh it may be up to the the work place to help try to control it because it doesnt seem like any where else uh you know were getting that assistance because in schools you know i i would hate to have a child young child right now because i think this is going to be a tough tough period for young kids with uh you know the drugs as rampant as they are   uhhuh well ive got an eleven year old son and an eight year old daughter and my son says i dont understand this drug stuff why dont people understand all you have to do is say no   i see   you know and he doesnt realize the pressure that hes going to be under later when his friends start doing this   right exactly or uh uh an older peer will come up to him and and uh try to try to get him hooked on it so that hell start selling it or something you know and uh i know uh you know just growing up   uhhuh   i really looked up to the older guys you know especially if they played football or basketball or whatever and and uh i know that uh you know itd be real easy to be influenced by by someone like that   well i teach and last year a student that id had the year before so he would have been in third grade came to school with ice   right golly now is this uh cocaine type   and i mean it i dont i dont know what it is its supposed to be uh real inexpensive i know that     oh it is huh   and anyway hes hes like a special ed child   right   you know and i could see he was probably selling it for these other people and we were doing these posters uh for drug antidrug campaign and all these little first graders were always drawing these pictures of ice cream trucks   right   and the teacher started talking to them and they said that they were selling drugs out of ice cream trucks now   golly that is terrible but i mean that makes sense because uh thats where all the uh the kids are you know you have the easy access to them and uh you know uh thatd make you know that would be a logical   uhhuh   i tell you what these drug dealers are about the best business people there are because uh they know who the market is and they know exactly how to get to the market if uh if other businesses could do half as good as they do then uh thered be some very profitable businesses but unfortunately they prey on prey on the young kids   uhhuh   but i dont know   so you think we should do this in every profession   uh the drug testing   uhhuh   i do uh i know where my father works he he works for a government contractor also and uh uh i believe any time you have a D O uh Department of Defense contract you have to have the drug testing and uh you know like uh uh athletes are starting to uh to test them for drugs so i i beli eve that it should be you know uh widespread and uh   uhhuh   that everyone should be tested what do you think   i dont know some jobs it seems like it would just maybe be a waste of money because who cares you know i mean like i dont know   right   what one would be an example like should i say postal service or not i mean are they going to screw up on mail   like what about your right right well what about uh teaching uh your profession   do i think they should   do you think they should in in that profession   well see i dont really see the need of it you know how many elementary school teachers do you think are going to be on drugs   right uh i guess the only the only concern id have   you might feel like you need it by the end of the day but i dont know it would cost so much money and i think maybe we could use that money in the schools you know to buy paper or something   right exactly i guess so somewhere else right   especially since were going to cut   you know i guess the only fear i would have would be that uh you know if i had a child uh that one in a million first grade teachers that would be on drugs my child would be in their class you know and and   well you know thats true and in teaching you dont get rid of a teacher very easy you know  theyd be there   thats right and and and teachers are very influential too
