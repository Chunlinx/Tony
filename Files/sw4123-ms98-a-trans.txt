        any       so how do you get most of your news   well  i kind of uh i watch the um national news everyday for one i also read one or two papers a day and im a im pretty much a news junkie and i tune in to CNN a lot   oh wow so  when you say the morning news or evening news or  national news is when   uh every evening at six thirty i believe i watch the national news   oh okay well i would probably be a junkie or something watch CNN a lot but i dont uh i dont uh subscribe to cable because because of the poor service and also uh   uhhuh   because well i uh i give to the United Way and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that   uhhuh as opposed to paying for cable   yeah i take away a uh a addiction  or something     yeah   well i   uh overall i i the quality of the news you get off off of most uh sources i would say is pretty low its usually you get pretty incomplete coverage and thats one of the reasons where i why i try and get as many sources as possible because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on you would hope its still you know hard to say that what youve heard is what really is   oh what what uh newspapers do you read   well i read uh the local newspaper and i also try and read one of the uh major dailies like the Chicago Tribune or the New York Times or something like that   uh for a while there i i i uh subscribed to New York Times actually actually a couple of newspapers because uh you know my fiance well she was unemployed for a while so she you know really needed to look at the the want help wanted ads and so often they they try the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspaper of news   uhhuh right   and i dont know New York Times is okay but um i dont know when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing is definitely gone down in the last ten years or so but   uhhuh   uh i mean they they say its like the sixth grade reading level but i swear its at least second or third grade sometimes   right pretty low   but i dont know um i think if if you listen to like NPR or something like   right i i really like NPR a lot   thats pretty good um and i like listening to that on on uh when i get a chance when im in the car a long enough time to to listen to it because i   right yeah i miss NPR a lot also i really like them because they give uh instead of being as your newspaper or your TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which i think is good and they also   uh   their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing   well McNeil Lehrer McNeil and Lehrer i guess hes leaving one of them is leaving   uhhuh   uh theyre theyre pretty good too um i guess a year ago youre probably watching CNN a lot right had that invasion or whatever it is   right yeah sure was   uh but i i dont know i guess a lot of its still a lot of hype look at the the Smith trial i mean that was a joke uh   uhhuh yeah that was but then you also have things where you uh where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which i thought was really really good   oh yeah the NPR doing that yeah i know the i had uh some visitor and he was just in just i dont know fixated on that you know just listened to it constantly   uhhuh   um and i guess thats good when its live if you if youll really want that but thats not really providing you news its its more like a media event rather than reporting   right well but the but the news news news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something thats good also about CSPAN which i i tune into every once in a while   oh really thats kind of boring to me i think   yeah it it is really kind of boring but you know thats if if you dont watch it there then youre going to hear somebody elses canned uh report somebody elses view about it and thats what youre supposed youre supposed to if you watch the news youre going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion opinion which i havent would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone elses   yeah yeah i guess thats true but uh one of the ways that i get information is uh everyday when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this this thing its free inside the company and its called Intellect and and they basically uh type out abstracts which are really really literally ive ive actually read the actual articles theyre pretty good
