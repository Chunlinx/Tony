        okay   we just bought our first home after being in school and so were just first time homeowners whove only been living here about six months   oh okay um well ive lived in the in the Dallas and Richardson area for about uh twenty five and a half years twenty six years   oh boy   and were in our second home now weve been in it for uh about thirteen fourteen years i think now in Richardson   uhhuh oh so youre youre an old pro then     weve lived in the Richardson area for that you know for the full time uh   umhum well what do you find having to be like out there ive always heard that it was expensive     well its its not really all that bad uh i think you live in Plano so uh the the Plano area and the Richardson area probably are are about the same pricewise i would think   umhum oh really hm   yeah so   well we uh when we graduated from school in Houston uh my husband went went to school at Rice and got his PhD so that thats what brought us here and um we had um heard a lot about Richardson being a good area and the homes there being really nice and but we kind of just got the impression it was out of our price range   yeah yeah well um i know i i think that theres some areas in you know in uh Richardson that may be a little bit higher priced but uh of course it like i said ive its been thirteen years since weve really priced a house so   umhum     so im not sure what the prices are like now uh i know that our price that the the value of our house went up you know considerably over over a you know uh oh an eight or ten year period   yes umhum   but then for the last several years its pretty well stabilized uh and perhaps even dropped back some from what it was so   really hm   but uh weve done uh you know in order to maintain ours weve done some remodeling and stuff you know just to to kind of change do some some little changes occasionally so   yes   uh but uh i guess im im a little encouraged with home prices i im a CPA and i was just talking to one of my clients uh yesterday uh or you know over the last couple of days   well that makes sense   and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know that was was more reasonably priced its uh in Dallas but its in the Richardson School District   umhum hm   and the the lady is very pleased you know she says its got everything she wants you know thinks shell ever want in a house and it was several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so   oh thats good   so i I suppose that the housing market is uh you know it is on the on the down side right now     well do you have a lot of homes out there that have um foundation problems that seems to be the pretty much the rule out here   well im not really aware of those i do know that that our house uh weve had to have the shower pan in the master bedroom replaced twice   hm   because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that   uhhuh   because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that but that was a design problem because we put uh and we designed the house so its our fault but we had them put the shower on a corner uh like our house is built in a U shape       and in inside that U but on one of the corners uh is where that shower is   umhum   and so any shifting in the foundation of course or or you know i guess i feel that way anyway that that that shifting would cause some problems in that in that area of the house   yes   and of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of uh of metal or plastic whichever it is anyway so   so  did it look cracked to you i mean thats how you knew it was broken or   no it uh it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and out onto the floor and its soaking up in the Sheetrock or in things right   oh oh so thats thats how you knew well since like i say were first time homeowners im still scared about everything like that  going wrong and how do you know its going to happen and all   yeah uh but uh yeah but i think uh you know i think so far as uh as the location Richardson Plano are probably comparable the the school districts are you know are about the same uh you know quality wise   umhum we really like our school out here   yeah so   but we um we were scared to buy a an house in our neighborhood because all of the homes did have these foundation problems and we didnt know um you know if we were afraid wed be living there and all of a sudden the house would crack in half and split open or something   umhum   yeah but uh well our house and im not sure how all of the builders you know how most of the builders do but ours is what they call uh post tensioned which means that there are iron bars you know that run through the foundation   umhum hm   and once they get the foundation poured then they they apply tension to that iron bar which compresses the concrete and makes it more uh stable more stable and and puts more strength into it   umhum   so uh you know it it   uh potentially thats supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the you know when the the earth itself shifts around so   well thats good well thats really good well our house is older its like a nineteen sixty three   yeah so     house that we bought so im not doesnt seem like it um i mean i know so much has changed in their technology in the last few years   umhum yeah right uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam   its slab     yeah so thats and thats what ours is our house the house we had before was over we live on the east side of Richardson now and the other one was over on the west side and it was uh a pier and beam house   umhum umhum   and uh i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago so   well thats good   yeah so you know i think houses uh i think they hold up pretty well if youve got a if you have a good builder   yes my grandfather was a builder and so my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew they were getting a good deal so     yeah   well i uh appreciate that information about Richardson i know it was um its got a really good reputation and   okay   yeah so well it uh you know i think its a a good place to live uh or course if i didnt think that well we wouldnt still be living here so     fourteen years thats pretty good well thank you and well um you good good luck with this program then byebye   right yeah that would okay thank you uh okay thank you you too umhum
