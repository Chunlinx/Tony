                                 Privatize Marriage            In the debate over whetherto legalize gay marriage both sides are missing the point Why should thegovernment be in the business of decreeing who can and cannot be marriedProponents of gay marriage see it as a civilrights issue Opponents see it asanother example of minority rights being imposed on the majority culture Butwhy should anyone haveor need to havestate sanction for a privaterelationship As governments around the world contemplate the privatization ofeverything from electricity to Social Security why not privatize that mostpersonal and intimate of institutions marriage            Privatizing marriage can mean two slightly different things One is to takethe state completely out of it If couples want to cement their relationshipwith a ceremony or ritual they are free to do so Religious institutions arefree to sanction such relationships under any rules they choose A secondmeaning of privatizing marriage is to treat it like any other contract Thestate may be called upon to enforce it but the parties define the terms Whenchildren or large sums of money are involved an enforceable contract spellingout the parties respective rights and obligations is probably advisable Butthe existence and details of such an agreement should be up to the parties            And privatizing marriage would incidentally solve thegaymarriage problem It would put gay relationships on the same footing asstraight ones without implying official government sanction No ones privatelife would have official government sanctionwhich is how it should be            AndrewSullivan one of the leading advocates of gay marriage writes Marriage is aformal public institution that only the government can grant But the historyof marriage and the state is more complicated than modern debaters imagine asone of its scholars Lawrence Stone writes In the early Middle Ages all thatmarriage implied in the eyes of the laity seems to have been a private contractbetween two families  For those without property it was a private contractbetween two individuals enforced by the community sense of what was right Bythe  th century the formally witnessed contract called thespousals was usually followed by the proclamation of the banns three timesin church but the spousals itself was a legally binding contract            Only with the Earl of Hardwickes Marriage Actof  did marriage in England come to be regulated by law In the New Englandcolonies marriages were performed by justices of the peace or othermagistrates from the beginning But even then commonlaw unions were valid            In the th century however government has intruded upon the marriagecontract among many others Each state has tended to promulgate a standardonesizefitsall formula Then in the past generation legislatures andcourts have started unilaterally changing the terms of the marriage contractBetween  and  all the states provided for nofault divorce The newarrangements applied not just to couples embarking on matrimony but also tocouples who had married under an earlier set of rules Many people felt a senseof liberation the changes allowed them to get out of unpleasant marriageswithout the often contrived allegations of fault previously required fordivorce But some people were hurt by the new rules especially women who hadunderstood marriage as a partnership in which one partner would earn money andthe other would forsake a career in order to specialize in homemaking            Privatization of religionbetter known as the separationof church and statewas our founders prescription for avoiding Europesreligious wars Americans may think each other headed for hell but we keep ourreligious views at the level of private proselytizing and dont fight to imposeone religion by force of law Other social conflicts can likewise bedepoliticized and somewhat defused if we keep them out of the realm ofgovernment If all arts funding were private as  percent of it already isfor instance we wouldnt have members of Congress debating RobertMapplethorpes photographs or the film The Watermelon Woman             So why notprivatize marriage Make it a private contract between two individuals If theywanted to contract for a traditional breadwinnerhomemaker setup withspecified rules for property and alimony in the event of divorce they could doso Less traditional couples could keep their assets separate and agree toshare specified expenses Those with assets to protect could sign prenuptialagreements that courts would respect Marriage contracts could be asindividually tailored as other contracts are in our diverse capitalist worldFor those who wanted a standard onesizefitsall contract that would still beeasy to obtain WalMart could sell books of marriage forms next to thestandard rental forms Couples would then be spared the surprise discovery thatoutsiders had changed their contract without warning Individual churchessynagogues and temples could make their own rules about which marriages theywould bless            And what of gay marriage Privatization of theinstitution would allow gay people to marry the way other people doindividually privately contractually with whatever ceremony they mightchoose in the presence of family friends or God Gay people are alreadyholding such ceremonies of course but their contracts are not alwaysrecognized by the courts and do not qualify them for the  federal laws thatthe General Accounting Office says recognize marital status Under a privatizedsystem of marriage courts and government agencies would recognize any couplescontractor better yet eliminate whatever governmentcreated distinctionturned on whether a person was married or not            Marriage is an importantinstitution The modern mistake is to think that important things must beplanned sponsored reviewed or licensed by the government The two sides inthe debate over gay marriage share an assumption that is essentiallycollectivist Instead of accepting either view lets get the government out ofmarriage and allow individuals to make their own marriage contracts as befitsa secular individualist republic at the dawn of the information age
