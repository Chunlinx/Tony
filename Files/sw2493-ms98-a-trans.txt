              okay what kind of TV shows do you like   well uh i dont have a lot of time to watch TV unfortunately this is not a good subject um i   uhhuh   when the little bit of time i do  get to spend because im in school in the evenings um uh i like to watch movies and comedies and uh i watch the news   i see uhhuh the news   and the only  game type shows that i ever watch are Wheel Of Fortune   okay   how about you   um i dont i dont care for Wheel Of Fortune very much       i dont care for game shows in general i guess uh theyre not usually theres usually not that many on in the evening anyway so about the Wheel Of Fortune is about the only one thats on in the evening times   well yeah i know oh i havent watched it in ages but uh you know   yeah yeah um i do like uh uh well they had a good TV movie on last night called Separate But Equal   oh yes i didnt get a chance to see that   its a General Motors hall of fame type presentation uh its a twoparter the other parts on tonight but it was about the uh the uh the well its supposed to be a true story you know a dramatization the true story of the legal struggle that uh   uhhuh   ended up in the Supreme Court decision Brown versus the Board of Education which ended up um oh saying that separate and equal is not constitutional as far as you know schools it was talking about and it was interesting it was a   uhhuh   its its its really a high one of these high drama type you know uh shows thats also true any of those things i like Hall Mark Hall Of Fame and those kind of shows are always so good i like i like to watch those   oh yes yes they are they i love those but they unfortunately they dont have nearly enough of those those and the National Geographic ones specials those those are great too   right right oh yeah i can watch those National Geographic ones over and over again   yeah i know what you mean   and theyre theyre good theyre theyre i like news shows too like uh Sixty Minutes or Twenty Twenty   uhhuh   uh when i have a chance i watch those on uh i guess Sixty Minutes is usually on Sundays and uh i just like to see you know who they are raking over the coals   yes well you know it interesting they have a new one out have you ever watched Expose Expose   i havent caught that one yet   uh thats kind of one along the line of Sixty Sixty i mean that excuse me Twenty Twenty and uh yeah Sixty Minutes but uh   Twenty Twenty   uh ive only watched it once uh like i said ive been in class and uh so during the week uh i dont have much time and i spend a lot of time with uh my daughter on the weekend and she lives   uhhuh   a way away so uh im you were not usually watching TV  but uh but it is interesting uh they this time of year unfortunately it gets   right right right   kind of most of them are reruns and you know stuff like that thats why i kind of stick to the movies if theyre good uh that one sounds good though that was on last night i didnt get a chance to i didnt get home till ten so  yeah   right uhhuh yeah yeah its like right well that makes it hard yeah that was a good show um what else do i enjoy oh my wife and i have been into this uh uh LA Law have you ever heard of that show yeah   uhhuh ive heard of it i havent watched it uh uhhuh   its getting pretty you know its kind of like a Dallas type thing you know but its more of it it takes place in LA and its this law office and all the cases they take and the and the uh interoffice uh       uh politics and so forth people trying to maneuver and get power and back stabbing and also helping each other and you know if you know all the love interoffice love affairs and uh all that all that kind of stuff and you know power struggles to see whos going to be the next uh uh oh   uhhuh   president of the law firm or whatever and that kind of thing and uh and then of course they always have a lot of court cases and they show where they actually have courtroom drama   yeah uhhuh   type thing where theyre trying to you know youre always sitting there trying to guess at the end of the show you know and they always have the verdicts you know and youre always trying to out guess is he going to be guilty or innocent or whatever and they always put you know twists and turns twists   i was just going to say yeah usually  twist it you know its hard oh   yeah they throw a lot of twists and turns in like like one of the recent shows there was this really uh a young woman who uh was accused of killing her millionaire husband who was you know much older than she was like you know in her early twenties and he was in his sixties and he was she was accused of killing him for his money and she said no she wasnt and the and this law firm took on the case and got her off   uhhuh   um and uh and you know you think shes innocent all along you know and just you know because because of her circumstances that you know thats why people thought she had done it you know because it just looked so obvious that she had done it and thats why everybody assumed she had   right   and so they get her off and at the very end of the case after its over hes talking with her and he figures out that she really did do it after all a uh after after he got after he got her off   oh my gracious so what did he do then ooh yeah well then they couldnt retry her oh   well thats how the show thats how the show ended it just left you hanging there like you know like you set me up you fed me all this information information you know that made it look like this other person was guilty you know and   oh uhhuh   and thats how he basically got her off by by casting a shadow of doubt saying well this other his daughter did it you know and because this other will was had her name on it you know and all this kind of stuff but actually she had done it after all and he figured it out after he made her innocent and then that was right before he was going out to the big news conference you know to   oh my good   to talk to the reporters and stuff you know and how does it feel be you know to get her off the hook and this and that and they he went out there knowing that she was really guilty  so that kind of thing so its a fun show then i like comedies also like uh   yeah oh     theres a show call i watch Roseanne once in a while uh you youve heard of her probably yeah yeah   oh yes i dont watch her anymore not after that Star Spangled Banned thing   yeah yeah i dont watch her that often i watch sometimes i watch The Simpsons thats that cartoon show   uhhuh ive never watched that either   Bart Simpsons or a Coach is another one its a sports comedy where the guy is a coach of a a football team a team Minnesota State where theyre never have a good team you know but hes always trying to   i have watched that yeah thats good   always try ing to pull it off and he has his a girlfriend a a broadcasts anchor at the local news station and shes always trying to get him out of jams and she       so you know whatever whenever i have time i just turn it on basically and see whats on   yeah its a nice way to relax i mean in a way i mean i find it anyway although sometimes watching the news isnt very relaxing  i get home from from   it is no no   class and everything and turn on the TV and watch the news early news and its like uh i i didnt really need to watch that before i go to bed you know   right yeah so but i enjoy taking in a movie when i can im going to try to watch the second half of this one tonight   yeah well see that was thats another if i would have been home probably wouldnt have watched it because i have class tonight and i would have missed the second half and thats the most frustrating because thats you know you can if you missed the first half   yeah yeah yeah yeah   you can kind of catch up they catch you up you know with the second one but if you miss the second half youve missed the whole you know outcome and oh its frustrating   they catch you up and the right do you have like a a VCR where you could tape it or something on the record mode or on the time yeah   no i dont unfortunately we have cable but thats one thing i need to we had one but it broke down so uh i havent gotten another one because i havent you know i havent even   hm it broke down yeah yeah right   rented movies to watch because yeah yeah but uh but perhaps perhaps when its over i will you you know i of course   so little so little time to do that yeah have a chance more chance to relax   right well thats it i but i have gotten we have cable and so um thats   right theres always a movie on   yeah sometimes i spend a lot of time on that some movies that i would never have gone and seen uh you know have turned out to be really good movies uh you know you hate to spend the money on them especially as expensive as movie theaters are today   you right right how much are they out there   uh movies oh uh it costs you six fifty to go to a movie each a piece to go to uh a movie unless you catch a good matinee   yeah six fifty yeah hm out here i its i think out here they are still about five fifty about a dollar less   uhhuh well uh everythings high priced out here  but uh uh   things are going up all over too yeah yeah   yeah uh but id rather you know watch it on of course the only problem with cable though is its its is that they show the same one over about five hundred times before  you know you dont get that many new ones in but uh uh   right   they have a lot of good uh my son likes to watch uh the sports station you know and uh   specials uhhuh yeah the all sports station yeah   right uh you know things like that so uh thats what makes it worth it uh because hes handicapped and hes at home all the time so so uh   uhhuh right i see   uh you know he enjoys that but uh um i  i like i said TV isnt my best subject because but i i do enjoy a good comedy a good movie is a comedy if i can you know sit down and and watch or if they have a good uh     right   you know show on thats a good comedy im not real much for the sitcoms because of their they need to have a new twist or something in some of those you know theyre getting all kind of the same but um uh   uhhuh the same yeah yeah   its just   well i think weve probably talked long enough  about this subject   uh yes uh okay well it was nice talking to you and uh   well it was nice talking to you and you have a nice day   okay you too byebye now   okay bye
