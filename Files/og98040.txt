SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ENTITLEDREGISTRATION FORM USED BY OPENEND MANAGEMENT INVESTMENTCOMPANIES AND NEW DISCLOSURE OPTION FOR OPENEND MANAGEMENTINVESTMENT COMPANIES FINAL RULES RIN AE AHi Costbenefit analysisThe SEC conducted a costbenefit analysis for both final rulesas required by section c of the Investment Company Act The actrequires the SEC to consider whether its rulemaking will promoteefficiency competition and capital formationThe analysis for the Registration Form rule notes that while itis difficult to quantify costs and benefits the total annual costof  million for preparing filing and updating the currentForm NA is not expected to rise significantly because newinformation is not required The benefits of the new rule includemore wellinformed investors who may invest more of their resourcesand allocate their investments carefully which in turn would tendto promote competition among the fundsThe analysis for the New Disclosure Option rule also notes thedifficulty of quantifying the costs and benefits of the rule TheSEC has estimated that the annual cost to the industry of preparingand filing updated profiles would be approximately  millionwhich may be offset by restructured advertising expenditures andlower printing and distribution costs One benefit is bettermeeting the diverse information needs of investors in evaluatingfunds which has become more difficult as the number of funds hasgrownii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and a FinalRegulatory Flexibility Analysis were prepared for both rules andwere summarized in the preambles to the proposed and final rulesrespectively The complete analyses were furnished to our OfficeThe analyses contain the information required by the RegulatoryFlexibility ActThe Final Analysis for the Registration Form rule notes that ofthe approximately  registered openend management investmentcompanies approximately  orGAOOGC percent are funds which meet the definition of small entitieswith net assets of  million or less at the end of the mostrecent fiscal year The analysis concludes that the final rule willnot impose any additional burdens on small entities because most ofthe changes in the rule do not require the development of newinformation The rule will primarily require a reformatting of thecurrent information which may take longer the initial time it isperformed but will possibly result in less time in the future forpreparing the new format While it considered several alternativesto reduce to the burden on small entities the SEC found thatseparate treatment for small entities would not be consistent withthe protection of investorsConcerning the New Disclosure Option rule the Final Analysisnotes that approximately onethird of the  small entities couldchoose to use the new profile or  funds The analysis finds thatthe new rule would not be significantly burdensome for smallentities because use of the profile is optional and that theinformation contained in the profile is now typically contained afunds prospectus As above while several alternatives wereconsidered the SEC found that it was unnecessary or inappropriateto adopt any of them because of the need for investorprotectioniii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of
