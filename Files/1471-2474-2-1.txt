                    Background        Patients following total hip and knee arthroplasty are        at a significant risk for thromboembolic complications        Despite modern prophylaxis against thromboembolism studies        still report a  to  frequency of deep venous        thrombosis and a significant rate of pulmonary embolism        following total hip or knee arthroplasty        The        high incidence of thrombotic disease despite prophylaxis        makes early detection imperative as treatment with        anticoagulation is highly effective           Both DVT and PE manifest few specific clinical signs or        symptoms making the clinical diagnosis neither sensitive        nor specific        A high index of suspicion based        on risk stratification is necessary for the detection and        appropriate implementation of diagnostic studies to        identify this complication The ability preoperatively to        identify a subset of patients undergoing adult        reconstructive surgery that are at a higher risk of        developing thromboembolic complications would aid the        clinician in making an accurate diagnosis and make possible        further research to determine optimal regimes of        postoperative detection and prophylaxis        Until recently the only known hypercoagulable states        were several rare genetic disorders of the coagulation        cascade antithrombin III protein C and protein S        deficiency which accounted for only a small percentage of        all patients with venous thrombosis   In         Dahlback et al   described a previously unreported        hypercoagulable state among members of three families that        suffered from recurrent venous thrombosis Further        investigation revealed an autosomaldominant inherited        defect in the anticoagulant function of factor V resulting        in resistance to the anticoagulant action of activated        protein C APC   Formal evidence for this association        came from a large populationbased patientcontrol study        the Leiden Thrombophilia Study which followed         consecutive patients of less than  years of age with a        first episode of objectively confirmed DVT          Twentyeight percent of patients in the study group and         of controls were found to be APCresistant        Furthermore it was estimated that these patients have a        sevenfold greater risk of developing a DVT The abnormal        factor V that causes APC resistance was subsequently termed        factor V Leiden Later studies confirmed a seven        toeightfold increased risk for patients heterozygous for        the factor V mutation and an fold increased risk in        homozygous individuals    Factor V Leiden is        therefore the most common thrombophilic disorder described         times more common than all the other genetic        coagulopathies combined with an estimated prevalence of         in the general population            Polymorphisms of the angiotensin converting enzyme have        also been associated with a hypercoaguable state The        angiotensin converting enzyme ACE digests angiotensin I        to angiotensin II a potent vasoconstrictor and is thus        involved with the regulation of vascular tone The        angiotensin converting enzyme has also been shown to        attenuate fibrinolysis and affect both platelet activation        and aggregation   The ACE gene has been found to have        a polymorphism consisting of an insertion and a deletion of        a  base pair fragment of intron    Patients may        thus be of one of three separate genotypes        insertioninsertion deletiondeletion or        insertiondeletion Patients with the deletiondeletion        genotype have been shown to have mean plasma ACE levels of        approximately twice that of patients with the        insertioninsertion genotype   Thus patients with the        deletiondeletion genotype may be at increased risk for        thromboembolic events        Although the majority of patients undergoing total hip        and knee arthroplasty are subjected to similar        perioperative risk factors that predispose to        thromboembolism only a subset of patients develop this        complication The objective of this study was to determine        whether the FVL mutation or the deletion polymorphism of        the ACE gene is associated with a higher risk of developing        a postoperative thromboembolic complication                    Patients and Methods                  Patients          The presence of the Factor V Leiden mutation and the          deletiondeletion polymorphism of the angiotensin          converting enzyme gene were determined for  patients          who developed symptomatic pulmonary embolism           patients or proximal deep venous thrombosis  patients          following elective total hip or knee arthroplasty at our          institution between February of  and July of           The prevalence of these genetic profiles was compared to          a control cohort of  patients who had undergone          similar procedures between November  and March of           at the same institution and whose postoperative          course was not complicated by symptomatic thromboembolism          using an unmatched casecontrol design A total of           elective total hip and knee arthroplasties were performed          during the time period that samples for the control group          were collected however  patients chose not to          participate in the study and  patients were discharged          to home prior to sample collection An additional           patients who were clinically suspected of deep vein          thrombosis but had a single negative duplex ultrasound of          the lowerextremities were also excluded from the          analysis          Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed on the basis of          clinical

and          oral warfarin and two by placement of an inferior vena          caval filter followed by intravenous heparin and oral          warfarin          Demographic and operative information including          relevant past medical history and the type of          thromboembolic prophylaxis utilized was collected for the          experimental and control groups as summarized in Table

the relationship between        inherited hypercoagulable states and thromboembolism        following total hip and knee arthroplasty with mixed        results Lowe et al   found that the Factor V Leiden        mutation was associated with an increased risk of deep        venous thrombosis as determined by routine bilateral        ascending venography in  European patients who had        undergone total hip arthroplasty however only  of the         patients with deep venous thrombosis had proximal        thrombi Svensson et al   found that among a cohort of         Swedish patients who had undergone hip arthroplasty        female patients who were heterozygous for the factor V        Leiden mutation had a fourfold increased risk of        thrombosis The authors felt however that based on their        data no definite association between the Factor V Leiden        mutation and postoperative thrombosis could be made In        contrast Ryan et al   studied  patients who had        routine bilateral ascending venography following total hip        and knee arthroplasty and found that the prevalence of the        Factor V Leiden mutation was no different between patients        who did and did not have venographic evidence of deep        venous thrombosis Similarly Woolson et al   studied         patients who had a proximal deep venous thrombosis after        total hip arthroplasty detected by routine predischarge        compression duplex ultrasound and found that the        prevalence of the Factor V Leiden was no different in that        population compared to  controls In contrast to the        aforementioned studies the present report studied patients        who had developed symptomatic thromboembolic events the        majority of which were pulmonary embolism and were all        treated with a uniform thromboembolic prophylaxis regime        Our results support the findings of others that in        patients receiving pharmacological prophylaxis against        postoperative thrombosis the Factor V Leiden mutation is        not associated with an increased risk of symptomatic        thromboembolism following total hip or knee        arthroplasty        While Phillip et al   found no association between        the Factor V Leiden mutation and deep venous thrombosis        they did find that the deletiondeletion genotype of the        angiotensin converting enzyme was strongly associated with        postoperative venous thrombosis in  patients who had        undergone total hip arthroplasty  of whom had a        thromboembolic event as detected by routine compression        duplex ultrasound They concluded that patients with the        deletiondeletion genotype were at a fold increased risk        for a thromboembolic event following total hip arthroplasty        as compared to patients with the insertioninsertion        genotype However  of the  experimental subjects had        isolated distal deep venous thrombosis which is of        questionable clinical significance and only  had a        pulmonary embolism While the results of this study had        encouraged us to screen our patient population for these        polymorphisms when utilizing a more relevant clinical        endpoint symptomatic pulmonary embolism or deep venous        thrombosis we were unable to confirm this association        Due to the relative infrequence of symptomatic        thromboembolic events while using pharmacological agents as        prophylaxis an unmatched casecontrol study design was        employed This type of study design has the advantage of        increased statistical power for studying relatively rare        events   However its disadvantages include the        possibility that other variables that were not controlled        for could have affected our results The patients in both        the case and control groups were operated on during        overlapping time periods and were found to be        demographically similar and thus we do not believe that        such confounding variables affected our results Our power        analysis reveals that a relatively strong association        between these genetic profiles and postoperative        thromboembolism  fold increased risk for the factor V        Leiden mutation and a  fold increased risk for the        deletiondeletion polymorphism of the angiotensin        converting enzyme gene would have been required to detect        a significant difference between the prevalence of these        mutations in our case and control groups Likewise a        larger number of patients would have been required to find        a significant difference if a weaker association was        assumed However no trend was detected in our data to        suggest that such an association was present Furthermore        such a weak association would make preoperative screening        and identification of such patients not cost effective        It was noted however that a significantly greater        percentage of patients who suffered a thromboembolic event        had a personal or family history of thromboembolism p          for both The report by Woolson et al          included similar findings Although residual abnormalities        of the deep venous system could account for the higher        prevalence of a personal history of prior deep venous        thrombosis or pulmonary embolism the higher prevalence of        a family history of thromboembolic events suggests that an        as yet undescribed genetically determined hypercoagulable        state or predisposition may be present in these        patients                    Conclusions        The objective of this study was to determine whether a        specific genetic profile is associated with a higher risk        of developing a postoperative thromboembolic complication        Although our results suggest that neither of these        potentially hypercoaguable states are associated with an        increased risk of symptomatic thromboembolic events        following total hip or knee arthroplasty in patients        receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis an as yet        undescribed genetically determined hypercoagulable state or        predisposition may be present in these patients
