                                 Steve Coz            Once upon a timebeforeOJ that issupermarket tabloids were journalisms shame Respectablewriters sneered at the tabs for their millions of lumpen readers theirfabricated or worse purchased stories and their raffish British editors whobehaved more like blackmailers than like scions of the Fourth Estate            But nowthe editor of the National Enquirer  Steve Coz has a Harvard degree cum laude  no less and mainstream cachet In an age whencelebrityworship is religion and populism is the dominant political ideologythe tabs are pariahs no longer Since taking over as Enquirer editor in the yearold Coz has become the tab industrys first star editor aswell as its first respected one In the spring Time named him one ofthe  Most Influential People of  US News profiled himadmiringly soon after And until a couple of weeks ago Coz was considered theleading candidate for the editorship of the New York Daily News  one ofthe most venerated of daily mainstream tabloids            The American cult of celebrity has flourished since WalterWinchell and the tabs have been thriving since the early sbut its onlyin the last few years that other journalists have taken the supermarket ragsseriously Coz deserves as much credit or blame for this as anyone Beforebecoming editor Coz directed the Enquirer s massive OJ coverage Atone point the Simpson case made the cover  weeks out of  TheEnquirer s investigators far outclassed other reporters Thanks to lotsof spadework and liberal payments to sources Cozs team tracked down thefamous pictures of OJ wearing Bruno Magli shoes the harrowing diary ofNicole Brown Simpson and the guy who sold OJ a knife right before themurder The Los Angeles Times ran a word paean to theEnquirer s feminist coverage and even the New York Timescredited Cozs staff with breaking open the story            The paperhas been equally enterprising during Cozs tenure as editor In the midst ofthe  presidential campaign it revealed that Bob Dole had had a mistressAfter the murder of Bill Cosbys son Ennis the Enquirer posted a reward opened a phone tip line and fielded the call that led to asuspects arrest It has covered the JonBenet Ramsey murder doggedly too            The Coz vogue owes as much to his publicposturing as it does to his investigative reporting Coz casts himself as theconscience of tabloid journalism if thats not an oxymoron When theGlobe  the Enquirer s  hired an airline stewardess to seduceFrank Gifford on hidden camera Coz was shocked shocked  He penned anoped for the New York Times condemning the Globe for making newsrather than covering it After Princess Dianas death Coz made the networkTVrounds to denounce the paparazzi stalkarazzi and tout theEnquirer s refusal to buy crashscene photos We call on the rest ofthe press to join our ban on the photos If he gets any more highminded hesgoing to bang his head on the ceiling            Thisrighteousness lies at the heart of Cozs business strategy to make theEnquirer respectable Coz is trying to convince America that theEnquirer is more like People than it is like other tabloids HisEnquirer  he says abjures paparazzi photos inflammatory andmisleading headlines and fabricated stories Coz is more likely to appear on aSunday talkshow round table than on a tabloid TV show He also gets a lot ofmileage out of his Harvard degree and his preppy good looks two commoditiesthat oldschool tabloid editors lacked The Harvard shtick is largely thatCoz has spent his entire working life at the Enquirer             Cozs grandstanding does reek of hypocrisy He denouncedthe stalking of Diana but the Enquirer s own cover story at the time ofher death was Di Goes Sex Mad complete with snapshots of Diana and DodiFayed Coz criticizes the Gifford trap yet defends the similar way theStar  the Enquirer s sister paper treated Dick Morris TheStar paid Sherry Rowlands to lure Morris to a place where a hiddencamera could film them Cozs distinction Morris was carrying on withRowlands before the Star took pictures while Suzen Johnson didntapproach Gifford until after she had a Globe contract            TheEnquirer also pays for stories and sourcesan absolute nono inmainstream journalismand relies on gossip that would never make it past aregular newspaper editor And Cozs Enquirer still depends onsuckerpunch journalism It is far crueler than People ever would beCelebrities scoff at the claim that the Enquirer is kinder and gentlerCozs Enquirer has been sued frequently for defamation and invasion ofprivacy After Dis death George Clooney blamed Coz personally for encouragingcelebritystalking And according to gossip columnist Liz Smith threeHollywood superstars have hired private investigators to gather dirt on Coz andtwo other tabloid editors            The misfortune of Cozs career may be that heis gunning for journalistic respectability at a time when journalisticrespectability doesnt pay Americans are starving for tabloidstyle news andeveryone wants to feed them Tabloid TV shows such as A Current Affairand Hard Copy have stolen tab papers market share So have reputable TVshows and magazines which now cover celebrity news with as much vigor as thetabs The best JonBenet story ran in Vanity Fair  Time Newsweek  and People worship stars fad diets and medicalmiracles almost as avidly as the Enquirer does These mainstream mediaare eating the tabs lunch The Enquirer s weekly circulation has fallenfrom  million copies in the s to  million today            Coz believes hell reversethis decline by taking or at least talking about the high road Dont counton it Consider the Globe  As the respectable media have become sleazythe Globe has become sleazier While Coz preaches decorum theGlobe has added more sensationalism more gore more nasty gossip TheEnquirer s circulation is stagnant The Globe s circulation isrising fast
