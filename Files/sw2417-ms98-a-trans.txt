                 well i dont know but uh im twenty two years old and i think it would be uh its not a good choice to do that i mean you have uh everything here you know like uh the Army and everything else is all all voluntary and thats the way youre going to dedicate yourself   right   to to that you know to your job if its voluntary i mean if you dont like it i mean if youre like in other places where they have a you know mandatory you know uh services yeah   sort of like the draft do you know in the Army youre not going to uh uh be i i understand i understand what youre saying im im twenty four and uh you know i i dont think that i would be willing to to dedicate you know a year or two years of my life   because i mean the thing is is that whenever you i mean you seen like for example you know like the war that just went on you saw you saw that   to a right   some people were not going you know people that that had all the benefits that were sitting around for years you know maybe three four years getting paid uh by the government or you know   right exactly   they just when the when the time came they said no way you know when they when that was their job they joined it because they wanted to or well you know some people didnt   right   didnt have the you know the money they said its a good way of uh in coming in but those are public service i mean you i mean you would be getting paid very little you know or anything at all   right   and uh you would just hate it so much that whatever you had to do would be just you know its like you know   you just do the minimum yeah   yeah i mean you wouldnt you wouldnt do it i mean  the the the thing would be that it would throw you you know totally the wrong way you would be there because you had to be there   right exactly   but yet you would still respond to everything in a very you know negative way you know its like do this why you know   right right right   i i have a i dont i dont have to do anything you know its like what am i going to do if i sit here if i sit here for a whole year theyll let me go and then i can get back to my life     exactly you know and i and im sure there is a problem about uh getting you know the volunteers to do that and maybe they could uh spend a little bit more money on promotion and and uh advertise it a little bit more   yeah   uh so that the public is a little more aware of it but uh i definitely agree with you i would hate to to see that become mandatory   well there i dont think theres any way it can you know like they say this proposal would anywhere would get anywhere because of the i mean first of all ive never heard of it until this this phone call you know   right   and uh if it is actually proposed and taken you know to the government or something   that would be political suicide for anybody to i would think   yeah to to actually support it you know it would be just like saying that you know what are what are you crazy i mean there   right right   i mean you i mean you know we had enough with the abortion issue thats still going around that you guys want to bring you know the next  you know   exactly next big issue up yeah yeah because i think uh  young and old alike uh would would more or less agree on this issue   yeah   uh maybe certain religions uh you know i think its is it the Mormons or somebody i know at Brigham Young University they have to do like a mandatory uh year or two years worth of sort of service but uh whatever that religion is   but see but youre going there and you know what youre getting into   thats right and that is a that is a definite choice uh   yeah   and and i i believe its just that religion thats not a you know a prominent uh predominant religion uh religion so i dont i dont think that that uh issue would hold much water   yeah but its its not like saying like im born and then when i reached a certain age im going to have to do something you know   in a political right   its uh its not by choice its like everything everything else you know its like if i want to do it ill do it but you know its like you know and uh you know i have a background im from Argentina   right   and uh everybody everybody that is unlucky enough has to do the military service   i see   and but you go into this whole big lottery every year and you know each uh your last three digits of your document you know like your social security number youre matched up with other numbers right   oh i see   from uh from uh one to a thousand   right   and so if your number is below four hundred youre not going to have to do it   i see   say its between four hundred and six hundred you might have to do it depending how many people are in your class and you know like you the they right   your age group or whatever yeah   and if its above six hundred youre going to have to do it and i got one thirty one   oh Lord oh okay so you felt pretty good then huh   and so yeah i i didnt have to do it but the thing was that you have you know the whole the whole nations watching you know like if if its your class everybody thats your same age is listening listening to the radio   right   waiting for them to announce the number you know   golly   and its like and then you know you have people you know going you know its like everywhere you know you have some people that are glad some people that are saying shit and the other people that are going oh my God im somewhere in the middle you know its like wow am i going to have to do it   right yeah right there on the borderline huh   yeah and you know but its  my brother goes everybody in my family had to do it and they go you know its just a year and a half of your life thats thats totally wasted you dont do anything else theres no time and you dont do anything   jeez   you know you go there you train you get treated like shit and then you you i mean then you get out   so its its no is it not educational training its strictly its strictly uh military i see   right and so i mean but you know its like the thing is is that you know you just get treated i mean one one of the guys that was doing it was uh like uh a waiter at one of the restaurants that know you know like the military had   right   and that was his job you know he got he got you know like three months of uh you know physical training   God     and then he got to serve all these people       you know but thats what they do i mean thats a year and a half of your life thats that you dont do anything that you have to be there you know maybe five times you know five times a week and that you know that you have a i guess a round robin schedule or something   right jeez and i guess a minimal pay or   and uh no oh there i dont i dont think i dont think there is any pay wait im not sure because what happens is you get to like to ride buses for free   do you they get paid very well oh   well you do i guess you do get paid but the thing is is that you know people are what if they see you in the uniform   oh you get a little benefits oh they know   right like for example you you know like when they go around the train asking for tickets like short distant trains they wont ask you if you if youre wearing your military uniform for a ticket theyll just skip you   right i see i see   and uh you know its like they they consider that but it would be the same way here you know its like if if you had to do it you know you have a big sign im sorry i dont get paid you know   right right   its like please let me ride for free you know its like im im living off dad for these wonderful two years which i have to do you know its like     right   and then the other thing is when i get out of college at twenty eight with my BS you know its like by the time   well yeah yeah youre thirty years old and trying to get your first job yeah   yeah and so that would be that would be see therere too many things that go against it that would be ridiculous   right right   so oh well its been seven minutes   well that sounds good   i dont i dont well i dont i dont think theyll ever pass this i i im just going to laugh if i ever see it in the newspapers i i mean i dont read the newspaper that much but i never heard anything about it so   well im i havent either and so uh yeah i dont i dont think much will come up of it   so and but then you wont have to do it just imagine sometimes your kids youll be saying well its your job go do it you know  but it   thats right   thats right its easier after youre you dont have to worry about it   yeah really then youll have to say see in my age i didnt have to do it  oh really dad yeah  oh well okay   thats right thats right well hey i appreciate the call talk to you later byebye   yeah byebye
