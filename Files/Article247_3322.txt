                                 Congress TaxCutting Folly                        Sometimes you find yourself having to say the obvious So here goes Thereis no good economic or social motive for the two  billion tax cuts justpassed by the Republican Senate and House of Representatives The justificationfor the cuts rests upon a misapprehension of the lessons of the s afoolishly optimistic view of the certainty of economic forecasts a confusionof public and private goods and an almost willful averting of the eyes fromthe realities of the US economy I know the cuts were dead on arrival Butits still amazing that the Republicans passed them            Last things first Tax cuts in good Keynesian fashion stimulate theeconomy But the economy is already running at or near its productive capacityBond yields have soared above  percent on fears of inflation and aninterestrate hike by the Fed at its August meeting now seems a foregoneconclusion In this environment tax cuts serve only to overheat an alreadyracing economy And increased consumption is hardly what the economy needs Anargument can be made that spending on education and infrastructure would helpboost the economys productivity in the long run Certainly spending down thedebt reducing government borrowing would have that effect by encouraging moreproductive uses of capital Its hard to imagine that a cut in todays hardlyconfiscatory tax rates would do the same especially when the majorbeneficiaries of both bills would be the wealthy who have already reapedenormous benefits from the boom            But perhaps as weve been told time and again by Bill Archer and PhilGramm we should trust the people to spend their own money Of course weshould Unlike economist Robert Frank whos worried that were buying too manyExpeditions and Boxsters I dont really care what particular private goodsconsumers consume But the people should also be able to spend their money onpublic goods such as public schools highways and stealth fighters and theycant do that if the share of the federal budget devoted to discretionaryspending keeps getting smaller and smaller No matter how much Id like to Icant get together with my neighbors and pay for road improvements on theInterstate or invest in NASA I know the obviousness of this point isstaggering but so too is the disingenuousness of the rhetoric surrounding taxcuts The moneys going to be spent in one place or another Its just aquestion of where not a question of trusting the people or not            A centerpiece of both tax cuts is a severe trimming of the capitalgainstax which seems like a very odd decision at a time when shortterm investingis on the rise and companies are having absolutely no trouble raising capitalHere again the benefits of this cut will flow almost entirely to thewealthiest and will solve a problem that currently does not exist that iscapital scarcity And although any capital tax distorts capital allocationisnt encouraging longterm investing a distortion that recent events in theglobal economy suggest might not be such a bad thing            Most important its essential to remember that all of these tax cuts andspending plans are predicated on the idea that the CBO or the White House canmake meaningful predictions about economic growth tax revenues and budgetsurpluses  or even  years out They cant The record of economicforecasting is an abysmal one not because the forecasters are stupid or biasedbut because the economy is just too complex to predict with any accuracy PhilGramm did generously say that if the surpluses dont materialize Congresscould just raise taxes to make up the difference He also said that he had someFlorida swampland the Brooklyn Bridge and a couple of hot Internet IPOs hewanted to sell us
