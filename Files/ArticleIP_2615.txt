                                 When                 We look at it like thisThe big fish eats the small fish and the small fish eats the shrimp You buy orget bought Its a law of economics Vice Director Shi Jianping of theShanghai Rubber Belt Co told the Wall Street Journal earlier this weekMerger mania you see is sweeping the Peoples Republic Soon instead ofhundreds of small companies all making identical rubber belts there will be onegiant company making all the rubber belts Itll be just like the market for PCoperating systems in the United States            As ithappens Shi Jianpings description of todays China sounds quite a bit liketodays United States Mergers and acquisitions are back in a big way and thenew buzzword is consolidation Since  M  A activity has risen torecord levels both in terms of raw numbers and size Telecommunicationsdefense aerospace mass media In all these industries the number of playershas been significantly reduced over the last three years Emboldened by a newapproach to antitrust law at the Justice Department and Federal TradeCommissionone that suggests that unless youre doing something that willimmediately raise consumer prices its AOK with themgiant companies thatpreviously would never have imagined merging have tied the knot Thisrediscovery of the art of the deal makes it seem like the s all overagain            Except that in some interesting and important ways itisnt In the first place a much higher percentage of these mergers andacquisitions are taking place within rather than across industries which iswhy we hear a lot more about consolidation and a lot less about synergy orconglomeration Instead of USX buying Marathon Oil in a desperate attempt todiversify into a business it hadnt proved it couldnt run we have Boeingbuying McDonnell Douglas British Telecom buying MCI and Raytheon buyingHughes Electronics In addition the vast majority of M  A activity todayis friendly The big fish may be eating the small fish but the small fish seemmore than happy to be eaten In this new winwin world theres somethingalmost unseemly about hostile takeover attempts            Of course that only makes itall the more interesting and the more telling when they occur            UnionPacific Resources is an independent oil and gas driller which means itspecializes in getting as much out of a given fields reserves as possible Itused to be part of Union Pacific Corp the transportation giant that laidrailway track across the United States As part of its desire to focus on itscore UP spun off UPR two years ago The oil company is blessed with verylittle debt but its grown relatively slowly since the spinoff because itdoesnt have many reserves and lacks the wherewithal for massive explorationprojects            Enter Pennzoil Or rather reenter PennzoilPennzoil makes  well Pennzoil motor oil It also owns Jiffy Lubeoilchangesmotor oil is that synergy or consolidation And it has a growingoilandgas exploration business Two years ago Pennzoil approached UnionPacific with an offer to merge figuring its extensive reserves would fit wellwith UPRs intensive drilling But Union Pacific rebuffed Pennzoil actuallyit was more a simple failure to call back than an explicit rejection And soPennzoil turned itself around selling off less profitable fields expandingits exploration business strengthening Jiffy Lube Last year the companyturned its first profit since  and earnings for the last quarter were upsharplymuch more sharply than UPRsover the year before Not surprisinglythats when UPR decided to come acalling            A littlemore than a month ago UPR announced a tender offer of  a shareapercent premium over Pennzoils previous closing priceincluding acommitment to buy  percent of Pennzoils shares at the offer price If UPRwere to gain control it would buy up the remaining shares at market priceMore than  percent of Pennzoils shares were tendered by the deadline Gameover right            Not quite Pennzoils management and board of directorsvehemently opposed the takeover They insisted the companys longterm valuewas much greater than  a share and that UPR was trying to pick it up beforethe effects of the turnaround had been felt by investors And Pennzoil has apoison pill provision which means that as soon as  percent of thecompanys shares are acquired by a hostile bidder every other Pennzoilshareholder gets to buy newly issued Pennzoil shares at a substantial discountObviously that would make any buyout attempt prohibitively expensive            Now poisonpill plans andother scorchedearth strategies to frustrate takeoverslike the sale ofvaluable assets or the assumption of insane levels of debtseem to violate theprinciple that those who own the company the shareholders should be able todecide what to do with it If we want shareholders to think like owners and notspeculators taking away that power hardly seems the answer            On theother hand the way tender offers are structured almost guarantees theyll beaccepted If youre one of the few shareholders who doesnt tender her stockUPR is only going to pay you the market price for your shares and you have noguarantee that will be more than  What that really means is that anycompany with the financial ability to launch a tender offerand given the easewith which financing can be found that means essentially any companycanbring about the dissolution of its target A study in the s in fact foundthat four out of every five tender offers resulted in the target being absorbedby one firm or another            For freemarket purists theres nothing wrongwith this If a companys management hasnt done right by its shareholderstakeovers are an appropriate remedy For these believers in the efficientmarket a companys stock price always reflects its true value Theres onlyone problem with this It makes no sense            In amarket of  stocks shortterm prices will rise and fall for an infinitevariety of reasons very few of which have anything to do with a companys realproductivity or value Dell Computer for instance would be at least fivetimes as hard to acquire today as it was a year ago But only a foolor aChicago School theoristwould say that Dell is five times as valuable to theeconomy today as it was a year ago Placing the entire future of a corporationin the hands of arbitrageurs which is what a tender offer amounts to is theworship of property rights run amok Yet how to come up with a solution thatwould protect longterm shareholder rights while making tender offers lessautomatically successful Wasnt it Warren Buffet who suggested a  percentcapital gains tax on any investment held less than a year That might work            Most scholarly studies of hostile takeovers show they havelittle or no impact on productivity profitability or on the acquiringcompanys longterm stock price Plenty of wealth is redistributed but itsnot really clear that any is created Although bidders tend to portraythemselves as rescuing ailing companiesUPR said it was reacting to a decadeof broken promises and poor performance at Pennzoilin fact they almostuniformly bid for profitable healthy companies that the market for one reasonor another is undervaluing The new American vogue for mergers may be makingthe economy stronger though the jury is still out on that question But in ahostile takeover it seems pretty clear one plus one generally doesnt equalthree Often it doesnt even equal two Hard as it may be to remember in abull market society doesnt get any richer when UPR exchanges its cash forPennzoils shares Of course investment bankers lawyers and speculatorsdo
