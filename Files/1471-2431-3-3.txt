                    Background        Girls who experience a relatively early sexual        maturation typically assessed by age at menarche tend to        be more obese as adults              For        example Garn et al    found that women ages  to         y who reported menarche before age  y were  to  kgm        heavier than those who underwent menarche after  y In        addition to this association with adult levels of body mass        index BMI kgm  menarcheal age is also inversely        related to adult skinfold thicknesses               Although there is at least one negative report     the        lack of association between menarcheal age and adult        obesity may be due to the difficulty in recalling an event        that occurred several decades in the past            Although the biological mechanisms underlying the        inverse association between menarcheal age and adult        obesity are uncertain it has been suggested that early        maturing girls may have a longer period of positive energy        balance     or that various endocrine factors influence        both the rate of sexual maturation and the accumulation of        body fat     However it is also possible that the        apparent influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity        reflects the underlying importance of childhood obesity        with relatively fat children at increased risk for both        early menarche        and adult obesity                    Disentangling these interrelationships requires        information on menarcheal age childhood obesity and adult        obesity and one study    found that adjustment for BMI        at age  y reduced but did not eliminate the association        between menarcheal age and adult obesity A substantial        proportion of girls in this study however experienced        menarche close to age  y and it is unclear if BMI levels        at younger ages could also account for the apparent        influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity The present        study explores the interrelationships between childhood        levels of BMI menarcheal age and adult ages  to  y        obesity in a biracial sample of  women                    Methods                  Sample          Bogalusa Louisiana a semirural community in          Washington Parish population  is  miles          northeast of New Orleans Seven crosssectional studies          of schoolchildren ages  to  y were conducted in          Ward  of Washington Parish between  and               In addition four studies of adults ages  to           y who had been previously examined as children were          conducted between  and  Protocols were approved          by appropriate institutional review boards and informed          consent was obtained from all participants Because many          subjects participated in multiple examinations we could          conduct various longitudinal analyses A yearold          examined in  for example was eligible for          reexamination in studies conducted in               and  age  y          Of the  to yearold girls who were examined in          the Bogalusa Heart Study between  and  a total          of  girls  participated in a riskfactor          examination before menarche and  were ageeligible to          be reexamined in adulthood A yearold examined in           for example could not have been reexamined as an          adult Of these girls  were reexamined in          adulthood We excluded  subjects from the analyses          because  the reported menarcheal age was younger than          the age at a previous examination  the first report          of menarcheal age was made after age  y  menarcheal          age was never reported or  data on premenarcheal          weight or height were missing          The final sample size was  with each girl being          examined on average  times between the ages of  and           years In most analyses premenarcheal levels of          height BMI and triceps skinfold thickness TSF were          based on data from the initial childhood examination          mean age  y and adult levels of the anthropometric          dimensions were based on those at the final mean age           y examination Because errors in recalling age at          menarche likely increase with the duration of time          menarcheal age was based on data provided at the first          report of this event There were various combinations of          baseline and followup examinations in this cohort but          the largest numbers of girls were followed from           to  n   or from  to  n                                     Anthropometry          The examination procedures used in the Bogalusa Heart          Study have been described     Weight was measured to          the nearest  kg using a balance beam scale and height          was measured to the nearest  cm with a manual height          board BMI kgm  was used as an index of relative          weight Because of the variability in levels of weight          height and BMI by age among children national US data           to  were used to convert these values into          sexand agespecific Zscores      These Zscores          express childhood levels of weight height and BMI in the          current study relative to those of similarly aged          children examined between  and           The TSF was measured three times in succession with          Lange skinfold calipers and the mean value is included          in the analyses The subscapular skinfold thickness was          not measured until  the third examination of          schoolchildren and levels are shown only for adults          The ratio of the subscapular skinfold thickness to TSF is          used as a measure of central fat distribution                          Menarcheal History          As previously described     information on          menarcheal age was obtained by a registered nurse Girls          in the  rdgrade and above were asked whether they had          ever had a menstrual period and if necessary the term          menstrual period was explained Postmenarcheal girls          were asked to identify the year of their first period          with the help of questions such as Do you remember what          grade you were in when you started having periods          Because most subjects provided the year but not the          month of menarche we assumed that all girls experienced          menarche at the midpoint July  of the specified year          Menarcheal age was then calculated by dividing the number          of days between birth and July  of the reported year by                                    Statistical Analyses          Levels of various childhood and adult characteristics          were contrasted between white n   and black n            women Racespecific levels of weight height BMI          and skinfold thicknesses among adults and children were          also examined within categories early  y          intermediate  to  y or late   y of          menarcheal age Spearman rank correlation coefficients          and odds ratios were also used to summarize the relation          of menarcheal age to both childhood and adult levels of          weight height BMI and skinfold thicknesses          To assess whether childhood differences in the          anthropometric dimensions could account for the          association between menarcheal age and adult obesity          regressionestimated differences in adult levels of BMI          and TSF between early menarche  y and late            y maturers were compared in two models The first          regression model controlled for only age while the          second model further adjusted for childhood levels of BMI          and TSF We assumed that the estimated differences in          adult levels of obesity across menarcheal age categories          in the fully adjusted model represented the independent          relation of menarcheal age to adult levels of BMI and          TSF whereas differences between the two models          represented the effects of menarcheal age that were          attributable to childhood obesity          Smoothed levels of BMI by age based on lowess              are also shown for women who experienced early          intermediate or late menarche These analyses were          further stratified according to childhood BMI Zscore            vs Zscore                              Results        Mean levels of various characteristics are shown in        Table  On average girls participated in approximately        five examinations and the mean age at the initial        examination was  y Childhood levels of weight and height        at the initial examination were similar to those expected        with Zscores close to  but blacks were slightly taller        and heavier than were whites These racial differences in        both weight and height resulted in very similar BMI levels        among white and black girls but the mean TSF was thicker        among white girls The mean menarcheal ages of whites and        blacks were similar  vs  y but blacks tended to        be more likely  vs  p   to undergo a        relatively early  y menarche At followup mean        age  y black women had higher mean levels of weight         kg BMI  kgm  and subscapular skinfold        thickness  mm than did white women but there was no        racial difference in TSF        Menarcheal age was inversely related to adult levels of        weight BMI and skinfold thicknesses among adults Table         As compared with late maturers menarcheal age         y women who had a relatively early menarche  y        weighed more  to  kg had a higher BMI  to         kgm  and had thicker  to  mm skinfolds in adulthood        p   for all differences The magnitudes of the        various correlation coefficients r   to  with        menarcheal age were similar between black and white women        but the associations were not linear Whereas women who        underwent an early menarche had elevated mean levels of        BMI weight and skinfold thicknesses in adulthood levels        of these characteristics differed only slightly between        women who experienced an intermediate age  y or        late age   y menarche Early menarche was also        associated with a higher subscapulartriceps skinfold        thickness ratio among white women but this was largely        because of the higher BMI levels among women with a central        distribution of body fat r   Menarcheal age was not        significantly related to adult height but among white        women early maturers were on average  cm shorter than        were late maturers p          Among both white and black girls higher premenarcheal        mean age  y levels of BMI weight height and TSF were        associated with an earlier menarche Table  Among white        girls for example those who underwent menarche before age         y had higher childhood levels of BMI  kgm         weight  kg height  cm and TSF  mm than did        those who underwent a relatively late   y menarche        Furthermore menarcheal age was more strongly related to        levels of these characteristics in childhood with        correlations ranging up to  than in adulthood Table         r   to  Logistic regression analyses final        column indicated that a difference of  standard deviation        in levels of weight height and BMI approximately doubled        the odds range  to  that a girl would experience        menarche before age  y Additional analyses indicated        that these associations were evident even among the        youngest children with BMI levels among  to yearolds        inversely associated r   whites and         blacks with subsequent menarcheal age        We then examined whether the inverse relation of        menarcheal age to adult levels of BMI and TSF resulted from        the earlier menarche of girls who were already overweight        in childhood Table  As estimated in regression models        that adjusted only for examination age girls who underwent        menarche before age  y were on average  kgm        blacks to  kgm whites heavier as adults than were        girls who underwent menarche after  y However        adjustment for premenarcheal differences in levels of BMI        and TSF reduced these adult differences by  to         kgm blacks and  kgm whites Adjustment for        childhood height which was also associated with an earlier        menarche did not alter the relation of menarcheal age to        adult levels of BMI and TSF Controlling for childhood        levels of BMI and TSF also substantially reduced the adult        differences in TSF between early and late maturers Adult        levels of BMI and TSF were more strongly associated with        childhood levels of these characteristics Table         bottom with differences of  kgm whites and         kgm blacks between the outer fourths of the BMI        distribution Furthermore in contrast to the associations        with menarcheal age these adult differences in BMI and TSF        were only slightly reduced  after adjustment for        menarcheal age        The joint effects of menarcheal age and childhood BMI        levels are shown in Figure for whites top and blacks        bottom BMI values from all examinations were used in        this analysis resulting in a total of  values among         women Smoothed levels of BMI by age are shown in the        left panels for girls who experienced an early  y        intermediate or late   y menarche and the higher        BMI levels of early maturers are evident at all ages        However further stratification by childhood BMI Zscore          vs Zscore   right panels greatly reduced the        differences between early and late maturers and emphasized        the greater importance of childhood BMI For example white        women with an early menarche had an overall  kgm        higher mean BMI level after age  y than those with late        menarche but as seen in the upper right panel this        difference was reduced to  kgm within the two groups        of women categorized by childhood BMI In contrast among        both early and late maturing white women those who had a        childhood BMI Zscore   were  to  kgm heavier in        adulthood than women who were thinner in childhood                    Discussion        The recent secular increase in obesity among US adults            particularly among black women emphasize the        importance of identifying children who are at high risk for        adult obesity With only one exception     girls who        undergo a relatively early menarche have been found to be        more obese in adulthood              and our        results confirm that a relatively early menarche is        associated with adult obesity among both white and black        women However most  to  of the apparent effect of        menarcheal age is due to the faster maturation of girls who        are relatively heavy for their age and the importance of        childhood obesity on the subsequent timing of menarche was        evident even among  to yearolds In addition we found        that the inverse relation of menarcheal age to adult        obesity was nonlinear with differences in adult levels of        BMI and skinfold thicknesses most evident between subjects        with an early  y menarche and those who had either        an intermediate or relatively late menarche        Although it has been suggested that rapid sexual        maturation may have longterm consequences for the        development of obesity among women     our results        indicate that it is more likely that childhood obesity        influences both menarcheal age and adult obesity These        associations may be mediated by various interrelationships        among hormones sexual maturation and body fat For        example levels of leptin are increased among overweight        children and adolescents      and this hormone is        secreted by adipocytes Other results indicate that leptin        may play a role in the initiation of puberty     and        each  ngmL increase in serum leptin has been associated        with a month decrease in menarcheal age     The        apparent effect of early menarche on adult obesity may        therefore result from the influence of childhood obesity on        both the timing of menarche and the risk for adult obesity            It should be realized however that although        controlling for childhood BMI and TSF greatly reduced the        inverse relation of menarcheal age to adult obesity a        relatively small independent association remained Various        behavioral factors may also be important in this        association with an early puberty possibly resulting in        changes in eating habits or physical activity            Among women blackwhite differences in BMI levels        become apparent after age  y     suggesting that        adolescence may be a critical period     for the        development of obesity It is possible that the more rapid        sexual maturation of black girls       may in        part account for the high prevalence of obesity among        black women     Although we observed only a small        difference in the proportion of black  and white         who underwent menarche before age  y most women in the        current study experienced menarche before  More recent        data indicate that black girls in the US on average        experience menarche  months earlier than do white girls               Furthermore the mean menarcheal age of        black girls in Bogalusa decreased by approximately  months        between  and      A somewhat similar but not        statistically significant trend was also reported in a        recent study with the median menarcheal age of black girls        decreasing by  months between  and             These trends may at least in part be due to the        influence of various programs in the US such as the        National School Lunch Program aimed at improving the        nutritional status of children        Menarcheal age was also inversely related to adult BMI        levels in the British Birth Cohort with a mean difference        of  kgm at age  y between women who underwent        menarche before age  y n   or after age  y n              In agreement with our findings Power et al           found that adjustment for childhood age  y BMI        levels substantially reduced but did not eliminate the        apparent influence of early maturation on adult obesity        However these investigators did not provide an estimate of        the independent association between menarcheal age and        adult obesity and it is possible that BMI levels at age         y were influenced by the many changes that occur near the        time of menarche     We found that even among  to        yearolds BMI levels are inversely associated with the        subsequent timing of menarche        In agreement with our findings as well as those of a        previous report from the Bogalusa Heart Study            other investigators have found childhood levels of obesity             and height     to be associated with an        early menarche The previously reported positive        association between childhood height and adult obesity           may therefore be in part due to the earlier menarche of        relatively tall girls Although several investigators have        also found that an early menarche is associated with        shorter adult stature         possibly because of        the loss of several years of growth due to the early fusion        of the epiphyses of long bones     most of the reported        differences in adult height have been small eg         cm In the current study we found a  cm difference in        adult height across categories of menarcheal age among        white girls p   but there was no association among        black girls Any association between menarcheal age and        adult height is likely to be small        Several limitations of the current study should be        considered when interpreting our results Despite the large        sample size only  of the  ageeligible children        were reexamined as adults and included in the analyses        However the sample appeared to be representative of the        larger population and childhood levels of BMI weight and        height did not differ between the  reexamined children        and the other   minus  children The        agreement of our findings concerning the        interrelationships among childhood obesity menarcheal age        and adult obesity with those of other investigators also        indicates that our results are likely to be generalizble to        other populations        The most important limitation of the current study may        be the use of selfreported menarcheal age and the        misclassification associated with this recall over several        decades may explain the negative findings that have been        reported     Over shorter  years periods        however correlations between the first report of        menarcheal age obtained close to the time of menarche and        a subsequent report have generally been high     with         of girls accurately recalling the month and year of        menarche     Among the  girls in the current study        who participated in more than one examination after        menarche  of the recalled ages at the first and second        reports differed by one year or less and only  differed        by more than two years The mean interval between these        two examinations was  years but was more than  years        for  of the sample Although this reproducibility is        somewhat lower than in other studies a nondifferential        misclassification of menarcheal age would have resulted in        an underestimation of the actual associations In addition        it is possible that the information on menarcheal age        obtained at the first examination following menarche mean        interval  y may be more accurate than subsequent        recalls Additional analyses indicated that both childhood        and adult obesity tended to be more strongly associated        with menarcheal age reported at the first examination than        at the second examination following this event eg r          vs  with adult BMI                    Conclusions        Our findings indicate that much of the apparent        influence of menarcheal age on adult obesity is in        reality due to the influence of childhood obesity on both        menarcheal age and adult obesity However there is still        an independent association which in conjunction with the        increase in childhood obesity    and the recent secular        decrease in the menarcheal age of black girls in the US              will further increase the prevalence of adult        obesity Additional longitudinal studies of childhood and        adult obesity as well as predictors of early menarche are        needed but is likely that the prevention of childhood        obesity will lower the incidence of obesityrelated        complications among adults                    Abbreviations        BMI body mass index TSF triceps skinfold
