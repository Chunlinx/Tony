                                 Voice Over                        Russ            Bust the union indeed Im for unions on principleand in practicalselfinterested terms the union was what allowed me to make some semblance ofa decent living when I worked there not to mention its role in representing amilitant staff culture and defending the autonomy of editors and writersespecially in the Murdoch erabut all that aside the union has nothing to dowith the Voices editorial problems The Voice was much better inthe s when the union was stronger relatively speakingnot that it was everreally strong but it seems totally toothless now On the contrary theVoice has been done in by s corporate culture with its emphasis oncostcutting its cult of efficiency and its deep distrust of creative workbecause its ultimately unquantifiable and resistant to control from the topIf a publication is built around writers with strong individual views andidentities and people read the paper because of those writers it gives thewriters and editors a lot of power and I think it has suited Leonard Sternsbusiness agenda Im not suggesting its a conscious conspiracy for theVoice to stop being a writers paper Free distribution also changes thenature of the readership and the relationship between readers andwriterspeople arent shelling out money to read particular writers and itsharder for writers to tell who their audience is            A while ago I had a conversation with the Voices managing editor inwhich he said I was one in a long line of Embittered Alumni I thought that waswitty and briefly considered making up a Village Voice EmbitteredAlumni button But in fact Im not bitterthe Voice was where I reallydeveloped as a writer and editor and Im grateful to it on the wholeImjust frustrated I think the paper served a crucial function as a space forcultural reporting and analysis and culturally radical ideas that were censoredelsewhere and it isnt serving that function anymore nor has any otherpublication come close to replacing it The Voice was the firstpublication to give a forum to prosex feminists the first so far as I know toblow the whistle on the ritual sex abuse daycare trials There was a timewhen something like the Monica Lewinsky scandal would have prompted anoutpouring of debate and analysis from all angles If something like Littletonhappened the Voice would have sent a reporter out there for a few weeksand would have had the best story on what was really going on there And so onWell RIP            Times up See you in New York
