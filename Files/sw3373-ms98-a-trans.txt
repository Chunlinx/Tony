        all right whats your favorite show     well i was just trying to think when they called i didnt have as much time to prepare for this as i did some of the others um i love watching some of the uh new new shows basically   umhum   and we uh took we subscribe to CNN and we took that and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during any kind of thing like the earthquake and i have gotten stuck on a lot of this the news shows and the stuff that comes on that that it you know like the uh at night the discussion talk shows and things and we really havent gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current   umhum   uh especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here   sure   we have little ones uh we do let them watch  and we think thats kind of informative to teach them how to handle things in situations   umhum it really is umhum   what do you watch   i watch just about anything but not a lot of TV i mean ill watch you know maybe a little while when i first get home in the evening   umhum umhum uhhuh   and i usually watch you know the news and then ill watch that Hard Copy or   uhhuh thats the same things we do   or that kind of thing you know and i like the  and Unsolved Mysteries and   umhum yeah that kind thats the kind i like really more than the sitcoms i havent gotten into many of those   umhum now i do like my husband is really crazy about Evening Shade that comes on on Monday evening   i have heard thats real good   and i uh   thats Burt Reynolds isnt it yeah ive heard that   umhum and ive got to where every Monday i rush around so i could sit and watch that with him because its really funny   now someone told me that and also uh i i meant to be trying to pick up on Murphy Brown because they said that that was really good this season   umhum well his favorite nights Monday night so weve got to where well sit and watch it on Monday night because that and then that uh oh i cant even think of the name of it   youve got it  uhhuh   like i say im not   Designing Women is on that night too   yeah and the one with the the sergeant that married the woman with the kids Sergeant McGillis   hm i dont even know   Sergeant uh Major Major Dad   oh okay now i weve never even seen that   yeah that comes on right after uh the Evening Shade and then Murphy Brown and Designing Women   uhhuh   so we always he watches that and i kind of sit i watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others as i can   on the other  well you know on Friday nights especially we like to watch   or um its kind of a competition on Thursdays between Prime Time and Knots Landing   umhum umhum yeah   but uh we used to like Knots Landing a lot oh excuse me just a minute  the moneys right there on the   well you cant hardly watch Knots Landing with the little kids around though   oh i know thats the thing and so we  umhum well they are in fact on weeknights theyre in bed by eight but weve just gotten anymore to where we just keep it off   except theys probably are in bed by nine did you get your pizza taken care of   yeah hes gone to get it thank you um but i was but i was trying to say on Saturdays theres absolutely nothing and thats the day my husband wants to do straight sports     well do you know i have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that ive really liked and thats Sisters have you watched that   no but i saw that advertised today and it sounds like its not fluff it sounds like its good   its really you know its really pretty good i mean its kind of like you know um   umhum   soap opera i guess   yeah thats what they said it was kind of a little more drama to it   but its so so far it ive watched it about three times now and its really held my attention its been pretty good some pretty good acting   well and and another one now that its getting darker and youre wanting to cocoon more that they said is excellent is the Ill Fly Away and Brooklyn Bridge some of these that are nostalgic   now i watched Brooklyn Bridge this week for the first time but i havent i did i like it   did you like it did you well they said that one and Ill Fly Away are really quality you know  and i havent seen it either i think what i need to do is kind of read to see whats on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight oclock and then i get my bath  its you know its almost too late to start something new   now i havent seen ill Fly Away yet umhum its nearly too late for TV thats the way i am i get in from work and im tired and i sit and watch for a few minutes then i have to get up and do dinner and everything   yeah yeah umhum yeah and then weve gotten to where we rent videos for the weekend nights  so its like we kind of tuned out of our TV   umhum yeah thats us if were home on the weekend we always watch videos so   yeah well we do too   but there are some good shows on i i really probably should watch more of them than i do but i like i dont know i im always in to making things and   yeah i dont know yeah theres a lot more to do with with your time when you get into it   and i dont just spend all my time and i my husband now he sits and watch TV constantly   umhum well my my sister and them and her husband do on weekends they dont have children yet and they just turn it on when they walk in they turn it off when they leave
