                                 A Banner Year            One ofthe events we political Webwatchers were waiting for has arrived Seriouspresidential candidates have begun advertising on the Internet George WBushs campaign is now running several different interactive banner adstargeted to Web users in early primary states including one for voters in NewHampshire that allows viewers to calculate how much they would save underBushs tax plan Click here to see the taxsavings banner John McCain ranbanners soliciting volunteers to circulate ballot petitions for him in Virginialast month To see these ads click here TodayMcCain announced another Internet ad campaign touting his support for apermanent moratorium on Internet taxation                         TheBradley and Gore campaigns are likely to follow suit with banner ads of theirown But before these ads become as commonplace as second TV spots itsworth considering a few of the issues they raise                           Privacy Both Bushs and McCains banner ads were developed byAristotlePublishing  a political firm that maintains uptodate voter lists andsells them to campaigns for use in various kinds of voter targeting fromdirect mail to doortodoor canvassing Aristotle has recently developed anInternet application It crossreferences its voter information with datacollected by portals Web sites and Internet service providers By siftingsuch information together the company believes it can surgically targetclusters of voters of special interest to candidatessuch as say marriedwomen in their s who are registered as Republicans in New Hampshire BothBush and McCain have been using Aristotles method of targeting banners fortheir pilot Internet ads            Butthis sort of targeting raises an ethical question Should a person by virtueof registering to use a certain Web site become the involuntary recipient ofpolitical propaganda Jay McAniff of Aristotle says his firm relies on what isknown as permissionbased marketingthat is it only uses informationoffered voluntarily not the kind gained passively on the basis of cookiesclick  for Michael Kinsleys explanation of cookies And the McCain and Bushcampaigns both say they wont resell or otherwise use the information collectedfrom people who click on their ads                         Buteven if all are scrupulous about what they do with user data theres somethingBig Brotherish about being bombarded with ads based on information youvegiven for another purpose Imagine if your television was able to gatherdetails about your viewing habits and your personal life and then transmit thatdata to companies that wanted to use it to sell you things You might find itpretty creepy With email spam or oldfashioned direct mail at least therecipient knows that someone is marketing something to him with the help ofdata that someone else sold With banner ads targeting can be invisible                           Disclosure and Fairness Bush spokesman Scott McClellan toldme that the campaigns banner ads have run on some  Web sites includingYahoo Excite and CNNcom But McClellan declined to give any more specificinformation about the ad buy for strategic reasons McCains campaigncouldnt provide the names of any of the Web sites where it was advertisingAristotle Publishing isnt even willing to divulge the name of the company thatactually places its banner ads on Web sites            If wewere talking about conventional TV or radio advertising all such informationwould be a matter of public record According to federal law stations have tomaintain open books showing who spent how much on political advertising Thisassures compliance with Federal Communications Commission rules designed tosecure equal access to public airwaves Mandatory disclosure means that WMURthe leading TV station in New Hampshire cant give Steve Forbes a volumediscount without offering the same deal to Forbes rivals But these FCC ruleshavent yet been applied to the Internet and its not clear they can bePortals and ISPs dont use the public airwaves and they dont needbroadcasting licenses            Theres a widespread and largely sensible aversion to the mechanisticapplication of existing campaignfinance regulations to the rapidly evolvingmedium of the Internet But the TVInternet disclosure disparity is hard tojustify in principle and points to potential abuses down the road As it isnow Web companies not only have the ability to provide diabolically precisedemographic targeting to political campaigns they can also make such offersexclusively Yahoo could theoretically offer its entire inventory of NewHampshire Republicans through Feb  to the Forbes campaign at a premium priceThis would be unfair to the other candidatesand if done on television orradio entirely illegal But a campaign lawyer I spoke to for this story saidhe couldnt see what would prevent it on the Internet so long as Yahoo chargedat least the going rate for the ads                           Effectiveness Of course well only need to worry aboutissues of fairness and privacy if banner ads are seen by political campaigns asworking The Bush people say the results of their effort arent in yet buttheyre optimistic and expect to stick with Internet advertising The McCaincampaign has more specific evidence of success According to spokesman DanSchnur  people clicked McCains Virginia banner ads some  percent ofthose who viewed the banners This isnt a bad response rate though it meansthe overall campaign was tinyjust  ad impressions But of the people who clicked Schnur says nearly half followed through by circulatingpetitions for McCain An ad buy that probably cost less than  promptingnearly  people to volunteer in personthats true interactivity
