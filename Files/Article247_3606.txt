                                 More on Boomers Rock and Walt Mossberg            For those arriving late to this dispute In an earlier item FDR Father of Rock n Roll Chatterbox wrote that boomer mathcontradicts the boomer mythology that it was the baby boom that first absorbedrock n roll into the mass culture Chatterboxs proof was that the firstrock n roll records that reached a large mainstream audienceBill Haley andthe Comets Rock Around the Clock and Elvis Presleys HeartbreakHotelwere released in  and  The oldest baby boomers in  and were  and  respectivelytoo young Chatterbox reasoned to be buyingrock n roll records            Walter S Mossberg who writes the Wall Street Journals Personal Technology columnwrote in to dispute this last point Incidentally the link to Mossbergscolumn that Chatterbox posted earlier doesnt work for people who dontsubscribe to the Journals online edition Chatterbox has nowsubstituted a link that will work for everyone free of charge Mossbergexplained that he was born in March  and that he was buying rockn roll records at the age of  which of course would have been in Chatterbox replied that he could easily picture Mossberg with whom Chatterboxformerly worked at the Journal s Washington bureau as a smartaleckyyearold but that he doubted many other members of Mossbergs cohort weresimilarly precocious Chatterbox then invited  and yearolds to enlighten                  Slates  Fray as to whetherlike Mossberg they were buying rock n roll records at the age ofnine            Fray postings immediately started pouring in from people who said that yesthey are about Mossbergs age and yes they were buying rock n roll recordsstarting in the mids So Chatterbox will now yield on this pointwhilenoting this doesnt really undermine Chatterboxs larger point that FDR is anunacknowledged founding father of rock n roll For the details see thefirst item Baby boomers were part of the recordbuying public thatmade rock n roll an art form for the masses as opposed to one for blacks anda few white hipsters in the mids Chatterbox continues to doubt howeverthat boomers represented a majority of that public until the s            Please note the important distinction between listening to rock nroll music Chatterbox born in  was listening to the Beatles wellbefore he was  and buying rock n roll records Chatterbox didnt buyhis first recordLP or singleuntil long after the Beatles  breakupSeveral Fraygrants click here andherefor examples missed this distinction Heres Fraygrant SharonSaunders                                             I plugged  the family radio into the wall by my bed turned it low andlistened past my bedtime to the real thing LaVerne Baker Little Richard theCadillacs the Coastersjust about every black group every doowop grouparound plus Dion and the Belmonts fellow Bronxites Not only did we listento it but us little kids actually stood under the lamppost and sang acappella                                       But except in the highly attenuated sense that Saunders was boosting theratings of radio stations that were playing LaVerne Baker and Little Richardand the Cadillacs and the Coasters she wasnt really putting money into thesegroups pockets or as was more often the case these groups record labelspocketsas she would have been doing had she bought their recordsafter hearing them on the radio            That said it must be conceded that several boomer Fraygrants did goout and buy the records well before their teen years Click here andhereand here for afew examples When s were king preteens with limited finances were buyingthem by the crateful explains Duffy HawesHeres Jill Tso                                             I too was born in  and bought rock n roll records when I was inthe fourth grade One of the first s I purchased was Jerry Lee Lewis GreatBalls of Fire My father had purchased a custom hifi and I played the  soloud and danced all afternoon When he came home and heard the lyrics he brokethe record in two I was crushed and resented him for many years Last year Ifinally realized why he thought Great Balls of Fire was terrible for hisgradeschoolaged daughter to be listening to I had never associated the titleand lyrics to the vernacular use of the word balls Duh                                       Indeed one boomer FraygrantSharonSmithgoes so far as to recall that she owned her very own copy of RockAround the Clock though shes a little vague about whether she purchased itwhen she was  or  years of age                                             I was born in October  five months before Mossberg and grew up inSan Francisco On the last day of sixth grade in June of  Miss Barnettone of the greatest teachers the world has seen let us have a party Shebrought a record player we brought our s my contribution was Rock Aroundthe Clock and two dozen  and yearolds danced for two hours How hadwe learned A year of watching American Bandstand every day after schooland practicing in front of the TV                                       Chatterbox will give the final word to Mossberg who has shown himself to bea gracious victor in this argument                                             Everybody including me concedes that the older nonboomer teens playedsome role in the adoption of early rock even though ultimately thesekids didnt get it and we boomers did And youre correct that boomerpropaganda never allows for this possibility Your only mistake was totallywriting off the mystical power of yearold boomers in the s But how wereyou to know Born in  You cant even remember blackandwhite TV or thosefirst transistor radios that one of the                   Fraypeople                   mentioned ahem actually Chatterbox can rememberthese things but thats a small point                                                 I honestly think this toyearold age groups discovery of rock androll against the wishes of our parents cemented into us older boomers twolessons that were behind much of what happened in the s                                                                        Question authority                  Age matters                                                      Because of rock we had a lot in common with each other that neither ourparents nor our older siblings or older friends shared It was the start of thefeeling right or wrong of generational bonding and of boomer exceptionalismwhich GenXers so despise  I can still vividly remember the day I went tobuy my first  rpm record using my own funds And I wanted something likeMaybelline by Chuck Berry or maybe Wake Up Little Susie by the EverlyBrothers But my father forced me to buy a lame horrible pop tunecalled Melodie DAmour                   by the Mills Brothers or the AmesBrothers or some lame brothers I never let him do that again and I neverforgot that lesson about the way authority figures can screw youInterestingly my dad and I later developed a great relationship and he sworehe couldnt remember the incident But it was etched in my mind
