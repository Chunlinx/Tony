                                  Fatal Attraction             The struggle among Patrick Buchanan Donald TrumpJesse Ventura and Ross Perots lieutenants for control of the Reform Partyonly looks like the clash of celebrity egos Actually the Reform Party issplitting along the fault line between American progressivism and Americanpopulismrival traditions represented most recently by presidential candidatesJohn Anderson  and George Wallace  Natural allies andnatural enemies progressives and populists simultaneously attract and repulseeach other In  and to a lesser extent in  Perot managed to uniteboth Anderson progressives and Wallace populists but if history is any guidenobody will pull off that miracle in this election            John Andersons progressive Republicanism belongedto the distinctive political tradition of Greater New Englanda territory thatarcs from Maine to the Pacific Northwest and was settled by th century Yankee Protestant settlers The Yankees secularizedPuritanism combines an enthusiasm for social reformsuch as abolitionismProhibition womens suffrage civil rights eugenics and the antismokingcrusadewith an oftenpriggish moralism and an apocalyptic horror ofcorruption Most thirdparty movements have originated in Greater NewEngland The name of one movement launched during World War I tells the wholestory The Nonpartisan League            The Germans andScandinavians who settled in western Greater New England reinforced the secularpuritan ethos although they were more likely to be socialists than theYankees whose fear of corruption has often made them enemies of biggovernment And Prohibition divided liquorhating Northern Protestants frombeerloving Germans Even so the Protestant pietism of many Germanic Americansmeshed neatly with the Puritan religious culture of New Englanders and theirwestern cousins while socialist enthusiasms were easily merged with SocialGospel Protestantism in the northerntier states It is no coincidence thatAnderson the standardbearer for the YankeeGermanic tradition in  is ofSwedish descentnor is it a coincidence that in  Anderson formerly aRepublican voted for Walter Mondale a fellow SwedishAmerican            Southern populism which earlier had produced Huey P LongGeorgias Tom Watson and the Southern supporters of William Jennings Bryanspawned George Wallace Populism has more often found a home in the HighlandSouth than in the coastal black belt which has been dominated since colonialtimes by the elitist conservatism of rulingclass Bourbon families and theirallies Drawing on the traditions of the ScotsIrish settlers of Appalachia andthe Ozarks Highland Southern populism encourages a tribal approach to politicsand rewards leaders who are flamboyant and bellicose Andrew Jackson was anearly example of this type Patrick J Buchanan is its latest incarnation            Perot united Andersonprogressives and Wallace populists but in an unstable pairing Wallacessupporters were social conservatives who favored activist government as longas it benefited them and their families while Andersons voters were socialliberals more concerned with good government than with expensive governmentThe Wallace voters tended to be white workingclass Democrats on their way intothe Republican Party the Anderson voters by contrast were often former liberalRepublicans in transit to a new home in the Democratic Party            In the federal deficit Perot found an issue that resonatedwith both progressives and populists In the minds of the skinflintprogressives spending money one does not have is a form of moral depravityThe deficit issue mobilized Jacksonian populists because it spoke to theirfears about a remote government dominated by the rich and powerful Unlikedeficit reduction the trade issue divided populist protectionists fromprogressives many of whom favor free trade            Thanks to hisdeficitreduction coalition Perot won more votes in  than any thirdpartypresidential candidate since Bull Moose Progressive Theodore Roosevelt in Perots  percent of the total bettered Wallaces  percent in and Andersons  percent in  The core of Perots support that year was NewEngland and Greater New England with his best stateno surpriseYankeeMaine While his rhetoric was populist his positions were progressive Theprogressives preferred government by experts to mob rule Perot claimed thatsmart people in Washington already had the plans all that was lacking wasthe will to implement them Progressive reforms such as initiatives andreferendums like Perots vague notions of direct democracy tended to bypasslegislatures and to concentrate plebiscitary power in allegedly nonpartisanexecutivesthe president governors city managers            Ignorant Perot critics called his technocratic approachfascism when it was oldfashioned American progressivism The progressiveslike their predecessors among the Mugwumpsthe independentminded Republicanswho spurned their partys presidential candidate in and LiberalRepublicans and Whigs and Federalists have long favored fiscal conservatismPerot and his Concord Coalition allies the New Englanders Paul Tsongas andWarren Rudman were as horrified by the federal deficit as the Mugwumps hadbeen appalled by the support of Bryanite populists for bimetallism and as theLiberal Republicans a generation earlier in the Gilded Age had beenfrightened by paper money            Perot then has the mindof a Greater New England progressive but the heart of a Highland Southernpopulist his native Texarkana belongs to the western fringe of the HighlandSouth If Perots message appealed to Yankee and Nordic progressives in thenorthern tier his antiestablishment populism and no doubt his flamboyantpersona appealed to the kind of voters whose ancestors had cheered on Huey PLong and Sockless Jerry Simpson Perot did very poorly in the conservativeSouthbut his showing was best in parts of the South that had voted for GeorgeWallace            With the federal deficit removed as an issue by Perots coalition of Snow Belt goodgovernment reformism and giveemhellhillbilly populism dissolved The puritan crusaders of the North and thealienated populists of the South may share common political enemies but littleelse A century ago Northern progressives such as The Nation s ELGodkin viewed populists such as William Jennings Bryan as barbarians and theyreturned the favor by viewing Mugwumps as enemies rather than as potentialallies            Then as now economicpolicy divided rather than united the opponents of the twoparty system In thes Mugwumps such as Godkin crusaded for free trade and against tariffprotection for corrupt manufacturers In the s northern fiscalconservatives such as Anderson Tsongas and Rudman have backed freetradeagreements such as NAFTA For their part Highland Southern populists tend torally around harebrained economic programs elevating them from an instrumentof policy into a symbol of a crusade against their enemies For the followersof Andrew Jackson the destruction of the Second Bank of the United States wasthe panacea for the disciples of William Jennings Bryan the panacea wassilver coinage for the followers of Ronald Reagan supplyside economics wasthe crackpot quick fix For Buchanan the symbolic economic issue is a revivalof high tariffs on manufactured imports            The factional war within the Reform Party then representsthe decomposition of the movement into its Northern progressive and Southernpopulist wings Buchanan can be described as a Southern populist as can PatChoate and Ross Perot whose populist sentiments appear to have triumphed overtheir progressive principles Former Colorado Gov Richard Lamm who attemptedto wrest leadership of the party away from Perot is a classic Greater NewEngland progressive as is former Connecticut Gov Lowell Weicker whose namewas circulated as a possible Reform Party nominee Jesse Ventura is the productof Minnesota political culture with its mix of Yankee and Germanic reformismand its long history of influential regional thirdparty movements such as theNonpartisan League and the FarmerLabor party And its not stretching toassign Donald Trump to the Northern progressive camp            If Perot backs Buchanan then the capture of theReform Party by rightwing Southern populists is likely At that point theprogressives will do what they have always done best Theyre never happierthan when they are demonstrating their moral political and religious purityby heading for the exit and starting their own small but pure church or partyNew Englanders fearing British corruption and tyranny provoked the AmericanRevolution A generation later during the War of  many New Englandersconsidered seceding from the United States whose federal government was thendominated by Southern politicians In the antebellum era New EnglandbasedConscience Whigs denounced the Norths proSouth Cotton Whigs as corrupt Afterthe Civil War highminded liberal Republicans walked out on their partnersthe sleazy Stalwarts In the early  th century the ProgressiveRepublicans led by Robert La Follette and Theodore Roosevelt stormed out ofthe GOP to form their own Progressive Party            So look for the Reform Partys displacedprogressives to declare the purity of their principles denounce the corruptionof the populists who have taken over the party machine and march outto founda new party perhaps from which in time they can secede
