                Doug you want to start   sure   you dont use any credit cards i dont imagine   no of course i use credit cards i have a couple of credit cards and     yeah yeah   and uh use them   uhhuh do you use them a lot   well we try not to were on a pretty strict and tight budget we use the credit cards however   uhhuh uhhuh   when were at a situation where we dont have either the cash or the checkbook handy   umhum   or we use credit cards also if we want to get an extended warranty on on an item that were purchasing so   oh well thats an idea thats a thought umhum   so yes and basically we use it mainly when were traveling or out of state or or somewhere where you know they dont take local they dont take out of state checks   umhum umhum umhum umhum   and so when were traveling some do you use credit cards often   my husband loves them         uh we do use them uh we try not to but he hes one who believes in credit cards and he uses them quite a bit   uhhuh   he likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month   oh yeah well thats thats a good thing because lot of people dont pay at the end of the month and they just pay the minimum required balance   he he likes doing that umhum and thats when you get into expenses   yes and you get in over your head   its   right but   itll uh some people i know also try to use it as float   uhhuh   where they buy something now and say well im going to buy this when its good and on sale and then i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month when im being paid   uhhuh right well sometimes you do come on bargains and that and its really useful   thats true   and some places wont take you know like a personal check or cash even   umhum   but they would take a credit card   right how well how are the laws in Pennsylvania uh as as regard well not the laws but the rates credit card rates in Pennsylvania for example down here when you go to a gas station   umhum   you get an extra charge for credit cards   right   than you would by paying for cash are they the same there   we yeah we have the same thing up here so we dont deal where they do that       we charge you know we go to places where they dont charge extra some of them charge five cents a gallon even like the gas stations more   thats pretty steep   and uh we just try to avoid you know the ones that do that we just dont uh go there   yes   because theres enough other ones around that dont charge you anything extra   umhum umhum   because actually to me credit cards are the same as cash to me they are anyways   yes because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase and and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill   right right yeah   are you saying that that way youre stranded not left stranded and high and dry  very good youre youre one of the the good i guess good   yes yes yeah right     faithful shoppers that dont get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money   well i cant say we never have now we have you know at times made payments on our things but we try not to   umhum   we try real hard   well yeah well  i see that as an advantage to a credit card also   umhum   that you can   umhum   can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself so i think that theres a great advantage to a credit card in those situations   right right umhum yeah because sometimes uh theres times when you may maybe couldnt take advantage of something   umhum   but with a credit card you can   umhum um umhum   so   um do you have uh multiple credit cards   uh   and do you find that advantageous or   well i think were narrowing it down actually uh uh like i said my husband likes them and we have quite a few but we really get when when you get down to the nitty gritty theres probably three that we use most of the time   umhum right were were actually in the same boat we like to use three uh   umhum   basic credit cards that way were not confused and we dont have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes to the end of the month   umhum umhum umhum   and do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail   oh yes   once a week twice a week or three times a week   well its not every week but but you do get them they make it very readily available   umhum yes   almost too much so but i really i really dont like it the charges they you know we try to limit look look at that also what they charge per year   right so the annual fee   for to use our money you know  theyre charging us to spend our money and i im not real crazy about that so we try to look at that also   right right yes so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card   but umhum   plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty three percent   right   uh based upon what the state will allow   um
