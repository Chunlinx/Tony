              yeah i uh i thats kind of a controversial issue here in the nations capitol i think were becoming known as the murder capitol   umhum   and so theres a lot of of emphasize on gun control uh im not exactly sure where i stand because uh i feel that it may be necessary with the crime coming out this way that wed be allowed to have the facilities necessary facilities to protect ourselves   umhum   uh i do know that the District of Columbia has a gun control law and it seems that the number of shootings has gone up since they invoked the law   it oh i see yeah well i   but the the criminals all have guns now   right well they they can get them one way or the other i i think its uh i probably rate it maybe on the scale of one to ten maybe uh seven or eight uh i think well the automatic weapons and these assault weapons and all of these things that uh i think that is something that uh really be limited but like you say if they take uh if they have gun control control then they take away uh the citizens right to protect themselves and we live out in the west where uh of course i have a number of guns and each one of my sons have guns and we go hunting quite a bit for deer and and uh uh pheasants and things like that and uh they impose a gun control law that would really be disastrous i think because because i think the criminals will get guns no matter what   uhhuh   where if we were restricted from having them uh or registering them all so that everybody knows whos got them i i dont feel i think that would really take away from our our uh rights and freedoms as as citizens to to bear arms and protect ourselves if necessary   yeah well we have uh well in Fairfax county its against the law to discharge a firearm   uhhuh   in fact i think its against the law to discharge a bow and arrow   oh my God   uh but the uh they dont have any real strong gun control law   uhhuh   uh whereas just over the border in the District they they have a real strong gun control law Fairfax County is fairly peaceful and uh the District of Columbia is averaging about two murders a day   oh boy yeah that i ive read about that that is really tragic i dont know how you could stop that i it  that would be terrible i mean you you dont even know whether you want to go to Washington DC   yeah well we i fortunately fortunately work out in the suburbs   with uhhuh   and uh i just dont go downtown at night   no   and uh a little bit reluctant to go in the day time   no uhhuh   and thereve been a few occasions uh i can remember a few years back i was downtown and uh toward quitting time i decided since i was there id go visit one of my favorite stores   uhhuh   and it was about six thirty when i left the uh store and i was walking back to my car and boy i tell you i got spooked   uhhuh   uh there were you know people in the alleys making noises at you and   oh wow   people lying around in the park and it was dark and and i i just got scared  i wound up running back to the car   yes you would well i know out here uh apparently theyve kind of uh uh well they  excuse me in the  Utah area they have uh the women i guess the women and doctors they had a uh hostage situation at uh one of Alta View Hospital in Salt Lake City where uh a fellow came in with a gun and he uh killed one of the nurses and and held the hostages uh all night till they finally finally got him but uh so what theyre saying now in the papers that there has been uh uh big increase in nurses and doctors that are buying guns hand guns to protect themselves   yeah   because of this situation that happened and it doesnt happened hasnt happened very often but uh again thats it you hate to to do that but uh were starting to get some gangs uh theyre coming out here and theres been a few shootings drive by shootings and these   yeah weve weve had a lot of uh driveby shootings we have a few people arrested for it going out and shooting just because they felt like killing somebody   yeah   just shooting at random im kind of sorry to hear that that its happening in nice rural Utah because uh   well its its not bad yet but uh theres there it is happened we we we had one of our uh football coaches at one of our high schools in Salt Lake City that uh i guess they were out on the practice field uh last fall and a couple gangs were involved and they shot him in the leg   hm   and uh its it  the police of course are are quite
