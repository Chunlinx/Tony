                                 Willey or Willie                           USAToday and the Washington Post lead with Kathleen Willeys  Minutesinterview The other papers pretend there was something else on The Los AngelesTimes says the days top story is the government of Irans crackdown onoil shipments to Iraq that violate UN sanctions The New York Times even more transparent in its attempt to appear above pack journalism goeswithare you sitting downthe possibility that Republicans could take overall the governors slots of the old Confederacy This is particularly odd inthat the NYT s own frontpage Willey story states that even thepresidents supporters say that if proved true the accusations of perjury andobstruction of justice in the Lewinsky matter could end Clintonspresidency            In her interview Willey gave a pawbypaw description of her encounter withPresident Clinton in a small study off the Oval Office and charged that Clintonlied about it All the papers have Willeys comment that she consideredslapping him but decided not to because I dont think you can slap thepresident of the United States And everybody has Clinton lawyer RobertBennetts comment that his client is absolutely bewildered by Willeysallegations and that there is as yet unreleased information that will undercutthem                           USAT reports that Willey also said during the  Minutes interviewthat she told Linda Tripp about her encounter in the Oval Office Willey saidTripp whose tape recording of conversations with Lewinsky sparked Starrsinvestigation later told her Im going to get you and    everyone elsein this place before this is all over Tripps lawyers deny that she evermade such a statement This passage leaves the reader wondering why Trippsresponse to Willeys report of her Oval Office incident would be anger towardsWilley But whats really going on is that the paper has garbled the Minutes interview In it Willey says that Tripp was angry at her not aboutthe alleged grope but because Willey got a White House jobwhich Trippattributed to Clintons interest in Willey while Tripp lost hers            In its lead the WP gets this right The Post also points outthat in some ways Willey could be a more troublesome witness for Clinton thanthe other women alleging sexual harassment because Willey was originallyunwilling to tell her story her accusation is of a nonconsensual act and sheis hardly a Clintonhating member of the vast rightwing conspiracy HillaryClinton cited having worked to get Clinton elected                           USAT quotes the president of NOW Patricia Ireland as saying Itsnot just sexual harassment If its true its sexual assault The WPhas this too but in addition notes the significance of the remark its abreak with the generally complacent attitude most feminists have maintainedtoward the Clinton sex scandals Up till now their motto has been The devilyou know is better thanTrent Lott Also USAT decides to leave outthe rest of the Ireland quote which the WP includes He put his handon her breast he put her hand on his erection That is a pretty serious chargeif true and it is a very big problem The NYT  in its front page storyalso makes the point about the significance of Irelands remark but cuts herquote just where USAT does The LAT goes the other way a littlebit saying that Willey claims Clinton fondled her breasts and placed herhand on his crotch even though Willey didnt use either of the words inquotes            In a wise departure from standard newspaper practice the Postdoesnt clean up Willeys quotes so that its report communicates a good dealof the emotion of the televised interview And then he then he then hekissed me on on my mouth and and pulled me closer to him And I rememberthinking I just remember thinking What in the world is he doing  And II pushed back away from him andhe he he he hes a big man And he he hadhis arms they were tight around me and he he touched meHe touched mybreasts with his hand and I I I I was I I was just startled            There is a dangling thread from the interview that none of the papers tugsat Willey says that one of the first people she saw after she got away fromthe president was thenSecretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen Why doesntsome enterprising reporter go ask Bentsen what his impression of Willeysdemeanor was            The LAT s Willey story says that in Clintons Jones case depositionhe acknowledged embracing Willey and perhaps kissing her on the forehead Hesaid he has engaged in similar displays of affection with scores and scores ofmen and women who have worked for me or been my friends over the years Maybeits time some of those men Bill Clinton has kissed on the forehead cameforward to support their president
