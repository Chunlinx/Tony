years This he said is one of the luckiest breaksthat Bill Clinton and Tony Blair ever had even in their amazingly luckycareers Kaletsky wrote Nobody seems to believe any longer that markets workbest if businesses are simply left to their own devices or that capitalism canavoid booms and busts without active government intervention  In short theThird Way faith in smart government seems to have triumphed completely overthe ThatcherReagan doctrine that government is the problem and market forcesthe solution            In an analysis of Blairsnew internationalism on its editorial page Le Monde

another wasuncertainty about its geographical extension should its writ run outsideEurope another the tendency of American messianism to mask egotisticnationalist policies and yet another the clash of
