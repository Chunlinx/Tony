                                 Hack Work Pandering and Omissions                        Dear David            I would not see myself as being easy on Henry Louis Gates Jr There arethose who frankly think him fraudulent some of whom are very prominent peopleI think this might be a bit unfair What I find fascinating about him is notthe work which may or may not be remembered in years to come but rather thedriving ambition so directed at what seems to me to be small causes writ largeby advertising and the sheer claims he can make for them In this regard he isan incredible intellectual figure and an incredible public presence I think itis a waste of time for a major scholar to create an encyclopedia despite theefforts of Diderot and Du Bois in the past I think it is a waste of time for amajor scholar to do such hack work today even if one could make a great dealof money doing it It is this obsession which far exceeds anything I have everencountered in any scholar and scholars and intellectuals have no little egoand no little ambition this need to have his fingerprints everywhere that Ifind curious but that I also think ultimately for Gates is destructive of thevery end he probably wants to achieve He wants I assume to be takenseriously but is he in the end And will he be  or  years from now            Yes I do agree that he has taken advantage of the practice that whites haveof wanting one prominent Negro at a time in a field He is a very shrewd manand I cannot blame him for taking the world as it has been given to him Whitesfind him agreeable for the two reasons that they find any black intellectualagreeable he makes what he knows about Negroes interesting but notthreatening he knows a great deal of white intellectual stuff which whitesalways find amusing and entertaining in a Negro But while he is a singularblack intellectual figure his position is simply to some large degree thatof any hustling black intellectual who knows that the rewards worth having inthis culture for his professional pursuits are all controlled by whites            Now your comments about the politically correct nature of Africanaare right and point up one of the serious flaws with this book It is far tootrendy almost whimsically so to be of great value to any reader say five orsix years from now This book aspires to be not only an encyclopedia but alsoan almanac a biographical dictionary a historical monument in and of itselfHere is an intellectual effort that is greatly compromised by antiintellectualforces of compelling strength the need to give emphasis to homosexuality allout of proportion to its importance in black life the need to mention peoplesuch as rappers like Tupac Shakur and the like when the art and significance ofsuch people remain to be proved worthy of attention the need for personalitiesgenerally like Rupaul whose inclusion is an embarrassment Then there are thethoughtclichs such as the inclusion of Cleopatra even though all the crediblescholarship shows that it was extremely unlikely that she was of Africandescent            It is this sort of pandering to the popular and to notions that many blackpeople hold dear even though they are wrong that works against this book andagainst black intellectual efforts generally That is because in the end theblack intellectual finds him or herself engaged in a propagandistic defense ofthe race instead of a true objective exploration of the meaning of the racesexperience good bad and indifferent This makes the black intellectual notonly a propagandist but also an apologist at times of the most hypocriticalsort blowing up trivialities while ignoring profundities because of theirambiguous nature all the while operating with the urges of a philanthropistdiscarding merit in the name of equality of space or for educating the publicin favor of a good cause This more than anything makes the publicintellectual black or white fraudulent dangerous in both his or her snobberyand his or her political moralism And this has particularly sapped the vigorand strength of the black intellectual his or her incisiveness swallowed in asea of bathetic race promoting It is telling indeed about theantiintellectual nature of this book that the blurbs on the back do not comefrom intellectuals or scholars at all but from popular black personalities andpartisans for causes Nothing corrupts good intellectual work more thoroughlythat the righteous malice of a cause            I do not particularly like to engage what is not in a book but of courseit cannot be avoided in this sort of work as its scheme is meant to make astatement about what is important about the black experience and what isnt Toignore people like Shelby Steele Stanley Crouch Ward Connerly Glenn LouryAnne Wortham and Thomas Sowell is irresponsible They deserve to beobjectively presented whether one agrees with their positions or not But thereare other absences here that given the pc nature of the work are verysurprising There are no entries on Hamza ElDin or Ahmed AbdulMalik the twomost famous Sudanese musicians ever to play in America AdbulMalik played withMonk for instance Hamza ElDin has made the oud famous in America as RaviShankar did the sitar Since the book is trying so hard to promote a globalblack culture and world music whatever that is their omission is justbewildering There is no entry for Curt Flood How can the man who challengedbaseballs reserve clause in courtwho gave up his career as a professionalbaseball player in  rather than submit to going to a team for whom he didnot wish to play Philadelphiahow can such mighty resistance which thisbook and all black political correctness greatly prizes be ignored CurtFlood was probably second only to Jackie Robinson as the most importantpolitical figure in  th century baseball Yet nothing on him inthis book His omission outraged me Snoop Doggy Dog or Nikki Giovanni or QueenLatifah are more important than Flood            This brings me to the entries that are connected in some way or another toPhiladelphia I was heartened to see entries for Raymond Pace Alexander and hiswife Sadie Mossell Alexander I was disappointed that there was no entry forWilson Goode the first black mayor of Philadelphia or for Dick Allen thefirst black superstar baseball player for the Phillies who was traded to StLouis in the deal that was to bring Curt Flood to Philadelphia the deal thatFlood used as a pretext for challenging the reserve clause So Allen wasimportant in several ways but not to have him in the book was understandableWhat was less understandable was the absence of Cecil Moore Indeed theAlexanders as black leaders in Philadelphia cannot be understood withoutCecil Moore the fiery exMarine who became the head of Philadelphias NAACP in and proceeded to turn the city upsidedown with his militant protests TheAlexanders middleclass black leaders who were uncomfortable with streetprotest detested Moore Indeed most of Philadelphias black leadership didAlso the entries on the Alexanders did not mention her role as the presidentof the Human Relations Commission a city organization that was started whenthe reform Democrats swept the Republicans out of power in the city in  andchanged the city charter The Human Relations Commission was very important inthe history of race relations in the city in the s and s although itwas a group without strong enforcement abilities It was not mentioned inRaymond Pace Alexanders piece how he worked in the s to try to desegregateGirard College he failed and how he tried to get the Mummers in their annualparade to stop using blackface makeup he failed there too In the entry onPhiladelphia itself there is no mention of the  riot that changed the citydramatically No mention in the Chubby Checker entry that his marriage to awhite woman Kathrina Lodders a Dutch woman in December  adverselyaffected his career            I mention all of this to say that to me as a Philadelphian what is saidcollectively about Philadelphia in the book is not terribly useful And that isprecisely the problem with these sorts of catchall books with entries oftenwritten as hack work by writers who are not terribly familiar with the subjectThe writers try to emphasize what makes the person a national figure withoutconcentrating very much on the local context of the persons importance whichis often far more valuable and meaningful to understanding the personshistorical standing than what can be said about the person as a nationalfigure This I find enormously frustrating about a book like Africana This is why I am puzzled that a man of Gates abilities wants to do suchunsatisfying and such compromised intellectual work as this Africana isa very selfconscious monument But to what            Gerald Early
