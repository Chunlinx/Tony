                    Background        Abnormal anterior segment development is often        associated with elevated intraocular pressure IOP an        important risk factor for the blinding disease glaucoma          The anterior segment of the eye is filled with a clear        fluid known as the aqueous humor or aqueous Maintenance of        IOP is dependent on a balance between aqueous formation and        aqueous outflow The primary source of aqueous is blood        flowing through the arteries of the ciliary body   The        aqueous is secreted by the ciliary body into the posterior        chamber between the iris and lens It then flows into the        anterior chamber the space between the cornea and iris        before draining from the eye at the iridocorneal junction          The iridocorneal junction is located in a region known        as the iridocorneal angle because of the aqueous filled        angular recess between the iris root and cornea One        drainage route consists of a trabecular meshwork TM of        connective tissue covered by endothelial like trabecular        cells and a Schlemms canal SC The aqueous percolates        through channels or intertrabecular spaces in the TM before        entering SC The fluid collected by SC drains into aqueous        veins that connect to the canal This route is generally        accepted to be the major drainage pathway for the aqueous          Egress via the loose connective tissue meshwork and        blood vessels of the uvea choroid iris and ciliary body        and the outer wall of the eye sclera also contributes to        aqueous drainage    Primary access of aqueous to the        uveoscleral route is likely deep in the angle recess at the        iridocorneal junction The resistance to aqueous flow        presented by the tissues of the TM SC and likely uvea and        sclera are important determinants of the rate of aqueous        outflow and IOP        The molecular mechanisms responsible for normal or        abnormal development of the iridocorneal angle its        structures and increased resistance to aqueous drainage in        glaucoma are not well defined Cell migration        proliferation and differentiation are important for the        development of this ocular region Cells of the periocular        mesenchyme migrate into the developing eye and        differentiate into various anterior segment structures        including components of the ciliary body the TM iris        stroma corneal endothelium and corneal stroma The origin        of the periocular mesenchyme was originally suggested to be        the paraxial mesoderm   Later fate mapping studies        using quailchick chimeras show extensive cranial neural        crest contribution to this tissue    Based on these        avian studies the mammalian periocular mesenchyme is        generally accepted as neural crest derived    Recent        cell grafting and cell labeling studies of craniofacial        morphogenesis in mouse embryos confirm a neural crest        derivation of the mammalian periocular mesenchyme          Additionally however they demonstrate the presence of        cranial paraxial mesodermderived cells in this tissue        Thus aberrations of both neural crest and mesoderm cell        migration or differentiation may contribute to anterior        segment dysgenesis and glaucoma        After the migrating mesenchymal cells reach the anterior        margin of the developing optic cup they must form the        tissues of the iridocorneal angle The iridocorneal angle        is initially occupied by a densely packed mass of        mesenchymal cells As TM development proceeds the cellular        mass differentiates organizes and develops channels to        produce the mature meshwork The developing TM and iris        separate forming the deep angle recess through which the        aqueous passes to access the TM The mature meshwork        consists of trabecular beams separated by intertrabecular        spaces through which the aqueous percolates The trabecular        beams are covered on both surfaces by endotheliallike        trabecular cells and the cores of the beams are composed of        extracellular matrix components such as collagen and        elastic tissue          How the complex TM develops and how spaces form in the        initially continuous cellular tissue is not clear Several        theories have attempted to explain the differentiation and        morphogenesis of the mesenchyme that forms the tissues of        the iridocorneal angle see               Some of these theories propose atrophy or resorption of the        mesenchyme as development progresses to create the        structures and spaces important for aqueous drainage while        others propose a reorganization of cells with no cell death        or atrophy Whether cell death or atrophy occurs during TM        and iridocorneal angle development remains controversial        Cell death was prominent in rat but not in monkey human        or dog eyes       It is not clear if        different mechanisms are important in rodents as compared        to these other species if there is something unusual about        the studied rat strain or if cell death occurs in the        other species but was not detected due to inadequate tissue        sampling or the stages analyzed        The mouse represents an important experimental model for        understanding mammalian development and diseases caused by        its abnormalities In studied mammalian species        iridocorneal angle development is incomplete at birth        Although various studies have characterized in detail the        prenatal development of the mouse eye there is very little        published about the normal structure or postnatal        development of the mouse iridocorneal angle               The aims of this work were to determine the        developmental profile of the mouse iridocorneal angle to        its mature form and to assess the role of cell death in        modeling the angle recess and TM We present a light and        electron microscopic EM evaluation of iridocorneal angle        development in staged embryos and through eight postnatal        weeks when the angle structures have reached full        maturity The mouse and human TM and SC have similar        structures and the developmental progression is similar        except for the accelerated time frame in mice Extensive        use of light microscopy EM and a cell death assay on        sections spanning complete eyes failed to identify cell        death at all tested ages in various mouse strains These        results substantiate models of iridocorneal angle        mesenchymal differentiation and modeling that involve        organization of cellular and extracellular matrix        components without cell death or atrophy and they suggest        a conservation of developmental mechanisms between mice and        nonrodent mammals                    Results                  Prenatal development          This study of the prenatal development of the CBLJ          iridocorneal angle essentially agrees with published          reports of general ocular development for the strains          CFIS   and HaCR   Due to these previous          reports we will focus on the formation of the          iridocorneal angle structures see figure Afor location          with brief mention of the adjacent iris and cornea          Invagination of the optic vesicle to form the optic cup          occurs around E as the lens vesicle is developing            Shortly after the stalk of the lens vesicle          disappears at E a few undifferentiated mesenchymal          cells were present adjacent to the anterior margin of the          optic cup These were more prominent by E and were          associated with blood vessels Figure B that become the          source of the anterior vascular tunic of the lens as well          as contributing to the future vascular supply of the iris          and ciliary body At this time progenitor cells of the          corneal stroma had migrated into the developing cornea          not shown By E the anterior margin of the optic          cup that ultimately forms the iris and ciliary body has          started to advance indicating that the anterior uvea and          iridocorneal angle were starting to form The mesenchyme          in the developing iridocorneal angle angle mesenchyme          had produced a loosely arranged cluster of cells that was          several cells thick and extended from the anterior edge          of the optic cup to the anterior termination of the          retina These cells were characterized by plump oval          nuclei with multiple nucleoli There was no clear          division between the mesenchyme of the posterior corneal          surface and the angle mesenchyme because the cells          remained undifferentiated Figure C By E the          anterior margin of the optic cup had extended more          anteriorly but no obvious differentiation into the iris          and ciliary body had occurred The angle mesenchyme was          more densely packed and continuous with the mesenchyme          extending onto the primitive iris that will become the          iris stroma Figure D There was a clear separation          between the developing iris and cornea the first          appearance of the iridocorneal angle recess Figure D          There were no obvious differences between E and E          except that the ciliary body had started to form as          previously reported                            Postnatal development          At birth P  dpc the angle mesenchyme was even          more densely packed and the cells and their nuclei were          more elongated and less rounded than at earlier stages          Figure E The iris was more differentiated as          evidenced by the fact that some of the cells destined to          form the stroma had started to synthesize pigment and          were therefore distinguishable from those of the future          TM The iris and ciliary body became separate as the          ciliary processes continued to form Figure E          The specialized basal lamina of the corneal          endothelium Descemets membrane was first evident at P          to P By P the iris and ciliary body were well          developed Pigmented cells and blood vessels were clearly          evident in the iris stroma and the ciliary processes were          elongated and more numerous Figure F The future          location of the TM was clearly indicated by an          aggregation of cells with densely stained plump fusiform          nuclei that separated the developing ciliary body from          the cornea Figure F          The angle mesenchyme extended from the termination of          Descemets membrane to the posterior termination of the          ciliary body by P These cells were less densely packed          than at earlier stages Figure G Although not          definitively identified in our P sections at some          locations there appeared to be small vascular channels          present near the developing TM The ciliary processes and          iris had an apparently mature structure by P By this          age the anterior cells of the future TM had begun to          separate although the posterior cells remained closely          packed Figure H The first clear indications of          Schlemms canal next to the developing TM were observed          on P as multiple small endotheliallined channels          located in the inner sclera over the posterior aspect of          the ciliary body although this was best seen using          transmission EM see below The presence or absence of          these endothelial channels at this location varied with          ocular region The anterior TM had started to separate          focally from the iris at P and this was more extensive          at P The angle mesenchyme had further developed into          beam like structures by P and though small more open          spaces were apparent Figure I At P either          endotheliallined vessels or a more mature SC were          present in most sections          By P further spaces had opened in the angle          especially anteriorly and for the first time there was a          consistent separation between the anterior TM and iris          root forming the deep angle recess Figure A At this          age a SC that extended from the posterior end of the          ciliary body to a point slightly posterior to the end of          Descemets membrane was consistently observed in all          ocular regions Additionally the separation of the iris          away from the TM gave the appearance that SC and TM moved          anteriorly Giant vacuoles structures important for          aqueous movement from the TM to canal lumen were clearly          observed indicating that SC was functional at P Figure          A By three weeks of age SC had extended forward to          the posterior termination of Descemets membrane and          large open spaces were present in the anterior TM Fewer          spaces were evident in the posterior TM Figure B Over          the next few weeks the spaces between the trabecular          beams gradually became more open and extended further          into the posterior TM Depending on the mouse and ocular          location the iridocorneal angle and its structures          typically reached their mature state by P to P          compare Figure Cand D In the mature state the          intertrabecular spaces were always most prominent in the          anterior aspect of the TM and less so posteriorly          Figure Cand D                          Other strains          The postnatal developmental stages and time frame          described above for B mice is essentially the same as          that we observed for the ABYSnJ strain not shown          There were no major differences in mature angle structure          between mice of different backgrounds and the anterior          to posterior TM differences described for B were evident          in all strains Figure EH The biggest difference          between the studied backgrounds was a consistently more          robust ciliary muscle in the BS mice                          Electron microscopy          To further understand iridocorneal angle development          we analyzed stages involving significant changes in the          TM and SC using EM Ultrastructural evaluation          demonstrated that differentiation of the TM was well          underway by P Trabecular beams were recognizable but          not fully developed The separation of individual          trabecular beams had begun and extracellular matrix          deposition was evident While present trabecular beam          collagen was less abundant than in the mature eye while          elastic tissue was relatively more abundant compare          Figure Dand Eto Figure Fand G The trabecular beams          were more separated in the anterior than posterior TM          The presence of SC or its precursors varied with section          level at P At some locations there were no traces of          SC Figure A whereas at others it was relatively well          formed with a thin endothelial lining Figure B No          giant vacuoles were observed at this age At other levels          of section the early SC had a more primitive vascular          appearance Figure C consistent with its likely          derivation from coalescing venules          At P spaces between the trabecular beams in the          anterior TM were typically more prominent than at P          The posterior TM remained relatively compressed compared          to the anterior TM with smaller intertrabecular spaces          Figure A B The extracellular matrix was more          prominent than at P compare Figure Ato Figure A A          well developed endotheliallined SC was consistently          present at all levels Figure B although giant          vacuoles were relatively infrequent compared to older          ages By P the intertrabecular spaces had enlarged to          adult size even in some regions of the posterior TM and          giant vacuoles were abundant Figure C Smooth muscle          cells Figure D located near the inner wall of SC close          to its posterior termination were first noted at P The          major developmental changes had occurred by P with          subsequent maturation primarily involving final          enlargement of spaces in the posterior TM          In adult mice SC was lined with attenuated          endothelial cells and at low power several giant vacuoles          were always present Figure E Giant vacuoles were          evenly distributed along the entire length of Schlemms          canal There were  trabecular beams in the anterior          meshwork and  in the posterior meshwork In the          posterior adult meshwork the extracellular matrix was          more prominent and the intertrabecular spaces were          smaller than anteriorly Figure F G                          Absence of cell death in angle development          Review of many sections examined by light microscopy          did not identify dead or pyknotic cells at any age from          PO to adult Similar review of many sections by EM failed          to demonstrate any cells that had necrotic or apoptotic          morphology This was true for multiple mouse strains see          Methods It is probable that all normal cell death          during development utilizes pathways of programmed cell          death PCD   To further investigate if cell death          occurred in the developing iridocorneal angle we used a          fluorescent double labeling assay that identifies          fragmented DNA using fluorescently labeled dUTP and          detects chromatin condensation by binding of the dye          YOYO Cells were identified as apoptotic only when they          were doubly labeled Figure  This assay is more          sensitive than light microscopy and allows more          widespread testing than EM As shown above TM channel          formation has started at P and is mostly complete          around P to P with subtle changes extending to P          to P Our assay investigated tissues that spanned most          of this period see Methods including four time points          in the critical period surrounding P to P P P          P and P The majority of the angle was assessed by          analyzing many sections that were obtained at  m          intervals throughout the eye During differentiation from          the trabecular anlage to a mature state only  doubly          labeled cells were identified in the angles of          approximately  analyzed sections or approximately           analyzed TM and SC cells One of these positive          cells was located in the lumen of Schlemms canal and was          likely a blood cell No apoptotic cells were detected in          the ciliary body and iris In contrast apoptotic retinal          ganglion cells Figure  were frequently identified          often  or more apoptotic cells in a section during the          established period of developmental ganglion cell death          assessed between P and P and less abundantly          afterwards Testis sections served as additional positive          controls with each batch of processed slides and          abundant apoptotic cells were always detected          As a final assessment of a role for cell death          pathways we determined whether absence of the FAS and          FASL initiators of cell death alter iridocorneal angle          development and morphology           Fas and           FasL are expressed in the TM and a          FASstimulating monoclonal antibody causes PCD of TM          cells    We assessed five mice of each of the          mutant strains BMRL           Fas           lpr and BSmnCH           Fasl           gld  which respectively lack          functional FAS and FASL The eyes of mice lacking          functional FAS or FASL were similar in appearance to eyes          from agematched B mice not shown This indicates that          these proapoptotic molecules are not required for normal          iridocorneal angle development                            Discussion                  Sequence and timing of iridocorneal angle          morphogenesis          In this study we describe the morphogenesis of the          mouse iridocorneal angle from prenatal stages to          maturity Our findings extend those of previous studies          that did not focus on the iridocorneal angle or did not          study its development to maturity                The sequence and timing of morphogenic events in the          CBLJ and ABYSnJ mouse strains is summarized in          Figure  and is similar to that for rats   The          sequence also is similar in humans The major difference          is the age at which specific developmental stages occur          beginning prenatally but extending to around P in mice          and possibly to  postnatal years in humans                      Briefly in mice migrating mesenchyme begins to fill          the space between the anterior edge of the optic cup the          surface ectoderm and the lens vesicle at E to E          Anlage formation appears complete by P to P Cell          differentiation within the anlage has started by P          Trabecular beams are recognizable but not fully developed          at P SC is first evident around P and appears          structurally mature around P Although SC is functional          at this age giant vacuoles are rare By P to P the          major developmental changes have occurred and          intertrabecular spaces have enlarged to adult size in the          anterior TM and some parts of the posterior TM Giant          vacuoles become more abundant as spaces between the          trabecular beams increase and are abundant at P to P          After PP maturation primarily involves enlargement          of spaces in the posterior TM                          Participation of cell death in iridocorneal angle          morphogenesis is controversial          Different theories on the mechanisms of morphogenesis          of the angle mesenchyme to the complex tissues of the          mature angle have been reviewed elsewhere                 Important mechanisms that participate in          complex tissue formation include proliferation and          differentiation of cells differential growth rates of          cells modulation of the extracellular matrix and cell          death Although there is evidence for a role of most of          these processes in iridocorneal angle development and          intertrabecular space opening see   the role of          cell death or atrophy is controversial          In Sprague Dawley SD rats dying cells were readily          identified from P to P average of  to  dying          cells per section and less abundantly at older adult          ages  to  per section at P   This time frame          encompasses the period of mesenchymal differentiation and          channel formation in the rat angle P to P Due to          this and the fact that dying cells were identified in the          TM iris iris root and ciliary body it was proposed          that cell death may serve to open the deep angle recess          and to create spaces in the TM and uveoscleral outflow          routes The dying cells were frequently associated with          macrophages An established function of macrophages is          the engulfment of cellular debris Macrophages also can          elicit cell death in normal development see   In          the developing eye macrophages are required to induce          death of vascular endothelial cells during programmed          capillary regression Disruption of macrophage function          prevents endothelial cell death and results in abnormal          persistence of the capillary networks known as the          pupillary membrane and hyaloid vasculature             Together these observations suggest that macrophage          induced cell death may be important in angle          morphogenesis          By contrast to the rat study trabecular cell death          was not observed or was rare in the developing human          monkey and dog TM       even though          small numbers of macrophages were present in some of          these studies In one human study that considered total          cell numbers as opposed to cell density the total          number of cells increased as the TM matured Macrophages          were reported in the developing mouse B anterior          chamber and a model of TM development including cell          death was proposed but no cell death was recorded            The reason for these differing results is still unclear          and may reflect factors such as the age of tissue sampled          or the amount of tissue available for study                          No evidence for cell death during mouse angle          development          We report here an extensive study of mouse eyes Light          microscopy failed to detect cell death in the developing          TM of B and ABYSnJ mice Dying cells were not detected          in the angle of mice of an additional  inbred strains          and  mixed genetic backgrounds at ages up to P No          cells with the characteristic morphologic changes of          apoptosis or necrosis were observed by EM    in          mice of strain B or of  other inbred strains and           mixed genetic backgrounds at ages up to P Similarly          only  apoptotic cells were detected in the developing          SC TM iris and ciliary body of B eyes using a cell          death assay on sections collected throughout entire eyes          In contrast apoptotic cells were frequently identified          in the developing retinas on the same sections          Importantly the great majority of TM channel formation          occurs during an  to  day period surrounding P to          P Our EM and fluorescent PCD assays included three          P P and P and four P P P and P time          points respectively during this critical period Although          rare cases of cell death may be missed the absence of          cell death in approximately  analyzed sections          provides no evidence for a role of cell death in angle          morphogenesis Finally development of the angle in           Fas and           Fasl null mice was normal          indicating this system of cell death regulators that can          kill TM cells   is not required for TM channel          formation Based on these observations we conclude that          neither apoptosis nor necrosis are important mechanisms          in development of the mouse TM and iridocorneal angle          Our data together with the rare occurrence of cell death          in studies of various mammalian species including humans          suggests that this is true for mammals in general                          Possible explanations for conflicting results          between various studies          The absence of macrophages in the developing TM of          mice in the current study is in conflict to a previous          study That study reported macrophages on the corneal          endothelium on the iris surface and in the TM at P          through P   The abundance of TM macrophages was          not reported but the statement that they were observed in          favorable sections suggests that they were not common          Macrophage mediated regression of the pupillary membrane          occurs between P and P in mice    In the          current investigation we observed macrophages in the          anterior chamber between the iris and cornea and          associated with the pupillary membrane between P and          P Thus we suggest that the macrophages previously          reported in TM of mice and possibly some other species          were involved in the process of pupillary membrane          regression and were sometimes deposited in the TM but          were not significant for TM development That TM cell          death was not recorded in both studies supports this          The demonstration of cell death in a SD strain of rats          has fueled the debate about mechanisms of iridocorneal          angle development   This report disagrees with our          findings in mice and warrants further discussion In this          rat strain conspicuous numbers of macrophages were noted          associated with dying cells in the iris ciliary body and          TM Given the similarities in developmental stages          between both B and ABYSnJ mouse strains and humans          and the similar timing and progression of angle          development in mice and rats it seems unlikely that          mechanisms of angle morphogenesis would differ between          mice and rats It is therefore difficult to reconcile          the frequent cell death in the developing and adult          iridocorneal angle of an SD rat strain with the absence          of cell death in multiple mouse strains in the current          study Although structural features and not morphogenesis          were the focus of other rat studies cell death was not          reported in an EM analysis of the adult TM of Swiss          albino rats or of the adult angle of an unspecified          strain of pigmented lab rats    These findings          suggest that the SD rat strain may have atypical or          excessive intraocular macrophage recruitment formation          stimulation or persistence that may explain the          macrophage abundance and cell death Spontaneous axonal          regeneration was recently reported in the transected          optic nerve of adult SD rats   This was unexpected          because in contrast to peripheral nerves axons of the          adult mammalian central nervous system typically fail to          regenerate following injury Regeneration is a complex          and poorly understood process in which macrophages are          known to be important Addition of appropriately          stimulated macrophages can induce a peripheral nervelike          regenerative response in the damaged rat optic nerve              Although the spontaneous axonal regeneration          in SD rats is consistent with atypical macrophage          activity further experiments are needed to test          this                            Conclusions        Our results support a model of mesenchymal        differentiation and iridocorneal angle development that        involves reorganization of cellular and extracellular        matrix components without cell death or atrophy The use of        genetically different mouse strains indicates that the        absence of cell death is typical in mice and not unique to        an individual strain The lack of cell death similar        developmental profile and similarities in mature angle        structure in both humans and mice suggests a conservation        of general developmental mechanisms between mice and        nonrodent mammals For general anterior segment        development this is supported by the observations that        genetic deficiency of transcription factors such as PAX        PITX FOXC    and LMXB that are expressed in the        periocular mesenchyme results in anterior segment        dysgenesis in both humans and mice                  In general however previous mouse        studies have not examined the effects of mutations on the        TM and SC This is partly due to limited documentation of        the sequence of events underlying iridocorneal angle        development and limited documentation of the mature angle        structures in mice The current study provides important        baseline information for mechanistic studies of angle        development in the existing mouse models of anterior        segment dysgenesis Additionally it will facilitate        experiments with mutant mice to determine how newly        identified genes function in angle development and how the        pathways in which they participate overlap or interact with        each other These experiments will enhance understanding of        the developmental processes involved in anterior segment        formation and glaucomas associated with anterior segment        dysgenesis                    Materials and Methods                  Light microscopy          At least three mice CBLJ B were evaluated for          each postnatal time period newborn P                     and P Adult B mice ranging          from P to  months and prenatal B stages E to          E were also examined Additionally progressive          developmental stages in the strain ABYSnJ were          evaluated P       and P with  to           mice at each age ABYSnJ were normal mice derived from          the ABYSnJ           corn strain At least  mice  to           weeks old were used for each of the following strains          or mixed backgrounds DBAJ BALBcByJ PJ former          name J SvEvTac SvBF PBF and BS          SvEvTac X Black Swiss F Four week old DBAJ          and SBLe mice also were studied To determine if absence          of the cell death mediators FAS and FASL alter          iridocorneal angle development and morphology we          assessed five mice approximately P of each of the          mutant strains BMRL           Fas           lpr and BSmnCH           Fasl           gld  which respectively lack          functional FAS and FASL               For stages E through P whole heads were fixed in          Bouins solution paraffin embedded and sectioned at  m          thickness Eyes from mice of ages P and older were fixed          with a glutaraldehydeparaformaldehyde solution            plastic embedded sectioned at  m thickness and          stained with hematoxylin and eosin For both paraffin and          plasticembedded B eyes  to  sections were          collected from each of  different ocular locations          using the lens as a landmark resulting in  to           sections per eye Collected regions included the lens          periphery central lens and a region halfway between the          center of the lens and the lens periphery Iridocorneal          angle development is somewhat variable both temporally          and spatially within a single eye and between eyes This          necessitated careful scanning of all sections The eyes          of other strains were processed identically except that           to  sections through the pupil and optic nerve were          typically collected and analyzed This also was true for          some of the adult eyes from B mice that were P or          older Developmental changes had to be consistently          present in multiple sections from the same region to be          regarded as real and conclusions were drawn only from          high quality sections This approach guarded against the          potential for distortion artifacts in the delicate          tissues analyzed                          Electron microscopy          To assess developmental stages and to check for cell          death we studied eyes from three or more B mice at P              and P from  DBAJ and  SBLE mice          at  weeks of age and from at least two  to  week old          DBAJ BALBcJ PJ SvEvTac BF and BS          mice Eyes were processed as previously described            Tissue blocks from  to  different locations around the          eye were sectioned and analyzed for each eye                          Fluorescent programmed cell death PCD          assays          B eyes at P      and P were          immediately fixed in  paraformaldehyde in  M          phosphate buffer pH  for  hours transferred to           paraformaldehyde in  M phosphate buffer for  hrs          and infiltrated with paraffin Eyes from two different          mice in each age group were sectioned at  m thickness          and sections were collected at  m intervals through          the entire eye except for very peripheral locations that          did not contain iridocorneal angle Depending on the size          of the eye between  and  sections were collected per          eye We analyzed approximately  sections and estimate          that considering all ages there was on average  cells          in each angle region of our sections Thus we analyzed          approximately  developing TM and SC cells           cells X  sections X  angle regions per section A          modified double labeling protocol that involved           in situ endlabeling of fragmented          DNA using BODIPY fluorophores Molecular Probes Eugene          Or and detection of condensed chromatin with the          dimeric cyanine dye YOYO Molecular Probes was used to          analyze all of these sections   Samples were          analyzed with a confocal microscope and cells were          identified as apoptotic only when they were double          labeled The occurrence of PCD was evaluated in the iris          ciliary body and TM
