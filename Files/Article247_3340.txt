                                 Can a New Magazine Survive                        The predicted demise of John Kennedys George and the launch of TinaBrowns Talk raise the question What are a new magazines chances forsurvival            If the magazine is intended to reach a broad generalinterest audience theanswer is not good The total number of magazines published in the UnitedStates has actually soared from  in  to  in  But this isentirely due to specialinterest magazines with names like The Asthmatic DayTrader imaginary or Martha Stewart Living real Even here theodds are against a newcomer More than  new magazines were launched in and half have already foldedmost after one issue In general onlythree out of every  new magazines make it to their fourthanniversaries            Among general interest magazines the only newcomer to survive and thrive isCond Nasts Vanity Fair   InStyle and EntertainmentWeekly  both published by Time Warner might also qualify depending onyour definition of general interest Cond Nast is privately owned soactual financial data are not available But it is widely assumed thatVanity Fair  though making money now is far from recouping its earlylosses Even ultimately successful magazines spend many years and many millionsbefore reaching profitability Unsuccessful magazines spend the money and neverbecome profitable How much money Georges startup costs were said tobe  million Rumors about the cost of launching Talk range up to million            Why Partly for the same sorts of reasons that any new business must spendmoney before it starts coming inhiring employees stocking up on yellownotepads throwing a launch party etcbut mainly because of the cost ofacquiring subscribers You mail out masses of subscription offers ie junkmail and are happy with a  percent to  percent response It can easily cost or more for a glossy monthly to acquire a subscriber who pays  or  ayear Then you are thrilled if half of those renew at the end of a year            Even an unsuccessful magazine can have a large circulation if it is willingto pay enough for subscribers Success comes when you have a high renewal rateand new customers are easy to entice to replace dropouts Then yoursubscriberacquisition costs plummet Even so the average subscriber may costmore to acquire than he or she ever pays But meanwhile your large and loyalaudience entices lots of advertisers At best this takes years            Of course even a moneylosing magazine can always survive indefinitely ifits owner is willing to cover the losses The Weekly Standard  owned byRupert Murdoch has joined the New Republic  the National Review and other older magazines in the tradition of magazines subsidized forpolitical reasons But there is another more amorphous and less acknowledgedtradition of moneylosing magazines kept alive for reasons of general glamourand corporate synergy Talk  coowned by Miramax a division of Disneyand the Hearst Corporation may survive and even thrive in that tradition            And then theres the Internet where there are no postage printing orpaper costs And there are no subscriber acquisition costs either sinceInternet magazines are given away free though Internet magazines do spend somemoney on marketing The theory is that advertiserswho dont seem to mind thelack of paying subscriberseventually will cover the entire cost with a bitleft over for profit So far this remains a theory            Next question
