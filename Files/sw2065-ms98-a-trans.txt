        okay the question was um what what is your opinion of youth uh spending  a year or two in in public service   i think it would be a great idea im not sure about requiring it you know of people because people are going you know feeling resentful i dont know but i think it would be a great idea   yeah   seems like theres so many kids that dont have any since of you know what they want to be or do or you know they could learn  something and maybe help other people at the same time and we sure our country all countries sure need help so     umhum would uh would you be more in favor of uh you know like a local uh my only experience with it i was in Central America for a while and uh in San Salvador in El Salvador for instance everybody had what they called there social year   hum umhum oh really uh   that they that they had to put in and basically it was a uh repayment for for uh high school education   umhum um   and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally i just there was very little external i think possibly what uh theyre thinking about here more external Peace Corps type things where were sending people off shore   yeah well i think that would be real interesting for people to do but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries and   hum   and but i dont know if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldnt be able to really you know send children you know to do that   yeah i dont i dont know how the Peace Corps works i guess i was of age when the Peace Corps came in and all that   i didnt know yeah i was too i thought seriously about joining at that time i thought it was a fantastic idea   did you ever get any information on it like   i sent off for stuff on it but i dont remember that much about it i know that they trained you in the language and um   thats thats what i was wondering about was whether they actually   yeah you actually got paid too while in the Peace Corps it wasnt much but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses were covered   yeah was it yeah wasnt Jimmy Carters mama that was in the Peace Corps or some such thing   yeah i think so yeah yeah but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here and take them to some other country that had different moral values something like Saudi Arabia where they couldnt drink   where they couldnt do that yeah you might end up with a revolution i dont know which end though yeah   really  yeah i hadnt thought about that umhum   yeah yeah thats thats been interesting though the kids that have been over you know coming back right now you know   yeah   you wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them would actually say hey thats not a bad way to do it because from what i understand from some of the guys i know crime uh is punishable just almost uh instantly and   public hangings and yeah   in public yeah  and this sort of thing you know so you dont have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes   yeah yeah ive heard that like in China and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody youd be murdered them  you know on the you know street so yeah   yeah  well i guess thats uh the price of freedom i guess is a little anyway the uh uh the the public service thing again i i i i guess in my own having had the whole three or four minutes to you know give it a great deal of thought here  uh   yeah   i i think i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary but when you do that then it becomes almost uh or it can be   yeah   you know there are people will kind of set up their own little club   yeah thats true   and uh but if you know if you start   the people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that   yeah   might not go if it was voluntary but i dont know how theyd enforce it if it was   yeah well if they went AWOL what are you going to do shoot them put them in jail   yeah i dont know send them over to Iraq  have a vacation in Iraq for a year   yeah yeah yeah right yeah i know my dad always talked about uh he was in uh CCC during uh the depression and he was uh a rock rib Iowa type republican and the only good thing he could ever say about uh the   yeah   the whole Roosevelt administration was uh civilian conservation corps he because he was in it he thought that was great the rest of it was all hog wash but the that was great   umhum yeah well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if its in their own country it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the   umhum   things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way i i it would take quite a few people i think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that so maybe that part of it would be helpful too   umhum yeah   i dont know   yeah the only   id like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and  mow the grass and   well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know what would you have who who who would determine what these people do   yeah yeah   you know if uh you know if its run by the individual state you know like CCC was run by the army and in effect   umhum   and  the only opposition to it really was that it was you know starting starting some sort of a military elitist type you know special corps of cadre of people that sort of thing and uh when the politics get real confusing   umhum umhum yeah really there could be um some uh scandals involved if you know it wasnt people that were really fair and   umhum   leaving it you know in a legal way or something they could send all the people over to uh you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to you know get supported or   yeah well weve weve gotten to the point where you know if if if well   it would be open for   if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know theyd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know all this kind of thing   yeah that could be a complicated too couldnt it yeah   oh yeah suppose uh well you know they they had a group who were construction oriented and they went and they they built uh  cant think of a good example a swimming poo l or anything you know and one you can you can only build it in one place you know and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you didnt build one over here   yeah thats true unfair or something yeah yeah   yeah i think uh   oh boy its one of those things on the surface you know it seems like a great idea its like a joke i heard once about uh elephant foot soup you know its easy to do once you find a elephant foot       its its uh its the logistics of the thing that uh that that gets you going   yeah really yeah well it seems like theres theres a lot you dont hear much on the news about young people really you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that but you know im sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing i just i saw on the news the other night that the uh the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show Kisha Knight Pullman was starting a i guess now shes practically a teenager   yeah   she started some type of um  national um organization for youth to volunteer to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards   umhum   you know helpful things and i know even like in the high schools in Dallas theres a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a um minority you know um i think it was in a Hispanic area they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers instead of they said every all these gangs kids could join to belong   umhum   but they didnt have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know so they were trying to start that out so if theres people out there that are   yeah   willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy gosh we ought to use them you know   yeah   if their willing to do it   yeah its its its just the you know here you to the logistics of the thing again you know who   yeah   whos going to run it you know what how oh its just so many   yeah   yeah well like like i said at the beginning ive got so many connections with people in Central America my daughterinlaw is Panamanian you know and they have situations like like that down there where they   hum umhum   they have these the social in some sort of way if you want to go to school outside the country and many Salvadorians did theyd go to school in Cornell Iowa of all places   huh   and when they came back theyd have to serve this this this year and it turned out to be kind of a joke the ones i knew you know always chose the Red Cross because they didnt do anything   oh i see   and they had all kinds of uh things they could go into agricultural and you know really you know good stuff but uh unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that Red Cross   yeah   it was so many of them in it that at any particular chance your chance of having to do something was very slim it was very slim and so   yeah yeah well we um belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints which is like the nickname the Mormon church   umhum umhum   and um the there is men and also women women arent um nearly as frequent and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission and um theyre all over the world and its it is an incredible logistics i mean they have a training center where they teach them its called the Missionary Training Center in Utah and they have to be taught the language   umhum   customs and all those kinds of things and then they um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months   okay then thats uh kind of  a private   right   organization you know im im familiar with my instructor pilot was a was a Mormon he was because he was a good construction uh you know instructor instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible   oh  he had a direct connection somewhere uh   yeah yeah right he felt that he really had an in so you know he things he would do with an airplane but any rate thats off the subject no i havent seen i havent seen   yeah yeah but see they dont get paid for it and um but there is funding that that comes theyre supposedly saving up on their own and the church helps them out some   you know umhum   but you know that it is incredible you you know   i seen how they were organized in in central and South America and uh its uh   yeah its very involved
