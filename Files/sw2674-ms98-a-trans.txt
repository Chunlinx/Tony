                i know uh that Texas laws are more uh whats the word i want more real i think realistic because they do believe in capital punishment and they do every once in awhile exercise that   thats true   uh were as i said Indianas very conservative and i cannot remember the last time anyone was electrocuted or whatever method they use nowadays to carry out a death sentence   do they have a law on the books up there   they have uh uh you know im just not even aware of what the law is its uh been so long since anyone was executed that it might be legal but its not done   right   my husband would know whether its legal or not but i am not very   so whats your uh opinion on capital punishment   i believe in capital punishment for certain crimes do you   yes uh   uhhuh     theres you know there are some things just that just are inexcusable   right   brutal crimes serial serial serial crimes things like that   uhhuh   um you know to me the punishment doesnt even fit the crime but you cant get any worse   uhhuh they uh  i think to me i think they have to come to that with uh as you say brutal crimes because of the prison system being so crowded that seems like just because you dont have a place to put someone doesnt seem like a very logical reason to kill someone else which of course is what it is but i think it would be a detriment to crime or would be a deterrent to crime because i know someone whos mad isnt going to think well gosh i cant do this or theyll put me away but somehow i think if the punishment doesnt fit the crime the crimes more likely to happen   right i think in a way its unfortunate theyve come up with with nice ways to um execute people i guess to me if if i was a uh potential serial killer or something it wouldnt stop me to be uh to die of lethal injection i mean its as painless as you can go   uhhuh   i mean i think if i was in a bad accident and they gave me the option i might say yeah you know give me an injection but uh   go with it huh you think they should go back to crucifixion then   i dont know about that um but uh you know the electric chair on the other hand is probably a pretty painful way to go i dont know   um   i dont know personally ill never be in that position   well we certainly hope not   so but i dont i think it should be something that is that is a deterrent thats something that that thats scary and its something thats going to make you make you be afraid to uh afraid of the consequences   do you think uh you know uh lately theyve had oh in the last few years theyve had some cases where women have killed abusive husbands do you think that they should be faced with the death penalty      depends on the nature of the abuse and i really dont uh you know that thats its something thats got to be evaluated on an individual case you know because   uhhuh   theres theres really no excuse for abuse but then there are other options there are ways to get out   it does happen though doesnt it   yeah i mean there you would hope but i guess its really a its easy to say but uh youd hope that someone in that situation would you know get out there are enough support groups enough you know over the century over the last decade or so anyway theres been   uhhuh   you know you dont have to kill your uh kill your husband because hes beating you up all the time you can can leave and have support its not like youd be stuck on the streets   yeah even in our small town of five thousand we now have a crisis center and its been in existence for five years so even in this area where you would think there might not be the help uh there is help for women who are abused or children who are abused or whatever uh i cant imagine uh a mother standing by and watching something destructive happen to her children but i have a friend whos is a school teacher and she has a nine year old girl in her room who is suffering abuse and the mother is aware of it and is not protecting the child which just makes your skin crawl to even think about it but   this is almost as much of a crime and i guess and i guess i dont know its to me its almost as much of a crime to just let it go   yes yes shes as guilty as he is   and i think i guess it gets back to if if if a woman kills her husband because hes been brutalizing her or her children theres maybe more of a reason and its not an irrational you know just a brutal crime for the sake of just i dont know without a conscience or something like like some of these   uhhuh uhhuh   thats kind of what i think what capital punishment should be for is you know somebody thats just you know missing something upstairs or just goes out and you know rapes and brutalizes a woman and turns around and does it again   uhhuh   and its like theres just no excuse you theres no reason i should pay for this person to spend the rest of his life in in prison   so you think our our uh values have to come down to dollars and cents     no but i dont think uh i dont think its right for somebody to uh for me to to uh pay for something i mean the way the way it is right now the prisons are overcrowded   yes   and were giving people that arent going to change were just were just housing them until they die   uhhuh   and if theyve you know caused as much pain and suffering as they have for for no reason and theyre going to do it again if they get the chance   uhhuh   it just just doesnt seem uh   i guess the most frightening thing to me uh youre probably young enough that youve not aware of the Richard Speck case uh it happened in uh the Chicago area but it was certainly broadcast nationwide he broke into this uh complex uh apartment complex and killed these seven nurses and every once in awhile you know one of them did survive she crawled under a bed and he missed her somehow and she did survive and she did identify him and there is no doubt that this is the man who did that and every once in awhile he comes up for parole and its scary to think that some board is sitting there trying to decide whether he is   right   rehabilitated to the point that he can go back out in society when these young twenty twenty two twenty three year old nurses are all dead it just doesnt seem he should i think have made that his life should have been sacrificed for what he took as you say the punishment has to fit the crime doesnt it   uh its just like uh back in California the Charles Manson thing   uhhuh   and of course hell never i dont think hell ever get out on parole just because it was so well publicized   uhhuh      but uh you know he comes up every so often   uhhuh or Sirhan Sirhan and   right   yeah of course also believe in deportation but thats another subject isnt it   maybe they ought to have an island out in the middle of the ocean we can drop them all off   take them back to Australia the way the English used to do   yeah  Australia might not care for that these days   i see theyve gotten a little narrowminded about things like that   on an island so far away theres no chance they can ever get off   yeah nice talking to you byebye   yes       alrighty bye
