                                 The InternetStock Bubble            The stock market iscertainly reacting faster than ever to the slightest hint of good or bad newsWhether this means the stock market is more efficient than ever though isanother question entirely The answer may depend on whether you thinkefficient is a synonym for jumpy and hysterical            AsExhibit A we offer the recent trials and tribulations of the socalledInternet stocks trials and tribulations that said less about the actualbusiness of the Internet than about the manic behavior of Wall Street in ajustwontquit bull market This most recent hysteria saw investors pouringbillions of dollars into Internet stocks before suddenlyand all atoncechanging their collective mind and racing for the exit In this theyresembled nothing so much as the knights in Monty Python and the HolyGrail  who took comfort in screaming Run away Run away as they fledkiller rabbits and the like            The ride began rather oddly when some of the mostprominent makers of computer hardwarememory chips microprocessors andPCsannounced that their earnings for the first quarter would fall short ofthe allknowing analysts estimates Intel Compaq and Motorola all said thatslowing demandboth in Asia and at homewas hurting profits and both Inteland Compaq emphasized the negative impact of sharp cuts in PC prices The badnews crushed these stocks but much of the money that left Intel and Compaqimmediately flooded into companies such as Yahoo Amazoncom and myriad othersearch engines online retailers and Internet access providers whose listingsnow dot NASDAQ            In partthat move into Internet stocks is simply evidence of what happens when everyonebelieves so strongly in the stock market that keeping any money in cash isregarded as heresy In other words if you were a mutual fund manager youcouldnt very well sell Intel and then say Now I believe I will wait until Ican find a company that seems fairly valued If you did that you might missout on the latest rally The money had to go somewhere and when Net stocksbecame the Next Big Thing for those few days thats where the moneywent            Still there was a certain logic at work inmaking Net stocks the Next Big Thing If PCs are getting cheaper and cheaperthen more people will buy them If more people have PCs then more people willeventually use the Internet fewer than  percent of US households currentlyhave access This in turn means that more people will search on Yahoo buybooks from Amazoncom and so on But while the longrun implications of cheapPCs for the Internet are important its hard to see how Intels profitconcerns made Amazoncom  million more valuable last Tuesday morning thanit was the Friday before The same was true of all other Internet companieswhose optionholding executives must have been thanking their personal deitiesfor the Asian crisis It was a classic case of the next five years of good newsfor a company being priced into its stock all at once And then the wormturned            Why itturned isnt really clear but it definitely did It was a very odd thing towatch in fact Sometime midmorning last Tuesday the Net stocks peaked thentumbled even more quickly than they had ascended Amazoncom Yahoo ExciteLycos EarthLink MindSpring All lost between  percent and  percent oftheir value in just a few hours Apparently the cheapPC theory had a fewholes in it            Just as the shift of money into Internet stocks was partlythe product of a virtuous circle created by institutions trying to keep theirportfolios invested in stocks that had momentum so too was the shift outpartly the product of a vicious circle created by institutions trying to dumpstocks that suddenly didnt have momentum The rout also had something to dowith the fact that only a few Internet companies have ever reported profits andthat even those that have profits trade at valuations to which as they say notraditional criteria can be applied Everyone knows that you cant value thesecompanies the way youd value General Electric perhaps because if you didthese companies would all have stock prices that are oneeightieth of what theyare now But every so often the market does look at their bottom lines and itfinds that discretion is sometimes the better part of valor            Still themost dubious part of this little minidrama is not really investors herdlikeadvance and retreat as much as it is the governing principle behind thatherdlike behavior That governing principle is that all these companies belongto something called the Internet sector and that its the sector and not thecompanies that matters This is of course the principle governing mostinstitutional investing which is why pharmaceutical stocks and airline stocksand semiconductor stocks tend to move as groups Its a rare day when AmericanAirlines stock rises while other airline stocks fall There is the kernel of agood idea at work here namely that macroeconomic or external eventslikesay a fall in the price of gasolinethat help one company in an industry willalso help others But sector investing also tends to reward a successfulcorporations competitors for that corporations success and in that senseseems not merely counterintuitive but downright perverse            More to the point in the case of the Internetsector investing rests upon a basic misconception namely that there are thingswe can meaningfully call Internet stocks In fact there are at least fivedifferent types of Internet companies each of which has very different futureprospects Online retailers such as Amazoncom and music seller CDnow arestill selling into a tiny market but one thats growing explosively Searchengines such as Yahoo and Lycos are evolving into what are called portalsites hoping to become more like miniAOLs than just search enginesInfrastructure companies such as VeriSign Verity and Netscape are creatingthe tools that make the Web work but their main source of income will comefrom corporations A few companies most notably CNET are trying to make moneypackaging content And finally there are the Internet access providers whichis to say America Online and everybody else            To be sure all thesecompanies will benefit from having more people use the Internet But not allwill benefit equally And even within those five groups the differences amongindividual companies are more important than the similarities To put it adifferent way Amazoncom Yahoo and AOL which have established tremendousbrand recognition and clear business models have more in common with eachother than Amazoncom does with other online retailers or AOL with other accessproviders And yet the strength of these companieseach by the way nowvalued at stratospheric heightsis helping carry those around them TheInternet will undoubtedly be a crucial part of the economy of the next centuryBut Wall Street would be better off remembering that approximately  autocompanies were around in the early part of this century Instead of mindlesslytossing billions at or taking billions from the Net as such investors shouldbe spending their time making sure that its the future Fords and GeneralMotors of cyberspace that are getting the capital they need
