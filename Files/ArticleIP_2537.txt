                                 The Doc in the Hat            As preschoolers my childrenbriefly confused Dr Spock with Dr Seuss whom they assumed to be a cat with astovepipe hat Americas household pediatrician as the Cat in the Hat Theimage is unwittingly apt linking two upstart heroes in the baby boomerpantheon A mothers helper with a bag of tricks that promised new fun for thehousebound Dr Benjamin Spock arrived on the postwar scene first His Babyand Child Care was published in  It revealed his gift for juggling theunbalanceable demands of life with children and for sounding serenely jauntyas he did it It goes without saying that Spock like the acrobatic Cat provedimmensely popular and has remained so What is perhaps less obvious is thatmuch as the Cat made sure his messes were temporary Spock was not assubversive as lore suggests            Spockspurported iconoclasm is twofold First he is typically hailed or rarely nowcondemned as a revolutionary who emboldened postwar parents to rebel againstthe stern behaviorist style that had prevailed in the s and s Thetruth is somewhat different Like most wildly popular figures he was riding awave not bucking the tide His genial Freudian approach fit right in with thereigning sociological wisdom which championed the democratic affectionatefamily as the welcome successor to the hierarchical home of the past Reviewersof the first edition of Baby and Child Care praised its dont rock theboat but do rock the cradle tone Spock the American Journal of PublicHealth marveled has succeeded to an amazing degree in striking a middleground in his advice That advice was seen to typify the presentdaydeparture from rigidity in schedules and training            Second Spock is renowned for an unprecedentedlyconfidenceinspiring pitch Trust yourself You know more than you think youdo he told his readers Instead of struggling to do everythingletterperfect out of a feeling of worry he counseled try to relax and beflexible Children trust them have a deep desire to grow up to be like theparents they admire and love Yet the message of simple reassurance turned outto be more complicated as Spock himself quickly discovered The first expertto say Dont be overawed by what the experts say became an expert ofawesome influence overnight His book sold threequarters of a million copiesin its first year without advertising Flattered Spock was also flustered todiscover just how dependent on his advice his fans had become Was parentalautonomy weakening on his own watch            Spockfrequently claimed that fears about permissiveness first surfaced in voiced by critics of his antiwar activism In fact as early as in the secondedition of his classic in  he was worried that parents might be flailingThey werent friendly yet firm as he had recommended They were confused andhesitant overawed by their children The son of an imposing Victorianmatriarch himself he was surprised at how wobbly modern mothers seemed            One mother stunned him by writing Dont yourealize that when you always emphasize that a child basically wants to behavewell and will behave well if he is handled wisely you make the parentfeel responsible for everything that goes wrong            Spocktook the question personally He also astutely recognized it as a midcenturysymptom of a fascinating and somewhat mysterious phenomenon this one of theparents of America being this nervous about doing right by their children Inour antitraditional culture older generations had tended to be ambivalentabout their authority over younger ones But now the swift pace oftechnological change left parents less equipped than ever to prepare theirchildren for the future even as children needed the preparation moredesperately Sciencein particular psychology Spocks own specialtyheldout a promise of newly finetuned control over their development            Parents understandably felt under pressure and Spock wasthe rare expert who acknowledged their bewilderment From then on ministeringto  th century parental uneasiness became his real mtier Even inits first edition his manual was more encyclopedic than others packed withuptodate medical and practical advice delivered in downtoearth prose Hesaw to it that over the years it remained so Just as important he becameeven more solicitously therapeutic In a field intent on claiming objectivescientific status he didnt hesitate to admit that doctrinaire ideasshifted conflicted and could be disorienting            Spocksown simplistic Freudian perspective with its emphasis on childhood Oedipaldramas and the wonders of sublimation sounds more quaint every year Its hishandling of the ambiguities of parenthood that is timeless Called aconfidence man by one impatient critic Spock indeed made a specialty ofdelivering mixed messages to his insecure audience            He set out in his book to calm parents in theprocess stirring up their anxiety He urged them to rely on their instinctsand went on to supply them with minute instructions He emphasized childrensresilience and was quick to suggest that problems require a specialistsassistance He started out psychologizing and ended up moralizing Through itall he prescribed spontaneity an oxymoronic endeavor if ever there wasone            But Spocks equivocationswere not evasions On the contrary they call attention to a truth less honestadvisers have preferred to obscure and parents only half want to hear thatchild rearing is a messy art of compromise and contradictions full ofuncertainty It is not a streamlined science Spock did not cure Americanmothers and fathers of their impossible dream of being professional parentsequipped with the developmentally correct answers But he played an importantpart in bringing realism to child rearing by being an unapologetic improviserhimself            If he was sometimes a naivepolitical activist Spock was always a resourceful pragmatist when it came tochild rearing wisdom He let broad intuitions and motley experience guide himI never looked at my records he admitted about the writing of his classicIt really all came out of my head All along he treated his book as agrowing organism not as a fixed system Spock relied on his own resiliencenot science to update his expertise for an era of feminism and familydisarray His classic has thickened gracelessly over the years but as theforthcoming eighth edition once again shows it has remained true to theadaptable temperament it was born with This oneofakind creation has helpedspawn countless howto manuals but its still easy to choose the indispensableone In Dr Seuss words Well what would you say if a mother asked you
