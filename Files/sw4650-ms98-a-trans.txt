        you an avid magazine reader     uh not really i dont really read any regularly uh in the past i use to read some i use to read Time all the time   oh uhhuh   but i guess that was just it i dont know too much reading to do so i stopped doing it so   um do you read for work or something   yeah i do a lot of reading for work because i i dont know i just have a lot of research literature to keep up on is the thing so   huh are you in the scientific field or something   yeah im in computer science   ah well uh my thoughts about magazines are uh that theyre kind of a quick fix i watch very little TV and i i like to read a lot   uhhuh   but if im feeling jumpy i kind of enjoy a magazine because everythings short and you can you know lay perhaps look at the pictures read an article for a couple of pages you dont feel like youve committed yourself to all the time it takes to read five hundred pages   right its just the thing is i i dont know i just have a tendency to want to read everything no matter what i buy what i buy so its kind of weird     oh yeah your pretty thorough if youre going to it right   yeah i dont know its uh just a weird thing about me so i try not to buy anything that im afraid of reading the whole thing so   oh if youre in a doctors office and they have all kinds of stuff what are you attracted to   yeah oh i dont know um i i like reading up on the news um and sometimes i like some science stuff but not much actually so i mean because Popular Science type magazines arent usually very uh i dont know yeah scientific so   scientific     how about you what do you read   uh well uh in the magazine world i guess im kind of i hate to stereotype myself because im not all that girlish in the sense of girlish you know i i can solder and all of that kind of good stuff     uhhuh uhhuh   but in my magazines when i think about it um i have a cooking magazine i like because i like to cook and theres some this thing called Country Home which has uh its kind of a mellow thing with all kinds of American and uh you i dont know recipes and decorating and all kinds of girl stuff   uhhuh   im almost embarrassed to say that   girl stuff huh well its not girl stuff it just you know good stuff thats all   well the other day i was talking with a fellow about woodworking and and thats another thing i love to do   uhhuh   im an artist and im into all kinds of crafts and things so i can i can saw and solder and all kinds of you know things that would make me not sound like the typical you know cutesy housewife type   right   but i guess in magazines i guess i you know i run the line i suppose thats true   uhhuh   uh at we have some Road and Track magazines around the house my oldest son likes and ill pick that up too   uhhuh   i enjoy it i like to look at the stuff id love to have if i had all the money to buy it   well yeah i i find it interesting to read just about anything thats lying around usually i mean its always interesting stuff i dont i wouldnt normally buy you always just well i dont know like i had an old friend who use to read Cosmopolitan all the time and i thought it was the most ridiculous magazine but it was just so interesting to find out i dont know about the culture of people who read Cosmopolitan you know   its kind of like sneaking a peek at the other side i know what you mean   right     im a big fan of the library i you know i i i dont really reread books so with the price of the paperbacks and even the hardcovers going up i just why not use the library theyll even get anything you ask them to find for you so you know why not do that but i am a big fan of the new book rack you walk in   uhhuh   and theyve got all the new books and to me its like a little treasure opening this crispy you know covered brand new book and ill come home with the strangest things that id never would have picked out   uhhuh   because you know they run through the whole Dewey decimal system and you know there was one on Alpine skiing that looked interesting and one on you know wood carving that looked interesting and you know you just find these things that   right   um well its refreshing to pick up something that you would never go to a rack for i think   umhum right   but i dont know that i have that much more to say about wood carving about wood carving im not even speaking thinking straight here about magazines um       any other thoughts on your part   uh not in particular no  um so do you read youre an artist then so do you read a lot of art magazines at all or   yeah um there are some um im particularly interested in the crafts and there is one called American Craft that lists all the shows and that kind of thing and um   umhum   craft shows are a lot of fun to go to when its not some some housewife in quotes who put lace on a pair of socks and sells that as a craft i mean that makes me crazy  you know but if its really truly beautiful pottery and       and you know hand hewn wood  stuff like that   yeah   then i really enjoy it and and im going to start taking up some pottery which ive never done myself ive gone from woodworking to silver jewelry making to stain glass   uhhuh   and pottery turning clay on a wheel is something ive never done and i just discovered
