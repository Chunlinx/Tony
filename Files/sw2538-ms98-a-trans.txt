        some of the political trends that have started up uh i guess in the other side of the ocean as it were some of the uh   okay   revolutions and desires for change thats going on over there when that first started going on there was a politician in the US i dont even remember his name but uh he made a a not so widely publicized comment that said just wait awhile and see how much US aid ends up going that way   umhum   his and he thought or predicted that Poland would be one of the first ones to start seeing uh both in forms of debt forgiven and uh actual dollar values given over to them and they took a little while but sure enough some of that stuff is coming about uh so i dont know if thats going to be an ongoing trend that were going to start helping this country and that country and breaking our own backs as it were what do you think   well i think thats uh a you know valid observation that uh anytime that a company that a country appears to be uh moving in the same direction that the United States uh thinks is the right direction that they tend to get more you know more uh more aid from from our government then they would have before or the other governments do um i suppose thats a uh as valid a way of determining who gets aid is as anything although im not sure that uh us giving aid is the right uh right thing for our government to be doing   umhum   um i i think its kind of ironic that from my you know from my observation anyway that that were uh rewarding other governments for becoming more democratic in following more capitalistic approaches whereas in our own economy the trend seems to be more towards social programs   umhum   and you know away from the capitalistic approach so its kind of like you know were moving in the in a kind of a direction toward each other   yeah thats interesting   uh you know i i mean thats my own observation anyway   yeah i think youre right i think over the well goodness i guess you could go back as   far as Roosevelt and say that the social programs have certainly gone up and only economics have caused a few cutbacks but still the desire seems to be that the government say   right right yeah   or the norm has become that they would desire that the government say yeah that we deserve this so you will provide this   right   this is part of the old happiness aspect   yeah   thats a thats an interesting thought that theyre headed to be a socialist and theyre headed to be democratic and maybe were capitalist and maybe the two will meet in the middle and and and agree i i dont know   and im not sure that uh that i would even think at this point that somewhere in the middle would even be desirable because uh i mean if theres if theres something uh if what we wind up with is more socialistic than what we have now then im not sure that its the right thing its there i think we have too much too many social programs   umhum   uh its a social programs without the corresponding responsibility i guess is   right that does seem to be a problem that even the Poles faced when uh i think theyre one of the earliest experimenters in in trying to get a capitalist uh economy going and some of the things that showed up is um i hate the term worth it work ethic but that seems to be the one thats tied to it   right   that some of the Poles just didnt know what it meant to get up in the morning and you know be there and put in a few extra hours if it needed it or you know a little bit of work here and work there do what it takes instead of just stamp the clock stamp the clock and forget about it give me my paycheck   umhum right   um though there are jobs of course that exist that way here uh they dont       they dont theyre not labeled CEO  you know theyre theyre uh assembly line type jobs and   umhum   they didnt have that worth it ec ethic and here were headed towards socializing to the extent that theres a whole welfare population that doesnt have it   right oh i   so but thats an interesting uh merging as it were of the two ideas were going one way and theyre going the other   i noticed in uh an article in the paper where i didnt read the whole article but you know the headlines anyway indicated that theres a a seems to be a consensus among small and medium size business owners that the uh the output of the American worker is on the decline you know pretty severely but uh   umhum   the outputs really suffering and i think thats you know thats another indication that that were headed in the wrong direction   right   uh you know and i think uh i think rewards for a job well done are are are necessary and i i think that we i guess we have a tendency to as you know as managers of companies or owners of companies they have a tendency to try to get as much out of the employee as they can and not give as much as they can   right   you know in return i uh i i think that that there there needs to be some give and take in both you know on both sides of the of the picture there   i dont know if itd be a political trend or not to to uh  consider the problem of the well i guess it it is a matter of uh at least the governments causing it theres theres so much more paperwork in most every job i mean the poor teacher cant get their jobs done for the reports and the things that the government requires and   right right   and uh the whole defense industry issue of having so many layers of management just to handle the paperwork and   well uh you know even the police uh have a lot of paperwork to do uh i observed a uh i didnt actually see the accident but uh the  the aftermath of a three car accident yesterday here in Richardson and i was going into the public library and apparently the accident had just you know recently happened then but there was a policeman there policewoman there   umhum   uh taking down the information and i was in the library a good thirty minutes and came back out and she was still sitting in the police car there you know the accident   right   participants were gone but she was sitting there filling out paperwork you know so you know it took her thirty minutes plus to to handle one traffic accident   hum yep the more cars the merrier the paperwork   and uh right   and you know i think thats uh just a a kind of an indication the paperwork the the amount of information that the government wants even about a traffic accident you know is so much that uh   yeah   you know we get bogged down and things like that   i wonder if they waive that when uh some of these horrendously large pileups occur in California like you hear these twenty and thirty pile   yeah   boy couldnt you imagine doing the paperwork on thatd take an army of officers just to do the paperwork       correct yeah   uh     okay well that just sounds like i got another phone call trying to come in so anyway its been interesting thank you   all righty ill let you go then um bye   bye
