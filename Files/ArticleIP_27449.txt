                                 Underpaid Soldiers            To justify a new increase in military pay thePentagon and legislators are citing a  percent pay gap between the salariesof servicemen and their civilian counterparts Ignoring for a moment whether adramatic increase in military pay is needed the  percent figure is bogusEven though the Congressional Budget Office debunked the statistic in Marchseveral military representatives continue to cite it in congressionaltestimony            The  percent pay gap represents the differencein the growth of military versus civilian wages since that iscivilian wages have grown  percent faster This does not mean thatsoldiers earn less than civilians because it does not take into account thepay differential from  If my wages have increased by  percent duringthe past five years while Bill Gates have increased by nearly  percent thisdoes not mean that I am earning  percent more than Bill Gates since he wasmaking more to begin with            Moreover even as ameasure of relative wage growth the  percent figure fails First the starting pointas opposed to some other yearmakes the gap look especiallybig since there was a substantial military pay increase in  Even worsethe comparison does not account for the fact that most members of the armedforces are younger and less educated than civilian workers This is importantbecause in recent years the wages of collegeeducated workers have grown muchfaster than the wages of highschooleducated workers The better comparisonwould be between the wage growth of soldiers and civilians of comparable ageand education            So forget about  percent argument Is there any pay gapA rough study by the CBO found that enlisted service members earnedhigher wages than threequarters of male civilian highschool graduatesof the same age and officers earn higher wages than threequarters ofcollege graduates of the same age By that measure soldiers earn more thantheir civilian counterparts A RAND study has found essentially similarresults            Military service offers manyadvantagesselfimprovement adventure travel patriotism the esteem ofones countrymenas the services tout It also has severe disadvantages suchas long hours harsh discipline isolation from loved ones and the risk ofinjury or death It may be a good idea to attract better soldiers sailors andairmen with huge salary increases but military service is so different fromcivilian work that most wage comparisons are extremely suspect
