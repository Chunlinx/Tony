                what you want to start   uh  it it uh it doesnt matter um were discussing the capital punishment i believe and um   right yeah right yeah i i suppose i should of   which i am am pro capital punishment except that i dont like the way its done   uhhuh uh yeah i i i uh i guess i i hate to see anyone die uh but uh i guess these people that go around and and kill children and   umhum   women and everything else without any remorse uh i dont think they deserve to to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives   i i agree i im capital the capital punishment is necessary in in many cases but uh the its not a deterrent um or our jails would not be so full there wouldnt be so many people on Death Row   umhum   i think it needs to be something uh uh a throwback to where they did a uh public execution where its visible   yeah   uh something you know not gruesome but but something where where people knew that it was it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people if you committed a certain crime you were going to receive a death penalty and it was going to happen to you   yeah   no stays of execution no no loopholes no   well and and even even that i dont really know if that would help i think lot of these people do it uh mainly because of of TV and and double double reason mainly they they see it being done on TV and also the fact of of notoriety i mean they become well known they are almost like like a big star   notoriety umhum yes yes but but they they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal they know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years   yeah uhhuh   that theyre going to write a book theyre gonna go on talk shows theyre gonna that that thats a reward   yeah   uh for a heinous crime rather than uh having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life   right   in in complete uh advance of any notoriety   yeah well i i i think if they went according to uh the Bible where it does say an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life uh you take a life you give yours   umhum right right   uh uh uh thats for sure  theres exceptions to the rule i mean if if its an accidental taking then uh you look at that but you know most of these people that down right go right and and do it out of pure pleasure   umhum   uh i dont uh like to see that i guess also the fact that they say its not a deterrent it is a deterrent in the in the sense that that person  will never do it again   well yes they will it   not not not if hes killed he cant do it again   oh and it yeah well correct thats correct yes yeah if if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is it is executed yes   the death penalty uhhuh   but but the the the chances are not great that that will happen   right   yet theres a greater chance that hell be back out on the streets in twelve years   umhum yeah well i i guess im also looking at beyond even that i i i guess i been thinking about it and i dont have a definite opinion but uh repeat uh crimes   umhum   uh maybe not the the more mild ones but you know a more severe ones especially on armed armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people and not just taking the money but   umhum   beating them half to death   that right   just for pleasure too and   yes   i i guess you got to look at something like that do they deserve to uh remain on this earth too   well you you know you you could carry it uh to that if uh if they are a repeat offender and and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up um you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes and of course uh uh battery or assault or thats not a capital crime so you you wouldnt be able to under our system   right right   now China and a few other countries have a little different view of that um you get caught with dope there and you die period   yeah umhum   there is there is no no appeals there is no
