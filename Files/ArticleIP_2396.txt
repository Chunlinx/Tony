                                 Mothers Little Tax Break            Signing theminimumwagehike bill last month President Clinton hailed its passage as abig victory for the working poor and the Democratic Party But buried in a taxpackage attached to the wage lawand completely missing from most newscoveragewas a small triumph for Texas Republican Sen Kay Bailey HutchisonHer sweetener the socalled Homemaker IRA would increase the sum thathomemakers are allowed to put away in taxfree Individual Retirement Accountsfrom the current  to  a year raising their IRA savings limit tomatch that of their working spouses            Hutchison originallysponsored the bill in  by  over half the Senate had leapt onto thebandwagon Endorsements included every group from the Christian Coalition itpromotes family values to feminist groups women would be the primebeneficiaries Bob Dole is still endorsing its enactmenteven though the planis now law Dole included Hutchisons proposal in the economic package heintroduced after the minimumwage bill had sailed through Congress on its wayto a sure presidential signature            With sobroad a constituency behind it why would anyone oppose the provision BecauseIRAs cost the Treasury moneywhich must ultimately be made up either byraising other peoples taxes or cutting their benefits According to anestimate by the Joint Committee on Taxation the IRA expansion would cost million in lost revenue over a fiveyear period which makes the merits of thecase worth a closer look            Supporters of the Homemaker IRA argue that the new benefitis needed because the current tax code discriminates against singleearnerhouseholds Families with two incomes can put away  for each spousewhile oneincome households can save only  for working spouses and for homemakers Its another marriage penalty Hutchison contends            By themarriage penalty Hutchison means the quirk in the tax code that pushesmarried people into higher tax brackets than their unmarried counterparts Thatpenalty however is paid only when both spouses work When only one spouseworks married people are charged at a lower rate than the working spouse wouldbe if he or she were single The benefit of the Homemaker IRA will go to thosewho already enjoy this marriage bonus  those who bear the marriagepenalty wont be affected            And that tax bonus is not the only perk ofPartridge Familydom Almost every tax law pertaining to marriage givessingleincome families more bang for their buck than any other category oftaxpayer Social Security and Medicare are prime examples Employees andemployers are each required to pay  percent of an employees income inSocial Security taxes and  percent in Medicare taxes The selfemployedmust contribute  percent in Social Security taxes and  percent inMedicare taxes Social Security benefits are based on individuals earningsduring their careers            Singlepeople and twoincome families pay in when they are young and cash out whenthey retire However nonworking spouses who never paid Social Security taxesbecause they didnt have an income to be taxed are entitled to Social Securitybenefits and Medicare based on the contribution of their spouses Retiredworkers collect Social Security benefits and their nonsalaried spouses receivehalf Working spouses must choose between their own earned benefit or half oftheir spouses After primary beneficiaries deaths their spouses collect percent of the benefit earned by the deceased The spouse also continues tocollect the full Medicare benefit So singleincome families collect  timesthe Social Security benefit and twice the Medicare entitlement a single personwith the same income receives                           Health care is another part of thehomemaker bonus package Most public and private employers that offerhealthcare benefits to employees provide coverage to the spouses anddependents of workers without a commensurate increase in employeecontributions As a result singleincome families and families with childrentypically get coverage for more people than do single people and partners indualincome households            Supportersof the Homemaker IRA also make a feministfairness argument Homemakersdont get the IRA they argue because their contributions to the family andthe economy arent counted as income As Hutchison and Sen Barbara MikulskiDMd wrote in a Washington                Times oped Failure to address theIRA fairness issue tells homemakers If your hard work doesnt produce taxablerevenue it doesnt count Because the overwhelming majority of homemakers arewomen Gloria Steinem and other feminists have long argued that their workshould be counted as part of national production            But the basic premise of the IRA rules is thatpeople with income are taxed on their earnings IRA accounts allowincomeearners to duck some taxation on that income if they promise to save ituntil theyre old Interest on IRA savings is not taxed until an individualwithdraws it Furthermore money put in IRA accounts is tax deductible whenfamily income is less than             And while it may be unfairthat homemakers are not paid for the work they do the upside to the deal isthat they are not taxed on it either Tax purists would argue that the valueof the homemakers hard workand the intrafamily benefits they presumablyreceive in return for itshould in fact be treated as income and taxed justlike the wages paid to outside service providers such as baby sitters andhousekeepers But you wont find many in either the feminist or familyvaluescamps promoting that idea As long as unpaid spouses do not pay taxes thewhole notion of offering them tax reprieves is questionable            So is thedisparity between the value that Hutchison and her supporters apparently put onathome work done by middle and upperclass spouses and the contributions ofwomen farther down the income scale Work is work whether it is done insidethe home or outside the home Hutchison argues But you have to have money tosave it and not many couples with young children have the luxury of tuckingaway  apiece annually for their Golden Years Moreover tax breaks areworth most to those whose highbracket positions mean they need them least            By contrast when it came time for Hutchison to weigh in onthe welfare debate  she supported a bill that would force single parentson welfare to get a paid job after two years as long as their children are overage five Her mixed priorities when it comes to women were also revealed by thefact that she voted nay on the minimumwage bill even though it included herown IRA proposaland despite the fact that according to the Bureau of LaborStatistics  percent of people working at minimum wage are women            Hutchison is careful toexplain she only intends to assist spouses who choose to stay homenot todiscourage those who work But heres the rationale We are seeing every timewe talk about crime in this country that it does come back to poor family andthe values that some people learn at home she says Anything we can do toencourage the family unit and encourage spouses who are able to stay at homewith their children if that is their desire we should do it In other wordsHutchison is offering a reward for making the right choice to those who canalready afford to make it
