        okay     what i was doing at at home in fact i work at nights here so thats another long story well talk about its funny that i got you though   yeah it is   uh i asked my wife to hand me the other phone because i was just i was busy and uh i had just gotten a call and i couldnt answer it and i said well ill punch it on this one   uhhuh   and uh its a walk around phone but its not a uh its not the other kind you know   yeah thats what mine is uhhuh   so it didnt work   now ive got a portable cordless is that what youre using   okay no im using a regular phone now uh   okay i got a i im using a cordless   if if its a what kind of phone do they talk its not a dial but if its a touchtone its okay   yeah right   i realized that once i used i should have i was going to go in the kitchen and and punch one on the touchtone   uhhuh   and i realized that i had screwed it up so it was my fault   okay   thats funny that we had gotten it   yeah it is   uh  i guess they want us to talk about dogs but dogs or cats   dogs and cats that your cat your Rex   ill switch over to birds you know we we dont really have birds as pets but we sure because we have cats   uhhuh   we always wind up with i havent yet uh a bird or two in the Summer because the cat will catch one and usually well catch the cat because the cat doesnt seem to kill the bird right away   oh really uhhuh   we wound up with a lot of birds over the years and   oh   there are organizations we drop ours off at Fort Worth if theyre still alive and you keep it alive which is hard to do for a couple of weeks   uhhuh   if you take it to an agency theyll send it back in the wild somehow and so we we wound up because of our cats with with many birds over the years uh again theyre not pets exactly but uh   oh oh this guy at work that i work with uh raises birds uh he has a a macaw macaw macaw   yeah   and parakeets and something else he one of those macaw parrots   the lady next door across from across the street from us just lost is it a cockatoo whats that one thats white   yeah a cockatoo i think its a cockatoo   it got loose and ive forgotten what how she did it and she had it in a cage of some sort   did it really   and what they were doing i dont know but it flew away you know and they called it and everything and rode drove around the neighborhood looking for it but uh   umhum those are expensive   yeah its free yeah       im surprised that a bird uh i guess they can find their way back but i wonder exactly where a tame bird would go   did she ever get it back   no no she never got it back ive heard stories like this before with parrots and all this uh because people let them out out in their house you know and fly around   oh thats uhhuh yeah my daughter had one i wouldnt have one flying around my house   and no i know uh       but uh ive forgotten she had it outside somehow and somehow they they mixed signals or something and uh it got loose of course again again the animals are so much faster than we are in one way or the other   yeah boy thats a shame   uh you know i was telling you the story about fencing i do like dogs i i would ive always had dogs my whole life as a kid   uhhuh umhum   uh   dont you miss them now i mean   well yeah i do i   because theyre they have such personalities   yeah i do i think that all the animals have personality im not the cat person i my sister had cats when we were little   umhum   we always seem to have a cat and a dog together which again when you bring them up i do notice that   yeah   they get along   right   and my wife was the cat lover and when when we started out as a young young married couple we just had an apartment so you its kind of easier to have a cat   yeah right right   and then she just never wanted a dog and then we got here to Texas uh shes from Texas again and uh she she had this thing with the fence and i i guess i have so many interests i dont really quite have the time with with two daughters and everything   uhhuh yeah right   and all the activities to personally train a dog but i would i would i guess ill have to wait until both of my kids are out of college before i get another dog again i guess im   yeah right right   i i i certainly saw your point with the Greyhound that theres there is a limit   yeah   uh to a pet um   yeah you know you think youre you think thats what you want and i really gave it a good try   umhum   and i had her spoiled i mean she was spoiled rotten but she was so and i have a new house and i and to walk in my house id have especially uh especially on a rainy day id have to take a bucket of water out there and wash all four of her feet this is a fifty pound dog im going to pick up a leg at a time and wash and set it down on something clean while i got the other three you know and and then id let her in the house well still even putting her feet in the bucket of water and wash them real good she still would come in so fast and so heavy that shed dig her paws deep down into my carpet you know and just take out running to and she would   yeah   oh she was ruining my carpet and i thought gosh i i love my new house more than i love her i think you know i just really have a big investment and i dont i just it was just more work than it was really really i wasnt enjoying her thats what it was maybe if id a had a run for a dog run but i think thats cruel to put a dog in a run   yeah yeah no i think so too uh my wife just she keeps convincing me because my my parents uh my parents are dead now but my parents and my brothers and sisters always had dogs   uhhuh   and when we would visit them she said you can smell dog over the house i said well youre really right   yeah   and so i never she always had a good argument why not to get a dog and we havent since weve been married   yeah but now see i have always felt that i could always smell cats cats to me always i i i used to have some friends house that i couldnt stand to go in their house i could smell their their litter box i thought oh my God i couldnt stand it and i dont know how they stood it i guess they didnt smell it   yeah oh yeah yeah uh no yeah i think youre right uh people are surprisingly are allergic to cats too we do have some friends on and off that will   oh do you   i guess its the hair the cat the short fur on the cat is uh one of the allergic reaction things like uh   uhhuh   cedar trees and all of the other stuff i guess the cat has a real fine not the that the real short hair dandruff or whatever they have that people do get allergic to cats uh   yeah uhhuh yeah   in their eyes you know they just walk in the house even though we lock up the cats and theyre crying   yeah thats right   and so some people unfortunately of course i wouldnt have an animal if i was allergic to it either   well i wouldnt either   uh my wife at one time said she was allergic to them uh   uhhuh   i was going to say a story   well i know is therere supposed to be is it Chihuahuas theyre supposed to be good for asthma they say Chihuahua dogs are supposed to be good for people with asthma i always heard   well i think the animals good for you just because uh it gets you out and everything i uh   oh yeah and dont i think theyre using you know theyre using animals in old folks home now and make and some hospitals because its supposed to make people   oh yeah   brings your blood pressure down you know dogs are always so happy to see you come home you know they always are just wagging i dont care how grumpy you are or what dogs are glad to see you   oh yeah   cats are kind of independent like  get in theyre they let you live with them you know  so independent   right i have some friends uh uh that have horses you know   uhhuh   and when my daughters were a little younger you know i thought well maybe thats a good maybe ill get them uh you know this is Texas and ill get them a horse   uhhuh   well we went over and we rode their horses and everything but and and just listened to the stories and the money the horse was sick all the time   oh   you i dont know if you if you have any friends with horses but they get all kinds of eating disorders if they dont if they dont eat the right grain or if you   oh see i was thinking about buying a horse maybe i dont want   if you give him an orange or something you nearly kill it i mean it the the stories he would tell it must have cost him a couple hundred dollars a month   uhhuh just to feed   of course he had several horses for shots and different things i thought my God and i just saw something interesting Consumer Reports they talked they had a animals and they compared   oh uhhuh   you know whether you should have a bird and and the pricing and it had a comment around a horse something to the effect of you dont even want to know what it cost to keep a horse you know  and i   cost  yeah i think ill just go rent a horse if i want to ride one   right i think the best thing in the world is to rent them i think that uh     yeah i do too   that that and boats are probably the same way id love to have a boat too but i think uh im not too sure i i would get that much use out of it you know   yeah no i mean well i do enjoy my dog uh shes such a oh shes my best friend and when when i lived in Orlando she uh got paralyzed from her waist down and uh waist   my goodness from what   and i thought it was uh uh we almost had to put her to sleep and i just cried for two days but i think what i i i ironically what happened was she got had fleas and i think it was the stuff i was having putting on her that that paralyzed her but   my goodness   the fleas i thinks what brought her back is she had to scratch so bad that she started using her paralyzed the the doctor was just amazed at a that she came back because   yeah   he really was going to was going to do surgery for fifteen hundred dollars or put her to sleep and i was going to have to opt to have to put her to sleep even as much much as i loved her i wasnt going to spend fifteen hundred dollars on an experiment   oh yeah yeah plus im not too sure yeah i think they are experiments too and they dont know that much uh   no but it was just uh that spot that they put on the back of a dog uh they used to use it on cattle and uh so i started using it on her and id take to her to the vet once a month and get that spot put on her   my sister spent a lot of go ahead   and she wouldnt have any fleas never had any fleas hadnt never any then all of a sudden uh i took her   huh   i was living in Orlando and i put i put her in the vet for while i came home to Dallas for a while and i took and when i picked her up she had fleas again and so my daughter came down and visited me me from Dallas and and while she was there the dog got paralyzed   hm   and so i took her back up to the doctor and anyway he he said it wasnt that but another doctor told me that there had been uh people the pet owners had been getting permanently paralyzed from petting the dogs that had that spot on them   my goodness   so i thought well and so i cant find a vet thatll do that for me anymore put the spot on her anymore and i dont want it anymore anyway   yeah   but i do fight fleas oh gosh   oh yeah theyre theyre a problem the the different rainy seasons here i dont how long you been here in in the area   yeah oh i moved back in eighty eight the December of eighty eight   oh course you were here before   yeah i lived here before id worked for TI for seventeen years and then i moved to Orlando uh with Mark and Marietta   yeah okay   and let let me talk about fleas we have nothing compared to fleas down they have down there   oh really   and they have them year round at least they die out kind of in the wintertime here in the yard down there they dont theyre are just and they are big suckers i mean big   yeah oh really   and they are just almost impossible to get rid of it costs a fortune if you have a pet youre going to have fleas down there   oh oh yeah   and i just had my house treated and treated and treated and treated and did i did all the things youre supposed to and i couldnt get rid of
