                                 If At First You Dont Secede                           Forgetthe Alamo                        This sounds crass but Icant deny it I desperately wanted the standoff at the Republic of Texastrailertrash compound to last longer than it didfor selfish reasons            Not weekslonger mind you Just a few hours Just long enough for me to getthere  Having missed all the famous government vs fringe standoffsRubyRidge Waco the Montana FreemenI was determined to go and bear witness thistime I would find out at last if mysterious UNdispatched blackhelicopters really buzz around at these things like giant hellspawnedbumblebees I would document the local movements of gutsandglory militiareinforcements A militia offensive of some sort was widely rumored on theNet where one rabid militia man wrote WE HAVE HAD A BELLY FULL OF THE FBIBATF DEA ETC ETC  Lock and Load prepare to Rock and Roll It soundssilly now but militia trouble did seem plausible at Fort DavisWednesday April  three days after the siege began several heavily armedRepublic of Texas members were apprehended at a truck stop near Pecos Texasabout  miles from the action            Alas none of it was to be I took off from Newark NJat  pm Saturday May  After landing in El Paso I called a militiacontact who had agreed to ask around about possible rightwing bivouacs Ieven brought camping gear Things looked hot when I leftfrom inside hisembassy ROT leader Richard McLaren was busily faxing out apocalypticmaydaysbut his hot blood turned to pink JellO            Hey said my contactGuess you heard Its over            What No McLaren wastalking so tough            Well he came out            While Igroaned he described the final hours McLaren had swallowed the oldnegotiators bait of surrender with honor The lawmen treated him like thehead of a brave conquered nation He would be allowed to press in court hisclaim that the Republic of Texas had been illegally annexed by the UnitedStates in  Then he would go to jail for many years Not the best of dealsbut he obviously preferred it to Plan B getting shot            Irented a car and putted around moroselylistening to the radio and mulling over my options Texas lawmen were boastingjustifiably about the happy outcome Yes there was one tiny glitchtwo ROTactivists had somehow slipped awaybut that was no problem A drawlingofficial said these fugitives were not experienced in the back country so theywould be easy pickings For my part I knew there would be little left to seeThe militia would stand down Even the trailer compoundwhich had beentricked out with Swiss Family Robinsonstyle selfdefense gizmoswas stillofflimits to the media            There was however onenotable event left Sunday members of the other factions of the Republic ofTexas were holding a big rally in Kilgore to make clear that the movementwould live on The republic as you probably know contains three competingclans I unfolded my map Hmmm Kilgore was way over by Louisiana Even at miles per hour I could count on driving at least  hours making it just intime for the opening gavel at  pm            Was it worth it            No but what else could Idogo see the Carlsbad Caverns I buckled up and hit the road                           MyCountries Right or Wrong                        The trip was worth it atleast in terms of understanding what motivates Republic of Texas believersWhat motivates them is Theyre nuts All of them            That word is somewhat loadedso I should be more precise ROT members are nuts like the Lilliputians inGullivers Travels were nuts They dont drool or wear their shirtsbackward but they do expend insane amounts of energy on ridiculous politicsdissipating most of it through meaningless infighting and petty posturing Arethey evil hateful nuts No I kind of liked most of them They would be funpeople to go fishing with            Unfortunately they have this other hobby seceding from the union And beingTexans they have enough guns and ammo to potentially make matters not so cuteMost nonMcLarian ROT members publicly disavow violence but the possibilityalways lurks Groups like the Republic of Texas exist in a murky gray zonewhere relatively harmless rightwing bigmouths meet the frightening shriekersof renegade militias raising the question At what point does nutty end andscary begin            You can never tell but Richard Keyes III is agood example of how quickly A can become Z Keyes is the yearold McLarenfollower who actually carried out the kidnapping and shooting that started thewhole Fort Davis mess Hes originally from Kansasso to find out more abouthim I called a county police detective there who tracks the far right Hedheard of him only once in a nuttybutfunny context Keyes filed papersearlier this year demanding that Kansas return portions of the state to therightful ownership of the Republic of Texas Teehee Next thing you knowhowever he emerged as a serious shootemup guy            As forthe meeting it was simply funnynutty but it became all too clear that therepublics separatist fantasies will live on A few hundred boisterousTexansmostly men middleaged or above with a fair number of angry youngrednecks and dotty old womenfilled the cramped banquet room of a rundownmotor lodge in downtown Kilgore Crowding one side of a long dais werefrowning representatives of the two nonMcLarian Republics of Texas One isheaded by David Johnson of Odessa Texas He didnt show up but some of hiscouncil members didthey were gray natty and grumpy like Baptist deaconsThe other faction is under the sway of Archie Lowe a longhaired guy who lookslike an amiable Harley rider and whose followers are a tiny bit more young andwithit The Archies current agenda includes a quest for internationalrecognition and the convening of a Constitutional Convention this July            The meeting itself was extremely hard to follow Aftergeneric introblab the floor was opened to the people a platoon of BraveNew World Epsilons who lined up behind a floor microphone and took turnshuffing and ranting Among the highlights            A very pale young man stoodup and said that Judgment Day was coming unless the Republic of Texassucceeded Then he started crying            A stocky guy in a red shirtand a Republic of Texas cap stood and dramatically announced that he was thedriver of one of the two vehicles detained by authorities in Pecos It was alla gross injustice of course Yes he and four ROT colleagues were travelingwith full packs semiautomatic weapons pistols radios and plenty of ammobut he said they were merely going to Kermit Texas to hunt wild hogs ButPecos is not on the way if youre going to Kermit from Garland I asked himlater Why was he there I was curious about what was going on he said Ona personal level            Agaptoothed old woman yelped that the federal government is getting boxcarsprepared with some kind of leg irons in em to fasten you into place to shipyou to concentration camps            OK perhaps quoting the old woman is a cheapshot Then again I heard similar effusions from a high officialJim Warmke awiry sunburnished old guy in a mustardcolored Western suit who serves assecretary of commerce and trade for the Branch McLarian remnant I liked Jimand I just hope his nuttiness stays funny but I have to wonder When we methe extended a huge sandpapery hand and said Howdy Jim Warmke WARMKEHot lock warm key We talked about McLarenThe man is a genius he has a IQand I raised the question of violence Given that the federalgovernment and the state are always and forever going to kick ass in US vsRepublic confrontations when would a patriot like Jim feel justified inpicking up a gun and charging            And with such overwhelmingodds why would he do that            Youll not know howclose some came he said eerily I can tell you that the militias havebut one methodology in mind They do not intend to assemble   armed men in one spot and allow napalm to destroy them There is atactic called targets of availability What that means is  Yourinterpretation would be terrorism There is no one that can control that Thereis no government could control that            Bomb talk Did he hear aboutspecific targeted sites            I have suspicions but Illnot answer that based on suspicions            After Jim left twoArchiefaction ROT men scurried over and nervously assured me that Jim was akook Great Why didnt I feel reassured                           The JokeStops Here                        Monday I finally visitedFort Davis on the way back to El Paso just to get a feel for the place Thingssounded quite sparky on the radio Early that morning reports said thatsomeone fired at the bloodhounds and that lawmen were closing in I arrivedabout  pm and roosted for a while by the police roadblock at the entrance tothe Davis Mountain Resort subdivision In the distance rose the stark rockymesquitecovered peaks that define this area A couple of dozen sunburnedsiegeweary reporters were hanging around in cars and one explained that theresort itself was miles and miles away Whatever was happening we wouldnt beable to see it or hear it            I took off and stopped forgas in the nearby town of Valentine Inside I met an old codger named CliffordBeare who had recently retired from the Jeff Davis County sheriffsdepartment I asked him if it would be hard for runaways to hide in treelessmountains            Well I guess but you couldhide Theres a lot of caves and stuff            Did he think these guys wouldget caught            I thinkthey will he said Yes I do            He was half right About that time onefugitive believed to be Mike Matson was getting shot to death in a gunbattle The other Keyes appears to have got away and Tuesday theauthorities scaled back the search for him making vague noises about theterrain and wild animals finishing him off He can  only have a finiteamount of food and water said Mike Cox who has been the states spokesmanthroughout the siege            What Of all these peopleKeyes is the only survivor who demands to be taken seriously He startedthe violence he never gave up and he went out ready to blast away and dieThey better hope something gets him because if he does stagger out of thosemountains alive hes going to be biblically nuttily and unfunnilypissed
