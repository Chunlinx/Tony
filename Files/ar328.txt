                    Introduction        The clinical observation that sexual dimorphism plays a        role in the immune response suggests that the endocrine        system is an important factor for the development and        maintenance of the response There is a high frequency of        autoimmune diseases in females and an increased immune        response to antigenic stimulus These observations make it        evident that sexual dimorphism probably acts on the immune        response through its effect upon the        thymichypothalamicpituitarygonadic axis          Series of subjects with gonadal dysgenesis and isolated        cases of Klinefelters syndrome associated with        rheumaticautoimmune diseases RAD suggest a relation        between these clinical conditions    Among male        patients reported to date who have hypogonadism and RAD are        individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus SLE             lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid syndrome        associated   scleroderma      rheumatoid        arthritis RA   ankylosing spondylitis AS            and polymyositis   while Turners syndrome has        been associated with autoimmune thyroiditis   juvenile        rheumatoid arthritis JRA   and juvenileonset        inflammatory bowel disease   Only one of these reports        included eunuchoid males and female subjects with an        abnormal X karyotype          Our goal in the present work was to determine whether        male patients with untreated hypogonadism have an increased        risk of developing RAD and if so whether there is a        relation to the type of hypogonadism                    Methods        The clinical criteria of male hypogonadism refers to        failure of testicular function resulting in decreased        production or absence of male sex hormones and impaired        spermatogenesis whether this failure is secondary to        hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction or is primary        testicular failure          From  patients who fulfilled the previous hypogonadism        criteria who were seen at the outpatient Andrology Clinic        Mexico City Mexico from July  to May   who        were not receiving hormone substitution were selected for        this study        The clinical criteria of male hypogonadism refers to        failure of testicular function resulting in decreased        production or absence of male sex hormones and impaired        spermatogenesis whether this failure is secondary to        hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction or is primary        testicular failure          Ten normogonadic healthy male hospital staff with        similar age and body mass index   constituted the        control group for testicular size and hormone levels        All the patients gave their informed consent They and        the control subjects were given a neuroendocrine genetic        and clinic evaluation including a physical exam in        addition to computed tomography of the sella turcica and        karyotyping of peripheral leukocytes The presence of        secondary sexual characteristics and testicular volume        normal value  ml were noted

  patients had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism XY two of        this group had Kallmanns syndrome and two had idiopathic        cryptorchidism        Eight out of the  male hypogonadic patients also had        RAD independently of the cause of their hypogonadism Of        these four had B  AS two had SLE in one case        associated with antiphospholipid antibodies one had JRA        and one had

with untreated        hypogonadism        Usually males with hypogonadism diagnosed in infancy or        in youth are those who have a complete hypogonadic clinical        picture Some individuals however exhibit an incomplete        clinical picture and may reach adulthood without having        their condition diagnosed Their condition may come to        light during tests of sterility in a couple or during        epidemiological studies      which have        established the frequency of male patients with        hypogonadism        At present it is considered that the frequency of male        patients with hypogonadism in the general male population        is somewhere between  and     and that the        most frequent genetic alteration found in these persons is        that causing Klinefelters syndrome whose prevalence is of        the order of  to  in healthy populations             and  to  in populations with certain mental        or behavioral problems            Our study was performed in a smaller group of male        patients with hypogonadism to those that have been reported        previously for two reasons First the patients were        studied in an andrology clinic for infertility and thus are        not an unselected sample of the general population Second        their hypogonadism had not been diagnosed or treated        previously Although it is arguable that our series of        patients not being a representative sample is unsuitable        for evaluation of the frequency of RAD in patients with        hypogonadism we investigated RAD only in those who had not        been treated for their hypogonadism to avoid the        possibility that androgen replacement had interfered with        the development of RAD           Because the clinical picture of RAD in some of the        patients was severe with clear systemic and articular        symptoms their RAD had been diagnosed elsewhere However        other patients with hypogonadism who also had JRA and AS        had only a few articular symptoms so slight that the RAD        had gone unnoticed until we looked for it        Considering that the frequency of RAD in Mexico City        where our study was performed is about  including RA         SLE  polymyositisdermatomyositis  JRA         AS  and other RAD Sjogrens syndrome mix        connective tissue disease etc    the        relatively large number of cases of RAD in this very small        group of male patients with untreated hypogonadism was        surprisingly high          P   suggesting a strong        relation between the two conditions see Supplementary        Table  The development of RAD only in those patients        with severe testicular dysfunction suggests that such        dysfunction is one endogenous factor that predisposes to        the development of RAD        The disorder most frequent in our group was the        combination of B with AS The frequency of patients with        B all of whom also developed AS was very high         leading to the conclusion that the risk that males with        hypogonadism will develop AS is higher than that of a        healthy Mexican mestizo about          P     We cannot explain        this association at present        The frequency of SLE in male patients with hypogonadism        was higher than would be expected in the general        population Despite the increased odds ratio for the        development of SLE in such patients the confidence        interval was very wide suggesting that other factors in        addition to hormonal and genetic alterations affect the        development of SLE in these patients        Our group of patients includes as far as we know the        first case of hypogonadism associated with juvenile        dermatomyositis The development of dermatomyositis and JRA        was higher in our patients than in the general population                 P   and         P   respectively        Supplementary Table  Nevertheless the confidence        interval was not calculable therefore we conclude that        these associations are coincidental The fact that        frequency of RA was no higher in our group of patients than        in the general population suggests that the RA and        hypogonadism are not related as has already been suggested                 Because the group of patients we studied was so        heterogeneous hypogonadism due to various causes and        various RAD we can conclude only that the hypogonadism        itself regardless of its particular etiology and the very        low serum testosterone levels are associated with the        increased frequency of RAD        Studies in healthy normogonadic males with RAD have        found low serum levels of testosterone and high levels of E                 in patients with RA SLE and        Sjogrens syndrome    The inflamed tissues of        normogonadic patients with RAD contain intense cellular        infiltrates rich in macrophages These cells have hormonal        receptors capable of converting testosterone and        androstenedione into estrone and E          by means of aromatase            An increase in the activity of aromatase induced locally        could explain the drop in androgen levels and the increase        in estrogens observed in patients with RA   However        in our group of patients serum testosterone and E          were both decreased Therefore in our        hypogonadic male patients the main cause of the        testosterone decrease was not due to an increase in its        conversion to E          because the gonadal failure caused a        decrease of both hormones mainly of the testosterone        without showing an increment from its conversion to E           Although the effects of low serum        testosterone levels on the immune system have been little        studied Bebo         et al have shown that orchidectomy        in mice can diminish the flow of CD activated in        experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis   In humans        before treatment with androgens patients who have        Klinefelters syndrome but not RAD have very diminished        levels of testosterone associated with high levels of IgG        IgA IgM IL and IL and with an absolute increase of        CD  CD  and the CD CD ratio   In patients        who have both Klinefelters syndrome and RAD the        diminished level of testosterone is associated with low        percentages of OKT and OKT and with an increase of the        OKTOKT ratio   On the basis of our findings and of        the reports cited we conclude that lack of testosterone        increases humoral and cellular immunity When androgens are        given these abnormalities are reversed and the clinical        picture improves           If our argument is correct low serum testosterone        levels favor the development of RAD in the hypogonadic male        patient while in the normogonadic male who develops RAD        mainly in RA the decrease of testosterone serum levels is        due to an increase in its metabolism for the activated        immune system with the subsequent elevation of E           These differences could also explain        the low or almost null association of RA and hypogonadism          In both cases after androgens are given the clinical        picture and the abnormalities of the immune system are        ameliorated            In summary males who have hypogonadism regardless of        its cause develop RAD more frequently than the general        population when they have very low serum levels of        testosterone                    Abbreviations        AS  ankylosing spondylitis B  histocompatibility        antigen B CREST  calcinosis
