                                 Trading Places            We all know why trade withChina is vital It exposes that countrys executives and entrepreneurs to thedemocratic civilizations of the industrial West It also instructs them abouthow things can be different from what they are in todays Chinawhere allpower resides in the bloody hands of a narrow oligarchy and a broader party ofbootlickers The best way to change Chinas abysmal humanrights record is toengage China so that its government has a stake in the good opinion of therest of the world            And weall know why no trade with Cuba is vital It would give Fidel Castro and hislieutenants a powerful boost Prosperity from trade would strengthen the regimeand delay democratization The best way to nurture civil society and dissent inCuba is by embargo Only by making the economic failure of the Cuban regimecrystal clear can the United States help Cuba            This Washington hypocrisy is bipartisan Congress is eagerto vote for sanctions on Cuba and reluctant to vote for sanctions on China Thepresident is eager for engagement with China and happy to sign theHelmsBurton act punishing Cuba But todays inconsistency is no worse than theinconsistencies under George Bush Ronald Reagan and other prioradministrations The legacy of the Cold War the hatred of Castro among Cubanemigrants provocations like the shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue planesover international waters along with Castros belief that he is strengthenedby confrontation with the United States have brought us to this point whereAmerican politicians are comfortable with one set of principles for theCaribbean and another for the Pacific The embargo has been tough luck for million Cubans who cannot buy or sell in the United States but it has madelittle difference otherwise            But theUnited States different principles for trade with Cuba are about to cause ittrouble thanks to the World Trade Organizationthe newly established refereeto police international trade disputes that Clinton was so proud to establishand Congress to vote for at the end of  The WTO is supposed to ensurethat countries stick to the spirit and letter of the tradeliberalizationagreements they have signed and to authorize sanctions against countries thatbreak the trade rules they had agreed on It keeps other countries frombreaking trade commitments that benefit the United States in exchange forkeeping the United States from breaking trade commitments that benefit thosecountries and it keeps all of us from indulging in the everyoneloses patternof trade sanction and retaliation If we in the United States are the good guysmore than half or even half the time a strong WTO is in our interest            Yet now the White Housenoticing the WTO forthe very first time since the signing ceremonyis trying to make sure it getsoff to a bad start Last years Cubapunishing HelmsBurton act denies USvisas to executives of companies that use buildings or equipment seized byFidel Castro and threatens the companies themselves with financial judgmentsby US courts Because of HelmsBurton the United States is threatening tofine WalMart if its Canadian subsidiary sells Cubanmade pajamas and isdenying Italian executives visas to the United States            Europeans and Canadianspoint out that HelmsBurton infringes upon their nations sovereignty andviolates US commitments under the WTO They are right In retaliation Canadapromises to fine the USbased WalMarts Canadian subsidiary if it does notsell Cuban pajamas The Europeans ask that the WTO hear the case and authorizesanctions against the United States This is exactly the kind of messy disputethat calls out for a refereelike the WTO            But theUnited States counters that  million Cubans threaten the national securityof  million Americans and that the WTO has no jurisdiction over suchnationalsecurity matters The Clinton administration declares it will boycottany hearing the WTO schedules            Now this is a strange position for the president to takeThe HelmsBurton clash is shaping up to be the WTOs first big case A strongWTO will block a lot of measures that hurt the US economy in the long run ifit is allowed to gain strength and authority If the WTO proves powerless inits first big case all will observe that its rules are only binding when thestrong wish them to be The point of having the WTO as a referee would be lostAnd a chance to remove trade disputes from the cycle of unilateral sanction andsubsequent retaliation would be lost as well If the administration wins thedispute over the jurisdiction of the WTO then in the long run the USeconomy loses            Trade liberalization has beenthe principal and by some counts the only achievement of the Clintonadministration The creation of the WTO was the capstone of tradeliberalization The WTO had in fact been first proposed by Franklin DRoosevelt and Harry S Truman It was one of three sister organizations theother two being the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank they hadsought to establish They had wanted to make the postWorld War IIinternational economy a freetrade freeinvestment economy oriented towardgrowthin sharp contrast to the preWorld War II economy riddled with hightariffs and import controls and oriented toward stagnation But tarifflovingsenators killed the WTO in the late s            Thus theputtinginplace of the final piece of Roosevelts and Trumans grand designfor a free worlda piece that they had tried and failed to put in place intheir daywould be an accomplishment to be proud of            So why Clintons aggressive defense ofHelmsBurton Why the willingness to weaken his major substantive achievementIts not that he has changed his mind and is now pursuing a general policy oflinkage between trade and democratization that applies to Cuba ConsiderChina again It exports  percent of its GDP up from  percent in  TodayChinas economy is more vulnerable to coordinated sanctions that would cut offits exports to industrial countries than ever before yet it seems less open todemocracy than ever before Chinas leaders have drawn conclusions from thecollapse of the Soviet Union that if they allow dissent or take steps towarddemocracy they will be dead or jailed in a decade and that no amount ofeconomic benefit is worth the destruction of their regime If increasingdemocratization is the test for access to the internationaltrading systemChina has flunked Yet sanctions against China are not in the cards            It is asif the White House thinks that the end of every story is a signing ceremony onthe White House lawn that the sole point is to sign documents and thendistribute the pens as party favors But useful functioning institutions arenot created by a single stroke of the pen            We remember the Marshall Plan today not because Secretaryof State George Marshall gave a great speech he didnt or because PresidentTruman maneuvered the bill creating the staff and bureaucracy of the EuropeanRecovery Administration through Congress We remember the Marshall Plan becauseTruman had followthrough He knew that stories did not end with a WhiteHouselawn signing ceremony and he fought for half a decade to breathe lifeand money into the Marshall Plan so that it would make a difference            Will anyone remember theWorld Trade Organization in half a century
