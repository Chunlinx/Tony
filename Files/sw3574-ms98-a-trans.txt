        being up up there maybe maybe you guys dont have as uh big a problem with air pollution as many do you     we we we have a terrible air pollution problem   do you really   our summers are extremely uh hazardous and during ah certain   umhum   wind directions because we get the uh Gary Indiana Chicago pollution   umhum umhum   and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze uh coming up along the lake   thats horrible umhum   and they do post uh uh warnings for people who have uh heart diseases or respiratory problems   umhum   during that summer season in the winter its not as severe   right   but uh if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad   uhhuh   uh the state of Wisconsin as a matter of fact uh started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting   uhhuh   ah i dont think its gonna go very far but it it was uh a way of ah triggering uh awareness   right right   so whats the conditions like in Dallas   well uh in Dallas i i havent seen air pollution quite on a quite on a level that we had in Denver uh i grew up in Denver and and ive lived there most of my life and we used to have those uh you know the posted warning days uh however in Colorado now they have the emissions control law which has really cut down probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post post warnings now you know as far as health concerns uh due to that emissions the the emissions uh   um   uh control on the vehicles seems that all of our all of our ah smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry     Wisconsin has a a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag   umhum   and theyre tested for uh their pollution control equipment and if they dont qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that its it is drivable   hm   so theyve theyve tried to do a lot of that and i you know uh there seem to be  at at least in certain little pockets and we were talking earlier about Madison   umhum umhum   Madison has one of the nicest uh bike uh road uh sharing programs of of any city in Wisconsin   oh really   in all of Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of uh bike trails for recreational use of any of the states   uhhuh uhhuh   and there is a a real promotion of of biking   uhhuh   but um there are still a lot of people wholl insist on on driving their own automobiles uh to go everywhere   right   i find that a little irritating because i dont think its always so necessary   umhum yeah yeah it it becomes it uh maybe to you and i who have grown up in some in some uh uh some more uh beautiful parts of the country uh i think that that uh we become a little more aware uh rather quickly of of whats happening with air pollution and how uh how horrible it really is um i i notice people in Dallas seem to say well sure theres air pollution but you know really how bad is how problem how bad could this problem really be um   send send them to Wisconsin and well let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from     oh really   uh the uh acid rain and theyll theyll they may wake up you know how would you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of the acid rain   uhhuh uhhuh um you right right   its a really a serious issue for those of us up in this ah sector up up here   do you find that um or or do you hypothesize that that most of the uh smog or or air pollution comes from vehicles or does it come mostly from industry up there   i think its mostly vehicles although  it does come from some of the industry of of the Gary area   oh yeah umhum   and uh i dont know exactly where it emerges from when it its up in the ah northern sectors of Wisconsin that causes the acid rain   umhum   that im a little uncertain of but i do know that uh it is a problem   umhum umhum i had talked with my parents i i grew up uh i was born in uh Muncie Indiana and and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute and i had asked them before uh i went back to visit recently about a year ago and i asked them i said did you ever realize the air pollution that was
