          okay   well lets start with you   okay um the last movie i saw was the Five Heartbeats and i liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it   Five Heartbeats   yeah its   who who was in that   its uh Robert Townsend movie   okay   um i i dont know all the actors or anything but it was just it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that   when was it out   um its still out now uh it came out i guess about a month or about a month and half ago something like that its about a black singing group it and uh it was called the Dells   umhum   and uh it was kind of like just about their their life and their uh       history and things like that and the way they went from from how they went from stardom to non stardom   yeah   and uh that was pretty good i enjoyed i saw Dances with Wolves have you seen that yeah   thats yeah i saw that one that was pretty good uh that won   yeah   best picture i think   uhhuh   and Costner got best director   yeah right now Kevin Costner i mean hes starring in everything hes doing the Kennedy movie thats coming out um and theres one yeah  yeah starring Kevin Costner   another Kennedy movie huh   and let me see what else um hes doing some other movie i cant i think Robin Hood thats it the Robin Hood movie coming out and hes going to be in also and let me see what else have i seen what have you seen   one comes to mind here and i cant im not sure about the name has Meryl Streep and um what was the name of that anyway the basis the premise of the story is that uh uh uh you go to a place after you die you go to a place called Judgment City   oh i know what youre talking about   and um anyway uh i cant remember the other the other actor uh   my its called Reviewing My Life or something like that   yeah and and uh   yeah i didnt get to see that   Defending Your Life Defending Your Life and its its an excellent movie uh its pretty entertaining uh   yeah thats it okay umhum hm   lets see what else have i seen lately um   one of my favorite movies its not one that ive havent seen i well its not a late movie its uh   Home Alone   Fatal Attraction   okay yeah   its probably my all time well not all time favorite but one of my favorites that i can watch over and over     yeah did well did you ever see Home Alone   no i never did i i heard it was really good ive never just havent gone out to see it was that pretty funny   that was a that was a that was a good one too yeah its pretty good and um   yeah yeah somehow just never made it to see that but i need to see it   i dont know i cant believe im just drawing a blank um because ive seen   yeah Fatal Attraction that i dont know why i like that movie so much i guess it was so much suspense   umhum   and i like suspense   that kinds of reminds me like uh did you ever see this is going way back uh Jagged Edge   yes uhhuh yeah on that order certainly is   that that was a good one too yeah but uh   and i liked the woman that played in that i forgot what her name is now   yeah thats   Anne Archer shes the one she was the wife in Fatal Attraction   oh okay   yeah and she played in uh Narrow Margin which was a little more recent   umhum   and that was kind of another suspense type Alfred Hitchcock type thriller that was good   yeah   um God i guess i havent seen too many movies lately i need to   i havent seen a whole lot either but  i know im drawing a blank on   yeah   what ive seen   umhum   and just   somehow i mean i its hard for me to get to the movies now because its getting so expensive you know id id rather rent   i know its  its obnoxious because you go in there and you spend six bucks a ticket but then you end up spending another six dollars on food   yeah yeah and thats just for a bocket a bucket of popcorn you know yeah   and a pop you know so its it gets pretty   yeah God forbid you should want something to drink with it but uh   yeah like if i so if i take a date it it it cost me you know twenty bucks easy   uhhuh oh yeah easily   and uh i dont know   and usually going to do usually going to go to a dinner go to dinner or something  with that   i was going to say you you know you can find certain restaurants that are nice and have good food for   yeah   eat eat for thirty dollars   its almost more fun really yeah its almost more fun really to rent movies you know just kind of stay at home maybe   yeah the problem is you always have to wait until theyre out   yeah thats true too   so thats what youre   yeah   youre uh dealing with   but then you can make your popcorn and you know be comfortable   thats true that is true   so umhum   um   well thats about all the movies ive seen recently   i ought to open the paper here because i know ive seen a few that have that played but um   yeah   i just cant come up with any names here havent havent been to one for a little while   umhum   but um did you ever see Kindergarten Cop   its no i never did   that was pretty good   was that Arnold Schwarzenegger   yeah umhum   yeah yeah   but um   theres a movie i do want to see uh  i havent seen it what is it oh Kiss Before Dying   okay   it looks it looks pretty suspenseful   yeah whose in that umhum another one i saw is called the Object of Beauty i dont remember recommend that as much as uh Defending Your Life but it was it was all right kind of funny um but um what else has been on and about   umhum are you looking in the paper oh   yep im trying to i wanted to get to the Silence of the Lambs i hear that   oh yeah that was great   pretty oh did you see that   yes that was that that might be one of my all time favorites too that was an excellent movie   yeah   it was pretty scary because i was visiting a VA Hospital uh near to where i live and they were saying that some of the patients there you cant leave by themselves because theyll make a weapon out of anything   umhum   you know out of a piece of paper they can kill somebody you know and this guy in Silence of the Lambs Hannibal Lector he was he was that kind of person and you they couldnt leave him alone and thats thats what was so scary about the movie   umhum umhum   you know since he was such an awesome character you know i mean it was it was really fascinating he was very dangerous but you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating   hm hm   but but they couldnt leave him alone at all and they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time but i wont tell you that just in case you see the movie   yeah ill probably try to go see   umhum   to see it in a little while here but its been out for a while   oh very good oh yeah oh yeah im not sure when itll be hitting video stores but it should be a while yet though   you heard anything on like Out for Justice   oh  i havent heard anything about it i but i dont like Steven Seagal things uh theyre just kind um   has he had very has has he had very many other movies out   hes had Out For Justice and there was one right before that with a similar title like uh i dont know some i dont know some macho title  thats why i i just dont like the   because its a macho movie   yeah it is i i dont i dont like that a lot i dont watch a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything like that either   speaking of that i think Terminator  is supposed to be out   yeah yeah that might be good though that might be good   i dont know ive enjoyed a lot of his movies uh they just uh theyre action filled and theyre a little bit of humor and   umhum umhum umhum   uh the   i guess i im not fond of the action packed movie where theyre always chasing or fighting or you know i like the more movies that make you think     yeah did you ever see um um Sleeping with the Enemy   no i havent seen that yet and thats something i really should have seen was that good did you see it   i havent i havent heard much lately i just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews   umhum yeah a friend of mine saw it and she said it was okay   yeah   you know it wasnt anything spectacular   you expect more out of uh Julia Roberts though   but the yeah the previews looked so good that i wanted to see it but i never did uh   did you ever see the original FX movie   yeah well i saw half of it and i remember i was in school i saw half of it and i fell asleep and everyone else watched it     oh okay because i was going to say i always enjoyed that i i uh i remember that movie and uh it was i mean i got into it   uhhuh umhum   and uh they have F FX  out   yeah yeah yeah   i dont know if   i really need to go see the original one im sure it was a good movie i just i probably had a test that day or something i dont know   uh yeah it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it yeah it its its its its uh   yeah umhum   i cant put it exactly on the lines of the Jagged Edge but it you know it uh kind of on that end you know you get these twists and   umhum yeah and that umhum umhum   its usually pretty good but uh   i think i think though that movies are losing their luster  kind of i think movies are losing their attractiveness just to a lot of people just i think i dont know because of the cost and i think it its just losing its originality   whats that   or something i dont i cant pinpoint pinpoint it but it doesnt seem like its as big uh rage to get to the movie theater as it used to be   yeah yeah   thats probably true i i i just   umhum   you see the same story lines different characters and   umhum yeah exactly   um i dont know its its its its its its hard to say and i know i dont   umhum   you know im i dont keep up with it   right   you know but uh i dont try to just just just for that reason reason it is a cost it does cost a lot so why   umhum umhum   go out and see something right away wait you know you kind of wait and if something gets really good reviews maybe youd finally go spend the twelve bucks you know to go to it   right right umhum   but um you know i havent been to a grand an opening for oh you know ages   umhum   just because
