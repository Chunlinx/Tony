             okay were talking about uh car repair the last car repair i had done on mine was last February it was uh uh  my car was inspected and then they said that the brakes werent adjusted properly and i had to go have it uh adjusted and it turned out that they needed repair and it cost like three hundred dollars   the brakes   to have that yeah for the brakes   what uh what did you have to have done to the with the brakes   oh i dont know they had they had a whole list of things you know you need to have this turned and that you know refinished i dont know i dont understand the whole process my personally which is one reason why i dont trust the auto repairmen i guess uh these car repair places but uh i hate to take it anytime because i know theyre going you know say oh you need this you need that and everything else in the book uh so i dont know  i havent had a terribly good experience a lot of times with car repair places uh years ago when i was living in California i went to my my my clutch cable had popped on my car the clutch had broken or something i dont know what was wrong so i took it to uh a transmission shop uh nationally recognized name and uh they had said uh well they he called me back that afternoon and they said oh yeah you need this you need that your transmissions faulty and all this and it was like you know six hundred dollars   jeez   and i said wait the cars not worth that much its its uh an eight year old car and its not worth that much uh ill just have to do later i said i dont dont do anything with it because im im not worth that much money on it and i went there after work my wife and i went there after work and uh they had the whole thing down and taken apart   umhum   so i told the guy i said you know i didnt authorize this i said you put it back together im taking it home and the guy said well it will have to be another day before we get it put back together  i started to go get a lawyer   umhum   you know because i didnt authorize anything and so he went and got his manager and the manager came out and says ill give you the parts at cost ill give you the labor for a hundred dollars and so for two hundred fifty dollars well do it all for you   oh really   yeah so i thought well hell meet me halfway ill meet him halfway so it all this work done for like two hundred and fifty dollars but still you know the the element of trust was gone at that point   yeah thats their way of capturing your pocketbook i guess for those who are least suspecting in a lot of regards i mean uh actually you probably had a better deal that way   yeah it was im sure it was so i got my uh transmission fixed with all my clutch um just the other day my clutch cable had had popped again and uh last year i i took it my car to a friend of mine to have the oil changed he worked at a at a car lube place and uh i asked him if he could adjust the clutch any because it was kind of loose and he looked at it and said sure he pulled the clutch cable out from inside the engine area and pulled the clip out that was attached attached to it and put it back further on on the cable well it was fine so i watched real carefully and and then  my clutch cable broke uh i went and uh i got a new uh clip that i had with me i bought an extra one and i just went there and and replaced it and was back moving again within three minutes and   umhum   there i was stuck on the road right in the middle of traffic but i managed to get it going again relatively quickly because i knew i watched what he did and was able to do it really fast and you know i just figured that if id taken it someplace they would have said oh you need a new clutch cable and this and that and you know two hundred fifty dollars later there it is you know   gee   i dont know i dont have much trust in those people but how about your experiences   well i generally try to find my own personal car mechanics   yeah   uh rather than taking it to a shop im kind of like you its uh i kind of equate them with some bad dentists   yeah   who try to find problems in your teeth which i have had that experience   yeah   and  thats a different subject so i better stay on cars               but the last problem i had with my vehicle was a  uh fuel pump that needed replacing and thats all the major problems ive had for a vehicle thats got eighty nine thousand miles   what kind of car you got   its a Nissan   okay that that explains it yeah ive got an American made car   yeah yeah its its been very good to me i im going to uh i i would eventually like to get into an American car but right now this ones doing fine for me   yeah   but then the other problem too is just a fuel filter and the fuel pump and ive had to replace a set of tires a couple times but that was due to quirks uh if you ever have a flat tire   uhhuh   dont ever have it plugged have a patch put on it   okay   because those plugs wear eventually will wear out all four of your tires   oh is that right   yeah because it causes an unevenness in the rubber and uh that happened to me twice before i caught on well enough to what what happened   hum   i had uh one tire uh plugged after a flat and somehow the unevenness of the plug just caused all all the other three tires to wear out   huh thats odd   so always have a patch put on   thats good to know though   its its happened to me twice and thats enough   yeah it is  thats more than enough well   other than that thats the major problems ive had i used to change my own oil and filter but i got tired of that so i let somebody else do it   yeah i do that myself i mean i i take it for places so because i figure for for eighteen dollars theyll mess with the oil and theyll mess with getting the things off and all that you know and its just it probably costs me at least six seven eight dollars to do it myself i figure for an extra ten dollars let them take care of it   yeah youre youre saving about uh ten bucks by doing it yourself but what the heck if you can afford it   yeah   um id rather change it myself myself but i dont have the facilities well enough all the time   yeah thats right   uh so thats the only major problems youve had then   who me   yeah   oh my clutch has gotten out a couple times and uh   what kind of vehicle   a Chevette   Chevette yeah   yeah lets see what else have i had done uh one day i was driving with my dad and the uh he was driving in fact and the uh uh stick shift came out in his hand  he driving down the road   um gee whiz     it just totally disengaged itself and you know of course then we had no way of of doing anything at that point we had to tow it home and uh and all that and it was like good grief and the car was new at that point it was only like a year or so old   umhum   uh and uh other things were going out on it you know and these repair people say oh you need need your your your your this and your thats gone out and its like good grief i dont even know what they do   umhum   so how am i supposed to trust them i dont know   yeah the only thing you can do is somehow through your own network and the friends find a mechanic through them   yeah thats all you can do   that they trust and and then im sure that that mechanics not going to do you in through their recommendation   yeah i was uh i had my car taken in uh to have the oil changed at the the place across from the the TI plant in Lewisville and uh they told me he says oh your your belts are all worn out and they need to be redone uh itd be like sixty dollars so i thought is that right i dont remember that having seen that theyre that bad so i took it to a friend of mines house and he looked at them he took the belts off and looked at them and he says no theyre not cracked or anything theyre theyre theyre in pretty good condition all i had to do is tighten them a little bit they need little bit of tightening   now what was it   theres was some belts that needed to be tightened   the belts umhum   they you know they were kind of loose and so but these people were telling me that they needed to be replaced   umhum   so   yeah i i know this guy thats a car mechanic and he told me i told him my belts are slipping a little bit and he said theyll last forever all you got to do is just tighten them   yeah yeah uh every time my dad had taken his car in to be worked on and they did something with the belts and they when they took the old belt off they cut it   umhum   and looks like its a standard deal easiest way to get it off and uh they just let it hang where it was basically instead of just taking it off and throwing it away and when he got home he noticed some strange sounds  so he opened it up and looked in there and there was the old belt wrapped around one of the uh axle things in there   umhum umhum   totally took him a halfhour to cut it off and  it totally engaged itself around the thing and boy was he he boy was he irate   hum   which i dont blame him you know hell i think he went back and showed it to them and really chewed them out for it  theres no excuse for that you know if your going to cut it off just grab it take it throw it away its simple   umhum umhum   oh well thats all i got to say   yeah i dont have that much problems so  with my vehicle knock on wood   yeah   excuse me i just remember a seventy nine Chevy Nova that i once had never again   yeah   that was a definite lemon   yeah thats what year mine is so thats the problems problem i guess   well i got rid of that one after it cost me megabucks     mine mines still running its twelve years old and its got uh seventy two thousand miles on it now so   thats not bad   no not that much
