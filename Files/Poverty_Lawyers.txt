becoming Americas costliest andmost divisive warYet simultaneously there was the social activism of the WarrenCourt and a national administration moved to declare a more worthycampaign in  the War on PovertyIt was a time when progressive young lawyers began a longstruggle  not yet won  for the right of all poor people to freeand effective legal counsel They are todays grayheads of thepoverty law bench as the new generation of public service lawyersaffectionately call them  a generation whose idealism comes at afar steeper price at least on the surfaceDaniel L Greenberg remembers a negligible difference in theaverage annual starting pay for poverty lawyers and theircounterparts at big Manhattan firms  and respectively The year was  said Mr Greenberg president andattorney in chief of the Legal Aid Society of New YorkThat year one firm doubled the starting salary and then theothers quickly followed suit said Mr Greenberg In part thefirms were saying that they were losing the best and the brightestto use the phrase of the time to the emerging new legalservicesNowadays a poverty lawyer working for one of New Yorks manyagencies representing the indigent  including Legal Aid the SouthBrooklyn Legal Services the Lawyers Alliance for New YorkInMotion the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights Volunteers ofLegal Service the Bronx Defenders and New York Lawyers for thePublic Interest  might begin his or her career at  perannum compared with the  average firstyear associatesalary at the citys larger firmsWhich is not to say that youthful idealism collapsed with theincredible inflation of private law firm salariesThere are reasons why people do this work its about largerthings you believe in said Lynn Vogelstein a documentaryfilmmaker who is now a staff attorney practicing family law atSouth Brooklyn Legal Services As a filmmaker she said I wassomewhat frustrated because the social impact is very indirectMy cases present me with incredibly interesting legal andintellectual issues about the role of government in peoples livesthe responsibility the state has in our lives  the intrusion ofthe state into peoples livesIm confronted by such issues every day said Ms Vogelstein a  graduate of New York University School of LawSometimes people think youre a dogooder and making this bigsacrifice but the thing is  I get to practice at so manydifferent levels which is something a lot of young lawyers inprivate practice dont realizeKatherine R Locker  knew her calling from childhoodgrowing up with a sister who suffered developmental disabilitiesMs Locker became a teacher then later went to Harvard Law SchoolToday she runs her own pilot project within the Juvenile RightsDivision of Legal AidFamilies like mine need lawyers even if they dont have themeans said Ms Locker supervising attorney for the Kathryn AMcDonald Education Advocacy Project named for the lateadministrator of the New York City Family Courts With the help ofa paralegal and two staff attorneys her project has a broadervision of legal advocacyWe spend a lot of time going to schools and negotiating withthe hope of resolving problems before litigation With theappropriate services people can surpass whats expected ofthemAt age  Sean Delany executive director of Lawyers Alliancefor New York which provides business services to nonprofitorganizations holds a perspective midway between the grayheads andthe new breed of poverty lawyerWhen he was at the University of Virginia School of Law in thelate s Mr Delany said Tuition was modest  persemester Today not only do law school graduates forego theopportunities of a large salary but they have these enormoustuition debt burdensA graduate of a toptier law school may carry a debt burden ofas much as  Some schools certainly not all credit aportion of tuition debt in return for public law service And lastAugust the American Bar Association created a Commission on LoanRepayment and Forgiveness to formulate ways to expand such creditsbeyond the relative handful of schools offering such help  usuallythe more wellendowed campuses such as NYU Law Harvard LawColumbia Law School and Yale Law SchoolBut no national standard of debt forgiveness is even near athand and the help that now exists does not mean that young povertylawyers do not worry about what they oweIm in a huge overwhelming sea of debt said Jennifer Arons a criminal defense staff attorney at Manhattan Legal Aid Sothe money things toughShe chose NYU Law over Columbia specifically because NYU wouldcover more of her tuition And she chose public interest lawbecause otherwise I would have been ostracized My parents wereMarxists and so were my grandparentsMs Arons and her officemate  Stephanie Schwartz  makesomething of a political odd couple at Legal Aid While Ms Aronswas a socalled red diaper baby Ms Schwartzs mother is CarolSchwartz a lawandorder Republican on the Council of the Districtof ColumbiaThey try to see her as less of a Republican said Ms Schwartzof her mother My father was a corporate lawyer and he hated itTheyre both proud of my underdog workOur criminal justice system is scary Most who have to gothrough it are poor people of color I worked in a prosecutorsoffice one summer I decided I could never be a prosecutorLike Ms Locker Michael A Rothenberg of New York Lawyers forthe Public Interest became hooked on

father  Stanley Rothenberg a partner at Moses  SingerLLP Father and son made a successful appeal before a SocialSecurity administrative board on behalf a learning disabledclientMy family was able to help me with school said MrRothenberg a graduate of NYU Law So unlike the truly newgeneration I wasnt faced with the debt burdenBut public service wasnt something I thought about he saidI knew what I wanted to do and money wasnt the issueIssue of MoneyFor better or for worse money can be an issue for young publicinterest lawyers  whether or not they have debts Can you reallylive on  in New York City Mr Rothenberg asked Itsdoable but its hard and there are sacrifices Im looking atways to raise salariesJohn Chip Gray Jr the project director at South BrooklynLegal Services and at  a veteran of poverty law said he likesto find lawyers in private practice willing to scale backTo cut your income by twothirds or more now that takescharacter said Mr Gray We get them that way sometimesI wasnt much interested in being a corporate lawyer My motherwas a Legal Aid attorney in Boston when I was growing up in thes said Mr Gray Your mothers a big influence on youSo it was an easy decision for me
