                                 Slate and Microsoft                                             Slate and Microsoft                                                         Slate                ispublished by Microsoft Corp Some people are concerned or even alarmed at thethought of the worlds largest software company getting into the mediabusiness Can                   Slate                tell it straight when it is owned byMicrosoft Since we are about to ask our readers to help us finance thisenterprise see last weeks Readme and since Microsoft is in the headlines these days thismay be a good moment to tell you how we see this issue            First as a practicalmatter in the year and a half                  Slate                has been coming out thecompany has not interfered in editorial decisions in any way Nor has anyMicrosoft higherup complained about any                   Slate                article even afterthe fact            Intheory too the alarm about Microsoft owning media properties seems oddCompare Microsoft with say Time Warner or News Corp Rupert Murdochsempire or other big media companies The potential conflicts of interest arefar greater for a publication that is part of a traditional media company thanfor one owned by a software company Time magazine bumps up against thevarious interests of its corporate parent many times in each issue includingevery time it reviews a book or a movie By contrast even lately with theantitrust controversy very little of what                   Slate                publishes hasanything to do with Microsofts other products and interests            There is legitimate concern about the concentration of themedia in large corporations of any sort But the special concern aboutMicrosoft entering the field is hard to understand Microsoft has been foundingnew journalistic institutions                   Slate                MSNBC etcnot buying upexisting ones Thus Microsofts media adventures add to diversity andcompetition among the media rather than reducing it This makes the complaintsof journalists in particular about Microsoft getting into the journalismbusiness especially puzzling A journalist who objects to a new company gettinginto journalism is a journalist with a secure job            Mediacompanies of course have decades of experience and in the case of TimeWarner if not Murdoch a reputation for integrity to protect Microsoft as anew kid on the block has no journalistic reputation yet either good or badBut Microsoft will need to establish a reputation for integrity and handsoffmanagement if it hopes to attract journalists and customers to its mediaproperties The company would be stupidly shortsighted to destroy thisreputation before it is even established in order to tilt the editorialproduct more in the companys favor And even Microsofts fiercest criticsrarely accuse this company of being stupid or shortsighted            Of course it may not be necessary for acorporate parent to interfere actively with the editorial content of media itowns Employees know which side their bread is buttered on In softwarecompanies like Microsoft a chunk of employees pay is in stock options whichgive employees an especially throbbing interest in the future prosperity oftheir employer Does this affect journalists ability to treat issues touchingthe company with the same lofty detachment they bring to issues that dont            Answermaybe As a practical matter once again we at                   Slate                think weplay it pretty straight though others inevitably will disagree Wecommissioned RalphNaders attack on Microsoft as soon as we heard about his campaign againstthe company Later we ran a piece defending the company More than once in discussions of thebrowser wars we have provided links to Netscape Navigators download page There are other examples and no doubt there arecounterexamples Root around the Compost and decide for yourself            In theory as well we as journalists have an even strongerselfinterest than our corporate employer in establishing                  Slate               sreputation for journalistic integrity We dont have to resist temptationnearly as often as employees of traditional media companies And some of thosecompanies by the way also use stock as an incentive            Now aslight disclaimer Despite all the completely compelling arguments offered inthe preceding paragraphs it would be silly and dishonest to insist that                  Slate                does or can treat Microsoft just as we would if it were notour employer And the same is true for any journalist working for any companywith varied interests The reality of ownership affects                   Slate                ina couple of ways we think            First we cannot actually forget that we workfor Microsoft The most we can aspire to is to imagine successfully how wewould treat Microsoft if we didnt work for it But this is an artifice and itis not foolproof There is the temptation to take the companys side and thecontrary temptation to prove ones independence with ostentatious criticismSince editors and writers get their ideas from their surroundingsMicrosoftprobably looms larger in                   Slate               s editorial landscape than it doesin that of other magazines On the other hand the simplest and always temptingsolution to conflictofinterest concerns is to take a pass on someMicrosoftrelated topics that you would otherwise treat Although we do thebest we canand we think our best is pretty goodit would be an amazingcoincidence if the result of all these opposing temptations and selfconsciouscalculations was exactly the same quantity and slant of Microsoft coverage asif there was no connection            Second                  Slate                will never give Microsoft the skeptical scrutiny itrequires as a powerful institution in American society any more thanTime  once again will sufficiently scrutinize Time Warner We can comepretty close to neutral reporting and analysis of news developments in featureslike TodaysPapers and TheWeekThe Spin At the other extreme if we discover that Bill Gatesmurdered Vince Foster or a similar megascoop journalistic bravado will easilytriumph over corporate loyalty But in the middle groundentrepreneurial andanalytical journalismno institution can reasonably be expected to audititself The standard to insist on is that the sins be of omission notdistortion There will be no major investigations of Microsoft in                  Slate                           The journalism reviews dote on episodes where somenewspaper runs an eightpart series about how its own ink is filled withcancercausing chemicals or whatnot However what guarantees that powerfulinstitutions get skeptical scrutiny isnt a lot ofstagy selfmutilation Itsdiversity of voices You cant trust a publication owned by Microsoft to keepan eye on Microsoft but you can expect it to keep an eye on Cond Nast and TimeWarner and youcan reasonably expect Cond Nast and Time Warner to keep an eyeon Microsoft By creating new journalistic institutionssometimes incompetition with established onesMicrosoft is adding to the total amount ofskeptical scrutiny going on            Or atleast at                   Slate                thats what were trying to do                           Michael Kinsley
