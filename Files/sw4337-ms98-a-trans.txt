                well   so uh what do you think about uh uh how trials in America are right now with the jury of nine or twelve do you think thats fair   well um i believe a trial by twelve uh peers is fair i dont think the need for a unanimous vote is fair   umhum   nothing in our world seems to be by unanimous vote   uhhuh   except that hm were too uh diverse a cultures i believe to make a complete agreement   umhum so you think that um majority rule majority rule is good enough for um deciding on a verdict of guilty or not guilty   i do   umhum   i really do   um something thats kind of interesting is uh i lived in Europe for a while and um in Germany they dont have trial by jury they have trial uh by usually three judges   and uh ive discussed with people and its its kind of interesting uh kind of an interesting concept it sounds strange at first not to have a jury by your peers but then um the argument for it is that um you know people off the street really dont know much about law   i agree with that   and yeah and and then uh i guess the argument is that theyre easily influenced you know by by tricks by lawyers you know who dos do more psychology than trying to teach them whats right and wrong and the law they they use uh you know techniques to sway their feelings whereas professional judges um you know know the ins and outs of the system better   i agree i think thats very true im um concerned that when we uh sentence a uh a criminal to for a certain amount of years that we dont really know what that means   umhum   you know ten years may mean one year in reality   right   and i dont think that most people are aware of that     umhum   you know i i wouldnt couldnt tell you if we sentenced someone tomorrow how long hed actually be in jail   uhhuh   could you   no   me either   no couldnt   and i think they kind of depend on that these criminals   right yeah definitely i dont know i think the that the um alternative is something interesting to look into uh   but it   if you you know instead of instead of juries just by by uh uh peers juries by professional judges   umhum   um but i guess uh that would take a major constitutional change here   definitely would but i see where they would be experts   right um i mean i see also how they were you know when they made the constitution they were uh afraid of that kind of thing that you know that um if the   um   government has all the power to decide whos guilty and whos not they wanted to make checks and balances against that   right it could really throw the checks and balances out of whack what if one of them is corrupt   right exactly   and he is the the decision the the main decision maker   right   you know the the theyre split either way   yeah its uh does carry an implicit danger with it that way   it does but thats kind of goes like our Supreme Court in a way   right  thats true too you know how does how does that work     and who gets to point those people the politicians   right     so they get to make the decision not the people   exactly i think it was i think it was more of a danger you know in the seventeen hundreds when um really you know like the King of England could decide whos guilty and whos not guilty i could see how they would       wanna protect against that so i think the danger is less today would be less of a risk of you know uh corrupt judges and the government forcing   umhum   uh you know someone to to be guilty for uh even though theyre not or vice versa you know um but its definitely something that would have to be watched very closely if they decided to do it that way   thats true i think a good start would be maybe some uh simple basic education into how the process really works for  children   exactly umhum   on up i mean i know i know that we all learned but i really dont see it where the children are learning it nowadays   right   they think its a big game and you know   right and and um you know what what does jury duty mean not not many people really   are are you willing to take off from work and lose a days pay or a weeks pay   uhhuh     is your boss willing to let you   right thats thats a really interesting issue too and um you know most people   yeah   another interesting thing is you know most most most people try and get out of jury duty right   oh definitely   so the people that actually become juries are its not really just a random sampling of the
