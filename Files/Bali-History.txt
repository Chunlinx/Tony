A Brief HistoryTodays Indonesians mainly descend from people who came from south China via the Malay peninsula and moved along the island chain to Java Bali Lombok and beyond from  to  bc Archaeological finds show that there was a flourishing Bronze Age culture in Bali and Lombok between about  and  bc Trade and cultural exchanges with Southeast Asia had certainly begun by that period and there were frequent contacts with India by ad About this time too wet rice cultivation was introduced to Bali changing the face of the countryside to its present appearance of rice paddy fields and terracesIndian traders and teachers brought Buddhism to Java It had only a limited influence in Bali however where people continued in their ancient animist beliefs worshipping the spirits of the mountains rivers and other natural forcesHinduism Comes to BaliIn the eighth and ninth centuries ad several Buddhist rulers in Java converted to Hinduism along with their subjects This time many people in Bali followed suit perhaps attracted by the complex Hindu mythology  the Balinese today still have a love of the old stories  and by the way their local gods could be housed easily in the crowded Hindu pantheon Around  the kingdom of East Java conquered Bali and the conversion process accelerated A mild form of the caste system and the concept of the Hindu trinity of Brahma Shiva and Vishnu were introduced But Bali was no mere vassal state of Java From  to  Airlangga son of the Balinese king Udayana ruled over East Java with the help of a Javanese princess while his young brother acted as regent in Bali During the th and th centuries Bali was often independentA powerful Hindu empire named after its capital Majapahit united all of Java by  The Majapahit general Gajah Mada reconquered Bali in  and annexed a large part of the Indonesian archipelago Hindu art and scholarship spread through the islands but on most of the islands this flowering was shortlived With the death in  of King Hayam Wurukin its last great ruler the empire of Majapahit began todeclineMuslim traders and teachers had already started converting several of Javas princes and people to Islam especially in coastal areas and in the th and th centuries the movement spread to the interior By the year  seeing their world breaking up many Majapahit aristocrats priests and scholars fled to Bali where their culture continued to flourish Islam never gained a strong foothold in Bali which was difficult to invade because of its many reefs and lack of harbors and had few products to attract traders The early th century also brought the first European ships to Indonesian waters when the Portuguese came in search of spices and set up trading posts  though not on BaliIn  Bali was united under Batu Renggong the formidable ruler known as Dewa Agung godking of Gelgel near Klungkung His men even succeeded in turning back the tide of Islam for a short while adding eastern Java and Lombok to his domains During his rule Balinese power culture and influence reached a peak with a boom in temple building and the associated crafts of sculpture and woodcarvingDuring the next  years Balis rulers fell to squabbling among themselves and the island split into ten or more rajadoms Balis contact with the Dutch was restricted to providing slaves  mainly Balinese who had broken the rajas laws or priests taboos  and soldiers for the army of the United Dutch East Indies Company Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC The company was the instrument of influence of the Netherlands until it went bankrupt in  and was superseded by the government Throughout the th century Dutch influence and authority slowly spread across the Indonesian archipelago but bypassed the relatively poor unimportant island ofBaliBetween  and  during the Napoleonic Wars Britain took control of Indonesia and seriously thought of staying once the wars were over Britains administrator Stamford Raffles who was named Lieutenant Governor even visited Bali and may have had it in mind to build a trading station here After the war however the British government decided to restore Dutch territory and interests  and Raffles found another site the island and future port of SingaporeThe Dutch Take OverOnce reestablished in Java the Dutch attempted to increase their influence and also to prevent the Balinese from plundering ships wrecked off the coast the Balinese considered shipwrecks to be gifts from the deities of the seas and felt it would be insulting to refuse them Following the looting of a ship in  the Dutch decided to use force Some  men recruited mainly from other Indonesian islands landed on the north coast in  and burned Singaraja Immediately the Balinese rajas agreed to stop the plundering of wrecks and to pay compensation for the  incident but it soon became clear that they had no intention of honoring the deal In  the Dutch landed a second military expedition in the north of Bali Advancing inland to attack theBalinese base at Jagaraga they were ambushed by a bigger but less wellarmed force led by Jelantik younger brother of the Raja of Bululeng In spite of appalling losses the Balinese won the day The defeated Dutch invaders retreated in disorder to their ships but the following year a third Dutch military expedition far stronger than its predecessors landed near Singaraja The northern rajadoms sued for peace they were offered terms calling for them to disarm and submit to Dutch rule The response of Jelantik was to fall back to Jagaraga and prepare to fight This time the Balinese were overwhelmed and thousands were killed some in a suicidal march towards enemy guns a ritual death in battle known in the Balinese language as puputan After a second Dutch landing at Padangbai Bay the puputan ritual was repeated when the Raja of Karangasem and his family threw themselves on the enemy gunsDuring the rest of the th century the Dutch using the rajas and other aristocrats as regents took control over most of Bali but their influence in the south remained limited This was emphasized in  when a ship wrecked off Sanur was plundered of its cargo The Dutch demanded reparations for this act the southern rajas refused In  a force of mainly Moluccan troops led by Dutch officers marched on Denpasar to enforce compliance They found the place almost deserted until suddenly the Raja of Badung together with his family and hundreds of courtiers emerged from the palace On a signal from the raja one of his priests stabbed him with a kris knife and then pausing only to stab their children first the rest of the royal party began a puputan either killing themselves or running suicidally towards the enemy When the dreadful scene was repeated by the Dewa Agung and his wives and followers in  in front of the palace at Klungkung the rajas resistance to Dutch rule was at an endThe public in the Netherlands was appalled by these grisly events From then on Bali and the Balinese came to be looked on as unique  to be protected from the colonial treatment that had turned the other islands into plantations exploited for profit Tourism was discouraged although a few foreigners did make the journey and returned to the outside world with news of the islands extraordinary culture An American couple Bob and Louise Koke opened the first hotel on Kuta Beach in  Louise G Kokes memoir Our Hotel In Bali provides an idyllic portrait of Balis first tenuous endeavor at tourism from  until the Japanese invasion in  During the s and s Cokorde Gde Agung Sukawati ruler of Ubud extended a long Sukawati family tradition of patronizing talent and craftsmanship by hosting visiting Western artists including the German painter Walter Spies who stayed for  years Spies influence revolutionized painting in Bali which had previously been one of the least inventive of Balis arts bound by repetitive conventions The Pita Maha school of young Westerninfluenced artists emerged also influenced by the Dutch pastelist Rudolf Bonnet putting Ubud on the world map of contemporary art Spies house and springfed swimming pool now part of the Tjampuhan Hotel were visited by Western artists academics musicians and stars of theater and film Deeply involved in Balinese culture Spies himself choreographed the stillperformed version of the most famous Balinese dance the kecak based on a story from the Ramayana When Germany invaded Holland in  Spies was interned as an enemy alien He died in  when a ship on which he was being transported to British Ceylon was torpedoed by theJapaneseFrom  until the start of World War II many young Indonesians received a Dutch education with the brightest students going to universities in the Netherlands The Dutch language gave the vast polyglot archipelago a sense of unity even among islands that had been bitter enemies for centuries Indonesian nationalism and a movement for independence from Holland gained strengthWar and IndependenceEarly in  soon after their attacks on Pearl Harbor and Singapore the Japanese invaded and occupied Indonesia with the intention of exploiting its oil and rice Until the end of World War II the difficult Japanese occupation continued with the surrender of Japan in August  Indonesia declared its independence The years from  to  saw the Dutch trying to reassert control however weakened as it was from years of Nazi occupation the Netherlands was not able to muster the huge forces needed to recapture all theislandsOn Bali in November  Indonesian nationalist fighters led by Ngurah Rai found themselves trapped by Dutch forces close to Marga north of Tabenan Outnumbered and outgunned Ngurah Rai and all  of his followers were killed in what is regarded as Balis last puputan Their sacrifice is commemorated by a monument and museum at the site together with stones bearing the names of each of those who died on the island of Bali during the struggle for independence see page Finally on  August  five years to the day after independence was first declared the fledgling Republic of Indonesia was recognized by the Netherlands Sukarno preeminent in the nationalist movement emerged as the new nations leaderThe  AfroAsian conference in Bandung heralded the arrival of the new nation and its leader Sukarno was welcomed to the world stage Together with Indias Nehru and Tito of Yugoslavia he was credited with the foundation of the nonaligned movementYears of ConfusionA succession of shortlived coalition governments wrestled with the problems posed by separatist movements of the various island groups dislocation caused by war and its aftermath a badly neglected infrastructure and the colonial legacy of overexploited plantations Frustrated by Indonesias loss of direction Sukarno declared a form of martial law in  A socalled guided democracy and an appointed national council and nonparty government took the place of the elected assembly and ineffectual coalitionsThe period between  and  was a surreal time of government by means of slogans and Orwellian acronyms Sukarno attempted to control the competing nationalist religious and communist groups NASAKOM was the word he used to represent their supposed common interests As if that wasnt enough processions paraded with placards emblazoned with MANIPOL Sukarnos political manifesto and DEKON his economic declaration written on them and there were others which condemned NEKOLIM neocolonialism and imperialism In the meantime the Indonesian economy collapsed and hyperinflation destroyed the currencyThe countrys limited foreignexchange reserves were squandered on windowdressing projects grand monuments and stadiums to host the Asian Games of  seen as part of a plan to bring Indonesia into the world spotlight International travel agents were given a tour of the country including a visit to Bali that coincided with an important Balinese ceremony in March  at the socalled mother temple Besakih on the slopes of the islands highest mountain Gunung Agung Portentously Gunung Agung though long dormant chose this particular moment to begin emitting smoke and firing rocks into the air but the ceremony went ahead anyway literally under a cloud The official guests had scarcely left Bali when Gunung Agung exploded in what was the most violent eruption the island had seen in centuries Lava flowed down its slopes but despite the impressions conveyed by reporters and by photographs seen in many books it covered only a limited area The chief instrument of destruction was the volcanic ash that showered down on the northern half of Bali covering it with a layer cm inches thick Crops were wiped out the rice terraces were devastated and starvation threatenedThe ash fall also blocked rivers but the dams it formed could not retain the waters for long When they broke torrents of mud and rock tore down the valleys and through the villages and towns along the river banks The official death toll of  was a wild underestimate The sky went black even over southern Bali although Denpasar received only a sprinkling of ashCoup and RevengeOn  September  a group of army conspirators who claimed they acted to prevent a possible coup against Sukarno kidnapped and killed six army generals In the following days General Suharto one of the most senior surviving commanders isolated the conspirators and effectively seized power The blame for the killings was pinned on the Communist Party the PKI which denied any involvement A pogrom was then unleashed first in Java and next in Bali with widespread killings of suspected Communists The Chinese minority mainly shopkeepers moneylenders and other small businesspeople were also a target In common with the other immigrant groups they had been compelled by law to display the flag of their country of origin even if a century had passed since their ancestors had come to Indonesia Throughout Indonesia every Chinese business marked by the flag of China and associated in peoples minds with communism was attacked The numbers killed will never be known in Bali alone the total casualties may have exceeded Sukarnos association with the PKI led to his being forced to yield most of his powers Only his honored role in the independence struggle saved him from trial In  Suharto took over the presidency Growth and ModernizationIn the decades following the economy stabilized as growing oil revenues fueled expansion The Chinese community backbone of the nations economy carefully rebuilt its commercial interests this time much less visibly Tourism to Bali was seen as a moneyspinner the s saw a rapid increase in the numbers of foreign visitors During the s the authorities decided to develop a more upmarket tourism on Bali Nusa Dua was designated to become a huge tourist enclave where only large luxury hotels would be built To bring the necessary volume of visitor traffic to fill all the new rooms Denpasar Airports runway was extended out into the sea to handle big airliners During the next decade Bali became one of the most prosperous places in the country In order to help Balinese better prepare for new jobs in the tourism market English language courses became mandatory in middle and secondary schools throughout theislandThe late s were a period of disillusionment with the longlived Suharto regimes many failings and widespread corruption As the Indonesian economy faltered ethnic conflicts erupted in many parts of the country even Lombok experienced a brief flareup of violence against Christians and ethnic Chinese But Bali with its unique Hindu culture and its international tourismoriented outlook has remained an island of stability throughout this unsettled period of Indonesian history
