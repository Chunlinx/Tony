                                 What Price ValuJet            Discount airlines ought tobe more dangerous             words postedFriday July  to be composted Friday July             The Federal AviationAdministration revealed Wednesday July  that ValuJet has applied to resumeflying You can be pretty sure the FAA is not going to approve this applicationcasually Regulators shut down the discount airline after the May  crash inFlorida that killed  people The past two months have seen a festival ofrecriminations about sloppy practices at both ValuJet and the FAA AWashington Post editorial declared The public needs evidence that thegovernment is insisting on the highest safety standards possible            A seeminglyunobjectionable sentimentbut there are two problems with it The first isthat the highest safety standards possible are too high You can always makeflyingor any other economic activitysafer by making it more expensiveincreasing the minimum distance between aircraft or time between takeoffsrequiring wider aisles and so on The inevitable tradeoff between safety andcost plus the law of diminishing returns dictates that you stop well short ofthe highest possible standards            Secondthere is no reason every airline should meet the same level of safety In factit makes perfect sense for discount airlines to be less safe than traditionalfullprice carriers This is no excuse for negligence and rulebreaking But ifthe rules dont recognize that some people quite rationally will wish to buyless safety for less money they are doing the flying public a disservice            Try some rough math on the back of an envelope Accordingto Transportation Secretary Federico Pea discount airlines have loweredticket prices on routes where they compete by an average of  or  to orfrom an airline hub The standard statistic on airline safety is that youcould fly once a day every day for  years before dying in an airplanecrash So suppose that flying discount made it  times more likely thatyou would die in a crash Now the odds are on a fatal crash in just years Is it worth itjust to save  Well by my calculation checked withfolks whose grounding in mathematics is sturdier and more recent youreincreasing your chance of a fatal crash by about one in  Looked at theother way paying the extra  to avoid the added risk and leavingaside other advantages of grownup airlines such as the delicious meals roomyseats punctual departures onboard golf courses etc puts an implicitvalue on your life of about  million            Now youmay think your life is worth  million but unless youve got  million tospend on it thats a hollow boast Every day you make decisionsprobablyincluding the decision to step outside your house and risk being torn apart byhounds as you pick up the morning paper you could after all hire someone tobring the paper inside for you every day just to be safethat implicitlyvalue your own life at less than  million Of course Freedom of Neuroses isone of the basic American liberties we celebrate this Independence Day weekendand people should be free to spend  to avoid a onein risk if theyso desire But society should not force them to do so And society in settingits rules cannot possibly value each persons life at  million withoutgrinding to a halt            In recent years the FAA has been struggling with thequestion of whether to require small children to fly in safety seats The rulehas long been that kids less than yearsold may sit in a parents lapandtherefore usually fly for free Flight attendants and other supporters ofsafety seats make a good argument that its a bit odd for the government torequire that coffee pots and adults be strapped down but not littlechildren But an FAAcommissioned study determined that requiring safety seatswould actually cost lives How By leading families to drive instead offly The study figured that the end of smallchildrenflyfree would raise theaverage fare for affected families by  causing onefifth of them to takethe car instead Whereas the safety seats would save an average of one childslife per decade the extra driving far more dangerous than flying would costnine lives Or so the study figured Critics objected to the calculations butthe principle of thinking about safety in this way survives any quibbling aboutthe numbers            You could think about thediscountairline question the same way Discounters carried some  millionpassengers last year What fraction of that number chose to fly instead ofdrive because of the cheap fare and how many of those would have died intraffic accidents if theyd driven Even in the tradeoff of lives for liveslet alone the less appealing tradeoff of lives for dollars making airlinestoo safe may be a bad deal            The discount airlines denyvehemently that they are less safe than the majors and the statistics show noclear connection between price and safety But if there isnt a connectionthats too bad Flying at a discount should be more dangerous Otherwiseyoure overpaying            SLATE News            Of all thegood stuff in this issue of SLATE Im probably most excited at having thewonderful
