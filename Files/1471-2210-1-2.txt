                    Background        Neural tube defects NTDs are major malformations of        the central nervous system CNS due to a defect in the        covering of the CNS They are among the most prevalent of        congenital malformations NTDs are second only to        congenital heart defects as a cause of perinatal mortality        due to birth defect and range in incidence from  to         per  live births depending on the country accounting        for  births worldwide annually        Factors that predispose individuals to NTDs are        numerous While folic acid deficiency and altered folic        acid metabolism have received widespread attention other        contributors are also important Socioeconomic status        genetic factors maternal illness and maternal drug        exposure are important contributors to the risk of        NTDs        Drug models of NTDs are valued because the drugs action        provides a possible explanation of the pathophysiology of        NTDs Valproic acid VA is a wellknown teratogen in both        animals and humans with a fold occurrence of spina        bifida SB in pregnant women exposed to the drug            The mechanism by which VA produces SB is unknown but        inhibition of folic acid metabolism is one hypothesis             Some investigators have brought the folic acid        hypothesis into question by demonstrating that folic acid        supplementation has no effect on VA exposed embryos        invitro      These studies suggest that another        mechanism may be responsible for the production of SB by        VA Other possible mechanisms include alteration of        neuronal membrane conductance sodium channel blockade or        altered neuronal calcium metabolism     VA is also        known to allow GABA the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter        of the CNS to accumulate in tissues        The role of GABA as a potential site for teratogen        activity for VA and other teratogens has been little        explored Preliminary reports have linked ligands active at        the GABA receptor with SB or other NTDs including        benzodiazepines alcohol and zinc                Preliminary work from this laboratory has shown the GABAa        receptor agonist muscimol and the GABAb agonist baclofen        produce both SB and the ArnoldChiari malformation        commonly associated with SB       VA appears to        produce most of its anticonvulsant effects by increasing        levels of GABA in the CNS presumably by inhibiting the        enzyme GABAtransaminase GABAT There is other evidence        to suggest that substances which alter the function of the        GABAergic system may contribute to the formation of NTDs        Alcohol has been associated with NTDs    and is known        to enhance the functioning of GABA Benzodiazepines BDZs        which enhance the activity of the GABA receptor also        enhance the teratogenic effects of VA in humans            Chlordiazepoxide another BDZ has been shown to produce        NTDs in the hamster            Further support for the contention that VA may produce        NTDs by way of GABA activity include the following        evidence One hypothesis of VAs mechanism of action holds        that it alters intracelluar pH This may be the case as        GABA can increase intracellular proton levels by        intensifying bicarbonate ion conductance through a        GABAgated channel    which may act as a developmental        handshake and regulate neuronal differentiation            The chloride channel an integral part of the GABA a        receptor has been implicated in embryonic development            GABA receptors are first seen at the time the neural        tube formation     Binding sites to GABA agonists and        antagonists and the expression of GABA receptor mRNAs are        seen starting at  days of development and peak at         days corresponding to the time of neural tube formation            Many neurotransmitters including GABA are growth        factor candidates for the CNS              Based on the above information we have undertaken this        study to systematically examine the effects of GABA        agonists and antagonists at both the GABA a and b receptor        and the role they may play in SB We used an established        model of SB in the rat to test the hypothesis using VA as a        known standard This model of SB uses the width of the        vertebral arch as an indicator of neural tube closure        While this model does not produce a specific SB lesion the        widening of the vertebral arch provides a model that        resembles human SB in terms of accompanying defects              and response to folate and other drugs              and meets the formal definition of a neural tube defect        any defect in the covering of the central nervous        system        We report here the effects of GABA a and b receptor        agonists and antagonists administered to rats at  days        gestation the period of neural tube formation                    Results and Discussion        A total of  embryos from  litters were examined        Measurements from the embryos were averaged for each litter        and the litter was used as the unit of analysis All        measurements were made in a blind manner ANOVA revealed a        significant effect of drug treatment of the average        vertebral arch distance F  p          The Bonferroni test was used for followup comparisons and        the comparisons to the normal saline group are given below        and in Table and in Figure where the results are        presented graphically Occasionally other defects were        noted in the embryos chiefly fused ribs these defects        were not appreciable and did not impact the vertebral arch        analysis There is no statistically significant        relationship between mean vertebral arch distance and mean        littler size        Valproic Acid produced a significant widening of the        vertebral arch in a manner consistent with previous reports        p              The GABAa agonist muscimol produced a significant        widening of the vertebral arch at all three doses tested           mgkg p for  mgkg p   for           mgkg The GABAa antagonist bicuculline also widened        vertebral arch distance at the  and  mgkg doses p          but not at the  mgkg dose        The GABAb agonist baclofen produced significant widening        of the vertebral arch at  mgkg p   but not at         or  mgkg The GABAb antagonist hydroxysaclofen        produced a significant narrowing of the vertebral arch at        all three doses tested p for  mgkg p for         mgkg and p for  mgkg        This study indicates that substances active at either        the GABA a or b receptors have teratogenic potential The        most striking feature of the drug effects is the        differential effect of antagonizing the GABAb receptor with        hydroxysaclofen While the GABAa agonist muscimol and        antagonist bicucullin widened the vertebral arch as did        the GABAb agonist baclofen the GABAb antagonist        hydroxysaclofen narrowed the vertebral arch Narrowing of        the vertebral arch was unexpected but has been previously        reported Previous work in this laboratory has demonstrated        narrowing of the vertebral arch when zinc is        coadministered with baclofen or muscimol     It is        unclear what the structural or functional consequence of        vertebral arch narrowing is Work in this laboratory has        shown lags in neuromuscular development associated with        excessive zinc exposure during neural tube formation and        possibly accompanying narrowing of the vertebral arches            Another curious finding of this study is that        widening of the vertebral arch occurs with either the GABAa        agonist muscimol or the antagonist bicuculline In classic        pharmacology it would be expected that the effects would be        opposite However in this instance it may be that any        disruption of the normal function of the GABAa receptor and        its integral chloride channel result in widening of the        vertebral arch On the other hand the GABAb receptor is not        directly linked to a chloride channel exerting its effect        via second messenger systems This functional difference        may allow for a classic agonistantagonist drug effect        during neural tube formation        One potential confound of this study is the role of        developmental delays Animals exposed to valproate and        presumably suffering from widened vertebral arches can show        weight differences well into postnatal life However        behavioral differences persist even when weight differences        no longer exist     However we are unaware of any        studies directly examining the spinal columns of animals        well into postnatal life therefore it is unclear if the        widening of the vertebral arch seen at  days persists        Another limitation to this study is the small sample sizes        for some groups and the administration of drugs to only one        day These results need to be replicated using larger        sample sizes and administering the drugs at other times        during gestation It is possible that these drugs may        disrupt neural tube formation if given outside of the        classic time frame for neural tube formation        GABA is a welldocumented neurotrophic agent involved in        brain development        Most of the work done        on the effects of GABA and neural development has been done        on embryos and embryonic tissue well past the neural tube        stage       However there is evidence of glutamic        acid decarboxylase GAD and GABA receptor expression about        the time of neural tube formation     Given that GABA        is important to neural development and the early        developmental time frame of the GABA system it is logical        that agents active at the GABA receptor ethanol BDZs can        have adverse consequences on CNS development Nearly all of        the substances examined are GABAa receptor ligands GABAb        receptor effects have been little studied and the role of        the GABAb receptor in neural development is little known        and should be more thoroughly investigated                    Conclusions        GABA may play an important role in neural tube formation        and the production of neural tube defects Substances        active at the GABA a or b receptor may be potentially        teratogenic In particular the findings indicate that GABA        a or b ligands are capable of altering neural formation        GABA may play a greater than appreciated role in neural        tube formation and may be important in neural tube defects        The narrowing of the vertebral arch produced by the GABA b        antagonist hydroxysalcofen suggests that GABA b receptor        may play an important but undefined role in neural tube        closure that differs from the GABA a receptor                    Materials and Methods                  Reference groups          Normal saline intraperitoneally IP  cc to

abdomen opened and the          uterus and uterine contents removed Fetuses were removed          and had their abdomens opened to allow for the          penetration of   M phosphate buffered formalin in          which they were immersed After three days fixation the          fetuses were stained for bone and cartilage as described          previously     Briefly the fetuses were eviscerated          and skinned Cartilage was stained with alcian blue          followed by bone staining with alizarin red The fetuses          were cleared in KOH and graded concentrations of          glycerol          After clearing the fetuses were inspected with a          dissecting microscope and the width of the vertebral arch          gap was measured with an eyepiece micrometer from T to          S
