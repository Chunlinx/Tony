        Mike the subject is almost laughable is there such a thing as an honest politician     well thats uh debatable if if you read the paper every day  looks like theres a new scandal breaking ever ever minute uh   oh i agree with you its amazing Will Rogers who was in the twenties and thirties if you hear the guy that gimmicks him and uses his same material it is pertinent today as it was then   yeah it is that guy that does the traveling show thats thats on Broadway and everything now   uh yeah umhum   yeah thats supposed to be great i dont know as long as there lawyers making up the majority of the state legislatures and the national Congress uh         i dont see a lot of change happening   attorneys yeah did you catch that the defensive driving course you can take to get out of a ticket was recently changed from two years to once every twelve months it was also noted in some journal that the percentage of ownership of the driving schools by legislatures has greatly increased   isnt that funny how that just happens to be a correlation   yes yes theyre not down there to to live off the salary of uh what theyre paid   im afraid not unfortunately   and course you know the  the famous joke is Japan does so good in business because they only let ten attorneys a year graduate each year and thats if fifteen had died the year before and   right i saw a a lawyer joke book the other day and it and the title of the joke was skid marks  and of course theres a major joke about skid marks and lawyers   yes yes uh   but uh i dont know it just its pretty disgusting every time you it its not just the unethical part of it its the selfserving part of it   umhum umhum   that bothers me about the politicians theyre all out either for a particular controlled interest group of some kind or maybe several uh and rather than really honestly decide issues on the basis of what is good for the country everybody decides them with this the constituency in mind or or afraid that theyre gonna hack off the wrong group or the other vote wise   umhum and wont get reelected   and yeah exactly and so we if we just limited terms senators especially   i agree with you a hundred percent   and even Supreme Court judges this appointing them for life is just absurd they wind up senile old men making decisions at eighty years old   oh i think all the way uh all the way down to dog catchers of the city yes sir limited turn   just just say that the most you can serve is a couple of terms and then get in there and then you could get in there and do the best possible job that you really feel like you should be doing and then youre out of there and go on to something else instead of this   two two umhum umhum you go to  you know get elected to another office and let somebody else pay you   because this exactly well at least youd decide things youd decide things from the stand point of whats best hopefully for whatever agency youre representing   uh you seen the benefits that yeah the benefits legislatures uh state and senate and uh and legislatures in Warshin get after theyve been there a few terms is unbelievable they get their salary for life health benefits for life   yeah i know   oh uh uh have have you ever noticed when   i just i just think we ought to we limit the President why not terms of the others and give theres plenty of other qualified people to run   what right they tried that in in Washington or was it or Oregon but speaker of the house was from there   umhum   and if approved it he would not have been eligible to continue representing and being speaker and so the voters voters kicked it said no we we since were the one with the with the gun right now were not gonna vote out having the gun control having the power   exactly hm   so when i i dont LBJs a perfect example of how somebody can be broke and get into politics and come out rich as yeah   thats right and above nothing either  starting with Duvall County       well they they used to say in advertising that the textbook example of good competitive advertising advertising is Hertz and Avis rent a car commercials number one number two i guess LBJ has to be a textbook example of politician without any morals   yep yeah thats thats probably true   i dont think one of the question question was could they legislate laws to keep politicians honest my opinion no because they wont pass laws against themselves   i havent yeah i dont well thats it when the very people making the laws are gonna be the ones who would have to pass those uh against themselves it it sort of uh goes without saying that itd be awfully awfully tough unless you could get the best thing that could happen uh to the state legislatures would be to be full of just independent independent independent businessmen or just businessmen working for companies that could somehow get their salary made   umhum let them   uh  justified you know or brought up to whatever over the state salary level uh   umhum
