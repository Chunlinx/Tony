                                 Water Works            Amid the flamboyant world of th century French painting no scandal attaches to the name JeanBaptiste Camille Corot no vivid anecdote or outrageous inyourface work ofart If Edgar Degas longed to be celebrated and unknown it was Corotapainter Degas greatly admiredwho achieved this paradoxical wish Hisselfeffacing devotion to his art and especially to landscape helped to pryopen the jaws of academic convention He claimed to have only one goal in life to make landscapes a commitment that precluded any other seriousattachment including marriage            Corot wasborn in  and his  th birthday is the pretext for twomesmerizing shows in New York this fall a wideranging retrospective at theMetropolitan Museum of Art and a more specialized show at the Brooklyn Museumbuilt around Corots Italian visits The son of fashionable Parisianmodistes  dealers in hats and accessories Corot lived comfortably on atrust fund until he himself became the fashion both among wealthyindustrialists who treasured his visions of the very rural serenity they werethreatening and among the rising young stars of the impressionistgenerationClaude Monet Berthe Morisot Camille Pissarrowho revered PapaCorot even as he disdained their blinding use of color He died in  ayear after the first impressionist exhibition            Corot is often referred to as a pioneer of pleinairpainting but as the Brooklyn show called In the Light of Italy Corot andEarly OpenAir Painting makes clear the practice of making outdoor sketchesin oil was wellestablished by the time of his first Italian campaign in The show places Corot in the company of an international cast ofpaintersincluding the littleknown Welsh painter Thomas Jones who producedsome astonishing studies of moldering Neapolitan walls with drying laundrydangling from balconiesall of whom worked outdoors in Rome and its environsfrom the s to about  But Corot could as well be called apleineeau painter so fluid and watery are his works The Tiber weavesamong Corots Italian sketches of the s and like several of the otherpainters in the Brooklyn exhibition he pays obligatory homage to the falls atthe Roman resort of Tivoli Still theres something parched in thesepaintings where the air is crisp and even the bodies of water have a solidityof form and contour that recalls and betrays the influence of Poussin            Then in after his return to France Corot painted his Old Testament sceneHagar in the Wilderness the first major painting in the Met showwhichportrayed Ishmael and his mother dying of thirst in the desert An angelappears above them a sort of cosmic bartender bringing a drink One thinks ofPhilip Larkins poem about a religion based on water And I should raise inthe east A glass of water Where anyangled light Would congregateendlessly Hagar made Corot famous and for the next four decades thefloodgates were loosed Water is everywhere in Corots work The Met in aneffort to show off Corots strengths in genres other than landscape makes roomfor his largescale Salon paintings few of which exist in Americancollections In these he reprised such religious and mythical shower scenes asthe baptism of Christ and Diana as she was spied upon by Actaeon During thefinal year of his life Corot was still fidgeting with the unconvincing antlerssprouting from poor Actaeons head In smallerscale works Corot wroughtchanges on a variety of more secular riparian subjects ferrymen fishermenwomen washing laundry or tossing each other playfully into the current            Something happened to Corots work around as though that revolutionary year had shaken his certainties as well He movedhowever not toward anything resembling social protest one of Corots rarerepresentations of modernizationa view of a textile factory with a womansitting at a preindustrial spinning wheel in the foregroundis more wistfulthan indignant Rather the change is stylistic All that was solid in his artbegins to melt creating the vaporousness that Monet and others so admired inCorots work The boundary between water and land so clear in the Italiansketches is increasingly blurred in the great souvenirs of the simaginary landscapes in which lakes reflections and mistenveloped trees allmeld together One critic complained that Corots foliage was like mashedpeas but another praised the intoxicating limpidity of Corots water Evenif we camped out in his studio we could never learn in  years how hesucceeds in rendering the beauty of water            Noneother than the emperor Napoleon III himself snatched up the gloriousSouvenir de Mortefontaine for  francs and hid it away in the palaceat Fountainebleau where he could admire in private the great horizontal sweepof the central tree and the standing womans posture echoed in another barertree Corot who obviously loved the painting hung a photograph of it overhis own bed Such paintings widely reproduced even during Corots lifetimeconfirmed his lasting fame as a landscapist After the gloomy events of thePrussian siege of Paris and the slaughter of the Commune that followed theglistening countryscapes that Corot exhibited in  seemed like areaffirmation of La Belle France herself            While Corot was drawn to the contemplative and even themonastic life he painted a peculiar series devoted to monks reading playingthe cello and praying he was by no means immune to feminine charm Hepraised the Roman women in particulartheir asses are spectacular heconfided to a friendthough he thought the Italian whores were overpriced TheMetropolitan retrospective also makes a case for Corots figure studies manyof which were painted during the final years of his life In the ravishingLady in Blue of  the adaptive model Emma Dobigny a favorite ofDegas as well shows off a cascade of blue clothshes a waterfall in reposeThe painting was owned by Degas good friend the industrialist and amateurpainter Henri Rouart who put it on public view for the first time at theParisian Exposition Universelle of  It was the sensation of that show asperhaps it will be of the Met retrospective But the Lady in Blue ishardly representative of the more austere figure studies that line the walls inthe final room of the Mets exhibition These uncompromising women with theirdry marmoreal features appealed to Derain and Picasso but theyll probablysend contemporary viewers back to the landscapes            By the turn of the centurythe most advanced painters were learning all they could from Corots exampleFor Van Gogh Corots reputation was fixed like the sun itself Monet takingrefuge in his own liquid world of waterlilies proclaimed in  There isonly one master hereCorot We are nothing compared to him nothing It isprecisely the astonishing popular success of Monets generation that has madeit difficult today to view Corot as anything other than as a precursor Thesheer profusion of these two exhibitions with their welcome mix of thefamiliar and the littleknown should prompt a muchneeded reassessment ofCorots subtle art To enter these shimmering shows now is as refreshing as adrink of cool water
