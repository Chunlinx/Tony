                okay uh lets see i i believe in the trial by jury i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for uh payoffs you know briberies uh unfairness onesidedness you know all those kinds of things and i i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody i really i really agree with the uh innocent until proven guilty theory i think thats thats a good way to do it you know thats about all   well i think i think basically were in a lot of agreement uh in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs uh some kind of legal definition   umhum   but for anything involving that a trial by jury certainly should be mandatory   umhum   but there should be uh with our overworked uh judicial system it seems to me like there ought to be a means of of um not having to take everything before a full court you know maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh as as as an example where called a jury duty now   umhum really   and and maybe instead of of uh just kind of blowing it off and just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do   umhum   maybe we should commit to spend a week and during that week youre kind of an ad hoc lets hear about it group of i dont know twenty five instead of twelve   umhum   and each each case is presented to that group of of twenty five and those cases are of lesser degrees of magnitude you know the guy was caught burgling uh and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught uh you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor     right   and theres not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works that guys going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time   yeah right   uh i just think our system is overworked and were starting to stress the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial   yeah thats thats a good idea maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of uh you know where they could go from there do they need a big lengthy uh twelve person jury jury or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things and the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how is this open and shut you know like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened you know a jury like that   you know we   yeah thats uh that could be a good idea to uh that could work   you know kind of deltaing off what what weve been talking about here uh i believe that   umhum   our weve weve become almost litigious uh society where were everyone everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff and although were supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we dont need to do that   yeah   uhhuh   you know maybe instead of of being so quick to sue you uh if you have a disagreement with someone instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you need you and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent need to go face this group of twenty five or a Judge Wapner like you know that they have on TV and let   huh yeah yeah   either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case and lets you know lets get rid of some of this harassment suing   yeah right that right thats thats a good idea i in the Bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them first and if that doesnt work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them and if that doesnt work to take it to the whole church so thats right off that same kind of principle   you bet and if   thats a thats a good idea   if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldnt have half the   yeah thats true thats true too but uh you know that whole Biblical concept like that thats true in a lot of our um you know the the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that it doesnt work on that but its based out of that and uh so that you know that could work there   yes id forgotten what thats called theres a a real name for that like the Judean law or something like that   um what is that called the JudoChristian ethic JudeoChristian ethic   well that may be right its in there some place i think we both know what that were talking about the foundation of our legal society   yeah right right right   uh to and too the that was sort of the the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly   umhum   uh i guess the the Lord started out with well treat you fairly ill treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say uh thats sort of the Old Testament version   yeah thats   i know i did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament where where theres a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and theres a loving Lord in the New Testament but thats a whole different subject     really really really yeah   okay well i i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on on the legal system   mine too yeah mine too   but its been a pleasure talking with you   yeah same here what what part of the country are you from   im living here in Texas   oh okay in in Texas okay i was just being curious   well thats quite all right   okay yeah well im im from the Dallas area oh okay well thats thats neat   well so am i  in fact im at work out at Lewisville   oh are you really wow okay well ill let you go and it was nice talking to you   my pleasure have a good day byebye
