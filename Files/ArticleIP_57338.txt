Bethlehem                        Dear Sus            As with bleedinghealing takes different amounts of time for different people Alas some peoplebleed to death Prudie wishes you peace of mind wherever you may find it Giveyourself some time to see how things play out and see how youre feeling aboutthings  well about him If you cant get over it get out of it            Prudie understandingly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I am having anongoing ordeal over whether my yearold daughter should refer to herstepfather as Dad Stepdad or by his first name Ive been remarried forsix years to my present husband and he insists that my daughter should referto him as either Dad or Mr Giles when addressing him My daughter calls myhusband by his first name which infuriates him because he believes it isdisrespectful My daughter insists he doesnt deserve to be called Dad andnow only makes reference to him when mentioning her stepfather to friends orrelatives Please advise about what would be the most appropriate way to handlethe situation                                       Mrs Giles                        Dear Mrs            Mr Giles sounds likea real beaut The form of address you understand is merely the battlegroundfor the simmering war between them Your daughter wont call him Dad whichhe wants and he wont permit a firstname address which is perfectlyacceptable which is what she wants And for whatever its worth Prudie hasnever heard of anyone saying Stepdad please pass the salt so forget thatone Someone maybe a family counselor needs to deal with the alienation theyoungster feels and the hostility harbored by your husband If you can find away to deal with and improve their relationship what she calls him will becomea moot point Reading between the lines it may be that the childs biologicalfather and your husbands own offspringsituation are part of the equation            Prudie worriedly                                             DearP                                                      Tell me if Im overreacting I was having lunchwith Danielle who works in hospital billings in the cafeteria Just inpassing I mentioned that I never received a thankyou note for my smallwedding gift Danielle insisted I was wrong and to prove it took me to heroffice where she pulled out this book of friends In it she had a page foreach of her friends and on my page was listed what I gave her and the date shewrote a thankyou note What was troubling was not so much that but the otherentriesincluding how friend responded to death of her father ieflowers card etc                                       I think heraccountants mind has gone too far I mean you cant measure everything andkeeping a ledger on your friends is odd I told her this and she said that inthe Jewish tradition they believe all your actions are inscribed in the bookand she is doing just that What do you think                                       Unsure                        Dear Un            Prudie thinks this womanis one sandwich shy of a picnic What she is referring to is Gods accountingnot hers The poor dear must have been reading Marvel comics in school whenthey talked about this It is true that the humanistic Jewish view holds thatthe substance of ones life is created by good deeds but a ledger toting upflowers and cards does not figure in Her misunderstanding reminds Prudie ofthe policeman who asked a driver what gear she was in at the moment her car hitanother Gucci sweats and Reeboks she said            Prudie rationally                                             Prudence                                                      I am a yearoldfemale and I have been married for six years and have a yearold son with myhusband He works a lot and our marriage hasnt been on track for about months now and we seem to be more like roommates than a married couple Idont know if hes cheating on me but he has been acting strangely Hes beencoming home at  am when he gets out of work at  in the morning He tellsme its because he goes to have coffee with his boss after they close the storewhere he works I dont know whether my marriage is over and whether to talk tohim about all this and ask if we can work things out One thing I do know isthat if my husband is cheating I wouldnt be able to stay with him                                       Confused                        Dear Con            My dear if your husband really is drinking coffeefrom  to  am he would need to wear Depends If you suspect he is takingan afterwork breather with someone other than his employer you could call theman and ask He may however not level with you In any case girlfriend orpool parlor you must get the problem out in the open            When you state your ageand the age of your child it sounds like you are in Romeo and Julietterritory If this is not a typo you are far too young to be dealing with allthe factors you mention Confront your husband with both your suspicions andyour awareness that things have gone off track See where the conversationgoes If he has a million complaints consider counseling if hes willing orseparate maintenance You cannot live like this and neednt tolerate hisinyourface behavior            Prudie proactively
