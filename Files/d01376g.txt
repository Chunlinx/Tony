United States General Accounting OfficeExecutive GuideGAOFebruary Maximizing the Success of Chief Information OfficersLearning From Leading OrganizationsGAOGPrefaceInformation technology IT has become integral to providinggovernment services and the management of information in thefederal government has moved out of the back office and off themainframe into the home and office and onto the Internet As thefederal government fully embraces ecommerce and other leadingedgeimplementations of IT that benefit citizens leadership in managingthe governments information resources becomes of paramountimportance The development of new service approaches and theenhancement of old ones in this new information era require theactive participation of information management organizations fromthe beginningThe efficient effective and innovative use of informationtechnology requires a level of leadership and focus that goesbeyond what would be provided in a technical support functionCongress recognized the need for greater leadership in informationmanagement and technology in the ClingerCohen Act of  whichmandated the position of chief information officer CIO forexecutive departments and agencies This act and other laws definethe general responsibilities of the CIO and many of the processesrequired to manage information in the federal governmentVirtually all of the major executive agencies have appointedCIOs and many have taken positive steps toward the implementationof important information management processes specified by law Toreap the full benefits of information management reform federalagencies must utilize the full potential of CIOs as informationmanagement leaders and active participants in the development ofagency strategic plans and policies The CIOs themselves must meetthe challenges of building credible organizations and developingand organizing information management capabilities to meet agencymission needsThis guide is intended to assist federal agencies in maximizingthe success of CIOs Principles and practices gleaned from the casestudies presented in our guide offer concrete suggestions on whatagency executives can do to ensure the effectiveness of their CIOorganizations The guide does not address all of theresponsibilities which fall to federal agency CIOs  only thosewhich have parallels in the private sector Moreover we find thatpractices used by federal agency CIOs tend to differ from thoseused by leading organizations We did not study the reasons forthese deviations specifically but they likely result from thecontext in which federal CIOs operate Both operational andstructural aspects of the CIOs environment can vary significantlyin the federal sector versus the private sector Rather than dwellon differences our study shows that there is much common groundbetween public and private CIO organizations on which to buildefforts for improvement The specific key conditions and strategiesdescribed in this guide can be used as suggestions for federal CIOsto apply or adapt to their environments where appropriateWe would like to thank the Private Sector Council and theleading practice organizations we selected for

GAOAIMD March  ContentsPageFederal Information Management ReformThe rapid pace of technological change and innovation in thecurrent information age poses wideranging opportunities forimproved information management and enhanced performance inachieving agency missions and goals At the same time however theproliferation of technology has brought with it a range of thornyissues surrounding managing and integrating complex processescomputer equipment and telecommunications networks In itsoversight role Congress has established a series of laws to definethe role of information management in government and to mandatebasic processes to manage the government information technologyIT investment This section provides a brief overview of thatlegislative historyThe federal governments management of its information resourcesto date has produced mixed results Consistent with reformlegislation agencies have taken constructive steps to implementmodern IT strategies systems and management practices andpolicies directed toward achieving cost savings increasingproductivity and improving the timeliness and quality of federalservice delivery To the extent that the nearly  billion inannual planned obligations for information technology can beinvested and managed more wisely federal programs will operatemore effectively and at less costFor years Congress has been working to increase theeffectiveness of information and technology management in thefederal government An early effort was the Brooks Act enacted in which called for centralized oversight of federal informationtechnology acquisitions by the General Services AdministrationGSA The Paperwork Reduction Act of  PRA applied life cyclemanagement principles to information management and focused onreducing the governments informationcollection burden To helpaccomplish this PRA designated senior information resourcesmanager positions in the major departments and agencies withresponsibility for a wide range of functions including informationresource planning budgeting organizing controlling trainingand ensuring the absence of duplication in information systems PRAalso created the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairswithin the Office of Management and Budget OMB to provide centraloversight of information management activities across the federalgovernmentIn the s Congress enacted additional laws holding agenciesaccountable for effective management of public informationresources In particular the Chief Financial Officers CFO Act of and the Government Management Reform Act of  spelled outan ambitious agenda to remedy the governments lack of usefulrelevant timely and reliable financial information For thegovernments major departments and agencies these laws established seniorlevel CFO positions  required annualfinancial statement audits and  set expectations for moremodern systems to support integrated management of budgetaccounting and program information The Government Performance andResults Act of  commonly known as GPRA or the Results Actrequired that agencies set strategic goals measure performancetoward those goals and report on their progress Effectiveimplementation of the Results Act hinges on agencies ability toproduce meaningfully integrated information to manage performanceand measure resultsIn this guide information management refers to all aspects ofthe management of all information resources including technologyfunds human capital and management processes as well as theunderlying information IT refers to technology used to support themanagement of informationFurther amendments to the PRA in  required that agenciesindicate in strategic information resources management plans howthey are applying information resources to improve theproductivity efficiency and effectiveness of government programsincluding improvements in the delivery of services to thepublicWith this increased focus on agency accountability also camerecognition of the need to elevate the agencies informationmanagement positions to more strategic executive levelscomparable to the CFO positions created in  The ClingerCohenAct of  amended the PRA renaming and elevating formerinformation resources manager positions to executivelevel CIOs whoreport directly to the agency head and have information managementas a primary responsibility The new information management leadersare accountable for not only the range of information managementactivities outlined in the PRA but also for more strategic ITfunctions such as developing architectures managing portfoliosand measuring the performance of information technologyinvestments Among other things the ClingerCohen Act also required senior executive involvement in IT decisionmaking imposed muchneeded discipline in acquiring and managing technologyresources  called for the redesign of inefficient workprocesses before investing in technology and  repealed theBrooks Act eliminating GSAs central acquisition authorityPrimary procurement responsibility now rests directly with federalagenciesTogether with a number of other laws enacted over the pastseveral years to foster improvements in such areas as financialmanagement acquisition and computer security this legislationdiscussed above composes a statutory framework for achievingperformancebased management and accountability in not justinformation management but overall federal management AppendixI provides a list of these key federal laws affecting informationmanagement As the executive leaders for information andtechnology management federal CIOs have a key role in helpingtheir agencies fulfill many of the provisions embodied in thismanagement reform frameworkEven with the guidance provided by OMB for establishing the newinformation technology management leadership positions agenciesface distinct challenges in effectively positioning federal CIOsand supporting organizations to ensure that information managementadds value in their businessmission performance  CIOs in thefederal sector face structural and cultural hurdles generally notfound elsewhere Some of these additional challenges are describedin the final section of this guideManaging for Results The Statutory Framework forPerformanceBased Management and AccountabilityGAOGGDAIMD January   and Managing for ResultsThe Statutory Framework for Improving Federal Management andEffectiveness GAOTGGDAIMD June  OMB guidance on implementing federal CIO positions includesMemorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments andEstablishments Implementation of the Information TechnologyManagement Reform Act of  M April   andMemorandum for the Presidents Management Council What Makes aGood CIO June  Overview of Fundamental PrinciplesThe basis for this guide is the belief that federal agenciescould benefit from examples set by a few leading organizationswhose CIO organizations have gained a reputation for outstandinginformation management in their enterprises This work is intendedto provide pragmatic guidance that federal agencies can consider indetermining how best to integrate CIO functions into theirrespective organizations Our target audience includes seniorfederal executives and managers although our observations can alsoprovide insights for senior information management officialsthroughout the public and private sectors Appendix II providesmore details on the objectives scope and methodology of ourwork Based on interviews with privatesector and state CIOs andother research we have developed a framework of critical successfactors and leading principles The balance of this guide describesthis framework and its application to CIOs in the federalgovernmentCIOs of leading organizations we interviewed described aconsistent set of key principles of information management thatthey believed contributed to the successful execution of theirresponsibilities These principles touch on specific aspects oftheir organizational management such as formal and informalrelationships among the CIO and others business practices andprocesses and critical CIO functions and leadership activitiesThe specific nature of these principles varied depending on theorganizations mission size culture and other factors but eachunderlying key principle was consistently observedThe CIOs interviewed considered these principles instrumentalbecause they address critical organizational and operationalaspects of the CIOs role Notably the principles address seniorexecutives responsibility for creating an effective managementcontext for their CIOs as well as the CIOs responsibilities forbuilding credibility and organizing information technology andmanagement to meet business needs The practices are not new ideasin the general management of organizations but rather are theapplication of wellfounded principles in the maturing area ofinformation technology and managementThese principles are most effective when implemented together ina mutually reinforcing manner As ad hoc efforts each individualprinciple addresses a single aspect that is necessary but is notsufficient for success by itself The failure to execute a singleprinciple may render the others less effective Further althoughthere is no precedence among the principles organizationalconditions may make it more feasible to address one principlebefore another For example the chief executive officer CEO mayposition the CIO for success in advance of hiring a new CIO whilethe other principles await the CIOs attentionFigure  illustrates the six fundamental principles described bythe CIOs interviewed during the development of this guide Inaddition for each principle several key characteristics oforganizations that successfully execute these principles arelisted These key characteristics can provide insights into whatconstitutes successful CIO organizationsFigure  Six Principles and Key Characteristics of CIOManagement in Leading OrganizationsEvaluating the intent of the six principles we observed thatthey naturally fell into three distinct sets which we refer to ascritical success factors Figure  illustrates the six principlesand their relationship with the three critical success factors andtheir respective organizational fociFigure  Critical Success Factors and OrganizationalRelationshipsCritical Success FactorsPrinciplesOrganizational Focia COOChief Operating OfficerUnderstanding the six principles in terms of critical successfactors is particularly useful because of characteristics that areshared by principles within the same success factor Following is abrief description of each critical success factorAlign Information Management Leadership for Value CreationThe principles under the first critical success factor AlignInformation Management Leadership for Value Creation advocate theneed to recognize the role of information management in creatingvalue and positioning the CIO for success both of these principlesaddress issues of senior executive support Both principles requirethat the leaders of the enterprise embrace the critical roleinformation management can play in the success of the organizationand the leadership role the CIO must play in order for informationtechnology and management to meet its potential The firstprinciple addresses the acceptance of this premise by seniorexecutive management and the second ensures that the CIO has theorganizational legitimacy to execute his or her rolePromote Organizational CredibilityWhile the first success factor refers to legitimacy at astrategic planning level this success factor addresses a moreoperational level The principle that addresses the need to ensurethe credibility of the CIO organization and the principle thatencourages measuring success and demonstrating results if executedsuccessfully will lead to the confidence of those with operationalresponsibility in the enterprise Without credibility the CIOorganization will struggle to be accepted as a full participant inthe development of new organizational systems and processesExecute CIO ResponsibilitiesThe last critical success factor Execute CIO Responsibilitiesaddresses the need to organize information resources to meetbusiness needs and to develop the associated human capital Thesetwo principles provide the foundation for the CIOs effectivenessin carrying out the CIO organizations specific responsibilitiesOnce executive management endorses the centrality of the CIOorganization and becomes a partner in the development of newsystems the CIO organization must execute its responsibilitiessuccessfullyThe last section in figure  Organizational Foci illustrateshow both principles within a single critical success factor requirethe same organizational units to collaborate in their executionBoth principles within a critical success factor also focus on thesame organizational units as targets of their implementation Forexample in the case of Promote Organizational Credibility bothprinciples rely on the collaboration of senior executives anddivision heads for success and have as their target the seniormanagement of the enterpriseThe common features within a critical success factor can becomeespecially significant as the CIO and other players plan theexecution of the six principles described in this guide As thisgroup plans its strategy it can utilize the commonality amongprinciples to link initiatives and utilize the synergy betweenrelated efforts For example while organizing informationresources to meet enterprise needs and developing human capital aredistinct initiatives they share extensive areas of commonalityExecuting both principles inPage  GAOG CIO Executive Guideconjunction with each other can create opportunities forefficiency and effectiveness not otherwise availableFinally the organization of principles into critical successfactors illustrates the extent to which the work of a successfulCIO must extend throughout the enterprise In particular the rolethat the CEO and other senior managers play in ensuring the successof the CIO should be noted While it is the responsibility of theCIO to execute the specific responsibilities of his or herposition it became clear to us during our case studies that thesuccessful CIO relies extensively on both vertical and horizontalrelationships within the enterprise in order to carry out theseresponsibilitiesThis executive guide includes examples from our case studyorganizations as well as information from selected federalorganizations which helped us confirm the applicability of ourfindings to federal government experience At the conclusion ofeach principle we provide a case study to describe the principlein practice at one of the organizations we visited as well asstrategies to consider when implementing the principle Althoughthis guide focuses on fundamental practices rather than detailedguidance the examples illustrate and complement much of thespecific guidance contained in similar and related GAO documentscited in appendix IIIThe Federal CIO Environment TodayThe CIO position in the federal government is still evolvingAgencies are learning how a CIO can help improve effectiveness andefficiency and better realize the benefits of their informationresources Current federal CIOs are learning how to carry out theirresponsibilities in the federal environment with all of theincumbent expectations and constraints Both the agencies and theCIOs are working to meet the letter and intent of the ClingerCohenAct and associated legislation effectively The principles offeredin this guide are intended to provide insight into what CIOs atleading organizations consider critical to their success andprovide advice to federal CIOs and senior agency management as theywork to improve the use of information technology and management inthe federal governmentThe federal CIO faces an environment that includes many of theelements encountered by CIOs interviewed for this guide At thesame time the federal CIO faces additional challenges as a resultof specific legislative responsibilities eg records managementand defined contracting requirements The federal CIO is alsosubject to a funding process that is more complex and uncertainthan in most other organizations The effect of the appropriationsprocess and the highly distributed management structures found inseveral federal agencies tend to move some of the control ofprocesses having to do with information management away from theCIO Together these characteristics among others differentiatethe federal CIO environment from other environments Thesedifferences and their impact on the framework developed in thisguide will be discussed in the Using this Guide section Thefollowing discussion focuses on the common elements among theprivate state and federal sectors and the application of theframework across all threeIn a series of oneonone interviews with half of the FederalCIO Council we found that federal organizations face many of thesame issues as their privatesector and state governmentcounterparts Specifically federal organizations must overcome thechallenges of effectively linking information technology andmanagement to agency missions positioning and legitimizinginformation management leadership measuring performance andbuilding capabilities and skills Our meeting with five members ofthe Federal Small Agency CIO Council and a number of independentstudies provide similar conclusions The six principles thatemerged from our discussions with privatesector and stategovernment CIOs also describe the general areas that federal CIOsagreed needed to be addressed However the specific approaches toexecuting those principles tended to differ among the varioussectorsThe Federal Chief Information Officer Third Annual Top TenChallenges Survey Association for Federal Information ResourcesManagement November

Annual ITAASurvey of Federal CIOs Grant Thornton LLP December  andIACCIO Task Force Draft Report Federal Chief InformationOfficers Working Group and Industry Advisory Council July In three of the principle areas the level to which practices ofleading private versus federal organizations have evolved issignificantly different For example in principle I while leadingorganizations generally include their CIOs in executive businessdecisionmaking in the federal government setting informationmanagement is still often viewed as a support function rather thana strategic activity Leading organizations also consider variousleadership models and position their CIOs at a clear executivelevel as in principle II In contrast federal CIO implementationis in more nascent stages lacking criteria for matching CIO typeswith organizational needs Further in principle V while leadingorganizations are flexible in reassigning staff and structuringcapabilities across business and technology lines federal staffingpractices and organizational structures are less flexible innaturePerformance measurement principle IV and informationmanagement human capital development principle VI are two areasthat private state and federal CIOs all agreed must be addressedin order for the CIO and the supporting organization to besuccessful Practices used by both the private and public sectorsin the area of performance measurement are still evolving In bothperformance measurement and human capital development practicesused by the federal CIOs differed from those of CIOs in leadingorganizations though federal CIOs were actively trying to addressthe issues Differences in the approaches used probably resultedfrom specific constraints in the federal CIO environment includinga focus on nonfinancial program benefits rather than financialreturn on investmentsCredibility building principle III is the one area in whichCIOs in both the public and private sector have all adopted similarpractices The precise application of the practices depended on thespecific contexts of their organizations but the approaches wereconsistent It may be noted that this is one of the few principlesthat CIOs may address themselves without regard to organizationalconstraints or CEO support Of course as stated earlier theeffectiveness of this principle is moderated by the extent to whichthe other principles have been implementedThe following table summarizes the practices of our sampleorganizations in each principle area and compares them withpractices in the federal CIO environmentTable  Comparison of Leading Practices and Federal CIOManagement PracticesIn terms of critical success factors federal CIO organizationstend to trail the CIOs interviewed for this guide in the AlignInformation Management Leadership for Value Creation and ExecuteCIO Responsibilities factors The successful execution of thesetwo critical success factors depends to a great extent on officialsother than the CIO In the first success factor the CIO depends toa great extent on the other senior executive officers to supportthe inclusion of the CIO in critical strategic discussions In theother factor the federal CIO tends to be constrained byorganizational attributes typical of the federal sector Theseattributes include but are not limited to relatively littleflexibility in financial reward systems and highly distributedorganizational structures in a number of federal agenciesThis is not to say that there are no examples of progress in thefederal sector in either of these two success factors The federalresponse to the year  computing challenge created anopportunity in many agencies for CIO and program organizations topartner in responding to specific agency mission needs Thispartnering took place at the senior executive level and contributedto the success of the federal YK effort In addition the CIOCouncil the Office of Personnel Management and individualagencies have been working together to develop new approaches tocompensating and retaining information technology and managementworkersIt is interesting to note that the remaining critical successfactor Promote Organizational Credibility is executed about thesame within all sectors since all sectors approach principle IIIsimilarly and no sector executes principle IV well As noted itis within this critical success factor that the CIO is able tooperate with the greatest individual flexibilityTable  indicates that a gap exists between the practices offederal CIOs and CIOs of leading organizations Areas in which gapsexist should be examined carefully to understand the basis for thedifferences as well as opportunities for greater implementation ofthe principles It is possible that the business context forfederal CIOs is sufficiently different from that of CIOs in leadingorganizations that lessons learned may not be applicable Some ofthese differences are described in the final section of this guideAt the same time an understanding of the information technologyand management practices of leading organizations could contributeto the development of improved CIO management practices in thefederal sectorThe following sections describe each of the general principlesand practices discovered in our work with leading CIOorganizationsCritical Success FactorsPrinciplesOrganizational FociCritical Success Factor  Align Information ManagementLeadership for Value CreationThe CIO and supporting organization must have active support andcommitment at the very top of the enterprise or they will remainlimited and tangential to the business despite their potentialcontribution to mission accomplishment This first critical successfactor focuses on the role of the senior executive of theenterprise in developing a culture that includes the CIO inseniorlevel decision making and that assumes the potential of ITin creating value for the enterprise Executive leadership isessential to the successful execution of this factorA common theme among the CIOs we interviewed was that themessage of the importance of IT to the organization must becommunicated at the highest levels Senior executives must embracethe central role of technology and the CIO must be a fullparticipating member at the table with them as business strategy isdiscussed This behavior begins with the CEO who sets the examplefor senior and midlevel executives and through them the rest ofthe organization In addition the participation of the CIO inlongrange strategic planning is necessary to take full advantageof the opportunities IT can provide and to ensure that thetechnology infrastructure is in place as business strategiesdevelopPrinciple I Recognize the Role of Information Management inCreating ValueThe CIOs ability to add value is the biggest single factor indetermining whether the organization views IT as an asset or aliabilityInstituting an effective CIO organization does not start withselection or placement of an information technology and managementleader nor does it begin with establishing a structure formanaging information resources and activities Rather it beginswith consideration on the part of executivelevel managers of therole of IT and how vital it is to accomplishing mission objectivesIt also entails thinking about ways to incorporate the informationtechnology and management leader in the executivelevel managementstructure and create an environment that facilitatesbusinesstechnology sharing and exchange of ideas Moreover CEOsand governors can set powerful examples through their own strongrelationships with CIOs Such relationships symbolize theimportance of information technology and management within theirorganizationsKey CharacteristicsSenior executives have primary responsibility for setting thebusiness context for their CIOs and formulating strategies forintegrating information technology and management into theirbusiness operations Executives of leading organizations no longerregard technology management as a separate support function andinstead strive to understand how investments in informationresources are made and how they integrate with other investmentsand the overall business vision These executives also increasinglyfocus on the management operations program and service deliverybenefits and performance of their major strategic informationsystems CEOs have a key role in setting the example for the restof the agency to follow in seeking to understand informationtechnology and management concepts and appreciating the strategicrole that information technology and management can play in helpingto accomplish business objectives Viewing information andtechnology not just as assets to manage these CEOs assign theirinformation technology and management leaders a prominent role inbusiness decision making Recognizing the business transformationpotential of IT these executives also position their CIOs aschange agents with responsibility for applying technology toachieve major improvements in fundamental business processes andoperations With CEO support the CIOs are in a good position tohave significant impact on not just IT but the entire businessenterpriseFollowing the CEOs lead members of the senior executive teamlearn to value the advice of the CIO in setting business directionsand developing strategies for improving organizational capabilitiesand competitiveness They seek to embrace fundamental informationtechnology and management principles and work with their CIOs todevelop a shared vision of the role of IT within the businesscontext They engage in dialogue onPage  GAOG CIO Executive Guideways that technology can be incorporated to improve businessprocesses outputs and outcomes They incorporate informationmanagement as an intrinsic part of their business planning anddecision making processes discussing the benefits and risksassociated with specific strategies for improving service reducingcycle time or reducing costsIn leading organizations senior managers make joint decisionson information resources formulate business plans and setperformance expectations Increasingly managers make IT investmentdecisions based on the value of the investments to theirenterprises not just to a specific business unit or function Byasking strategic and operational questions at the beginning of theplanning and evaluation period senior managers gain a betterunderstanding of the potential benefits and value of ITInformation and technology managers in leading organizations arealso adopting processes that help them quantify and align projectswith their organizations business planning and measurementprocesses They produce plans that link to overall business plansand assign managers to act as liaisons between business units andCIO organizations Increasingly managers also focus on measuringreliability responsiveness and customer satisfaction which inthe eyes of senior management are just as important as strictlyfinancial measuresLeading organizations work to create environments that areconducive to sharing ideas on how information technology cansupport the businesses and vice versa They adopt formal mechanismsand structures that facilitate the ability of their businesses andinformation technology and management leaders to understand andcommunicate one anothers issues and work together to accomplish ashared business vision These mechanisms and structures includeforums councils and boards for discussion and exchange onbusiness and technology issues Such forums help promoteorganizationwide perspective and facilitate the ability to achieveconsensus or stakeholder buyin to businesstechnology directionsFor example one state has a strategic planning forum that bringstogether major stakeholders statewide to identify strategic andtactical issues including IT issues confronting the state Thestate prepares a strategic planning document based on thisstakeholder input This process has helped to integrate informationmanagement into overall business planning by aligning IT productsand services with business functions and linking technology to thestates overall strategic directionTo further support the businesstechnology collaborationleading organizations adopt a common business language skillfullyavoiding technical jargon and instead using language that generalmanagers and legislatures can understand They use analogiesterminology and processes that help fuse business and technologyinterests and ideas together Other strategies forbusinesstechnology learning include informal activities such asnewsletters presentations reports and servicelevel resultsplaced in common areas to communicate the effectiveness of theirCIO organizations Leading organizations further the twowayexchange of ideas and perspectives by bringing in experts from thefield to advise or educate managers on recent trends anddevelopments in both the business and technology arenas Realizingthat attitudes expectations and culture seldom change quicklythey plan for whatever time and resources are necessary to create acommon ground and organizational cohesiveness Their efforts go along way in shoring up commitment from across the organization tostrategies for achieving common goalsLeading organizations also focus on hiring managers who bring ahybrid of business and technical expertise to the organization Onelarge multinational corporation uses technical facilitators tosupport its initiatives In the past this company had experiencedproblems in sharing information resources Managers in thedifferent lines of business were unwilling to share informationresources because each felt his or her particular line of businesswas unique Because technology was becoming critical to futuresuccess in this business sector top managers were increasinglyassigned to support and manage the companys internal informationmanagement functions Several of the managers assigned had bothbusiness and technology acumen and had the ability to raisebusiness issues from a technical perspective in a nonthreateningmanner In resolving business issues they were sometimes able toidentify more efficient technical opportunitiesCase Study Recognizing the Role of Information Management inCreating ValueDue to changes in market conditions and requirements forincreased productivity through using common components a largemanufacturing company decided that it needed to make major changesin the way it managed IT to support the business The company hadoutsourced its information management function but lacked theinfrastructure to provide strategic direction discipline andoverall management of information management to ensure optimalimplementation and cost Given this situation the company wasfaced with a proliferation of legacy systems and inefficientbusiness processes built around them The company also met withbureaucratic business resistance to change to a common informationsystems environmentBy way of improvement senior executives adopted a new ITstrategic direction and focus that tracked back to the companysbusiness priorities common lean and fast global and growthSenior management then hired a CIO as a change agent reporting tothe Vice Chairman and the companys senior decision making counciland gave him responsibility for transforming the IT functionthereby making him an enabler of the function and an integral partof the business strategyThe CIO recruited an IT management team that understood both thebusiness and technical sides of the enterprise He instituted amatrix management organization creating a leadership structurethat provided flexibility for meeting future information managementneeds as well as maintaining existing IT systems The new ITorganization became responsible for such strategic activities asparticipating in the development of overall business strategiesprioritizing IT requirements generating IT business plans settingtechnical and architectural standards managing user interfacesoutsourcing contracts suppliers and systems engineering andallocating IT resources To assess performance the IT organizationinstituted several sets of measures that link directly to thebusiness objectives and priorities defined by the CEO in thecompanys strategic planThe major steps that the company took to improve areillustrated in figure  belowFigure  Steps for Transforming Business Operations UsingInformation ManagementDefined strategic business priorities including CommonLean Fast Global and GrowthExecutive team shared a challenging vision of the role ofITImplemented a matrix IT organization functional andoperational alignmentEstablished virtual organizational structure forflexibility and responsivenessStrategies to ConsiderInstituting information technology and management as a supportfunction separate from the business is an ineffective and outdatedmodel Leading organizations recognize the role of IT in supportingmission accomplishment and seek to integrate it with businessoperations The following outlines the strategies that seniorexecutives in leading organizations commonly use to promoteinformation management leadership involvement in business decisionmaking and maximize the benefits from their IT investmentsFocus on efforts to incorporate the CIO organization into theoverall business byensuring executive leadership and commitment for the CIOorganization both at the career and political levelsembracing the CIO as a full participant of the executivemanagement teamdeveloping structured approaches for exploring the broadrange of opportunities and strategies in information technologyavailable to enhance the business andfocusing technology initiatives on creating value andproviding the information needed by internal and externalcustomersProvide an atmosphere that supports executive understanding ofIT bycreating and using formal and informal executivecommunication channels to make the business case for integratinginformation management into organizationwide decisionmakingandemphasizing returns and metrics that clearly linkinformation management with an organizations businessneedsPrinciple II Position the CIO for SuccessThere is no cookiecutter approach so knowing what fits in anorganization is key to finding the right CIO to match with theorganizationThere is no one right way to establish a CIO positionDiversities in corporate missions structures cultures andcapabilities prohibit a prescriptive approach to informationmanagement leadership There are nonetheless a number of practicesand alternative strategies that senior executives in leadingorganizations use to help define and institute their CIO positionsto effectively meet business needs This section examines thosepractices providing pragmatic guidance that other organizationscan also consider in determining how best to integrate CIOfunctions into their respective organizationsKey CharacteristicsSenior executives in leading organizations recognize that aonesizefitsall solution to establishing information managementleadership does not exist Rather they take responsibility forensuring that their CIO models are consistent with the businesstechnical and cultural contexts of their enterprises Executivesdo so by examining their internal environments and asking a seriesof questions about the problems that need fixing how informationtechnology and management can help and how a CIO might best fitwithin their management structures to guide technology solutionsThe answers to these questions help them choose from a range ofalternative CIO approachesSpecifically by defining mission improvement objectives seniorexecutives determine whether their organization needs a CIO who isa networkingmarketing specialist business change agentoperations specialist policyoversight manager or any combinationthereof Studying existing IT capabilities helps define thestructure and responsibilities of the new CIO organizationConsidering the centralized or decentralized nature of theenterprise helps determine the corporate CIOs authority level andhow the CIO shares responsibility with other managers across theagency Further appreciating organizational culture and changereadiness helps define the pace and extent to which CIOs canaccomplish business transformationBusiness executives keep in mind that initial CIO models adoptedshould not be set in stone but may have to be adjusted over timeas their enterprises grow or mature For example while a companymay need a business strategist to build a new IT capability overtime another type of CIO may be better suited to sustainingoperations This evolution in the CIO role is also reflected by theintroduction of variant leadership positions in informationmanagement ie chief knowledge officers or chief technicalofficers that diffuse responsibility across several seniorlevelmanagers For example one industry organization that we visitedhas multiple product line CIOs The most senior informationmanagement executive positioned at a level above these CIOs assertsthat he is not the corporate CIO and does not want to be Withthe belief that one person cannot embody all the knowledge neededto effectively direct information technology and management in anorganization this executive uses an executivelevel technologycommittee as a forum for building consensus for IT initiativesIn conjunction with determining their CIO models seniorexecutives clearly define up front the roles responsibilities andaccountability of their CIOs for enterprisewide informationmanagement better enabling their CIOs to operate effectivelywithin the parameters of their positions visvis those of theirsenior management counterparts ie CFO COO Typically CIOsserve as a bridge between top managers IT professionals and endusers CIOs provide leadership and vision focusing seniorexecutives on highvalue information technology issues investmentsand decisions They may also serve as business change agentschallenging conventional approaches and developing new methods andsystems for delivering mission benefits The case study at the endof this section provides an example of a CIO hired specifically tohelp transform information management and business operationsIn this strategic capacity CIOs take the lead role inintegrating information and technology management and performanceacross the entire information life cycle They are responsible forsuch activities as planning setting standards and policies anddesigning and managing architectures to guide introduction oftechnology products and services While not all CIOs necessarilyhave handson responsibility their purview may also incorporateany or all of the operational elements of information andtechnology management such as data processing infrastructuremanagement and systems acquisitionSenior executives provide their CIOs with the authority theyneed to effectively carry out their diverse responsibilitiesExecutives ensure this by giving the CIO a key role in ITinvestment decisionmaking providing budget control or ensuringleadership backing for information technology and managementprograms and initiatives Formally documenting or in the case ofpublicsector organizations legislating CIO roles andresponsibilities can help in managing performance and expectationsof both the enterprise and the CIO For example the position ofone state government CIO that we interviewed was based on aspecific statute establishing the CIO at the cabinet level andassigning clearcut responsibilities for funding and overseeing IToperations statewideWhile there is no single template for doing so seniorexecutives in leading organizations apply consistent criteria inselecting their CIOs The most obvious criterion is relevant ITexpertise Rather than being technical experts specifically theirCIOs intuitively understand IT principles and trends and act asstrategists applying technology and approaches skillfully to helpresolve or overcome daunting business challenges But even while ITexpertise is important their CIOs are business managers as wellwith experience in administrative financial and corporatemanagement Such experience better enables the CIOs to work withbusiness managers to build a shared vision for meeting missionneeds For instance one state government CIO attributed hissuccess to his breadth of experience across a variety of financialretail and IT units which facilitates his ability toPage  GAOG CIO Executive Guideget buyin from stakeholders in the state Additionalproficiencies critical to CIO success include leadership abilityinnovation and flexibility effective communications skillsinterpersonal skills and political astuteness The weight thatsenior executives assign to each of these criteria in selecting aCIO depends on the information management leadership model and theneeds of the enterpriseCIOs are no longer tied to a single functional unitie theIT shop Instead they are positioned as senior executives withthe ability to strategically view and apply IT to the bestadvantage of the enterprise CIOs generally report to and partnerwith their agency heads forging relationships that ensure highvisibility and support for farreaching information managementinitiatives As active members of the CEOs executive teams theseCIOs are well situated to provide advice and direction integrateIT with the business vision and take part in highleveldecisionmaking Active participation in executive processes andcommittees facilitates the CIOs ability to build effectiveexecutivelevel working relationshipsCase Study Positioning the CIO for SuccessIn  this manufacturing company instituted a CIO position tohelp build its information management capability after deciding tosplit its former internal IT service provider off as an independentbusiness For years the manufacturing company had relied on awholly owned subsidiary to provide IT products and services Withminimal IT talent left in the company following the splitoff theCIO had to create a new IT leadership staffThe company used a consultant to search for a CIO to build theinhouse information management capability Essentially thecompany wanted a CIO with IT expertise strong management skillsand background experience in managing large centralized companiesThe current CIO exceeded their requirements He came highlyrecommended due to his prior success in transforming two othercompanies and his skill in outsourcing which would be needed tomanage the manufacturers continued reliance on informationtechnology contract services The CIO accepted the position onlyafter obtaining senior executives commitment to his vision fortransforming not just information technology and management butprocesses in the entire companySenior executives set the CIO up to succeed They positioned himas a member of the senior decisionmaking board reporting to theViceChairman of the company They gave him the flexibility tobring in managers from the outside and set up a matrix managementorganization consisting of multiple business sector CIOs alignedwith functional CIOs across the company all reporting to thecorporate CIO They required that any IT initiative includecollaboration between a sector CIO and a processresponsible CIOas illustrated in figure  Senior executives also made the CIO thefinal authority on all IT budget operations and processmanagement issues During the period from  through  theCIO has been effective in lowering projected annual IT costs for the total reduction was over  million when taking intoaccount both cost avoidance and cost reduction while enhancing theprovision of IT services to the companyFigure  Matrix Management Organization in a LeadingOrganizationGlobal Processes and SystemsStrategies to ConsiderIn the absence of a single model for instituting a CIO seniorexecutives take precautions to ensure that their informationmanagement leadership positions are appropriately defined andimplemented to meet their unique business needs The following isan outline of the strategies that senior executives in theseorganizations use to determine the types of CIOs they need selectindividuals to carry out these roles and position them aseffective and influential members of the senior executivedecisionmaking teamDetermine the CIO model byexamining the current environment and identifying whatthe enterprise expects to accomplish through information managementbefore establishing a CIO position to lead improvementsandmaking the CIO type ie business strategist marketingspecialist policy and oversight manager operations specialistetc consistent with the enterprises mission history currentenvironment culture and change readinessDefine clear roles and accountability for the CIO bydelineating CIO roles and responsibilities visvisthose of other senior managersensuring that the CIO has the authority needed to beeffective anddocumenting CIO roles responsibilities andaccountabilities to help manage expectations andperformanceSelect a CIO with the right skills set bychoosing someone with information technology andmanagement expertise and the potential to help in businesstransformation consistent with the CIO model selectedandensuring that the individual also has the leadership andcommunications skills and other proficiencies needed to effectivelycarry out the CIO positionMake the CIO a business partner byhaving the CIO partner with other senior executivemanagersempowering the CIO to work with other senior executivesto discuss and decide among alternative IT products and strategiesfor meeting business needs andensuring that the CIO is involved in strategy discussionsat the highest levels so that he or she can lead the enterprise inusing information management to corporate advantage rather thanmerely responding to client requestsCritical Success FactorsPrinciplesOrganizational FociCritical Success Factor  Promote OrganizationalCredibilityThe second critical success factor focuses on the CIOs abilityto establish the CIO organization as a central player in theenterprise The legitimacy of the CIO and the CIO organization mustbe developed for the CEOs message of information technology andmanagements central role to be accepted and for the CIOorganization to become a full participant in formulating corporatestrategyBoth principles in this critical success factor pertain to thedemonstration of the CIO organization as an entity that cancomplete critical projects successfully and contribute to the wellbeing of the enterprise This effort is largely the responsibilityof the CIO and the focus is lateral and downward The CIO mustcreate an environment in which the ability of the CIO organizationto contribute to the success of the enterprise is recognizedSuccess to be appreciated has to be demonstrable and measurableIf the CIO is not able to demonstrate that he or she deserves thesupport of the CEO and makes a valuable contribution to thecorporate mission the CIO will not be effective as a fullparticipant in the corporate decisionmaking processPrinciple III Ensure the Credibility of the CIOOrganizationWhile placement of the CIO position at a high level within theorganization may carry some weight the CIO generally must earncredibility by making things happenInstituting a CIO position consistent with organizational needsand finding a capable leader to fill the job are no guarantee ofCIO success Rather the burden of ensuring information technologyand management effectiveness shifts from senior executives to theCIO and his or her supporting organization Given the relativenewness of the position visavis the rest of the business the CIOis faced with having to gain the attention and respect of managersat all levels across the organization and build the support andcooperation needed to effectively execute the informationmanagement leadership role The following is a discussion of thestrategies that CIOs in leading organizations use to legitimizetheir roles and successfully collaborate with their businesscounterparts to guide IT solutions to meet mission needsKey CharacteristicsCIOs in leading organizations recognize that providing effectiveinformation management leadership and vision is a principal meansof building credibility for their CIO positions CIOs do this in anumber of ways Foremost they do not manage IT in a vacuum butrather make sure that the information management program is wellintegrated with what senior executives want to accomplish CIOswork with their executive peers to jointly produce a visioneducating senior managers on the strategic value of IT providingadvice and direction and setting expectations of what can beachieved CIOs express this vision in business rather thantechnical terms and in such a manner as to generate enthusiasmbuyin and motivation for managers to strive together toward theachievement of common goals Further CIOs participate on executivecommittees and boards that provide forums for promoting andbuilding consensus for IT strategies and solutions We found thisto be true for each of the case study organizations that wevisited Having achieved senior management interest and backingCIOs can leverage this support as needed to help ensure cooperationfor carrying out information technology and management and businesschange initiatives across the enterpriseEffective CIOs and their supporting organizations do not setout to force their ideas and solutions on their businesscounterparts Instead they seek to bridge the gap betweentechnology and the business by networking informally formingalliances and building friendships that help ensure support forinformation technology and management CIO organizations then workwith rather than for the businesses getting them involved inprojects and driving ownership and accountability to linemanagement rather than to the IT shop For example in one casestudy the state legislature placed the CIO organization in chargeof managing the planning funding and implementation of a projectto develop a single telecommunications network to serve the statesentire education community Rather than a technical challenge theproject has been a huge coordination effort requiring that the CIOorganization overcome rivalries and achieve the commitment andcooperation of traditionally autonomous education sectorsCIOs retain the support of their business colleagues byfollowing through on commitments to effectively lead businesstransformation projects provide needed IT products and servicesand train and educate the user community Through it all CIOsstrive to maintain open communications and build trust They do soby being accessible to the businesses listening to user feedbackand focusing on user needsCIOs recognize that balancing shortterm successes withlongerterm business change initiatives is key to keeping theirbusiness customers satisfied In the initial months of tenure CIOsset out to understand their enterprises needs and tackle toughissues ie runaway projects and crisis situations such as year management that demand immediate attention or could poseimmediate obstacles to success In the short term they also focuson building relationships addressing business imperatives ieprocess streamlining and consolidation and demonstrating successby promptly providing highimpact products and services iecommercial offtheshelf software and desktop equipment that allowthem to achieve positive and visible accomplishments fairlyquickly CIOs recognize that showing interim results concurrentwith more protracted efforts such as multiyear systemsdevelopments bigticket infrastructure projects or businessprocess reengineering can have significant positive impact on CIOcredibilityOften CIOs outline plans of attack or roadmaps to help guidethem in effectively implementing their short and longtermstrategies Documenting their courses of action helps them manageschedules and expectations and provides baselines against which toassess progress and performance These CIOs are careful not to getcaught in the cycle of continual planning but take steps to ensureeffective progression from planning to implementation They returnto their plans iteratively updating them as progress is made andbusiness needs evolveFinally CIOs in leading organizations recognize that there istoo much going on in the area of information technology andmanagement for them to absorb all of the issues alone Rather thanallowing their technology ideas and programs to stagnate they keepabreast of changes in the fastpaced environment that might beapplied to enhance capability and improve mission performance intheir own organizations They do so through avid reading workingwith vendors and following market directions CIOs also benchmarkpartner with or seek advice from successful peers and competitorson initiatives that provide opportunities for exchanging ideassharing capability and expertise and achieving mutual benefits inthe larger information technology and management community Forexample one state CIO with whom we met said that he values theGAOG CIO Executive Guide Page guidance received from a CIO advisory board of private industryrepresentatives convened by the governor to facilitate learningfrom business organizations This CIO also partners with a major ITcorporation on a project to acquire standard desktop equipment forall agencies under the governors purview Participation in keycouncils advisory groups and government trade and professionalassociations such as the Industry Advisory Council and the NationalAssociation of State Information Resource Executives is also usefulfor exchanging ideas sharing information and identifying new waysto meet common challengesCase Study Ensuring the Credibility of the CIOOrganizationThis states Justice Network JNET illustrates howimplementation of many of the practices discussed in this sectionhas enhanced the credibility of the CIO and his supportingorganization JNET is a highly successful project started by theCIO organization enabling agencies to jointly develop a singlesecure webbased system to support administration of criminaljustice across the state The project responds to the governorspriority for consolidated agency projects thereby ensuringhighlevel support for CIO efforts The CIO organization conceivedthe idea for JNET after receiving multiple requests from criminaljustice agencies for funding to develop redundant systems Theorganization identified the joint project as a good opportunity tosave on costs share information and reduce redundancy and errorsby making it possible to enter new offender information only onceas subjects proceed through the criminal justice processHistorically the states justice agencies have been highlyautonomous and distrustful of outsiders Prior attempts to get theagencies to work together failed IT managers recognize thatsuccess with the current initiative goes a long way in increasingCIO credibility with the state agenciesThe CIO organization launched JNET by bringing togetherstakeholders from across the state in a series of meetings over thecourse of  months to establish a vision for a shared system thatwould also meet individual justice agency information needs Underexecutive order a seniorlevel leadership committee including theCIO is responsible for establishing JNET policy direction andstandards and for authorizing the release of JNET funds A steeringcommittee consisting of justice agency representatives works withinformation management professionals and consultants to refineproject details Its biweekly meetings provide a good opportunityfor the CIO organization to build relationships with the stateagencies and for agency representatives to get acquainted and learnabout one anothers operations and data resources With centralresponsibility for controlling contracts and funding drawn from theagencies budgets the CIO organization is credited with being theglue that holds JNET together A JNET office established toadminister the project on a daytoday basis also reports directlyto the CIOUnder CIO guidance JNET has been planned as a multiphasemultiyear development effort with interim products and results TheCIO organization has helped agencies successfully complete a pilotphase to prototype initial JNET content and applications alsodemonstrating the CIO organizations ability to help deliver oncommitments Three additional phases involve testing the systemsbasic datasharing function and adding new capabilities such asdata importing online processing and document managementInitially the justice agencies thought JNET was a bad idea agencyrepresentatives were pessimistic and merely went through themotions of working together They posed such resistance that at onepoint the CIO had the lieutenant governor make a surprise visit toa steering committee meeting to oversee project progressdemonstrate senior management support and ensure agencycooperation toward meeting common objectives Once the agencies sawthe operational prototype and the projects potential theyrealized that their individual sacrifices had paid offToday JNET continues to grow in scope and popularity Alongwith it CIO credibility has increased The CIO organization iscurrently working with several counties to help link them withJNET Next steps include instituting JNET at the local level andultimately partnering with other states to construct a nationwidejustice network JNETs success has served to legitimize andincrease the value of the CIO function to its businesscounterparts Now other agencies including the departments ofHealth and Public Welfare also want to work with the CIOorganization on similar crossfunctional information managementinitiativesStrategies to ConsiderWhile senior executives are responsible for creating theenvironments and positions likely to ensure CIO success it is theresponsibility of the CIOs themselves to make that success areality Regardless of all the promising skills strategies andtechnologies they may bring to bear no CIO can be effectivewithout first building credibility with business executives ITprofessionals and user communities alike to ensure commitment andsupport for their information management leadership andinitiatives The following practices commonly used by CIOs inleading organizations to build credibility can also be consideredand applied by CIOs in federal departments and agencies to betterlegitimize their positions and help ensure success in theirindividual businesscultural environmentsProvide information management leadership and vision byensuring that the vision encompasses senior managementprioritieseducating top managers on the value of informationtechnology and management in helping to accomplish missionobjectivesarticulating the vision in business terms to facilitateline management understanding and achievement of buyinandusing senior management discussion and decisionmakingforums as opportunities to build consensus for IT programs andinitiativesEstablish effective working relationships bynetworking informally and forming alliances with othersenior managers to help defuse potential opposition and buildcommitment to new technology directionsgetting managers from the business side of the enterpriseinvolved and accountable for information managementprojectsfulfilling commitments to provide effective IT goods andservices andestablishing open communications and feedback mechanismssuch as surveys and questionnaires as a way to buildtrustBalance quick successes with long term impact bysetting priorities and distinguishing between short termhighimpact initiatives and longer term objectives that requiremore vested interest and outlining a plan or strategy for accomplishing thesepriorities in an efficient and effective mannerLeverage external information technology and managementexpertise bykeeping abreast of technological change and incorporatingnew products and strategies in the enterprises IT program asappropriateforming partnerships and building off of the success andexpertise of external CIO peers andnetworking and participating in forums in the largercommunity to debate and identify ways to address common informationtechnology and management issues and concernsPrinciple IV Measure Success and Demonstrate ResultsMeasurement determines what one pays attention to The thingsthat are measured become relevant the things that are omitted areout of sight and mindIn many organizations the value of information technology andmanagement is considered intangibledifficult to measure and miredin terms of soft dollars or strategic assets For this reasonin the past few organizations embarked on programs to measure theeffectiveness of IT systems However it has become increasinglyevident that without a measurement process where results can bedemonstrated not only is information management at a disadvantagewhen competing for scarce resources but also when making its casein support of efficiency and effectiveness initiatives For the CIOorganization to be viewed as part of the business a structuredprocess needs to be in place to measure success and demonstrateresults to the organization This section discusses the approachesthat leading organizations use to measure performance andresultsKey CharacteristicsWhile there is no standardized approach to performancemeasurement leading organizations strive to understand and measurewhat drives and affects their businesses and how to best evaluateresults These organizations have generally struggled withidentifying and adopting measures to assess the value of IT buthave been able to put some measures in place to help demonstrateperformance They use measures for a variety of purposes Themeasures are a vehicle for communicating with senior management andstakeholders in the areas the organization deems importantMeasures also serve as vital management and decisionmaking toolsproviding information that can be used to make improvements inbusiness outcomes and service deliveryMany managers told us that the measures that capture the mostattention from senior management are simple onesor at least simplein terms of how they are expressed In a number of instances theorganizations we visited used uncomplicated terms to communicatemeasures but the underlying concepts were quite involved andrequired a good understanding of IT and business fundamentalsThese organizations collapsed a lot of information into a form thateffectively communicated the success or failure of informationtechnology and management activities and in the case of thelatter expanded on the issues and supplied additional informationFor example one international organization involved in severalproduct lines measures its performance in line with the followingorganizational business prioritiesMaximize performance ie improve service and reduce ITand management costsImprove business processes ie IT projects andEcommerceIncrease team contributionsCreate a leadingedge electronic communicationsprocessEven though these measures seem simple a considerable amount oftime effort and data are involved in amassing and assessing theresults tied to these business prioritiesTo establish joint ownership for performance managementorganizations strive to construct measures jointly with theirstakeholders customers managers and CIO staff They worktogether to achieve a common understanding of goals metrics andanticipated outcomes that are easy to understand but are aimed atadding value Managers told us that performance measurement systemswork best when combined with established measures that reflectcustomerstakeholder needs and the activities of employees that aredirectly involved in information management The CIO organizationsresponsibility does not end with the establishment of measures nordoes the CIO organization have sole responsibility fortechnological success As a practical matter those responsible forjudging the success of programs and their supporting functionsshould agree on the measures used and become involved in monitoringthe outcomesAlthough approaches vary leading organizations develop measureswith a focus toward improving not only internal IT performance butalso external relationships with technology users and the overallbusiness Organizations balance various technical measures toensure that IT products and services are deployed in the mosteffective and efficient ways and lead to desired business resultsThey focus on monitoring short and longterm IT measures thatdirectly affect business activities and produce real businessvalue This means that IT activities must be directly related tocompany relationships with customers clients and suppliers andalso affect business results such as direct costs or marketshareLeading organizations use performance measures that focus onbusiness outcomes such as customer satisfaction levels servicelevels and in some instances total requests satisfied Forexample one state agency commissioner requires that hisdepartments develop tactical plans for all areas not just IT Allexecutives participate in the planning process The performancemeasures are broken down to meaningful levels as a way of holdingthe IT shop and other departments accountable for the servicesthey provide IT goals and objectives are incorporated into theplans and IT performance outcomes are provided to the commissionerand his executive staff on a quarterly basis This exercise hasserved to build credibility and help demonstrate the value that ITadds to the organization The existence of performance measures hasalso made a difference in how agencies behave because thedocumentation they provide serves to make them accountableTo properly collect and analyze information leadingorganizations develop measurement systems that provide insight intotheir IT service delivery and business processes The establishmentof an information feedback system allows organizations to linkactivities and functions to business initiatives and managementgoals This feedback in turn leads to increased IT productivityand organizational effectiveness One state we visited establishedan information services board to develop statewide policy standardsand to monitor projects as part of its portfolio managementprocess The board however hasPage  GAOG CIO Executive Guideincreasingly become more involved in monitoring and makingrecommendations on troubled IT projects Some of the lessonslearned from the boards project reviews are thatthe board needs to get involved early in monitoring andoverseeing projects before considerable funds are spent on theprojectslongterm highcost projects are no longer sustainablebecause sponsors tend to be unable to sustain longtermsupportprojects are best managed in a limitedcommitment phasedapproach andprojects should quickly demonstrate resultsOnce planning and decisionmaking structures are in place andperformance results can be used as part of the decisionmakingprocess organizations are in a better position to ensure thatgoals and objectives clearly link and align with IT performancemeasures Leading organizations also assess the readiness of theirorganizations to use IT measures and their receptiveness to datacollection measurement and analysis Further they nurture aphilosophy that is positive toward performance management andmeasurement and they view measures as a way to focus on businessvalue and customer satisfactionIn summary managers at the organizations we studied cautionedthat IT performance measurement is in its infancy and measurementtechniques are still evolving partly due to changes in technologyMost of the organizations are continually looking for ways toimprove their IT measurement systems as a means of supportingachievement of organizational goalsCase Study Measuring Success and Demonstrating ResultsTo measure its information technology IT and managementinitiatives one state instituted a performance measurement processillustrated in figure  that is driven by an IT strategic planThe plan sets forth the goals and strategies needed to support thestates entities in developing IT plans in using informationresources and in defining IT performance measures The ITstrategic plan also aligns very closely with the states strategicplan that sets forth four broad goals for the use of IT within thestate  improve service delivery  make information moreaccessible  use IT to improve productivity and  invest inpeople tools and methods The IT strategic plan also incorporatesstakeholder involvement by including perspectives by state agencyexecutives legislators educators and other stakeholders on theuse of the states IT resources Also included in the plan isinformation from the states biennial IT performance report Thisreport evaluates the states progress toward meeting the lastbienniums IT Strategic Plan goals and includes a summary ofstrategic and operational performance measures These measures inpart are the result of the states previous IT strategic plan andare meant to measure how well IT resources are being used toachieve the states overall strategic goals and operationaltechnical objectives These results are published in the StatesBiennial IT Performance Report and are used to benchmark thestates information management services The state legislature alsouses this information to allocate future fundingFigure  Performance Measurement Frameworkmeasured and monitoredStrategic Performance MeasuresOperational Performance Measures Progress made in

Strategic PlanStrategies to ConsiderPerformance measurement is a critical step in ensuring resultsand success from any project but especially from informationtechnology and management initiatives whose value is oftendifficult to capture While performance measurement is stillevolving in principle and in practice leading organizations havepinpointed a number of strategies that have proven useful ingauging the impact and benefits of their IT investments Thesestrategies are discussed belowEngage internal and external stakeholders in defining andmanaging IT performance byensuring that mission delivery and IT performancemeasures are integral to strategic management and decisionmakingprocesses andestablishing internal and external customer groups toperiodically review validate and accept IT performancemeasuresEnsure that processes are in place to balance business andtechnical measures bydeveloping specific technical performance measures for ITproducts and services and balancing them with businessdrivenmeasures anddemonstrating that the performance measurement datagenerated are reliable and usefulEstablish an effective data collection and performance feedbackprocess bydeveloping welldesigned performance data collectionmethodsestablishing a limited set of outcomebased performancemeasures that link to mission outputs and outcomes andutilizing concise understandable performance reportingtools and techniques and conducting performance measurementreviews as neededCritical Success FactorsPrinciplesOrganizational FociCritical Success Factor  Execute CIO ResponsibilitiesThe CIO and supporting organization are ultimately responsiblefor successfully executing their role in the enterprises missionHow central this role is to the strategic plans of the enterprisewill depend on each of the first two critical success factors butsupport from the top and all efforts to build credibility will befutile unless the CIO organization is run effectively If the CIOorganization is not able to execute its responsibilities and if itis not able to play the critical role for which it has beendeveloped the corporation will learn to work around it or it willbe replacedThere are many aspects to successfully organizing and running aCIO organization However this critical success factor as well asthe underlying principles focuses on the elements that leadingorganizations believe are most central to the CIOs responsibilityDetermination of the CIO organization structure must fall to theCIO as he or she is the senior executive of that unit Aligningthe CIO organization with the needs of the enterprise is criticalto the satisfaction of those needs Communicating enterpriserequirements to staff and making appropriate decisions to meet theneeds of the enterprise are the responsibility of the CIO As theCIO organizations representative in strategic decisionmakingforums the CIO must be the translator of those strategies into CIOorganization initiativesAlong with technology human capital is the central resource theCIO has to execute his or her responsibilities While the CIO isaccountable for and reviews technology decisions staff frombusiness areas may develop most of the investment proposals Humancapital plans for the information management and technology areaare seen as the particular responsibility of the CIO In thecurrent IT environment technology has become a commodity Thehuman capital involved in applying that technology to achieve themission of the enterprise is a resource that requires the CIOsattention The hiring retention and training of informationmanagement and technology personnel is seen by leadingorganizations as a fundamental principle of good CIO practicePrinciple V Organize Information Resources to Meet BusinessNeedsWhile the CIO is important it is the operating environment forthe entire organization that will make it successfulDeveloping a CIO organization is an ongoing process that demandsa clear understanding of the organizations responsibility forhelping meet business needs This responsibility along with parentbusiness processes market trends internal legacy structures andavailable IT skills drives decisions as to the structure of theCIO organization and how the organization is aligned with the restof the enterprise Ultimately the CEO controls the assignment ofinformation technology and management functions to the CIO the CIOorganization and other organizational units Once these decisionsare made the CIO organization must provide effective responsivesupport through efficient allocation of resources and thedaytoday execution of its responsibilities This principleexamines the practices that leading organizations commonly use inestablishing CIO organizations to effectively meet their missionneedsKey CharacteristicsIt is the duty of a CIO to manage expectations and help ensurethat all members of a CIO organization have a clear understandingof their responsibilities In leading organizations evolvingbusiness processes play a key role in determining how theseinformation management responsibilities are structured and adaptedto meet changing needs We found that leading organizations quicklyreallocate and make information resources available on a routinesometimes daily or hourly basis to address changes in businessprocesses External factors such as market trends changingtechnology and available skills as well as internal legacystructures and corporate ventures also influence how a CIOorganization is formed aligned and adjusted to help support therest of an enterprise For example one organization that westudied had experienced two mergers that required the company toquickly integrate the new businesses and restructure to meetgrowing business needs Human resources systems were consolidatedand new corporate structures were quickly defined to ensurecontinued support to the enlarged customer base The companyremains prepared to restructure to meet everchanging businessrequirementsIn lieu of establishing either completely centralized ordecentralized CIO organizations leading organizations manage theirinformation resources through a combination of such structures Inthis hybrid the CEO assigns central control to a corporate CIO andsupporting CIO organization while delegating specific authority toeach business unit for managing its own unique informationmanagement requirements The corporate CIO and supporting CIOorganization centrally formulate policies and standards for allITrelated activities They also centrally manage architectures anda core set of infrastructure components to provide common ITservices to the entire corporation The corporate CIO works withCIOs or other information managers in each of the business units toensure efficient reliable and interoperable technology for theentire corporation The following figure illustrates traditionalcentralized and decentralized organizational structures incomparison with the hybrid combination used by leadingorganizations todayFigure  Comparison of Decentralized Centralized and HybridStructuresLeading organizations decide as part of a sourcing strategywhether to provide specific information technology and managementservices with inhouse staff or external providers Anorganizations sourcing strategy is part of a larger human capitaldevelopment strategy which is discussed in principle VI Theshortage of skilled IT workers in the current market environment isoften a major reason for leading organizations to outsource TheCIO and decisionmaking authorities decide what type of work isappropriate to outsource and what type of work is best performedinternally Typically leading organizations cultivate longtermskills such as contract management project management andsecurity management while outsourcing shortterm skills such asapplication development For example one state capital that wevisited is home to over  software companies IT skills are ingreat demand which made hiring by the state difficult so this CIOlooked for alternatives to inhouse software development andmanagement It made sense for the state to outsource tacticalfunctions such as help desks and mainframe managementOn the other hand there are responsibilities such as ITplanning and oversight that must remain inhouse As the statecontracts out more of its information technology and managementfunctions it is also essential that it have good contractmanagement expertiseAlong with effective allocation of available resources leadingorganizations execute their information management responsibilitiesreliably and efficiently Technology is highly integrated with thebusiness processes in these organizations because technology isviewed as an enabler for the business not just a tool Theorganizations make IT investment decisions based on business caseanalyses and returnoninvestment projections Consistent with afundamental strategic information management approach theorganizations also focus on continuous process improvement Theorganizations provide reliable information management capabilitieson a daily basis but also look to the future by pursuing newinitiatives that show how technology can improve the business oftomorrow For example one state CIO that we interviewed said thathis role was to identify enterprisewide and strategic initiativesto improve state information management One initiative involvedestablishing strategic direction guidelines and standards forinstituting electronic commerce in the state government Electroniccommerce was to be used for such activities as renewing licensesand paying taxesLeading organizations simplify projects by producing incrementaldeliverables that quickly show success and demonstrate the impactof effective CIO management while still focusing on longtermobjectives As discussed in principle III carrying out successfulprojects is expected in leading organizations and adds to thecredibility of the CIO and the CIO organizationCase Study Organizing Information Resources to Meet BusinessNeedsImplementing a combination of centralized and decentralizedinformation management enables leading organizations to effectivelysupport their business operations One leading organizationimplements a combination of centralized and decentralized IT andstructures to best meet the needs of its three diverse lines ofbusinessan international services division an internationalindustry division and a retail division The organization uses acentralized IT infrastructure with decentralized developmentefforts to provide efficiency and security for its corporatecustomers Efficiency is the number one priority of theorganization in terms of dollars spent as well as technologyperformanceThe organization has CIOs in each of its three business unitsEach business unit makes IT investment decisions based on businessrequirements and the technology available to support thoserequirements For example desktop platforms and software varyamong business units depending on the unique needs of each businessarea The work in the business units is all performed inhouse andis not outsourced as business expertise is considered a corecompetency The business CIOs work together to determine how IT canbe used to reach customers across business lines The internationalservices and international industry divisions have some commonrequirements based on the international nature of the twodivisions The international industry division and the retaildivision have common requirements based on the specific industryThe CIOs of these divisions work together leveraging opportunitiesfor shared IT products and services so that each unit can investfewer dollars to accommodate common needsThe corporate IT organizations role is to aggregate needsacross business units and provide solutions that can be integratedto serve the entire corporation Common components of each businessarea include data centers human resources payroll a financialarchitecture and a common desktop environment Standard processesand tools such as contingency planning interdependencyidentification protocols and risk management are used tocoordinate multiple business areas These standard utilitiesevolved through two corporate mergers and are now institutionalizedacross the corporation The mergers required that the organizationquickly adopt new organizational structures and address newbusiness requirements The standard processes and policiesdeveloped applied and improved as a result of the mergers providethis organization with the flexibility it needs to adapt to futurechanges in responsibilityThis organization is constantly looking to improve its ITinvestment processes All technology investments are justifiedusing business case analyses The decisionmaking process forestablishing business cases recently evolved to include competitiveneeds Competitive needs were not considered when this organizationinitially postponed electronic commerce initiatives due to lowreturnoninvestment projections The organization fell behind thecompetition in providing this service and the delay may have costit customers As a result competitive needs are now consideredpart of the decisionmaking processStrategies to ConsiderAn effective CIO organization is a dynamic structure respondingnot only to business mission and cultural requirements but alsoto rapidly changing technologies elusive skills and competingresources in the external market environment Leading organizationsrecognize the myriad forces driving their IT capabilities Thefollowing is an outline of the strategies that these organizationsconsider in deciding how to effectively structure source andexecute their technology management operationsCreate a clear understanding of responsibilities within theorganization byarticulating a common description of responsibilities toall levels of the CIO organization andassigning responsibilities to parts of the organizationbased on skills and organizational structureUse a combination of centralized and decentralizedorganizational structures bycentrally formulating policy and standards for allITrelated

still focusing on longterm objectivesPrinciple VI Develop Information Management Human CapitalProviding good benefits packages and building core competenciesare other ways of attracting stimulating and retaining ITworkers especially among todays selfpreservationmindedgenerationXersAs is true with the other principles the business requirementsof an enterprise drive decisions related to the specific types ofresources needed to implement technology successfully Externalmarket forces and internal legacies influence the types of skillsavailable to a CIO organization Given these realities the CIOorganization must provide an effective responsive IT workforce tohelp accomplish missions and goals This principle discusses thestrategies that leading organizations use to assess their skillbases and attract recruit and retain IT professionalsKey CharacteristicsLeading organizations develop human capital strategies to assesstheir skill bases and recruit and retain staff who can effectivelyimplement technology to meet business needs Figure  provides anoverview of the strategy that leading organizations use to secureinformation management human capitalFigure  Strategy for Securing Human Capital in LeadingOrganizationsTrainingituOutsourceLeading organizations assess their IT skills on an ongoing basisto determine what expertise is needed to meet currentresponsibilities and support future initiatives They can evaluatethe skills of their employees using methods provided by entitiessuch as Carnegie Mellon Universitys Software EngineeringInstitute and the InformationCurtis B Hefley WE  Miller S  PeopleCapability Maturity Model Technical Report CMUSEIMMPittsburgh PA Software Engineering Institute Carnegie MellonUniversityGAOG CIO Executive Guide Page Technology Association of America Needed skills are comparedwith existing capabilities in the organization to determine gaps inthe IT skills base For example the state university at one of ourcase study locations had conducted a study revealing continuinggaps in the states ability to recruit and retain IT workersvisvis industry In response to the governors initiative toexpand the states IT workforce proposals were made for a programto recruit and fund college and university students willing tostudy technology management as a prelude to becoming part of thestate governments labor force Strengthening the skills andcapabilities of IT professionals through training and innovativehiring practices is part of a formula for building informationtechnology and management capabilitiesLeading organizations sometimes use surveys that compare missingcapabilities with market availability to determine what skills toacquire through hired professionals When professionals with thenecessary skills cannot be hired these organizations supplementthe existing workforce with external information resources Morespecifically they cultivate expertise in their internalworkforces while outsourcing skills that are available frommultiple sources at lower cost Leading organizations may evenchoose to replace labor with technology when they cannot hire theskilled professionals they need Core information managementfunctions include project management security management andcontract management practices that can apply to a variety ofprojects The various staffing and sourcing strategies provideleading organizations with dynamic workforces that can quicklycarry out these functions to meet changing business needsStudies forecast an everincreasing shortage of ITprofessionals presenting a great challenge for both industry andthe federal government Organizations are finding it difficult toretain staff when their competitors can always offer highersalaries For example one state government CIO organization thatwe studied experienced a  percent turnover in IT professionalsDespite having higher technology wages than any other state in thecountry the state remains at a disadvantage in competing withindustry and must rely on alternative strategies and incentives toattract and retain skilled workersWhile benefits recognition and challenging responsibilitiesare also useful in securing staff leading organizations identifytraining as a major nonsalary incentive for attracting andretaining skilled IT professionals Leading organizations dedicatean increasing percentage of their IT budgets to training Sometimessuch funds are devoted to retraining existing nontechnicalpersonnel to supply them with IT expertise For example oneindustry case study organization sponsors a month course toretrain about  legacy employees in project management skillsThe company also offers a range of formal classroom training lessformal workshops and informal mentoring programs Given the changemanagement environment for IT in this company staff always wantsand needs to be in a learning mode Similarly another industry CIOtold us that he provides IT training through a program that paysnew employees  percent of their salaries while they attendschool Upon completion of training the employees each earn percent of their salary during an initial performance evaluationperiod and full salary at the end of that periodWhile managers in leading organizations are accountable forcreating opportunities for their employees training individualstaff are responsible for taking advantage of those opportunitiesIn general leading organizations provide training as part of achanging hightech work environment that includes stateofthearttools and methods allowing skilled IT workers to perform their jobsto the best of their abilityWe identified additional strategies that leading organizationsuse to enhance their information management workforcesSpecifically these organizations bring in employees with desirableskills from across the enterprise to work in conjunction with ITprofessionals thereby maximizing the capability of their technicalresources These employees make up crossfunctional teams thatprovide an appropriate mix of business expertise and IT skills toaccomplish the various tasks of a project Working together themembers reflect the interests of not just information technologyand management but the user community and the projectsstakeholders and provide a holistic blend of technical projectmanagement value management budget finance and procurementskills and capabilities to meet mission needsCase Study Developing Information Management HumanCapitalUsing a variety of staffing and sourcing strategies providesleading organizations with dynamic workforces that can quickly meetchanging business needs One leading companys CIO said thatrecruiting information management workers with special skills inareas such as data networks and systems administration is extremelycompetitive To be successful in recruiting his organization hasdevised different offer packages to attract employees A packagemight include accelerated salary schedules or stock options Oncehired the company sends these employees back to college for ITtraining and invests in them This CIO acknowledges however thathis company does not spend enough on training Currentlyapproximately  percent of the IT operating budget is devoted totrainingThis organization also provides training to new employeesthrough a program that pays  percent of the employees salarywhile he or she attends school Upon completion of training theemployee enters a performance evaluation period during which theemployee earns  percent of his or her salary After successfullycompleting the performance evaluation period the employee thenbegins earning a full salaryThe organization increased its salary base to compete with othercompanies in retaining and attracting talented informationmanagement workers Besides salaries company managers view a goodworking environment and awards and recognition as essential forretaining employees Recently the CIO took over  employees andguests to a fivestar hotel for an evening out to celebrate thegroups accomplishments When senior managers appreciate businessaccomplishments they are willing to spend funds for staffrecognition This CIO admits that his IT workers are constantlyasked to work long hours and undergo a lot of stress though theyget little in return for the amount of work they doThis CIO believes that money is not the only motivator for ITstaff He feels that an important element to managing staff isfinding ways to recognize individuals and say thank you When thethank you comes from inside the organization it goes a long wayThe CIO uses different means to show his appreciation Forinstance his staff publishes a monthly appreciation newsletterthrough the Intranet The CIO believes there is big payoff in thesetypes of activities and the costs are minimal if any The CIO alsoviews time off as a good incentive bonus because it does not costthe company very much Other incentives his group has undertakeninclude taking staff out for lunch or handing out  AmericanExpress checks In todays environment organizations have to becreative One of the managers created a thank you toolkit to showher appreciation to her staff The CIO states If you dont have alot of money to spend you have to ask yourself what are thelittle things you can do to show your appreciationStrategies to ConsiderGiven the increasing shortage of IT professionals in the currentmarket environment securing an effective responsive technologymanagement workforce is a challenging task for both business andgovernment organizations alike Leading organizations haveidentified the following strategies that help in assessing their ITskills and recruiting retaining and utilizing talent to meettheir business needs These organizations consider and apply thevarious strategies as appropriate within the organizationalfinancial and cultural parameters of their individual business andgovernment enterprisesAssess the skill base bydetermining expertise needed to perform informationmanagement responsibilities andidentifying gaps between skills available and skillsneededIdentify innovative ways to attract talent

external expertisebringing in employees with desirable skills from acrossthe enterprise to work with and help maximize the capability ofinformation technology and management professionals andreplacing labor with technologyUsing This GuideThe principles and practices we developed based on ourinterviews with leading organizations in the private sector andstate government have enabled us to construct a framework to guidefederal CIO organizations In our discussions with about half ofthe CIOs of major federal departments and agencies and five CIOs ofsmall federal agencies we found that they generally agree with theleading organizations on the fundamental management principles forinformation management and technology At the same time we foundthat the practices used by federal CIOs tend to differ from thoseused by leading organizations We did not study the reasons forthese deviations specifically although some likely result from thecontext in which federal CIOs operate Both operational andstructural aspects of the CIOs environment can vary significantlybetween the public sector and the private sectorRather than dwell on differences it is more useful to focus onthe considerable common ground between public and private CIOorganizations to build efforts for improvement The specific keyconditions and strategies described in this guide can be used assuggestions for federal CIOs to apply or adapt to theirenvironments as appropriate More generally the key conditionsand strategies can be thought of as addressing specific aspects ofthe six primary principles which CIOs from all sectors agree arecritical to the successful execution of their responsibilities andrealization of the potential benefits of information technologyinvestments Taken as areas of focus these aspects may beevaluated by federal CIO organizations and tackled using techniquessuited to their situations Recognition of the differencesdescribed above as well as others should influence theapplication of advice provided in this guide But the advice ofCIOs of leading organizations should remain relevant regardless ofthe specifics of the situationThe ideas presented in this guide may also provide thefoundation for further discussion within the federal CIO communityMany federal CIOs in the normal course of their own efforts havealready begun working along the lines of the advice provided inthis guide These CIOs have gained valuable insights into applyingthe practices of leading organizations to the federal sector TheCIO Council or other organizations of federal CIOs can create anopportunity for sharing these experiences using the principlesdescribed in this guide as an organizing framework The challengeof understanding how the federal context influences theeffectiveness of the principle may be best met with support frommanagers who work in the same contextIn addition the specific key conditions and strategiesdescribed in this guide will provide insight when considering areasof future study For example specific principles may beinvestigated more deeply and strategies for implementing aprinciple such as developing information technology human capitalmay be proposed in more detail Or those aspects of the federal CIOenvironment that constrain the federal CIO flexibility and hinderthe ability to perform effectively may be examined more closelyand specific strategies to cope with those aspects may be proposedUnderstanding how CIOs of leading organizations approach theirwork and acknowledging those aspects of the federal CIOenvironment that limit the ability to implement similar strategiesmay prompt congressional and executive board discussions about theneed for future legislation and policy changesA few dimensions in which the federal and private sector candiffer are described below These examples largely stem from thenature of the public sector in which federal CIOs operate Many ofthese examples were mentioned by federal CIOs interviewed for thisguide However the extent to which the differences createadditional constraints on the CIOs depends on how they and agencyleaders respond to themSenior executive management in the federal sector candiffer significantly from the private sector The agency head is apolitical appointee who often is more focused on policy issues thanon internal management and operations This can deny the CIO theCEO support that is so critical for the successful integration ofinformation technology into business or missionfunctionsThe budget decisionmaking process used for informationtechnology projects can present particular challenges for thefederal CIO not found in the private sector For examplelegislative actions such as tax law changes and Medicare paymentprocess changes may require extensive system modifications andthe CIO does not have the flexibility to decide whether or not topursue them This ties up resources that might otherwise have beenexpended differently In fact mandated projects often must befunded by money that had been planned for other projects Longterminvestment strategies are difficult because agencies are asked toput together funding requests  months in advance of fundingavailability In addition IT funds may be contained within theappropriations for a specific program or an overall administrativebudget making them less visible and if part of discretionaryspending more subject to volatile changes in the federal budgetAs a result the CIO may not have control or direct oversight overmuch of the IT funding within the agencyPersonnel decisions in the federal sector are oftenconstrained due to work rules or organizational factors Currentinformation management job descriptions do not match theoccupations recognized in the industry today Training funds areoften limited due to larger budget considerations Recently theOffice of Personnel Management OPM found salaries in the federalgovernment to be lower than in the private sector On November  OPM implemented a governmentwide policy increasing salaries inseveral IT categories in an effort to make federal employment morecompetitive Because this policy was recently implemented wecannot yet assess the impact of these changes on federal employmentpracticesThe federal CIO may direct an organizational structure inwhich duties that would typically be a CIOs responsibility in theprivate sector are not under his or her direction at all Forexample some federal CIOs are in charge of large policy andoversight functions with little operational responsibility Whilethis may be an appropriate model it is critical that any model bematched with the overall needs of the agency in mindThe range of responsibilities as defined by legislationthat accrue to the CIO are very broad in the federal sectorincluding areas such as records management and Freedom ofInformation Act requirements for which there is little parallel inthe private sector While federal CIOs often may not haveoperational authority for the full range of responsibilities in thelegislation they and their agencies are still subject to oversightby the Congress in many of these areasThough the environment faced by a CIO in the federal sectorclearly differs from that of CIOs in other contexts the principlesthat form the basis for this guide remain relevant The underlyingprinciples were observed consistently in our sample of leadingorganizations and were cited as being critical to the success oftheir CIOs Federal CIOs can learn from the successes of theseleading organizations and can apply the principles as appropriatein their own organizations In addition agency heads and othersenior leaders in the federal government can gain an understandingof their roles in executing the critical success factors that mustbe addressed as CIOs work to meet the letter and intent of theClingerCohen Act and related legislationAppendix I Federal Legislation Affecting InformationManagementFederal Financial Management

infrastructures We were interested inidentifying effective CIO management practices used across avariety of organization types and structures In doing so we alsosought to develop specific case study information on how CIOs havehelped improve the effectiveness of their organizations businessoperations We have used this information to develop suggestedguidance to assist federal agencies in effectively integratingnewly created CIO functions into their respectiveorganizationsWe synthesized a great deal of literature and research on CIOorganizations to provide ideas on effective practices ininformation technology and management This body of knowledgeserved as a foundation for designing our project approach We thenconducted case studies at a number of private and publicorganizations We have found that case studies provide an abundantsource of information describing management practices and theintellectual background that led to the development of thosepractices Case studies also provide the flexibility to pursueparticularly rich avenues of inquiry as they develop duringinterviews Finally they are also an excellent means ofcommunicating the essence of practices that have worked well bycapturing the context as well as the specific practiceWe identified candidate organizations for our study based onawards and recognition from professional organizations andpublications over the past several years We conducted multidayvisits to organizations that agreed to participate in our study tolearneach organizations approach to selecting positioningand defining the roles and responsibilities of its CIOtechniques for instituting IT policies and standardsmanaging technical personnel and financial resources buildingcustomersupplier relationships and measuring the performance ofIT organizations in meeting business needs andstrategies for promoting and facilitating business andorganizational change through ITWe visited three private and three public sector organizationsrecognized as leaders in successfully managing information andtechnology investments to create value and improve businessperformance We selected private organizations across a range ofdimensions including type of business number of employees andrevenues All private organizations contacted had receivedrecognition by professional organizations and publicationscorporate executives or independent researchers Our selection ofstate organizations was based on recognition by professionalpublications state CIOs and the National Association of StateInformation Resource Executives NASIRE In particular NASIREawards recognition to states whose systems have made importantcontributions to the operations of state governments The followingorganizations participated in our studyCommonwealth of PennsylvaniaState of TexasState of WashingtonChase Manhattan BankGeneral Motors CorporationJC PenneyWe also interviewed the former CIO of the state of Californiaand the current CIO at US West Communications although we didnot conduct comprehensive case studies at these entitiesWe conducted site visits to each participating organization andobtained supporting documentation illustrations and examplesDuring the visits we interviewed the CIO members of the seniorexecutive team IT managers and other officials as identified bythe host organization to obtain their individual perspectives oninformation and technology management issues Based on thedocumentation and interviews obtained from our site visits wecompared practices across organizations to identify innovativepractices used by individual organizations as well as commonpractices used across the variety of organizations participating inour studyWe subsequently interviewed  percent of the Federal CIOCouncil members as a means of comparing federal CIO practices withour case study results and ensuring that practices used in theindustry and state organizations also addressed the challengesfound in the federal government We selected a mix of federalorganizations to visit taking into consideration their variousmission types civilian military or regulatory centralized anddecentralized structures and prior GAO study results Further wemet with a panel of CIOs from five small federal agencies todetermine whether the practices identified are also applicableacross diverse organizational sizes based on dimensions such asbudget personnel etc These discussions which are summarizedin the section entitled Current Federal CIO Environment helpedus identify similarities and differences in the CIO managementpractices of federal versus leading organizations The discussionshave also enabled us to pinpoint areas where federal agencies canbenefit from integrating the practices of such leadingorganizations in their respective organizationsOur research was conducted from March through October  andculminated in the issuance of an exposure draft in March Since March  we received comments from a variety oforganizations and individuals Based on suggestions from thegeneral public we have considered and made changes to the textwhere appropriate General consensus of those providing input wasthat the CIO Guide represented leading practices and that thedocument was insightful and valuableAppendix III Related GAO DocumentsInformation Security Risk Assessment Practices of
