                    Background        Olfaction is a major neurosensory function by which        mammals investigate the external chemical environment The        initial step in odor identification is interaction of an        odorant molecule with olfactory odorant receptors ORs        expressed at the surface of cilia of chemosensory olfactory        neurons in the olfactory epithelium Seventransmembrane        ORs first identified in    are the largest        vertebrate gene family comprising as many as  genes        reviewed in       Mammalian ORs are classical        Gproteincoupled receptors belonging to Class I or A        which also includes opsins and catecholamine receptors          Each olfactory neuron appears to express a single type        of OR     implying a sophisticated mechanism of OR        gene choice Another intriguing feature of olfaction is        combinatorial recognition of odorants Each receptor        recognizes multiple odorants and each odorant binds to        multiple receptors to generate specific activation patterns        for each of a vast number of distinct smells          The genes encoding ORs are devoid of introns within        their coding regions    Mammalian OR genes are        typically organized in clusters of ten or more members and        located on many chromosomes     The repertoire        of human OR hOR genes contains a large fraction of        pseudogenes suggesting that olfaction became less        important in the course of primate evolution Recent        studies indicate that some  of all hOR genes may be        pseudogenes compared with fewer than  in rodents or        lower primates           Analyses of incomplete compilations of hORs in        particular approximately  fulllength receptor genes           have recently been published A larger annotated        set of hOR genes is available as an online database          The very recent milestone publication of the first draft of        the human genome sequence by two groups    opens up        the possibility of detailed and complete identification        mapping and analysis of OR genes and their products in the        near future One of these groups reported that the human        genome contains  OR genes of which approximately         appear to be pseudogenes   Many alternative        nomenclatures for hORs including a comprehensive        phylogenetic classification developed at the Weizmann        Institute    have been proposed by various labs        over the past few years        The identification cloning and sequencebased        classification and analysis of candidate hORs are essential        prerequisites for rational structurefunction studies of        this vast receptor family Our goal was to identify the        complete repertoire of hOR genes encoding fulllength        receptors The approach was to carry out reiterative        homologybased searches of GenBank DNA particularly        recently available unannotated raw sequences and to        compile hOR sequences already present in other public        databases We report here the identification and cloning of         putative fulllength hOR receptor genes which we        believe accounts for nearly the entire repertoire of        functional hORs We also present a comparative sequence        analysis of the predicted OR gene products and propose a        new nomenclature for candidate hORs                    Results and discussion                  Sequence database mining and odorant receptor          cloning          The general strategy for the search for fulllength          hOR genes is shown in Figure  It was based on absence          of introns in coding sequences of mammalian ORs             as well as high overall sequence similarity and the          presence of several highly conserved sequence motifs in          all known mammalian ORs            The first step was to identify all currently known hOR          sequences by extensive keyword and homologybased          searches of several public DNA and protein sequence          databases see Materials and methods The resulting          several hundred sequences were compared with each other          by BLAST and multiple sequence alignments DNA and          protein entries were matched All duplicates were          crossreferenced and apparent pseudogenes having          frameshifts deletions and other defects obviously          incompatible with receptor function were eliminated This          initial screen identified approximately            bona fide fulllength according to          criteria described below hOR genes and a large number of          candidate sequence fragments          The next step was identification of additional members          of the family by exhaustive iterative homology searches          of translated human genomic sequence databases          particularly the raw unannotated highthroughput genomic          sequences HTGS using protein queries corresponding to          the known hORs As the number of identified receptors          grew additional diverse sequences were added to the          query list to capture additional ORs in databases          Genomic sequences containing areas of significant          homology to ORs were subjected to open reading frame          ORF searches Several hundred identified ORFs of          sufficient length  amino acids were translated          and compared to known ORs Three criteria were used to          select putative ORs from this set high overall sequence          similarity the presence of seven predicted transmembrane          TM regions and the presence of multiple positionally          conserved sequence motifs described in Materials and          methods that serve as signatures of this gene family          The basic criteria for recognizing a particular OR gene          as encoding a fulllength functional receptor candidate          were the presence of an uninterrupted ORF starting with          an ATG codon and a complete seventransmembrane unit A          few putative ORs were discarded from the final set          because they contained structural features deemed to be          incompatible with receptor function such as insertions          of multiple nucleotide sequence repeats in their          ORFs          These are intentionally minimalist criteria designed          to exclude apparent OR pseudogenes but not cryptic          pseudogenes such as those having defects on the level of          transcription or splicing or containing subtle but          functionally disruptive mutations in receptor coding          region For example human OR hOR in our          nomenclature as discussed below classified by others            as a probable pseudogene on the basis of deviations          from other ORs in its carboxyl terminus and          untranslated region UTR sequence is considered a          regular candidate OR according to our analysis It has to          be noted that the final assignment of OR gene or          pseudogene status must be based on functional expression          data          As a result of the search described above           putative fulllength OR genes have been identified in the          human genome This number includes all the previously          known annotated hOR sequences extracted from the public          databases It is feasible that a small number of          fulllength hORs escaped detection because of frameshifts          or other sequencing or assembly errors in the          corresponding HTGS entries We are continuing routine          searches using updated versions of genomic sequences to          identify such cases Because of the very high occurrence          of OR pseudogenes in humans    and the presence of          ORs in highly variable parts of human genome             it is also possible that some polymorphic members of this          gene family exist in the human population in both intact          and defective allelic forms A small subset of identified          OR ORFs was discarded because of such defects as partial          deletions of TM or TM regions The argument can be made          that these OR genes could encode functional receptors In          addition it was hypothesized that odorant reception may          also be mediated by receptors of a completely different          class such as guanylate cyclases   These caveats          notwithstanding we estimate that we have identified at          least  of all fulllength prototypical ORs in the          human genome                          Cloning coding regions of fulllength human          olfactory receptor genes          To validate sequences extracted by genomic database          mining all hOR gene coding sequences described in this          paper were cloned by direct genomic PCR using mixed DNA          from ten individuals as a template and oligonucleotide          primers corresponding to the amino and carboxyterminal          sequences of the corresponding ORFs An average of eight          independent clones for each receptor were isolated and          sequenced in their entirety While singlenucleotide          polymorphisms SNPs were detected in many hORs data not          shown the sequencing data essentially confirmed correct          identification of fulllength ORencoding ORFs Sequences          shown in the multiple sequence alignment Figure  are          those extracted from genomic sequence database          entries          Studies of human OR gene and pseudogene sequences          covering approximately  fulllength receptor genes             were recently published A larger set of          annotated putative human OR genes identified by an          automated search algorithm became very recently          accessible through a worldwide web interface   A          detailed comparison and crossreferencing of this          overlapping set of data with the output of our          independent database mining and genomic cloning effort          allowed us to verify the hOR selection reported in this          paper The sets of the hORs identified by us and the          other group strongly overlap which corroborates the          essentially complete overview of the hOR repertoire We          found differences between our data and those in the HORDE          database however These include  hOR genes that are          apparently identified as pseudogenes in the HORDE          database but encode functional hOR candidates by our          analysis as well as  hORs not found in HORDE see          Materials and methods Our extensive cloning and          sequencing data supported the conclusions presented here          Differences are probably caused by DNA sequencing errors          in raw highthroughput genomic sequence Other          differences include single nucleotideamino acid changes          as well as discrepancies in the definition of amino and          carboxyl termini for some ORs An important caveat in          interpreting these discrepancies is an apparent          evolutionary decline in the human olfactory apparatus          Many specific anosmias inabilities to smell a particular          odorant have been identified in humans             Although the molecular basis for these anosmias is not          currently known all or some of them could be caused by          hereditary OR defects The high proportion of hOR          pseudogenes    and the unusually high rate of SNPs          in hORs   point to significant variability in the          composition of the functional OR repertoire in the human          population More research is needed to clarify these          issues and to generate the final catalog of functional          hORs                          Genomic localization and general features of          hORs          It has been previously demonstrated that members of          the hOR gene family are distributed on all but a few          human chromosomes Through fluorescence           in situ hybridization analysis          Rouquier   showed that OR sequences reside at more          than  locations in the human genome and that the human          genome has accumulated a striking number of dysfunctional          copies  of these sequences were found to be          pseudogenes We identified a total of  putative          functional hOR genes located in multiple clusters on all          human chromosomes except for      and Y          with the majority  hORs on chromosome  Chromosome           is followed in frequency by chromosome   ORs            ORs and   ORs By contrast chromosomes            and X seem to carry only a single fulllength OR gene          Fulllength hOR genes are present in more than           distinct clusters and are interspersed with pseudogene OR          sequences to a variable degree data not shown          The distribution of hORs from the two most abundant          sources chromosomes  and  in the phylogenetic tree          of the OR repertoire is illustrated in Figure  While it          does reveal some phylogenetic superclusters of ORs the          chromosomespecific subsets of ORs are typically          scattered across the phylogenetic tree In addition to          harboring almost half of the functional OR candidates          chromosome  contains an intriguing large cluster of           fulllength OR genes families  through  in          Figure  which is evolutionarily distinct from the rest          of the repertoire and is located near the telomeric end          of chromosome  Despite the phylogenetic uniqueness          this subgroup has strongly conserved sequence signature          motifs of ORs The remainder of ORs from chromosome           are clustered in the centromeric region q or at          the other end of the chromosome q Although the          available information on genomic localization of the OR          genes was extracted from the Human Genome Project data          and used in developing OR nomenclature see below          mapping the exact chromosomal position of each OR gene or          studying their cluster organization was not the goal of          this study Instead our focus was on identification and          comparative analysis of putative fulllength hOR          sequences produced by conceptual translation of the          corresponding genomic OR ORFs          Whereas the aminoacid identity between a few of the          most distant human ORs is as low as  the average          identity for a random pair of hORs is in the           range This lower limit of sequence identity within the          hOR family is similar to that reported for candidate           Drosophila OR genes   and          chemosensory receptors of           Caenorhabditis elegans   An          average predicted hOR is approximately  amino acids          long whereas the shortest OR included in the list of          fulllength receptors according to our criteria is           amino acids hORo Uncertainty in determining          exact amino termini for many ORs see below makes it          difficult to identify the longest receptor sequence          however one hOR hOR is at least  amino          acids long          Strictly speaking a candidate hOR would be the most          appropriate designation for a protein belonging to this          structurally distinct human Gproteincoupled receptor          family as their odorantdetecting function has not yet          been reported As pointed out in a recent review            very little experimental data exists on the expression of          OR genes in human olfactory sensory neurons             Some studies indicate that OR genes can be expressed in          tissues other than the olfactory epithelium suggesting          potential alternative biological roles for this class of          chemosensory receptors Expression of various ORs was          reported in human and murine erythroid cells            developing rat heart   avian notochord   and          lingual epithelium   The best experimentally          documented case is the existence of a large subset of          mammalian ORs transcribed in testes and expressed on the          surface of mature spermatozoa suggesting a possible role          for ORs in sperm chemotaxis      It has          been also hypothesized that olfactory receptors might          provide molecular codes for cellcell recognition in          development and embryogenesis   including providing          guidance for olfactory bulb glomeruli targeting by          chemosensory neurons                            Conserved sequence motifs                      Transmembrane domains and loops            Strong sequence conservation is apparent in the            intracellular loops probably reflecting interactions            of ORs with common intracellular partners such as G             olf   One such previously            described conserved motif located at the junction of            transmembrane domain TM  and intracellular loop IC             and incorporating EDRY sequence conserved in all            Gproteincoupled receptors is MAYDRYVAIC            singleletter aminoacid notation The highly            conserved motif KAFSTCXSH X is any amino acid in IC            contains one of the cysteines from the intracellular            pair conserved in many Gproteincoupled receptors as            well as serines and threonines potentially involved in            phosphorylation events as discussed below Other highly            conserved regions include TM TM and TM the last            two domains are routinely used in the design of            familyspecific degenerate oligonucleotide primers for            PCR amplification of ORs Most of the sequence            variability is observed in extracellular loops EC and            EC membranespanning domains TM TM and to a lesser            degree TM and TM as well as in the extreme amino and            carboxyl termini of the receptors not shown in Figure             Structural diversity of these extracellular loops            and transmembrane domains is believed to reflect            ligandbinding specificity of ORs    One model            of a ligandbinding pocket in ORs stipulates the            existence of  variable aminoacid residues on            transmembrane helices  and  that constitute the            putative ligand complementaritydetermining region               Taking into account the high observed sequence            variability Figures   in additional OR domains            known to be involved in ligand recognition in other            Gproteincoupled receptors    such as TM and            extracellular loops that model may not be sufficient            to provide a complete description of odorant binding            specificity determinants            Almost all Gproteincoupled receptors contain a            highly conserved cysteine in EC and another in EC            There is direct and circumstantial evidence that the            residues form an intraor intermolecular disulfide            bond in many Gproteincoupled receptors and in some            cases these are critical for their ligand recognition            and membrane trafficking     OR sequences            contain one highly conserved cysteine in EC and three            in EC an unusual feature shared by only a few            Gproteincoupled receptors such as chemokine or PY            receptors which have an additional pair of            disulfideforming cysteines in the amino terminus and            EC    These four highly conserved cysteines            suggest that two disulfide bonds may be present on the            extracellular surface of ORs Like other            Gproteincoupled receptors ORs also contain a            conserved pair of cysteine residues in IC and IC            Figures                                  Amino termini            Olfactory receptors have short approximately             amino acids extracellular amino termini that do not            have homology to traditional cleavable leader peptides            A strongly conserved stretch of unknown functional            significance EFILLLGLF is located approximately            ten amino acids upstream of the predicted first            transmembrane region Like other Gproteincoupled            receptors ORs contain consensus sequences NXST for             N linked glycosylation near            their amino termini and in EC Almost every OR has a            single predicted aminoterminal             N glycosylation site and            approximately  of the repertoire contains a consensus            glycosylation site in EC whereas none are detected in            EC A number of ORs also contain NXC motifs in the            same locations It was recently suggested that this            motif occurring in some murine ORs is a possible            novel             N linked glycosylation site              It has to be noted that exact prediction of            aminoterminal sequences of hORs based on genomic            sequence information is not always clearcut While the            OR coding sequences are generally believed to be            intronless there is at least one report of an            exception to this rule resulting in an aminoterminal            sequence heterogeneity   In addition UTR            introns in OR genes are typically located very close to            the OR coding region   Extensive alternative            splicing of UTRs of OR mRNAs have been described               Therefore both the straightforward conceptual            translation of the longest OR ORF derived from genomic            sequence as well as use of intronexon prediction            programs may result in incorrect identification of OR            amino termini The presence of a potential splice            acceptor site homology to other ORs and an initiating            ATG sequence context conducive to             in vivo translation   were            taken into consideration to predict aminoterminal OR            protein sequences in our analysis                                Carboxyl termini            Predicted carboxyl termini of the ORs are short            with an average length of about  amino acids and            have significant similarity in their TMproximal half            starting with the highly conserved consensus RNK motif            immediately adjacent to TM Many class I            Gproteincoupled receptors including rhodopsin and            the               adrenergic receptor contain one            or two cysteine residues in their carboxyl termini            about  amino acids from the end of TM These            correspond to a putative palmitoylation site which            allows formation of a fourth cytoplasmic loop that            maybe involved in Gprotein coupling Only  of the            human ORs have one or more cysteines in their            carboxyterminal regions suggesting that            carboxyterminal palmitoylation if it occurs is not            general for ORs An additional feature of OR carboxyl            termini is a high content of positively charged            aminoacid residues occurring in a positionally            conserved pattern a not uncommon feature of many other            Gproteincoupled receptors Yet another typical            feature of many of these receptors is the presence of            multiple serine and threonine residues in their            carboxyl termini and IC that serve as phosphorylation            sites for Gproteincoupled receptor kinases GRKs as            well as protein kinases C PKC and A PKA a            mechanism involved in agonistdependent desensitization            of the receptors Mammalian ORs are known to undergo            rapid desensitization after odorant stimulation              and GRK has been implicated in this process               Approximately  of the ORs do not have any serine or            threonine residues in their carboxyl termini whereas            the remaining  have an average of more than two such            residues most of which are located in the vicinity of            positively charged amino acids and conform to consensus            sequences for phosphorylation by PKC or PKA In            addition the short third intracellular loop of all ORs            contains four to five highly positionally conserved            serine or threonine residues interspersed with four            equally conserved basic amino acids comprising a good            potential site for phosphorylation                                    A proposed nomenclature for functional human          olfactory receptor candidates          By analogy with the classical examples of          pharmacologybased nomenclatures of some wellstudied          Gproteincoupled receptor families a nomenclature of          functional olfactory receptors could be based on their          odorant specificity As such information is currently          almost nonexistent for human ORs other criteria such as          the chromosomal localization of their genes similarly to          the recently proposed           D melanogaster OR nomenclature            or their structural phylogenetic analysis as          proposed for mammalian ORs    should be used We          suggest an alternative hybrid nomenclature reflecting          both phylogenetic clustering of OR gene products and          their chromosomal localization It is conceivable that          phylogenetic closeness and high sequence similarity of          ORs may reflect similarity in their ligand specificities          On the other hand colocalization of a subset of OR          genes in a particular genomic cluster might indicate          their coordinate regulation and common biological          function One possible example of the latter is the OR          gene cluster located on human chromosome  at the          telomeric end of the HLA complex region It has been          shown recently that OR members from this cluster exhibit          unusually high allelic variability similar to the major          histocompatibility complex MHC genes   It is          hypothesized that this group of human ORs could be          functionally linked to MHC and involved in MHCmediated          mate preferences    Another relevant example is          the discovery of a block of human OR genes at least one          of which OR  hOR encodes a potentially          functional receptor in subtelomeric regions that are          present in  to  similar copies on several chromosomes            The presence of OR genes in these polymorphically          multiplied rearrangementprone areas hints at a higher          level complexity and individual variations in OR          repertoire          We generated phylogenetic trees using the          neighborjoining algorithm   as implemented in the          two standard phylogenetic analysis software packages          ClustalX    and Phylip   In both cases the          dataset was bootstrapped   to provide the statistical          estimation of the reliability of the resulting tree          topology Two resulting dendrograms having very similar          topology were used to identify OR clusters and assign the          receptors to a particular family A phylogenetic          dendrogram derived from comparison of fulllength OR          protein sequences is shown in Figure  with the families          bracketed Strong phylogenetic clustering supported by          the bootstrap tests typically only the bootstrap values          higher than  were considered significant as well as          high sequence similarity  identity were used as          a main criterion for grouping receptors into a particular          family The second criterion for defining a family was          common chromosomal localization including          colocalization in a particular genomic locus if known at          the time of analysis It is believed that local tandem          gene duplication is a common mechanism of OR evolution          from common predecessors Not surprisingly there is a          strong correlation between localization of an OR in a          particular chromosomal cluster and its position in a          phylogenetic dendrogram derived from comparison of          fulllength OR protein sequences Figure  However in          a number of cases ORs from different chromosomal loci          converge in a phylogenetic cluster implying recent gene          duplication with interchromosomal insertion events from a          distant region of the genome          As a result of this branching analysis the family of           hORs was subdivided into  families from  to           members in each Figure  The minimum pairwise          intrafamily aminoacid identity is  and the average          minimum aminoacid identity within all of the  families          having more than one member is  Each          chromosomespecific subset of hORs consists of  to           for chromosome  independently numbered families          whereby each chromosome has family  for example          Members of each family are numbered sequentially from           An example of our nomenclature is hOR which          represents a human olfactory receptor located on          chromosome  from family  and which is member  of the          family          Numerous ways of classifying ORs on the basis of          cloning technique clone name or genomic location have          been put forward The most advanced and consistent          existing nomenclature which includes both genes and          pseudogenes and is implemented in the HORDE database is          based solely on phylogenetic clustering with consequent          division of ORs into families and subfamilies             According to this nomenclature receptor sequences with           or more aminoacid identity are considered members of          the same family whereas those sharing  or more          identity constitute a subfamily We believe that at          least in some cases OR names in our nomenclature carry          more biologically relevant information and could be more          rational Consider for example receptors hOR          hORH hOR hORH hOR hORH          and hOR hORG where the HORDE names are in          parentheses According to our nomenclature see Figure           these four receptors form two complete families           with one member located on chromosome  and  with          three chromosome  members located in a single gene          cluster According to the HORDE division all four          receptors belong to the family  Three ORs including          the one from chromosome  and two from chromosome           fall into subfamily H whereas the remaining chromosome           OR belongs to subfamily G In other cases similar OR          grouping is provided by both nomenclatures Nevertheless          even for those cases the names in our nomenclature carry          information about the chromosome of origin for a given OR          instead of an arbitrary subfamily name An added          convenience of the nomenclature we are proposing is the          straightforward computerfriendly format which would          facilitate the handling of hundreds of OR sequences It          allows encoding up to  OR subfamilies of  members for          each chromosome possibly including polymorphic OR forms          as well as easy sorting of receptor lists          For the reasons discussed earlier some additional          functional hOR candidates are likely to be identified in          the future and will have to be accommodated by the          nomenclature It may also need to be refined as we learn          more about the biological function and specificity of          olfactory receptors and the detailed genomic mapping of          OR clusters We believe however that the OR          nomenclature we describe represents a comprehensive          convenient and possibly more biologically relevant          alternative to the existing OR classifications                            Conclusions        Identification and cloning of the functional hOR        repertoire creates a basis for addressing many unresolved        issues in human olfaction Most importantly in conjunction        with robust heterologous expression and assay systems and        highthroughput screening of odorant libraries it will        ultimately lead to understanding of structurefunction        relationships and smallmolecule recognition by this large        group of Gproteincoupled receptors The impact of genetic        polymorphism of ORs on differential olfactory perception in        the human population is another exciting topic Global        comparative analysis of functional hOR candidate gene and        pseudogene repertoires as well as of repertoires of human        and murine ORs will shed light on the evolution of the        human olfactory apparatus and its biological        consequences                    Materials and methods                  Sequence database
