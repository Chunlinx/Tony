                    Background        Freshwater planarians          Platyhelminthes Turbellaria        Tricladida  are widely employed for pattern formation        investigations planaria differ from other models used to        study morphogenesis insects nematodes fish amphibians        and mammals by their phenomenal ability to regenerate            Moreover planaria are used for         in vivo tumorogenicity studies of        pure compounds and complex environmental mixtures and for        mechanistic studies of tumorogenesis            Planaria are prospective models for genetic variation        studies in populations The planarian species          Planariidae family are represented        by different strains employing various modes of        reproduction including exclusively sexual exclusively        asexual or both sexual and asexual        Strains        that reproduce exclusively asexually are genetically        different to strains of the same species able to reproduce        both sexually and asexually For instance an asexual        strain of         Dugesia S mediterranea exhibits        morphological heteromorphosis in the third pair of        chromosomes     Worms belonging to different asexual        strains of         Dugesia japonica and         Girardia formerly         Dugesia          tigrina are triploid or mixoploid        while sexual strains are diploid      Asexual strains        are represented by independent populations that propagate        only by fission        Recently we supplemented the wellknown SSH        suppression subtractive hybridization technology            with the Mirror Orientation Selection method MOS for        eliminating background clones from SSHgenerated libraries            This innovative procedure allowed the application        of these techniques in the subtraction of large eukaryotic        genomes including those of freshwater planarian haploid        genome size of         G tigrina is    bp            Using the SSHMOS combination genomes of two different        strains of         G tigrina were compared Novel        viruslike element with unusual features was identified in        one planarian strain We characterized the genome structure        of the novel element and analyzed its distribution in the        planarian body                    Results                  Verification of the model          Two planarian strains were used for comparison One          was an asexual strain maintained as laboratory culture in          Moscow Russia for over  years Worms belonging to          this strain have been successfully used for various          experiments including gene discovery                The second strain collected in Russia near Moscow          represented sexual planaria capable of both sexual and          asexual reproduction The specimens were assigned to           G tigrina on the basis of their          external appearance       This strain is          morphologically similar to the sexual strain collected          previously in Spain    and like the Spanish animals          differs from asexual planaria in their size and details          of coloration Unlike asexual animals mature planaria of          the sexual strain possess welldistinguished reproductive          organs and lay fertile cocoons          To verify the genetic propinquity of the sexual and          asexual planarian strains we analyzed mariner element          sequences from the asexual and the sexual specimens          Several DNA sequences similar to the mariner element have          been reported in           G tigrina      There are          about  copies of this element in the genome which          appear to code for an active transposase     None of          these mariner elements are present in the genomes of          other turbellarians including the species closest to           G tigrina     With the aid of          PCR using specific primers for the planarian mariner          element we isolated and sequenced several clones from          sexual and asexual planaria All clones displayed           identity at the nucleotide level and the differences          between sequences of various strains did not exceed the          diversity within one strain          Based on these data we conclude that the two          planarian strains represent a valid model system for          studying genetic differences between planarian          populations and can be used for the subtractive          hybridization of genomes                          Cloning of PEVE          Two subtracted libraries were generated the first          enriched with asexual strainspecific DNA fragments AS          library and the second with sexual strainspecific DNA          SS library Differential screening revealed  and           strainspecific clones in SS and AS libraries          respectively Sequence analyses of selected ASspecific          clones demonstrated that about  contained open reading          frames ORFs with codon usage unusual for           G tigrina     Some of these          ASspecific ORFs encode polypeptides similar to viral          proteins          When used as probes in Southern blot hybridization          with undigested sexual and asexual planarian DNA these          clones stained two relatively low molecular weight DNA          bands in asexual specimens only Figure  The intensity          of hybridization signals was significantly higher more          then fold than that for the unique genomic sequence          data not shown          Our results imply that most ASspecific clones are          linked to an amplified extrachromosomal viruslike          element designated PEVE Planarian Extrachromosomal          Viruslike Element Using PCR with combinations of          primers designed from these PEVE sequences and the          genomewalking approach several overlapping fragments          constituting the  kb contig were isolated                          PEVE genome organization          PCR analyses with PEVEspecific primers showed that          the putative viral genome comprises two unique regions          flanked by inverted repeats specifically Us  bp          GenBank Accession No AF and Ul regions Two types          of Ul region were identified that displayed some sequence          difference Ul  bp GenBank Accession No AF          and Ul  bp GenBank Accession No AF A          schematic diagram of the regions with predicted ORFs is          presented in Figure A PCR analyses with different          combinations of primers specific for PEVE revealed four          variants of orientation of Ul and Us relative to one          another Figure B          To purify PEVE DNA the plasmid DNA alkaline lysis          method was used Partially purified PEVE DNA was          visualized on an agarose gel following ethidium bromide          staining Figure  Two bands corresponding to two          extrachromosomal DNA fragments were detected          Southern blot hybridization with different          PEVEspecific probes revealed that each fragment          contained the entire PEVE sequence Figure  Using          nondenaturing Southern blot hybridization on planarian          genomic DNA we established that the PEVE Ul sequences          hybridized to the lighter fragment whereas Us probes          stained the less mobile fragment Figure           These results imply that the lighter fragment contains          a singlestranded ss Ul region and doublestranded ds          Us region while the less mobile fragment is composed of          ss Us and ds Ul sequences Figure C                          Sequence analysis          BLAST analyses of identified ORFs showed that two were          significantly similar to known viral proteins          characteristic of distant viral phyla Other ORFs          displayed no significant homology to known proteins          The protein encoded by ORFS designated PEVE E is          homologous to the helicase domain of superfamily  SF          viral helicases such as E proteins of papillomaviruses          Figure        Similar to SF helicases the          PEVE E domain contains a Ploop motif A and two          conserved motifs B and C that determine helicase          function      However unlike SF helicases PEVE          E contains only the helicase domain with no additional          protein domains          The sequence of the ORFL product denoted PEVE Rep          is homologous to circoviral replication initiator Rep          proteins Figure  Rep proteins of circoviruses          nanoviruses and geminiviruses consist of two domains          specifically a Nterminal nicking domain with conserved          motifs   and  and a Cterminal SF helicase domain          conserved motifs A B and C      Conserved          sequence motifs  are characteristic of Rep proteins          that utilize the rolling circle mechanism of replication          employed by different groups of viruses circoviruses          nanoviruses geminiviruses bacteriophage                   However replicationassociated proteins of          animal parvoviruses which utilize the rolling hairpin          mechanism of replication only contain motifs  and                        The PEVE Rep protein is considerably similar to          circoviral Rep proteins and comprises two domains The          Cterminus of PEVE Rep contains all three conserved          motifs A B and C signifying helicase activity          However like animal parvovirus Rep proteins the          Nterminal part of PEVE Rep contains only conserved          motifs  and  suggesting replication by the rolling          hairpin mechanism                          Distribution of the PEVE element in the planarian          body          For analysis of PEVE distribution in planarian body a          single planarian was cut transversely into six zones as          depicted in Figure A and six corresponding DNA samples          were prepared PCR data from these samples showed that          PEVE is distributed unevenly along the worms body          Figure  The anterior zones zones  and  contain          lower concentrations of the element than the posterior          part of the worm          We analyzed the PEVE expression using Northern blot          analysis and RTPCR Figure  ORFS and ORFL probes          were used for Northern blot The ORFL probe hybridized          to an about  base polyA message The major          transcript revealed by ORFS probe hybridization was          about  base For each gene transcript length obtained          using Northern blot is consistent with the cDNA length          plus a polyA tail assuming the putative promoter          positions  for ORFL and  for ORFS and          potential polyadenylation signal sequence are          utilized          RTPCR studies showed that all PEVE ORFs are expressed          in planarian body with the same pattern PEVE expression          was not detected in the head region and increased from          zone  to the tail          Wholemount           in situ hybridization with PEVE RNA          probes confirmed the above data PEVEcontaining cells          were not detected in the head region and increased in          number from zone  to the tail Cells containing PEVE          were sparse in unstained parenchyma Figure AB          For ORFL and ORFS both sense and antisense          riboprobes displayed visible staining figure CD          while           in situ hybridization with sense          ORFL probe yielded no signal data not shown We          proposed that sense probes can hybridize with PEVE          ssDNA while antisense probes can hybridize with both          RNA and ssDNA If so there is one polarity of the ss          DNA regions within PEVE ORFL and ORFS are present in          the antisense orientation and their sense probes          hybridize with PEVE ssDNA stretches ORFL exists in the          opposite sense orientation within the ssDNA region of          PEVE and ORFL antisense probe hybridizes with both PEVE          RNA and ssDNA                          Examination of PEVE in Spanish asexual          planaria          We performed PEVE analyses in asexual planaria from an          independent Spanish population PCR with PEVEspecific          primers of genomic DNA and cDNA and Southern blot          hybridization on genomic DNA did not reveal PEVE in          planaria nucleic acid samples data not shown This          indicates that only our asexual planarian population is          infected by PEVE                            Discussion        Using the subtractive hybridization technique we        identified a novel planarian viruslike element PEVE        Examination of PEVE genome organization and structure        reveals that this viruslike element cannot be assigned to        any known group of viruses or plasmids and thus represents        a novel type of viral element that encodes two helicases in        one genome Both putative helicases may be involved in the        initiation of DNA replication        The proposed scheme of PEVE genomic organization is        presented in Figure C Based on Southern blot and         in situ hybridization data we        hypothesize that PEVE exists as two variant forms with        different compositions of ss and ds DNA stretches        corresponding to the Ul and Us regions The ss stretches        are present in a unique orientation and therefore have only        one type of polarity The ss Ul region displays sense        orientation for ORFL and antisense for ORFL while the Us        region comprises a strand with all encoded ORFs in an        antisense orientation These ss regions are flanked by ds        sequences in both orientations        PEVE is distributed unevenly along the worms body Our        PCR data reveal very low amounts of the virallike element        in the head region The PEVE expression was also detected        in central and tail regions and was not found in head        region In accordance with in situ hybridization data PEVE        is detected in certain differentiated parenchyma cells        PEVE is the first viral element identified in        freeliving flatworms This novel element is not widespread        in planarian populations and has been detected in only one        planarian asexual strain to date However it is possible        that similar viruslike elements and viruses are present in        other planarian strains        Although asexual strains of planaria exist independently        for a long time they display substantial genetic        resemblance In particular the identities of five         Antennapedia like homeobox genes        have been disclosed from both our and the Spanish asexual        strains      These findings imply that PEVE may        affect other asexual strains of planaria thus paving the        way for the development of transgenic planaria using the        planarian viral sequences as vectors for introduction of        exogenous DNA into planarian cells                    Conclusions        We have identified a novel extrachromosomal        viralelement PEVE in the asexual strain of planarian         G tigrina  PEVE is the first viral        element identified in planaria and comprises two potential        helicases that are homologous to proteins from distant        viral phyla This element cannot be assigned to any known        group of viruses or plasmids PEVE is unevenly distributed        in the worm body and is detected in differentiated        parenchyma cells                    Materials and Methods
