arguments but everyone agrees that neither impeachment article willget the requisite  votes and some senators think the perjury article wontget even a majority Speculation turns to whether  conservative senatorswill be able to filibuster a posttrial censure resolution to death and Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal committed perjury when he denied peddling nastystories about Monica Lewinsky to the press The naive scenario Rather than letClinton escape unpunished the Senate will prolong the trial to subpoena moretestimony about Blumenthal The sophisticated scenario Clinton will escapeunpunished and in his stead Blumenthal will be prosecuted afterwardChance of removal from office Zero                                       For the complete Clintometer and links to all Slate s

some people had misunderstood it The aideDavid Howard had then resigned saying his use of the word was insensitiveand Williams had accepted his resignation Williams now says he acted toohastily The spins  Bravo to Williams for admitting his error and refusingto bow to ignorance  Howard should take a less visible job because hisrapport with black city residents is crippled  Howard says the episode wasreally not about me or the use of the word niggardly  It was aboutfeelings underneath the surface  I used to think it would be great if wecould all be colorblind Thats naive especially for a white person  Shutup and take the job                         The WhiteHouse rebuked People magazine for running a cover story on ChelseaClinton The profile while essentially positive dwells on a negative contexthow the Lewinsky scandal is stressing out Chelsea and affecting her personallife eg the headline is Grace Under Fire An intimate look at the deepbond of love that sustains the Clinton women through their painful familyordeal The White House reportedly tried to spike the story on securitygrounds then condemned it as an invasion of Chelseas privacy The spins The Clintons are good parents who are trying to protect their daughter Theyre hypocrites since theyve used People and other popularmagazines for publicity about their family when it suits them  Chelsea isfair game because shes an adult and a public figure  The article was niceto her  Well at any rate it could have been a lot meaner                        PresidentClinton presented his  budget  Highlights a  percent

apologize to my Jewish friends here and aroundthe world and I apologize to the Christians here for having created any kind ofrift  I apologize not for what I believe but for my lack of tact andjudgment in making a statement that served no purpose whatsoever The spins Falwell is an antiSemite  No the only reason he had said the Antichristmust be Jewish is that Jesus was Jewish and the Antichrist is supposed toresemble Jesus  So Falwell had nothing to apologize for other thaninsensitivityanother triumph of political correctness  If resemblance toJesus were the only issue why didnt

for a touchdown to put the game away The goat was Falconssafety Eugene Robinson who was arrested the night before the game forallegedly trying to buy oral sex from a prostitute Sports writers mercilesslyscrutinized Robinsons errors in the game notably getting burned on an yard touchdown pass and partly blamed the Falcons sloppy performance severalmuffed touchdown opportunities and four secondhalf turnovers on the attendantdismay and distraction The runnerup goat was Falcons Coach Dan Reeves whosedefeat at the hands of his former quarterback Elway and an assistant coach hefired seven years ago Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan made Reeves  in theSuper Bowl The postgame hype revolves around whether Elway will attempt athreepeat next year or will retire on top as Michael Jordan did

elected office and is too conservative for mostvoters he plans to make antiabortion legislation a cornerstone of hiscampaign but he will have plenty of diehard donors volunteers andcaucusgoers from the religious right The media spin is that his announcementillustrates how longshot candidates milk attention by dragging out theirannouncements Bauer hinted at his candidacy in speeches then announced hewas taking a leave of absence from his job then set up an announcementinterview on Meet the Press  then persuaded newspapers to write previewstories about the TV announcementall before he
