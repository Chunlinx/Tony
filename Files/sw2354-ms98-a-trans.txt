          okay what kind of books do you like to read for enjoyment   uh mainly the the books i read are uh business related   uhhuh   or self improvement um ive got a a uh small company on the side that i that i do things with so uh a lot of the reading that i i do has to do with um how can i uh do better at at my small time business uh   what kind of business is it   important issues such as a you know taxes and   uhhuh   business expenses and all those kind things   well that sounds interesting that sounds fun  what kind of business is it     um ive got a uh small distributorship uh i uh   uhhuh   sell a uh healthy cookie on the side   really   and uh i have a few health food stores that i send it to i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can so i can get a deal from the uh from the main from the supplier   uhhuh well thats interesting   and then i distributed them and then i can i get i can sell them at a cheaper price plus ive got a uh drinking water system business that ive had on the side for years that ive done   a what   a drinking water business uh yeah  yeah   oh really well that sounds interesting my mom always wants me to open a health food store but ill im not really into it i dont know the information i dont know that much about it so anyway but well thats interesting i personally i like mostly um if i had a book of my choice i like books i go to the library a lot and it seems like i always i never go to the fiction section i mean that to me is just ridiculous its like life is to interesting to read fiction but   uhhuh   i always get books like um i like to quilt well im not into quilting but i check a lot of books out to learn how i just havent done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book but i like to um can and do food preservation and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff and i like to check books out like that and i always come away with im a Christian and i enjoy reading books about um i like i have a real heart for people involved in cults   uhhuh   and so i have a real you know heart for them and  im going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today and thats just where my heart is so i read a lot of books on that and you know Christian books written by people about you know to help you out and stuff and i read the Bible i dont read the Bible as much as i should but but i think i would always think that no matter what i did so but i do enjoy reading that and so pretty much we have different interests i think in reading   sounds like it   but and i have a neighbor with a big motorbike and he likes to run down the street with it and you you can probably hear him  but um i dont know so do you enjoy reading anything like that um   uhhuh um i havent really read anything like that in in in years there was a time when i was really into the home things and i did uh had my own garden and i did canning all those kind of things that was when i was about uh ten years younger   uhhuh   and uh had   thirty or younger       is that what you said   about ten years younger yeah   oh ten years younger oh thats funny   and um uh the the problem that ive had in the past with uh my children growing up and moving out of the house and and still having three left at home out of the five um ive   uhhuh   tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in in reading more and and spending more time at the library and it ive been moderately successful   uhhuh   uh with my daughter and with my son they both have different interests in books but um they they uh they do read them um i have some books on on health that i read all the time ones on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing but yeah i im   oh really yeah Maureen Solomon i had a a friend of mine has a book by her right now called Foods That Heal   uhhuh   they eat a lot of it you know you can take your vitamins and she was telling me to take zinc so anyway ive been taking enough zinc you know  to kill a horse probably  i hope it doesnt hurt me but anyway  i did read one chapter of that   theres a uh a couple called um oh im going to forgot his name now uh Dirkson   uhhuh   um and uh theres a book called Life Extensions i dont know if youve ever heard of it   no i havent   okay its a book called Life Extensions theres also a book called The Life Extansion Extension Companion uh Dirk Pearson and   uhhuh   oh i forgot Sallys last name anyway its a couple ive ive seen them on TV and uh they have they are pretty down to earth about uh what you can take and and what you cant take and um   the quantities and   the quantities what are good for you what isnt and um Life Extensions   whats the name of it again Life Extension   uh yeah hes probably about forty years old now i saw him probably seven years ago on Johnny Carson Show   umhum uhhuh oh really   and uh i was pretty impressed he had a he before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs   uhhuh   you know based on how well it was performing and then he embarked on this uh vitamin treatment and then every year he had the same tests run   umhum uhhuh   and at the age of thirty two i think it was his um heart was that of a fourteen year old   really   and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age and of course Sally uh isnt a very big woman i mean shes you know she appeared to me to be very petite and um she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an S   umhum oh really   and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises uh together they both exercised about five minutes a day doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises   really i know theres not any food that you can get and its grown on good soil hardly anymore and i know my my husbands uncle owns a big some acreage in a Eastland Texas which is in West Texas   uhhuh   and he owns a lot of acreage thats been farmed properly you know and uh we get black eyed peas off of it and stuff but   yes   i know that you know the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you but God still somehow makes us all be able to still live i think its a miracle were all still alive after so many generations well the last couple of processed foods you know i mean but i dont know i like to i like to my i like to be able to eat really healthy you know what am saying and i guess im going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do dont think were going to restore the earth to you know i think Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be   uhhuh   but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because im always looking down my plate and i think man isnt this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but i do take some vitamins on the side and i do like reading books like that i just i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth and were going to restore the earth i just dont see that i think i mean think to think that is almost its hopeless to think that man can do anything with the you know what im saying its to big than us and i think Gods in charge and Gods going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the   yes   you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking but you know theres a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and you know and try and do whats what i can do out of it thats practical but anyway so   yeah theres ive ive read a lot of things um since i got involved in the water business back in eighty three um and its amazing that the the legislation they have   uhhuh   um for food that doesnt apply to water they dont consider water a food and uh the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they wouldnt be able to sell it to you   uhhuh   through your pipes because its toxic um chlorine its toxic its a i dont know if your on city water city water has chlorine in it chlorine causes cancer   because its what oh uhhuh uhhuh   they know that theyve proven that um yet their saying well were putting such low doses in there that well you dont have to worry about dying from it the problem is that ive that ive read books that   uhhuh uhhuh   uh have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack     um   and if you look at the history of heart attacks  heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty   really   and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water   really you know i bet thats why we have some friends that eat only i just took this Amish bread out of the oven man its going to be good i had a starter that friend of mine made anyway uh i had a friend that read a book on that and um ive all my relatives my mom you know you probably read Back To Eden or something i dont know  we read a lot i know people have read all those books but the um they drilled they drilled a well i dont know how many feet but its three or four times deeper than it needed to be   uhhuh   and so their water comes out they live in Grand Prairie but its they live kind of in a the planes go right over from DFW so its not real developed and so they have a probably half an acre   yeah im very familiar with the area   and yeah and they drilled this well and the water comes out at thirty two degrees so  its kinds of neat would that be healthier do to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that   it depends a lot of uh a lot of things were thought that uh as you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals were putting chemicals on the field well the ground will naturally filter out the
