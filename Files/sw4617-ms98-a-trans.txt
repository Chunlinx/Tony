        okay     well i say the uh probably the best thing to do is is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water if they sink  theyre innocent right   i see uh a good a good southern solution   yeah uh so uh how do you how do you feel thats thats of course being facetious but yeah   uhhuh you have to say that um       i dont know the the things they asked to talk about were whether the uh whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing and seems to me that thats i think thats the way its done now uh at least   umhum   my understanding of the law which isnt very good uh   uhhuh   it seems to me that the judge does it and i i think thats probably all right in that they       you know maybe know what the the norm is for a particular thing   umhum and i guess also what the system will absorb   right   theyre probably more tuned in to that possibly though on um capital cases like maybe the death penalty   uhhuh   uh im kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole i mean he could have like a personal prejudice you know judges are people like everybody else even though theyre theyre supposed to be impartial but   thats right   maybe uh   and i think that may i that may be an exception as well because i think that doesnt the jury decide on the death penalty rather than than the judge   i i think thats i think thats the way it is uh whether they they decide whether or not they uh   yeah   uh accused or whatever would get the uh get the death penalty do they have a death penalty in California   yes in fact theyre going to execute somebody at the end of this month and uh   yeah umhum   theres a big uproar going on right now uh the uh Governor you know has been trying to decide whether hes going to commute it or not   yeah umhum   it was someone who had uh killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact   yeah i something like that ive got no problem with them   yeah   um i guess the way i think about it is not it shouldnt necessarily be thought of as revenge its just like if youve got like a dog thats running wild and biting people  put it to sleep you know just get it out you know its not able to fit in you know   uhhuh something inexpensive   yeah yeah exactly um i guess kind of the way i think about it also is they just if somebody gets the death penalty theyre theyre judged guilty they got the death penalty they should have one year and one appeal cover all their bases with one appeal and if not you know dont dont let them sit up there on death row for you know  fifteen years   yeah i think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years   uhhuh   but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and youd hate to be one of those   yeah thats a yeah oh im im sure yeah   the other thing they asked about was whether uh       uh the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again i think is the way it is now that all that all verdicts well maybe not i dont know at least in capital cases id think theyd have to be unanimous   umhum i i believe it is in capital i think in like uh lesser cases its like ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever   uhhuh   however many is on sitting on a jury i i believe thats the way it is but im pretty sure youre correct on capital cases um   yeah the paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial and that theres one juror that is is uh different than the other eleven   uhhuh yeah   and uh theyve only deliberated four hours or something and they say theyre hopelessly deadlocked   oh no   judge told them they werent hopelessly deadlocked yet     im telling you go one way or the other that thats probably an expensive trial   yeah six months so far they said so   uh yeah probably yeah im im sure theres a number its probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day you know worth of all the food for all   maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote     yeah   yeah thats thats been so long ive practically practically forgot who Noriega was you know   right   that has been going on my uh cousin is a FBI agent down in Miami   oh really   yeah so she  follows that stuff pretty closely but uh  yeah shes not involved in that that case   thats interesting well have you ever served on a jury   she doesnt no i havent i never have my wife has but i i havent   uhhuh i got called but i uh never uh got selected for a jury i sat for twelve ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process and they had       uhhuh uhhuh   some guy that was uh defending himself   oh
