                                 Fly Me to the Moon                        One of my thousands of favorite things about New York is how weatherproofit mostly is How it takes a threefoot snowstorm to shut it down and eventhen the subways work But all this changed a couple of weeks ago when therewas a flash flood that shut down the city completely Absolutely flooded thesubway system Do you know why I do Because theyre not spending enough moneykeeping the drains clean This was in the newspapers I think but its one ofthe nice sideeffects of living with a former political journalist who is anexpert on all sorts of things like tertiary sewagetreatment facilities I justheard from New York that everyone is being sent home from work at  oclocktoday that would never have happened but for the incident a couple of weeksago            So you are thinking of canceling a book signing just because no one willcome  You must go I insist            Yesterday you wrote that the s dont exist as a culturally distinctdecade You are so wrong The s began in around  when the s endedThe s were about sex the s were about drugs and the s are aboutmoney There were no s They never happened I know this I am about to makea movie that takes place in the s and when you make a list of what the swere you come down to a list of what they werent no cell phones no colorcomputers no SUVs no botox no Starbucks no Web sites no  etc For thepurposes of the movie I think of the s as the moment just before everythingthat is currently happening happened            This brings me to a thing I love to think about especially when I fly toLos Angeles the private plane I didnt fly on one I hasten to say But I didread Vanity Fair on the plane and if you look at their list of theNew Establishment  out of  of them have private planes or access to themIm sure the other five think of nothing but how to get them There are peoplein Hollywood who would truly rather die than be seen flying commercial Infact last year one of my Hollywood friends was visiting New York and said hewas going back to Los Angeles the next day The next day I saw him and said Ithought you were going home We couldnt get out he said Now what hemeant was not that he couldnt get a flight homethere are as you knowdozens of flights to LA every daybut that he couldnt get the Warner jetHe actually stayed an extra day in New York rather than submit to thehumiliation of American Airlines            And guess what This brings me to Ron Perelman Yay Or the Ron Perelmans ofthe world Because if you really want to know how these guys get beautifulwomen to sleep with them Ill tell you They take them on their jets The jetis a powerful aphrodisiac The jet is the thing that causes the Patricia Duffsof the world to lose their minds The jet is the thing that makes them all dothe Illnevergohungryagain thing Back to Gone With the Wind  somaybe it belongs on that list of the centurys  best after all In factwhen Ron Perelman and Patricia Duff broke up at the  Democratic conventionin Chicago her friends told everyone without irony that one of theinjustices of the breakup event was that Patricia was forced to flycommercial back to New York             I wish you would write about private planes Really  I could go onforever            My ghastliest showbusiness moments were spent with Dustin Hoffman but badas they were there were nowhere near as bad as being told youve flunked anexam you havent flunked and being forced to go to summer school and as theTimes notes today being punished by your parents for flunking saidexam The story in todays paper is truly horrible These are kids withserious selfesteem issues anyway            By the way in todays Los Angeles Times is an article aboutKenneth Starr who gave a speech here in which he admitted to some qualms abouthis career as a special prosecutor The man is clearly looking for a job            I have a rule about who wins the presidency too Mine is the person with the most authenticity and  the biggest balls This is why W is so dangerousAnd your remark about Jesse Ventura truly strikes fear into my heart Althoughsomeone gave me his autobiography for my birthday and I feel you could notpossibly have read it if you believe you could pull even the smallest lever forhim
