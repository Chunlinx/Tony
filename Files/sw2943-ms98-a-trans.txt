          there we go um normally it takes me a lot longer to get through but this is pretty quick do you have children   oh yes i do i have five   oh oh my goodness tell then youve obviously had some experience with child care   um both ends actually   really uh what do you mean   i tended in my home for about twelve years   oh wow   and uh uh   now what did you look for when you were looking for child care   when i was looking for child care   umhum   ive never had to uh uh its been the situation where i had to   oh it it   put my own children in child care thank goodness   it umhum yeah thats nice   i was uh   lucky   i was um ive always been very grateful for that   umhum   excuse me just a minute   umhum   im sorry   thats okay   but it has been a a factor my youngest is now in a uh preschool which is different than   umhum   day care i guess you know per say   uhhuh um well what you know i work in a personnel agency and um so im constantly interviewing and placing people in jobs   umhum   and ive just really become discouraged in peoples own sense of responsibility and dependability um and what whats hard for me is i dont have children but i would imagine once i do im probably going to need to find some sort of child care   umhum   and it worries me it worries me a lot because i just um i i dont i dont know who i could feel comfortable trusting my children with It   oh its very hard its very hard   it i yeah   i always felt like i ran a real tip top in home child care i think there are advantages to to child care in the home but oh id be very very careful if i were putting my own children in a home   umhum umhum i know   they uh and even if you get a place thats just perfect just perfect you know its clean and the people are responsible and and the uh   umhum   the other kids are decent and there are programs provided and foods done properly and all those kinds of things that you think of you know to to worry about   umhum umhum umhum   i you know you your children build bonds with those kids that are there   yeah umhum   and yet and theyre usually very young preschool age   umhum   and yet when thats gone   umhum  yeah   you dont you dont even know who those other mothers are chances are theyre like little cousins you know or brothers and sisters and yet they never see one another again   i know oh i know umhum   so you know i think thats a   umhum   thats a factor too   oh it certainly is um   most of my uh i come from a family of nine children   and umhum oh wow   myself my own you know children my uh nuclear family   umhum   and most of us have somehow been able to work out either aunts and uncles uh siblings you know older siblings younger siblings you know some of us have  had children that were quite stretched out in age or   thats great   situations where you know kind of joint where mothers worked at night or you know alternated or dad worked out of the home so he could tend the kids you know different things and   umhum umhum   not very many of us have had to actually have that full day every day   well   day care in a herd kind of situation and the one   not only yeah not only does that make you uh just have you know more peace of mind but isnt that great for the child too   i think so   to not be with strangers and even though theyre you know getting to know the people and its probably good for them to you know be out of the house and all that but just to have a parent with them so few families are able to do that these days that the fact that youre able to do it and and that your siblings could thats just wonderful   well and at the time that i was doing you know in home child care i i felt real strongly you know that that was a needed to be a real viable opportunity for parents to to have that option that they didnt feel you know a lot of people most people cannot afford to have a nanny   umhum umhum   or a governess you know type situation where that   umhum   housekeeper someone in the home their own home is tending to their own children   umhum   day in and day out thats just a luxury most people cant afford if they could afford that they probably wouldnt be going to work except for the person whos got a career you know whos um i think more and more i think were going to see   umhum oh yeah right umhum umhum   child care change i think theres going to be more corporate involvement i think were going to see a lot more um   definitely umhum   paternity leave and options that involve the dads more   definitely and were going to see more like you were saying corporate i think were going to see more uh maybe even a corporate contribution i mean just companies helping to to pay for it because its just not   flex times yeah yeah umhum well basically you know we already have my husband works for a large uh oil corporation   uh its a necessity umhum   and they have you know a deduction kind of plan where its tax free you know if you put it in ahead of time yeah   yes thats what we do here uhhuh pre tax dollars that that youre yeah thats thats what we have here   i think thats umhum umhum and on site care   uhhuh   those kinds of   oh they do have on site care   no no they dont im saying i think that i s one of one way of the future that we will see   oh im sorry oh umhum boy yeah   and and much needed i i like to see those kinds of things that emphasize the family unity rather than   sending people off and   you know because we just have a generation of people that are not going to be happy with   umhum   either parent not when and our economy is almost precludes one person staying home if they stay home theyve still got to contribute somehow   oh i know umhum yes   you know financially   yeah oh yeah um and and i guess you know its just its too scary to be reading the papers and hearing on the news they always say that um you know all these horrible things happen in the most comfortable places like uh sexually abused children its happening with a neighbor or with somebody that they think they knew well and trusted um and   umhum umhum yeah yeah they say probably eighty percent   thats the scary thing is that you think okay these people are good because you can trust them and and all that then theyre the ones that might you know turn around and and be the ones that cause the problem its its really scary its um   well   i my husband is a professor or i should say he will be a professor and um im looking forward to his schedule being flexible and to mine and you know at some point being flexible so that we can sort of juggle our own schedules around and and create some sort of way that we can be around you know not necessarily at the same time but at least one of us be there one woman that we have in our office um he works during the day and she works in the evenings parttime   umhum umhum umhum umhum   and so you know even though shes only working parttime shes not spending money on the day care so its almost like youre not um you know maybe youre not making as much but youre not spending as much either   umhum i read the most interesting article here oh gosh its been about two months ago right around Easter time i remember thinking it   yeah   was when i read it about a husband and a wife that honest and truly share the same job for Arco Oil and Gas   umhum oh my goodness   im trying to think it was computer related they were both over a department he worked one week she works the next they have two children   umhum oh wow isnt that ideal   how very unusual you know i mean for to find two people who even could do the same job or have the same education to do it but theyd met on site you know and   yes right right   the relationship developed and you know they married and   and a company that can allow that yeah   that would support it and the uh and of course you always wonder you know when you read it in the newspaper is it really all you know   right  is this true or what   did they just ignore half the team who cant stand this arrangements but the team members that were interviewed all seemed to be very supportive of it and uh   umhum  that is what a neat idea   and said that their that their management styles meshed real well   umhum   and   wow thats amazing   isnt that interesting very novel you know   yes that is very good i like that um its   you know you hear of women you know maybe like on flex time thing you know but youre talking file clerk i mean you know youre not talking   right yeah i know youre not     you know both with masters degrees yeah   isnt that interesting wow i would imagine that must be hard to to not bring your work home  though you know um they probably   umhum umhum our uh our dentists are husband and wife team work out of the same office   oh really oh   yeah and uh they have children   well thats thats good i mean if some couples want to do that i think thats great and uh you you just got to change your life around somehow when youre going to have kids no question about it   thats and yet its worth it   umhum   it truly is worth it you know there are some days when you wonder if it is but you know face it you know the   yeah   population is decreasing you know and somebodys going to have these little babies and   yeah umhum yeah now do you are your kids is are your older ones at an age where theyre taking care of the younger ones yet or oh they are   oh yes my uh my big ones are wonderful to help with my little one and uh   oh good   we are were to the point now where we only have one that has to be sat like you would say baby sitting or tending but i still believe that its very important that moms be in the home in the afternoon   umhum umhum   when those kids come home from school and stuff thats just   yeah yeah umhum   you know thats i think its just as critical for middle school and high schoolers as it is   umhum
