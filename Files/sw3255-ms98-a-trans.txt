        okay for as far as um i would think the probably the uh worst substance thats probably um or started to say the uh what causes the most air pollution is probably the car     probably so   and uh whether or not um theyll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed uh train  or or something like that or park   yeah itll be hard to get people to give up their mobility   yeah thats exactly it and thats what were finding um here where were at in Minneapolis area is that people dont want to carpool that there are   umhum   inconveniences to that or maybe you dont like the person you have to you would want to carpool with that kind of thing so its its kind of a thing where uh i think the majority of the people do not carpool   i think so too im in Texas and very few people carpool uh the people that i know dont want to because uh   umhum yeah   they never know for sure what time theyre going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon you know they just feel they need their car   exactly uhhuh or if somebody gets sick yeah or if somebody gets sick and its not the other person and they want to go home and that one persons got the car then theyre theyre stuck youre definitely right so   umhum umhum thats right and people dont want to give it up but now i think weve made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and   yes umhum sure  oops sure that happens quite a bit   to change the car itself but uh you know i i dont guess we can get away from it a hundred percent but yeah   yes yeah thats very true um other than that uh i dont know oh okay oh okay well try to be real quick here the other thing then is because i dont know how long they want us to talk it   well my other line is ringing but were going to ignore it  im sorry for these beeps oh a close to five minutes i believe and youre in Minneapolis well is the pollution really bad up there   five minutes oh okay Minneapolis area uh actually no we have uh quite a bit uh the only problem that we have and thats all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season you get more pollutants such as those but those are natural     umhum umhum yeah   um but there is starting to in Minneapolis itself because of so many people on the highway there is becoming a problem of pollution and they just put in a strict   umhum   law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if its releasing any uh lead   umhum umhum   into the air the air or other pollutants and if thats the case then you have to get your car fixed at least you cant   umhum thats the way it has gotten here we have just had that law i think about a year maybe a year and a half here in Texas   sure yeah   but uh i think its a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you cant blame them for that and uh but if they are polluting the air they need do need to have them fixed   yeah its not a bad idea umhum sure sure exactly   and you know theres a big move especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the CFCs that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air theyre having to change the type of products they use   umhum sure uhhuh   uh they cant use like i have a friend thats in the air conditioning heating business   uhhuh   and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of Freon that they use in the air conditioning systems systems   sure   therefore the individual every time they have a service call if they have an old unit thats still using this twenty two Freon or whatever it is it costs them three times as much to get it fixed   uhhuh sure   and uh if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of Freons that do not release as many CFCs into the atmosphere it doesnt cost as much   uhhuh yeah   so eventually people are gonna have to go to newer systems you know but   sure uh the other thing when youre talking about freon with cars uh air conditioning im sure over there its its a necessity versus something up here we can live without it but its uncomfortable   umhum right umhum   but uh this year my husband recharged our freon because it was needed to be done and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the uh   umhum hm   into the air because he opened it and i dont know if there was something wrong with it or it his directions werent quite fully instructed onto that and i was thinking how many other people   umhum its probably happened to millions of people umhum   oh sure because if you take it into a service station they want to charge you forty dollars just for uh freon which only costs you about three dollars so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price   umhum   because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say hey thats thats right there i think its like three or four dollars a a can   umhum yeah   and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car and i i thought about that and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because im sure he breathed it   inhaled so much of it umhum   but uh you think about that all the people that are using freon and things like that and   yeah well of course in the uh id think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places in the hair sprays were not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt you     uhhuh exactly pump yeah
