                                 Unlock Em Up            No oneat least no one inelite policywonk circlesis a bigger fan of incarcerating known adjudicatedadult and juvenile criminals than me No one has written more over the yearsabout the costeffectiveness of incarceration as measured both in terms of itscrimereduction value and in terms of doing justice Still when it comes tothe search for rational workable crime policies its time to admit that thebraindead lawandorder right is no better than the softintheheadantiincarceration left More and more conservatives now favor abolishingparole sharply curtailing probation imprisoning every adult felon for his orher entire term and warehousing juvenile offenders in adult jails The prudentresponse however is not to abolish probation and parole but to reinventthem            Firstlets get crystal clear on the grim facts about crime prisons probation andparole Be giddy about recent drops in national crime rates if you wish buteach year Americans still suffer some  million criminal victimizations abouta quarter of these are violent crimes Only about one in  crimes actuallyresults in anyone getting caught convicted and sentenced to prison Mostfelony defendants are repeat offenders yet most felony defendants aresentenced not to prison but to probation            Likewise a halfdozen recent studies prove beyond areasonable doubt what every veteran policeman knows Most prisoners arenot petty nonviolent thieves or mere firsttime lowlevel drugoffenders Yet most of these hardened criminals are still paroled well beforethey have served out their latest sentence behind bars On any given day inAmerica there are three convicted adult criminals out on probation or parolefor every one in prisonand many of these are indistinguishable in terms oftheir violent and repeat criminal histories from those who remain in prisonAs for juvenile offenders between  and  the number of adjudicatedjuvenile cases that resulted in probation rose by  percent The number ofprobation cases involving a person offensesuch as homicide rape robberyor assaultsoared by  percent            Literallydozens of careful studies document that probation and parole are to put itmildly failing to protect the public Nearly half of all state prisoners in had committed their latest crimes while out on probation or parole Whileformally under supervision in the community their violations included morethan  murders some  robberies and tens of thousands of othercrimes More than a quarter of all felons charged with gun crimes in  wereout on probation and parole Here too whats true for the revolvingdooradult system is even more true for the nofault juvenile system In manycities for example most cases involving violent older teen thugs who getreferred to adult court result in probation Kids plea bargain too            Why are the adult and juvenile probationsystems so poor and what realistically can be done to improvethemsoon            A big part of the answer isthat we spend next to nothing on the systems and get about what we pay forTake adult probation Joan R Petersilia former director of RANDscriminaljusticeresearch program has calculated that we currently spend about per year per probationer for supervision It is no wonder she notesthat recidivism rates are so high Likewise Patrick A Langan astatistician with the US Justice Department has found that more than percent of probationers are supposed to get substanceabuse counseling payvictim restitution or meet other requirements But about half do not complywith the terms of their probation Probation sanctions he concludes are notrigorously enforced            But howcould they be properly supervised by overworked underpaid probation officerswith scores of cases to manage As Petersilia argues even probationers who arecategorized as highrisk offenders receive little direct facetofaceoversight If probationers are growing in number and are increasingly moreserious offenders she advises then they are in need of more supervisionnot less But less is exactly what they have been getting over the pastdecade            Ditto for juvenile probation Over half of streetleveljuvenile probation officers earn less than  a year In big cities theprobation caseload of serious and violent juvenile cases has increased rapidlyIn a national survey probation officers admitted that their average urbancaseloads were at least  percent higher than they should be            Toreinvent probation we will need to reinvest in it More money more agentsand closer supervision are just the first phase Equally important is the typeof creative and critical thinking represented by Bostons probation chiefRonald P Corbett Among other innovations Corbett has teamed local probationofficers with local police officers Patrolling the streets together they havecut crime Corbett has also got probation officers to work with innercityclergy on a wide range of crime control and prevention initiatives            In Philadelphia the district attorneys officehas developed a nononsense program in which volunteers from the neighborhoodswhere the juveniles committed their crimes hear the cases set terms andmonitor compliance Run for the district attorneys office by veteran probationofficer Mike Cleary the citywide program boasts an  percent success ratecosts little to administer and holds kids including hundreds of juvenilefelony offenders accountable            The value of Phillysprogram observes former New Jersey Superior Court Judge Daniel R Coburn isthat it separates the minnows from the sharks then holds the minnowsaccountable and hence less likely to become sharks let alone become thepredatory Great Whites we must incarcerate He should know Coburn pioneeredtwo major and highly successful programs in New Jersey One is the statesEnforcement Court which goes after people who remain on probation because theyfailed to pay fines and restitution collects the money restores the trust ofcrime victims and brings literally millions of dollars into state coffers thatcan be used to beef up other justice programs The other is the Sheriffs LaborAssistance Program SLAP which puts lowlevel criminals to work for realcleaning up parks painting public buildings helping out in nursing homes andmore Fail to do exactly what youre required to do on SLAP Coburn declaresand you get slamas in see you in jail for sure            Admittedly parole is a tougher reinvention nut to crack In the late s Imyself had expressed hopes that intensivesupervision parole programs couldprotect the public and its purse But the best studies of intensivesupervisionprograms for highrisk parolees soon found that the programs cut neitherrecidivism nor costs So for the last several years I have argued in favor ofsome types of three strikes and youre out laws And I continue to stronglyfavor a noparole policy for some categories of violent and chroniccriminals            But the most interesting parolereinvention idea Iveencountered to date comes from Martin Horn formerly head of New York Statesparole authority and presently commissioner of prisons in Pennsylvania As Hornargues in most cases there is relatively little that parole agents can do tokeep an offender who is determined to commit new crimes from committing themThe flip side is that parolees who want to go straight often can make it ifthey are literate civil and can stay off drugs remain sober and get a jobBut parole agents often waste time chasing the bad guys rather than helping thegood And in many states the laws perversely limit a parole agentsdiscretion For example Ive heard many agents complain of having to revokethe parole of guys who failed a drug test but who were not in the agents bestjudgment doing anything more than getting high As one agent confided Aparolee of mine is OK and is looking for a job He pees in a bottle and comesup dirty and I have to send him back inside But a real predator I know isusing selling and almost certainly doing other crimes He stays on thestreets unless I catch him redhandedand I wont Its insane            Horns radical notion is toreinvent parole on the basis of a personal responsibility model A releasedprisoner would be given the equivalent of a parole services voucher For afixed period of timesay two yearshe can use the voucher to seek outeducation job training drug treatment or other services from stateselectedproviders If he wants to help himself he can If not hes on his own Do anew crime during this periodbite the hand that is offering you a way to helpyourselfand you do the time for the crime plus a year or two            Its time to get behindserious efforts to reinvent probation and parole and time to debate freshideas After all we are not going to put every convicted adult and juvenilefelon behind bars and keep him or her therenor should we
