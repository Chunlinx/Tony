                                 Up In Smoke            Everybody leads with the demise of the tobacco bill pulled off the Senatefloor by a Republicandominated vote There is some variety in the headlinesthough The Los Angeles Times  with its Senate GOP Kills TobaccoMeasure and the Washington Post  with its Senate GOP Kills McCain TobaccoBill point fingers and opt for the active voice USA Todaygoes passive with Tobacco Bill Dies in Senate And the New York Timesis somewhere in between with Senate Drops Tobacco Bill With  RevivalUnlikely Clinton Lashes out at GOP            The Clinton

the LAT s wordsa typically Democratic bigtax bigspending bill Newt Gingrich is quoted byeveryone as saying that House Republicans will take up and pass more narrowlyfocused legislation intended to reduce teen smoking but not increasetaxes            The WP sees this turn of events as a major defeat for PresidentClinton and public health advocates and a victory for the cigarette companiesbringing to an end an unprecedented yearlong effort to reduce smoking byyoung people and strictly regulate the tobacco industry All the papers notethe crucial role played in the defeat by the tobacco industrys  million adcampaign but its the NYT that makes the analogy with the way insurancecompany ads were used in  to defeat health care reform            Noting that the bill came out of

Senate floor in which he castigated his own party he received astanding ovation from Democrats in attendance and seated silence from membersof his own party This of course leaves the reader hungry for more informationabout why McCain bucked his own party to fight this fight but none of the newsstories obliges            All the front pages feature coverage of a bold and surprising moveundertaken yesterday by the US and Japan in concert the countries centralbanks bought as much as  billion in yen on the open market which sparkedfurther purchases of the Japanese currency by traders all of which

that the Clinton administration is rethinkinga  million mobile phone satellite deal between Chinaand Hughes Space and Communications that it initially greenlighted two yearsago Administration officials express to the paper their concern that theChinese general in charge of his countrys satellites has made statementssuggesting his countrys military may be planning to use the system to gatherinformation from mobile phones in use in China and neighboring countriesAnother discomfiting feature passed along by the Times is that thegenerals son was hired by Hughes to work on the project
