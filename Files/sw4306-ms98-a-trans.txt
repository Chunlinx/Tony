                so what do you think of the current jury system   oh i think basically it works okay the uh i do think that we need to have unanimous verdicts although that can certainly cause problems sometimes   yeah definite definitely you want the benefit of the doubt and as much on the defendants side as possible   yeah absolutely   make sure youre not getting into a police state or anything close to it   right absolutely the uh i think that when they have unanimous verdicts in some civil trials i think thats okay but uh im not sure if they said were supposed to just talk about civil or criminal or both   uh it just said trial by jury it didnt say either   okay well for civil i think a i think in a lot of cases in civil trials you can have a i think ten to two is acceptable   yeah i i think theres a lot more shades of gray that are possible and acceptable in civil trials than in criminal trials criminal trials are more of do the facts say that this happened or didnt it happened where in the civil trial theres a more wider range of you know whether this contract was satisfied fully satisfied partly satisfied or so on   right yeah theres a lot more variation there its not just did they do it or didnt they do it its   so i dont quite like the idea of the in civil trials in sounds like in a lot places the jury comes up with what the award amount should be i think you really want another party you know the the jury just say this is the things we think money should be awarded for and then either the judge or a three judge tribunal coming up with what the award amount should be   i agree and i agree that the jury in those kinds of civil trials can even apportion the liability if its a liability type of thing   yeah   that its forty percent this guy sixty the other or whatever but uh in civil trials juries have come up with some really ridiculous awards   right that get overturned or changed on the first appeal   right   where as if they came up with a more reasonable one the first time through maybe you wouldnt need to tie up the system with all these appeals   right i agree and i think that uh certainly were i in a paralyzed or something id want eighty three zillion dollars but uh i think rationally eighty three million dollars or something is probably acceptive because i think what id really want would be someone to you know the money to take care of me for the rest of my life   yeah well the the the   wish that i had proper care and medical treatment but giving me an extra million and millions of dollars that i couldnt do a damn thing with anyway   right   and uh wouldnt really help anybody except the lawyers whod get their cut of it their half   and i also think yeah on the same lines the uh punitive damage awards should really go more towards lets say the government and supporting the court system theres no reason an individual person should get the punitive damages i think thats more of   right   you know it its something that doesnt really you know the person is already being compensated for his losses and injuries   yeah   the punitive damages are more of a slap on the wrist of the person doing or the corporation doing the injury and having that go to the person who does the suing doesnt quite make sense   right also punitive damages in general i mean if theres if im hurt in a car accident and theres punitive damages of five million dollars against you id probably never collect it   right   and if its because your car was bad and its five million dollars against General Motors thats probably small change to them and its not really punitive against either one because General Motors five million is nothing and to you since its uncollectable it doesnt make much difference anyway   no i think five million dollars would definitely cut into the executive bonuses of GM   uh  i dont know its a good question i guess its off the topic were supposed to be discussing but   yes yes   the uh   and the other thing i guess that was in there was whether the you know the other thing i guess on the topic that id bring up is um the insanity defensives i dont never quite liked that temporary insanity   well i like what some states have including Colorado and Idaho the wording is something like on the insanity its instead of not guilty because youre insane so they send you to the mental hospital its guilty and insane something like   right
