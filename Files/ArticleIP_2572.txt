                                 Chairman Bills Big Blue Book            When President Clintonsbudget for fiscal year  came out on Feb  we were all engrossed inlaffaire Lewinsky and the spin the White House was putting onitrightwing conspiracy executive privilege Talmudic definitions ofadultery and so on Perhaps interest in that subject has now abatedsufficiently to allow us to turn our attention to the budget I propose here tocomment not on the policy it contains but on the rhetoric with which it ispresentedon the spin the Clinton administration puts on its policy            What ismost striking to a person who has been reading budgets for a long time is howfar the cult of presidential personality has progressed In the past the budgetI refer here to the main book titled Budget and not the other fivevolumes that come with it typically had two parts One was the budget messageof the president written in the first person and signed by the presidentReaders knew there was going to be a fair measure of boasting and selfservingin that section But most of the book consisted of chapters about the functionsof government with such prosaic titles as National Defense or AgricultureThese were written in the third person had lots of probably boring facts andone could learn a lot from them Of course they reflected the point of view ofthe administration but the reader didnt have the feeling that he wasconstantly being urged to buy the Brooklyn Bridge The president was scarcelymentioned            The budget still has the presidents message and a sectionorganized according to the functions of government But now inserted betweenthese two parts is a long sectionthis year its  pagesstill pretendingto explain the whole thing but explaining it as having sprung fullblown fromthe brow of the president The section has inspirational chapter heads such asPreparing the Nation for a New American Century and Creating a BrightAmerican Future            Eachchapter and subchapter in this section starts with a quotation from previousutterances of President Clinton set in italics and enclosed in a box Thesequotations are of a banality that is hard to believe For example we havethis                           Americans want the bestfor our children We want them to live out their dreams empowered with thetools they need to make the most of their lives and to build a future whereAmerica remains the worlds beacon of hope and freedom and opportunity To dothis we must all make improving the quality of education in America one of ourhighest priorities                        There isan irresistible reminder here of Chairman Maos little red book except Maosdicta were more pointed            In these  pages there are by my count uses of the word president I include nine cases of the word his used inclose proximity to and referring to the president And what is the presidentdoing on these occasions Of course he is working and proposing and havingvisions and making commitments But he is not only working he is in someinstances working hardto expand health care coverage and improve thenations health to improve education and the lives of working families toeliminate fraud in Medicare and Medicaid and to crack down on violent youthgangs            Thepresident also has initiatives            The BrownfieldsInitiative            The Water QualityInitiative            The Presidential Initiativeto Increase Seat Belt Use Nationwide            The Presidents Initiativeon Drugs Driving and Youth            The Presidents EducationTechnology Initiative            The Presidents AntiterrorismCounterterrorismSecurity Initiative            The Presidents AmericaReads Initiative            ThePresidents Initiative on Landmines            This istruly a president whose eye is on the sparrow            Depending on your mood this is either irritating orlaughable But I cannot believe that it is helpful to the president Theincredibility infects and pollutes everything else in the budget            Thesepages are filled to overflowing with the names of programs to be created orincreased Each of these has to have a name with Capital Letters and everycapital letter has to be part of an acronym My favorite is NEXTEA Anyone whoknows what that is should win money on Ben Steins quiz show Actually itstands for National Economic Crossroads Transportation Efficiency Act Themind reels reading about all these good things that are being done for us            What one would like to see is some listing ofprograms that are being reduced or not being introduced After all to governis to choose and to budget is especially to choose We cannot appreciate thereason for the things that are to be done unless we can compare them withthings that are not to be done Why do we have a Seat Belt Initiative and not aSmoke Detector Initiative Maybe there is a Smoke Detector Initiative and Imissed it True there are some cuts in expenditures and personnel They areall the result of what we used to call minimizing waste fraud and abuse andwhat is now called the Vice Presidents Reinventing Government Program Thereare no identifiable places where anyone is asked to give up anything            Wellthere are two exceptions to that The American people especially young peopleare asked to give up smokingbut to go on paying hefty taxes on cigarettes Byaccounting maneuvers not worth describing here this abstinence will enable thefederal government to increase spending on a variety of programs through aninstrument modestly called the Fund for America            The second exception is that we are to forgo using theprospective budget surplus for tax cuts or expenditure increases other thanthose proposed by the president until we have a solution to the longtermfinancing challenge facing Social Security It is here that we have thegreatest need for more explanation            Theformulation offered gives rise to the ridiculous table showing for yearsbeginning in  an excess of receipts over outlays exactly balanced by anitem called Reserve Pending Social Security Reform and a resultingsurplusdeficit that is exactly zero By that logic we had a zero deficit everyyear for the past  years except that the reserve was negative            Moreover the little word until contains anumber of ambiguities Some have interpreted it as meaning that the surpluswould be used to solve the financial problems of Social Security Thathas now been denied by the Office of Management and Budget Which leaves openthe question of the presidents intention for the use of the surplus after someother solution such as cutting Social Security benefits or raising payrolltaxes has been found Would we then be free to spend whatever surplus there isin the unified budget Or would we still want to apply some of that surplus toreducing the federal debt accumulated during the  years of deficits Could westart spending it even if the discovered solution for Social Securityslongrun problem didnt start to have a financial impact for another  yearsIn other words is the reserved surplus to be part of any longterm fiscalprogram or only a carrot to be used to induce a solution to Social Securityafter which the carrot can be eaten            I raise these questions notto disagree with what may be the presidents program but to illustrate theinadequacy of the budget as an explanation of it            When I told a friend of myproblems with the budget as an explanatory document he replied But yourethe only person who reads it That may be true But  copies wereprinted
