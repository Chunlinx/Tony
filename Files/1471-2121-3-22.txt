                    Background        A plethora of circumstantial evidence implicates        downregulation of the cyclindependent kinase CDK        inhibitor p in prostate cancer While greater than  of        terminally differentiated secretory cells in normal human        prostate display strong nuclear staining for p all cases        of highgrade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia invasive        carcinoma and pelvic lymph node metastases studied by        DeMarzo         et al showed downregulation of p            In addition low p expression correlates with        higher mean Gleason scores a number of prognostic        morphological features and decreased survival              Thus p may be a prostate tumor suppressor        In support of this notion the p protein has been        identified as a target of viral oncoproteins             However unlike traditional tumor suppressors the p gene        rarely shows homozygous inactivation in cancer cells              a finding that points towards alternative mechanisms        of p inactivation        p specifically inhibits CDKs which mediate entry into        S phase      The level of p is higher in quiescent        than in proliferating cells and this increase in p        abundance is required for an effective cell cycle exit            The cell cycledependent variations in p levels are        not reflected by similar changes in p mRNA     Many        aggressive prostate cancers display decreased p protein        levels in the presence of high p mRNA     suggesting        that p depletion may result from ectopic proteolysis In        fact p depletion in several cancers was shown to result        from increased proteolysis via the ubiquitinproteasome        system               This system employs a cascade of enzymatic reactions        that covalently attach a ubiquitin chain to substrate        proteins thereby targeting them to the proteasome            The ubiquitin transfer reaction involves three enzymes E        which mediates the ATPdependent activation of ubiquitin        and E or ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBC which        together with an E ubiquitin ligase transfers ubiquitin        to the target protein        Biochemical studies identified SCF SKP an E that        mediates p ubiquitylation         in vitro      This complex        consists of at least four proteins SKP CUL HRT        RBXROC and SKP SKP contains a socalled Fbox        which mediates binding to SKP and Cterminal leucinerich        repeats that recognize p CUL in turn binds to SKP        and together with HRT mediates the interaction with the        ubiquitinconjugating enzyme CDCUBC CKS a small        protein that associates with CDKs and greatly stimulates        p ubiquitylation was recently identified as a forth SCF        SKPcomponent             Two ratelimiting steps for p ubiquitylation were        defined  phosphorylation of p by CDK at threonine               and  binding of phosphorylated p        to SKP      SKP is downregulated in resting cells        with stable p but strongly upregulated in cells which        progress into S phase      In some tissue culture        cells overexpression of SKP is sufficient to induce p        degradation and S phase entry        and can        cooperate with         ras in transformation             Significantly overexpression of SKP has been observed in        many cancer cell lines     as well as in primary        cancer specimens and many of these tumors also display        downregulation of p               Here we used the androgensensitive human prostate        cancer cell line LNCaP    as a model system to address        the role of SKP in androgenmediated cell cycle control        This cell line undergoes reversible G arrest in response        to androgens         The G arrest is        accompanied by p upregulation       however the        pathway leading to p upregulation is unknown We show        that androgeninduced p upregulation is paralleled by p        stabilization and SKP downregulation SKP overexpression        is sufficient to overcome androgenmediated p        accumulation indicating that it is a major mediator of        androgenmediated cell cycle control                    Results                  Androgeninduced G arrest correlates with          inhibition of cyclin E kinase activity          Consistent with our previous studies the synthetic          androgen dimethylnortestosterone mibolerone          MIB inhibits the proliferation and suppresses the          transformed phenotype of LNCaP cells     and Fig          A No cytotoxic or apoptosisinducing activity was          associated with this growth inhibition      and          data not shown To determine whether MIB caused arrest          in a particular phase of the cell cycle MIB treated          cells were examined by flow cytometry MIB induced a          timedependent accumulation of cells in G at the expense          of both S and GM phases Fig B Consistent with G          arrest MIB induced inhibition of cyclin Eassociated H          kinase activity Fig C This inhibition correlated          with increased recovery of the CDK inhibitor p in          cyclin E immunocomplexes isolated from MIBtreated LNCaP          cells Fig D Similar finding were previously obtained          with the synthetic androgen R and the natural          androgen dihydrotestosterone DHT      The latter          study also showed that p is quantitatively bound to          cyclin E complexes in DHTtreated cells indicating that          p upregulation was sufficient to saturate and inhibit          cyclinECDK complexes                              MIBinduced cell cycle arrest and CDK inhibition          coincide with upregulation of p and downregulation of          SKP          Consistent with increased recovery of p in cyclin E          complexes MIB caused a concentration and timedependent          increase in steadystate p protein levels Fig AB          This increase was reversible as p levels were          gradually restored to near control levels after removal          of MIB and addition of a fold molar excess of the          antiandrogen cyproterone acetate CA Fig Cand D          Simultaneous administration of MIB and CA partially          prevented p accumulation indicating that it was          mediated by the androgen receptor AR Fig D          Since the level of SKP is a ratelimiting determinant          of p levels       we examined the effect of          MIB on SKP protein levels SKP levels were          downregulated nearly fourfold by MIB at concentrations          and with kinetics that closely paralleled p          accumulation Fig AB In addition downregulation of          RB and accumulation in the underphosphorylated form          paralleled SKP downregulation Fig A In contrast          only minor changes were detected in the expression of the          SKPassociated SCF SKPsubunits HRT CUL and SKP          Fig A MIBdependent SKP downregulation was          efficiently counteracted by CA Fig Cand D again          indicating an involvement of the AR Cyclin A but not          cyclin E levels were also suppressed by MIB in an          ARdependent manner while the levels of the          COPsignalosome subunit CSNJAB and tubulin remained          constant Fig D Finally consistent with SKP and p          being integral components of androgenmediated growth          control of LNCaP cells CA also efficiently reversed the          MIBinduced G cell cycle arrest Fig E          To confirm the effect of MIB on p and SKP at the          level of individual cells we performed          immunofluorescence staining In untreated controls most          cells displayed strong staining for SKP with few cells          positive for p Fig F The nuclear staining patterns          of SKP and p appeared mutually exclusive Fig F          In contrast the majority of MIBtreated cells showed          strong p expression while only few cells were positive          for SKP                          MIBinduced p upregulation correlates with          increased p protein stability and decreased          ubiquitylation          Northern blot analysis revealed that MIBinduced SKP          downregulation at the protein level is reflected by          quantitatively similar changes in steady state RNA levels          Fig A In contrast p mRNA levels were upregulated          by MIB only twofold Fig A This suggested that the          effect of MIB on p RNA levels can not fully account for          the accumulation of p protein compare Figs Band          A          We therefore determined the effect of MIB on p          halflife Protein synthesis was inhibited by          cycloheximide in control cells and in cells pretreated          with MIB for  h Cells were harvested after various          times and the effect on p protein levels was assessed          by immunoblotting Using this assay we determined a p          halflife of  h in control cells which was increased to          more than  h in MIB treated cells Fig B This          experiment likely overestimates p halflife in          untreated cells as SKP was itself downregulated by CHX          data not shown Nevertheless the data suggest that p          upregulation in response to MIB is partially mediated by          changes in protein stability          To confirm this conjecture we used an           in vitro assay to determine p          ubiquitylation activity in LNCaP cell lysate Similar to          previously described protocols       cell          lysates were prepared by hypotonic lysis of untreated          LNCaP cells or cells treated with MIB for  h          Ubiquitylation substrate was prepared by           in vitro transcription and          translation of p in the presence of Smethionine A          point mutant of p pTA in which the critical          CDK phosphorylation site in position  was replaced by          alanine    was also prepared Both substrates were          incubated with recombinant cyclin ECDK complexes in the          presence of ATP ubiquitin and LNCaP cell lysate          Conversion of p into polyubiquitylated high molecular          weight species was monitored by autoradiography of          Slabeled p following gel electrophoresis          Polyubiquitylation of wildtype but not mutant p was          observed in untreated LNCaP cell lysate Fig C This          activity was completely abolished in MIBtreated cells          Fig C suggesting that p accumulation results from          reduced p ubiquitylation                          Overexpression of SKP induces Fboxdependent p          ubiquitylation          Considering the inverse correlation between p and          SKP protein levels we asked whether ectopic SKP can          forge p downregulation in LNCaP cells To test this          we generated recombinant adenoviruses driving the          expression of SKP AdSKP or a mutant of SKP lacking          the Fbox AdSKPF Infection of asynchronous LNCaP          cells with SKP virus led to timedependent          downregulation of p Fig A          To determine whether SKP downregulation is a          necessary step in MIBinduced p upregulation LNCaP          cells were blocked with MIB for  h followed by          infection with AdSKP or AdSKPF for various periods          Immunoblotting revealed that SKP overexpression can          efficiently downregulate p levels in the continuous          presence of MIB Fig B In contrast overexpression of          Fbox deleted SKP did not result in a decline of p          Fig B          To determine whether SKP induces p ubiquitylation          cell lysate was prepared from MIBexposed cells infected          with AdSKP and AdSKPF and supplemented with          phosphorylated p ATP and ubiquitin SKP          overexpression for  or  h dramatically increased p          ubiquitylation activity present in these cell lysates          Fig C lane  and  This increase was not observed          with mutant pTA as substrate and upon overexpression          of SKPF Fig C lanes  and                           Overexpression of SKP is not sufficient to          overcome androgenmediated G arrest          To test whether SKPmediated p degradation is          sufficient to overcome the MIBinduced G cell cycle          arrest LNCaP cells were arrested with MIB for  h          followed by infection with SKP adenovirus Cells were          harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry after various          periods The mutant SKPF was used as a negative          control Although in three independent experiments the          fraction of cells in S phase was significantly p            higher in MIBarrested cells overexpressing SKP            than in SKPF overexpressing cells            at a time when p downregulation was          already apparent  h the majority of cells remained          tightly arrested in G over the entire  h course of the          experiment Fig A          This finding is in contrast to serum starved rat          fibroblasts and human U cells arrested in G by          overexpression of PTEN in which SKP overexpression can          drive S phase entry        In both cases          SKP overexpression leads to induction of cyclin A and          CDK kinase activity We therefore asked whether          SKPmediated p downregulation in MIB arrested LNCaP          cells was able to actually bring about CDK          activation          We first determined the effect of SKP overexpression          on MIBinduced RB downregulation and accumulation in the          dephosphorylated state see Fig A which is carried          out by CDK           in vivo     Immunoblotting          revealed that RB suppression in the hypophosphorylated          state was efficiently reversed by SKP overexpression for           or  h Fig B In addition cyclin A expression          was partially restored Fig B However both effects          were largely annihilated after  h of SKP          overexpression In contrast cyclin E levels while not          initially affected by MIB were decreased after  h of          SKP overexpression Fig B In contrast CDK and          tubulin levels remained stable at all time points of SKP          overexpression Fig B          A parallel experiment revealed that CDK kinase          activity assayed           in vitro using histone  as          substrate was suppressed by MIB but partially restored          by overexpression of SKP for  and  h Fig C left          panel This increase was paralleled by a decrease in the          amount of p associated with cyclin E Fig C right          panel While this decrease was maintained throughout the          course of the experiment CDK activation was attenuated          again at  h of SKP overexpression In summary SKP          overexpression caused transient upregulation of cyclin A          expression and CDK activity but was inefficient in          promoting S phase entry of MIBarrested LNCaP cells                            Discussion                  Androgen control of LNCaP cell proliferation          We have used the cell line LNCaP as a model to examine          the role of SKP in androgen control of p expression          and cell cycle progression in human prostate cancer          cells LNCaP cells exhibit a complex but characteristic          biphasic response to androgens  Stimulation of          proliferation at low androgen levels and  inhibition          of proliferation at higher levels such as those used in          this study     This dichotomy was compared    to          the situation in male rodents where castration leads to          atrophy of the prostate due to apoptosis          Readministration of androgen induces transient          epithelial cell proliferation presumably mediated by          proteolytic downregulation of p until precastration          cell numbers have been restored      No further          proliferation ensues beyond this point at which p          levels are increased again despite the continuous          presence of androgen This may reflect androgen activity          in restoring the glandular structure by promoting          postmitotic differentiation      Consistent with          this view androgen administration to intact rats          resulted in suppression of prostate epithelial cell          proliferation and maintenance of morphological gland          integrity     Based on these findings we propose          that the effects of high doses of androgens on SKP and          p in LNCaP cells described here reflect a          differentiation and consolidation effect           in vitro  If this is the case          LNCaP cells despite being highly aneuploid derivatives          of a metastatic lesion of an advanced cancer     may          have retained some aspects of the normal biphasic          mechanism of androgen control observed in castrated          rodents This mechanism may also be retained in other          prostate cancers thereby representing a potential target          for intervention                          Role of SKP in androgen control of p          stability          Our data indicate that SKP is an integral component          of androgen control in LNCaP cells as it is          downregulated in an ARmediated manner Fig Band C          In contrast all other known SCF SKPsubunits examined          were largely unresponsive to androgen Fig A          Importantly SKP overexpression is sufficient to reverse          androgenmediated p accumulation and induce p          ubiquitylation Fig Band D Based on the Fbox          dependency of these processes Fig C we conclude that          SKP directly triggers the ubiquitylation and degradation          of p in LNCaP cells a process which is attenuated by          androgenmediated SKP downregulation This          interpretation is consistent with SKP being a proximal          element in the previously identified androgenmediated          pathway of cell cycle inhibition in LNCaP cells As a          direct consequence of SKP downregulation p is          upregulated and cyclin A is downregulated This results          in inhibition of CDK activity accumulation of          hypophosphorylated RB inactivation of EF     and          cell cycle arrest          While it may surprise that SKP overexpression alone          is sufficient to mediate p degradation in LNCaP cells          given the known requirement for p phosphorylation              similar observations were made in rat fibroblasts          human U cells and primary rat hepatocytes                 In rat fibroblasts these findings correlate with          SKPinduced upregulation of cyclin A and CDK kinase          activity      which could further augment p          phosphorylation and degradation ultimately stimulating          cells to enter S phase          Unlike in rat fibroblasts and human U cells                SKP overexpression is not sufficient to override          androgeninduced G arrest in LNCaP cells despite a          profound effect on p levels Fig  Consistent with          this finding ectopic SKP expression was not sufficient          to maintain high cyclin A levels CDK activation and          RB phosphorylation for prolonged periods Fig Band          C The transient character of these responses may          explain the failure to cause efficient S phase entry in          the presence of MIB in particular as coexpression of          cyclins was previously shown to synergize with SKP in          stimulating CDK activity and S phase entry               In addition cyclin A is frequently overexpressed in          prostate cancers     In future experiments it will          be interesting to determine the effect of combined          overexpression of SKP and cyclin A and cyclin E on cell          cycle progression of MIBarrested cells          Regardless of the outcome of such experiments our          data firmly suggest that SKP is a central mediator of          the androgen response mechanism of LNCaP cells However          we do not believe that SKP is a direct transcriptional          target of the AR as the kinetics of its downregulation          were rather slow Fig A suggesting several          intermediate steps culminating in this event Such a          mediator could be AS a gene induced by growth          inhibiting levels of androgen with kinetics that precede          cell cycle arrest     In addition AS          overexpression mimics androgenmediated cell cycle arrest          in MCF cells stably expressing exogenous AR while          antisense AS confers resistance to androgeninduced          growth arrest     The function of AS is still          unknown but the encoded protein has features of a          potential transcription factor              While our study suggests that SKP is an important          player in p regulation in prostate cancer cells recent          studies have also implicated another protein CSNJAB          in p regulation      CSN is a subunit of the          COPsignalosome CSN complex        but also          forms distinct complexes apparently lacking CSN subunits                 Overexpression of CSN in NIHT cells          causes p export from the nucleus and ectopic          degradation     Notably like SKP                 CSN was found to be overexpressed in cancers devoid of          p     However our studies did not reveal any          effect of MIB on CSN expression Future studies aimed at          eliminating CSN activity will show whether it is          involved in androgenmediated p control          Finally a recent report demonstrated SKPindependent          proteolysis of p in lymphocytes derived from SKP          knockout mice     It is thus possible that p          proteolysis is subject to tissuespecific regulation In          prostate cells however SKP seems to be a major          determinant of p degradation as it is downregulated          by androgen and its overexpression is sufficient to          mediate p ubiquitylation and degradation Recent          studies involving androgen administration to castrated          rats have come to similar conclusions                                Conclusions        Our data suggest that androgenmediated SKP        downregulation is responsible for decreased ubiquitylation        and accumulation of p in LNCaP cells an effect that is        readily overcome by overexpression of SKP We propose that        frequent p downregulation in prostate cancer may be        caused by SKP overexpression thus enabling escape from        normal androgen control Finally our         in vitro studies validate the SKP        pathway as a potential target for therapeutic intervention        in cancers devoid of p                    Materials and methods                  Plasmids and reagents          Human SKP and p cDNAs were kindly

immunoblotting                          Tissue culture          LNCaPFGC cells were obtained from ATCC order number          CRL and maintained in RPMI supplemented with           FBS as described     We noticed that LNCaP cells at          low density grow best on  cm Falcon  tissue culture          dishes and that the effects of SKP overexpression were          most pronounced when cells were cultured on these dishes          data not shown                          Adenoviruses          For production of adenoviruses the ADEASY system was          used generously provided by B Vogelstein The complete          SKP cDNA or a mutant lacking the Fbox SKPF were          cloned into a modified pcDNA plasmid providing an          Nterminal Myc epitope tag and the human lamin B leader          sequence The lamin BSKP cassette was removed and          cloned into the pADTRACK shuttle vector The resulting          plasmid was transformed into BJADEASY cells by          electroporation Adenoviral DNA generated by          recombination in BJADEASY cells was isolated          Recombinant adenoviral DNA was transfected into  cells          using standard calcium phosphate procedures Virus was          harvested from cells and amplified by infection of           cells Amplified virus was purified by cesium chloride          gradient centrifugation and tittered An approximate
