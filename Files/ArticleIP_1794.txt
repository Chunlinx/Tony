                                 Maybe It Is About Sex            Todays news to chew onAccording to Newsweek  Kenneth Starrs impeachment report to Congresswill address only Flytrap It will ignore not only Travelgate Filegate andVince Foster topics he has spent years and millions studying but alsoWhitewater the scandal he was appointed to investigate lo these many yearsago Starr hasnt totally abandoned the Blist scandals He will still presentevidence from them to the three judge panel he reports to and that willcertainly lead to indictments against White House aides But the implication isthat the only impeachable offenses he is pursuing relate to Flytrap            I cant decide whether thisis surprising or unsurprising news Should reaction be gapemouthed shock or ablas shrug            In favor of gapemouthedshock There is something incredible in the idea that Starr could spend fouryears and  million and all he can come up with to nail Clinton is a sexscandal            In favorof a blas shrug Anyone who has tried to follow Starrs investigation has longknown that Whitewater Filegate etc are forests of confusion Even if therewere compelling evidence that President Clinton committed a high crime thescandals themselves are too incomprehensible to make any charge stick Oreven if theyre not incomprehensible the media have never succeeded inportraying them in a way that interests the American public Of course Starrdropped the Blisters Now he has distilled his case to the essence focusingon the only Clinton scandal that Americans understand and the only one wherehe might find a clear explicable high crime            There are two important ways Starrs Flytrap Only decisionmay disrupt the scandal In theory a Flytrap Only report should make it mucheasier for Clinton to mea culpa  An apology would clear thedecks Flytrap would disappear and the other investigations would not remainto threaten him Hed be humiliated but safe But although a Flytrap Onlyreport makes it easier for Clinton to mea culpa  it also makes it muchless likely The sad persistent fact about Clinton is that he tells only asmuch truth as he needs to The more you press him the more likely he is to behonest Anything that eases pressure makes him more likely to lie So if heknows that hes safe from Whitewater etc Clinton may be more inclined tobrazen out Flytrap After all he only has to beat one scandal not six            The other more frivolousconsequence of a Flytrap Only report will be to sow confusion among Clintonscritics The Blist scandals have always been fig leaves for Clintonsopponents They repeated the names of the scandals like a mantra WhitewaterTravelgate Filegate Foster Whitewater Travelgate Filegate Foster Nomatter what these scandals involved they served primarily to justify Flytrapa way to sanitize the sex scandal See its not just about sex Its abouta pattern of obstruction of justice and perjury dating back to his years asgovernor etc  But if Ken Starr Clintons most dogged persecutor saystheres no pattern what on earth will Clintons critics say That it reallyis just about sex I am looking forward to a week of creative newanswers                           KillingMonica                        How can you tell if Clintonis going to do a mea culpa  My guess Watch Monicas image            In the beginning MonicaLewinsky was you may recall a pathological liar who forged a letter ofrecommendation and said she never told the truth She was a shameless hussy whoseduced teachers took pride in her presidential kneepads and bragged abouther large breasts a creepy beretwearing stalker who tracked the presidentfrom event to event in search of a hug            But forthe past month and especially last week there has been a kinder gentlerMonica an innocent trapped in a scandal not of her own making The new Monicasounded sweetly sympathetic She told a friend it breaks my heart to testifyand said all she wanted for her  th birthday was my life back AWashington Post piece bathed her in golden light She hopes to go tograduate school in sociology shes scrimping because she doesnt want toburden her parents financially she is so much a hostage to the media that shecouldnt attend her own moms wedding andthe icing on the cakeshe hastaken up knitting The coverage of her day in court was uniformly kind rarelymentioning that she has lied before and changed her story now            Why the strange new respect First the Golden Rule ofConventional Wisdom which is that it must change Troubled Monica is an oldstory Reporters needed a new angle for this round of Flytrap Result KnittingMonica Lewinsky is reaping the reward for having dumped William Ginsburg Hiswild selfaggrandizing public statements made both of them a laughingstockand the Vanity Fair photo shoot he arranged sullied Lewinskys imagealmost as much as a Penthouse spread would have She is also enjoyingthe imprimatur of the law Whenever someone testifies gravitas follows Themere fact of giving sworn testimony to a court imbues a witness withcredibility and weight She is participating in the measured and solemnbusiness of justice            But the No  reason whyMonica has seemed like a sweetheart is that the White House has been silent AsMonicas image goes so goes the president If Clinton were going to apologizeLewinskys new image would be safe It would do no good for the White House tosavage her if the president is going to admit an affair            But the White House campaignagainst Monica is beginning and thats the best indicator so far that Clintonis not going to apologize For him to survive a denial Monica must be ruinedHaving showered Monica with security clearances and Pentagon jobs and gifts andWhite House visits its a little hard for Clinton to make the claim that shesa nut cake but the effort will be made A National Enquirer storyprobably based on a White House leak quotes Clinton saying that Monica isdangerous and that she hallucinates According to Newsweek  Clintonattorney David Kendall is gathering dirt about Lewinskys mendacity andpresidential obsession White House officials are tallying and comparing allthe different stories Lewinsky has told about Clinton to Tripp to friends inher affidavit to Vernon Jordan etc and are gleefully looking forward toexposing the inconsistencies If Monica must be killed to save the presidentshe will be killed metaphorically speaking of course            More Flytrap
