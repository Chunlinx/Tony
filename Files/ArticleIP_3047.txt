                                 Without Malice            Cynthia Gorneys new historyof the conflict over abortion could serve as an advertisement for an imperiledform of journalism the long meticulously researched narrative of ideas inwhich unglamorous noncelebrities drive the action If that sounds offputtinglyworthy even to devotees of serious nonfiction then too bad for us Some of thebest journalism of the last quartercentury or so belongs to the samegenreJane Kramers and John McPhees and William Finnegans work for TheNew Yorker and nearly all the late Anthony Lukas writing It is gettingharder to do for the very reasons it is worth doing It can require years ofreporting which doesnt sit well with the keepers of our buzzdrivenpublishing culture It demands of its practitioners a quality oflisteningeven alert selfeffacingthat seems increasingly rare in thisfirstperson age It doesnt sell a whole lot of ad space            None ofthis is to say that narrative nonfiction is some sort of selfless or inherentlydemocratic form Its not oral history the author is there on every page asenticed by vanity as any journalist ismaybe more so because his is the kindof journalism that aspires most nakedly to the status of literature But atleast these writers confer a kind of dignity on their subjects if only byattending so closely to peoples own explanations of what they believe Andwhen it comes to showing us the means by which everyday people are taken up byhistory how they shape it and are in turn shaped by it there is no genre moreaccommodating            In this tradition and with scrupulous fairness Articlesof Faith brings to life the arguments and experiences of sympatheticcharacters on opposite sides of a great moral divide Gorneys setting isMissouri which as a microcosm for the history of abortion and the oppositionto it over the last three decades is an arbitrary choice she seems to havechosen it mainly because her editors at the Washington Post sent herthere in the late s In the end though the conceit workspartly becauseSt Louis was the site of the first sitins at abortion clinics partly becauseit was a Missouri law restricting access to abortion that inspired one of theSupreme Courts most important post Roe cases William L Webster vsReproductive Health Services  partly because we are primed to think ofalmost any Midwestern state as typical in a way that New York or Californiais not and mostly because Gorney found two such fundamentally appealingcharacters there            On oneside is Judith Widdicombe an obstetrical nurse who volunteers at a suicidehotline and cant help noticing how many of the women calling in arepregnantand desperate about it This is the late s abortion is illegaland dangerous and at the hospitals where Widdicombe works she has seen womenbleeding and bluewhite with shock in the aftermath of botchedabortionsterrified women dying women And so Widdicombe a big smartopinionated woman with two young sons a sweet shy husband who runs anewspaper delivery route and a modest little pea green house in a niceneighborhood begins systematically to break the law It is Widdicombe whoeventually runs the abortion underground in pre Roe Missouri tellingwomen where they can find somebody relatively clean and relatively safe toterminate their pregnancies and sometimes smuggling them into her own sparebedroom afterward to suffer the aftereffects of the operations inclenchedteeth pain And it is Widdicombe who in the wake of Roe vsWade  opens the first abortion clinic in the state the Reproductive HealthServices of Webster fame This was womens business is how Gorneydescribes Widdicombes thinking about what she does And if you were a nursewho took care of womenfor that was how Judy thought of her work in labor anddelivery the care of womenyou did what they needed you to do you helpedthem have the baby or not have the baby they came to you in crisis and youeased them to the next place Either way it was a kind of delivery            On the other side is Samuel Lee a wouldbeseminarian with a ragged beard and the look of an Old Testament prophet or aRussian monk Lee is a pacifist and an intellectually serious one In inspired by the civilrights movement and his reading of Gandhi Lee dreams upand then organizes the first sitins at an abortion clinic and so helps tosteer the antiabortion movement from its polite letterwriting phase to itsangry streettheater phase Lee is convinced that no one has proposed a morelogical time for the moment of an individual persons beginning than thejoining of egg and sperm for the simple reason that there is no more logicaltime He compares his moral duty to rail against abortion to his moral duty tointervene if he saw a man on the street beating his child with a club He is apurist but not a fanatic            Onevirtue of having chosen these particular charactersa gruff empathetic nurseinstead of a polished prochoice lobbyist a thoughtful vaguely leftishCatholic as opposed to a firebreathing evangelicis that we can live withthem for  pages or so But implicitly the choice serves a more didacticpurpose as well Articles of Faith makes it abundantly clear that eventhe most decent people both sides have to offerpeople such as Widdicombe andLee who will occasionally talk to each other instead of merely hurlingepithetscan find no real common ground on abortion Whatever compromiseAmericans come to on abortion wont be the product of a warm and fuzzy dialoguebetween prochoice and prolife activists It is more likely to emerge out ofwhat polls show most nonactivists on the issue believe namely that abortionshould be as the slogan goes safe legal and rare Call it muddled or callit nuanced but most Americans seem to want to preserve the right to abortionpretty much unrestricted in the first three months and to allow states tolimit it sharply thereafter They want abortion to be legal but they think toomany people seek it out for the wrong reasons As Gorney notes thewellmeaning organization known as Common Ground Network for Life and Choice anational project that brings prochoice and prolife activists together indiscussion circles and makes mediators available to help resolve theirdifferences has succeeded mainly in inflaming partisans on both sides whileproducing extremely modest tangible results            The other advantage of this sort of textured narrative isthat it inevitably turns up bits of the past that more ideological accountsleave out Gorney gives us a fascinating glimpse for example of theinvolvement of the clergy in helping women obtain illegal abortions in the lates Widdicombe herself worked for something called the Clergy ReferralService a network of some  Protestant ministers across the country whodecided it was their pastoral duty to shepherd unhappily pregnant women tounderground doctors willing to perform abortions They took their lead fromthe Rev Howard Moody a liberal and outspoken Baptist who occupied the pulpitat Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village This is the kind of historythat prolifers dont care to discuss because it suggests the existence of amoral as well as a political dimension to abortion rights The idea that somemen of God might regard their commitment to a woman housing a fetus as moreimportant than their commitment to the fetus itself is anathema to people likeLee And prochoicers are likely to ignore the abortionabetting ministersbecause their own history of the movement puts feminist activists more or lessalone on center stage            There are drawbacks to anyjournalistic genre that requires the writer to stick to one or two main storylines Gorney introduces us to hundreds of other activists but it isWiddicombe and Lee who propel the narrative Since Widdicombe is apparently somuch less given to moral casuistry than Lee Gorney sometimes risks leaving uswith a vague impression of abortionrights activists as tough pragmatists at aloss for loftier arguments and antiabortion activists as philosophers with acommon touch Lee whose dedication to both nonviolence and Catholicism soonmarginalized him in a movement that had become increasingly dominated bymilitants and evangelical Christians is perhaps even less representative thanWiddicombe For a thorough account of the antiabortion movements turn to theright and the new militancy of organizations such as Operation Rescue readerscan refer to the recently published Wrath of Angels The American AbortionWar  by journalists James Risen and Judy Thomas Moreover Gorney ends herbook in  with the Supreme Court ruling in Webster  This is hard tojustify since the decision marked neither the culmination of the courtsthinking on abortion the Casey ruling in  was at least asinfluential nor an obvious turning point in the abortion wars It caps herstory simply because it caps Widdicombes battle with Lee            Gorney will probably bepraised for having drawn unusually nuanced portraits of abortion activists onboth sideshumanizing them and in so doing narrowing the gap between them Buther real accomplishment is something like the opposite The morecompassionately and conscientiously she reconstructs Lees views andWiddicombes views the more irresolvable their differences seem It may bethat only this sort of journalism with its sympathetic attention to theintricacies of its characters thoughts could do justice to thesedifferences
