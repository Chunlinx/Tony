        feel about um the Russian situation right now     well i am more uh more scared than than ever actually by it because it to me if you look at the uh situation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe it closely parallels the situation around the turn of the century with the fall of the Ottoman empire   umhum um it is very unstable right now   yeah and theres a the huge power vacuum and no one to control the local economies over there the inner uh trade between those republics and the satellites uh or what used to be the satellites of the Soviet Union and im afraid that its just going to  gonna have regional   right   infighting just like there was before World War One and were going to be stuck in another war   yeah im its really scary because i you know i i had a conversation or i heard it over a conversation that they had with Gorbachev on the news   uhhuh   stating that he needs to get you know like a United States set up over there because theyre not gonna make the winter without the food and the electricity   right   and if they dont if if people dont have food and electricity theyre gonna go after it somehow and theyre and theyre gonna fight it out instead of doing it calmly like hes trying to have done now   sure right   um i went over to the Soviet Union uh about three years ago   oh really   and it was very sad  they it the economy over there is very poor um   yeah and its worse now   oh yeah and when we went over there we were not allowed you know off this bus or you know into the you know onto the streets or anything like that well when i went i did anyway and i got out  and um   umhum     um you know yeah i know it we barely got back but um   rebel you   we went into the black market where kids our age were you know im twenty three   uhhuh yeah   and we went down there and these kids wanted anything that was made that was American Lee jeans your coats your shoes anything that you brought with you and theyd give you things   uhhuh   because they wanted these clothes and they looked just like we did because they would ask for these clothes and stuff so after you came out it was very sad people were in the real drab clothing and whenever you bought something youd have to go through four or five lines to get it   right   and it was you know really sad to see that but um yeah it its something else over there everythings breaking down when we the motel we stayed in you know you could only stay in American hotels   sure   and uh um the we didnt have water for four days and when we did get it it looked like apple juice it was awful and and you know to see how they live over there   oh God  hey wait a minute the water comes out here it it looks like that too   right  and it was just real sad to see it that way but um you know like our tour guide was a sixteen year old girl um she was married and living with her parents and you know they live in the apartment buildings around there   uhhuh jeez   and because she got the job because she could speak English   uhhuh   so she got to be a tour guide and it was really bizarre because um she couldnt shave her legs or anything and they couldnt get razors and so um she asked for us to go into the American shop and buy her razors so that she could do that and it was just something else to see   the wonders of Western culture get to shave your legs   yeah you know yeah and and well you know and you know everywhere i went over there it was it was like that but she wanted to do that and and so did every you know all the kids that were our age were you know wanting to be more like that and so its really scary because theres gonna be something somethings gonna have to happen   uhhuh so you did this one year in college whered you go to school   yeah yeah i did um Northern State in Aberdeen South Dakota   South Dakota no im an officer in the Air Force at uh Griffis Air Force Base   yeah oh okay   yeah so im im just a lieutenant im only twenty four so im its interesting hearing from someone   okay   of my perspective i always think that my view is always so much older and uh more conservative but uh   uhhuh uhhuh   i dont know ive maybe done older spent a little more time learning from history than the average armchair uh   uhhuh right  listening to the TV type of thing umhum   yeah yeah and everybodys jumping up and down praising all this and you you know it great   they dont understand whats gonna happen   yeah you know theres i think theres only one thing thats worse than the Communist government and thats no government   thats right and on right now theyre bordering on that because theres nothing there   yeah there there really are   you know youve got two leaders one thinks hes doing it and one  Gorbachev thinks hes you know got it and you know Yeltsins got half and  and the KGB is supposedly gone but um   well i dont think uh uh i dont think you can rule out anything like that   no you cant you cant theyre to they were too powerful for too long   and especially when when it gets to the point where things are really desperate then uh then the military becomes a threat as well   right   and uh   right   you know there the military still has a lot of power   umhum   and somebody has to control all those nuclear weapons its not even  the the situation isnt even is so much
