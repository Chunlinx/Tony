                                 The AttorneyClient Privilege            Last week a federal appealscourt ruled that White House lawyers must hand over notes of theirconversations with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to Whitewater IndependentCounsel Kenneth Starr The White House lawyers assert these conversations wereconfidential protected by the attorneyclient privilege They will take theirclaim to the Supreme Court What is the attorneyclient privilege Is the WhiteHouse in the right            Likeconversations between doctor and patient or priest and penitentconfidential communications between a client and his lawyer are legallyprotected  A client can refuse to disclose the substance of thosecommunications and only in rare exceptions will the lawyer be forced todivulge the information in question The communication should however always have been confidential and  relate to legal advice a client cannotdeliver documents to a lawyer simply to elude a legal obligation to turn themover An attorneys work producthis memoranda interview notes and othertrial preparationsare similarly protected Federal and state statutes codifythis privilege Lawyers who betray it risk disbarment and can be sued formalpractice            According to legal historians a version of theattorneyclient privilege first appeared in Roman courts It was revived by theEnglish in the  th century and then absorbed into American commonlaw The rationale is that it is in societys interest for people to seekadvice from lawyers in order to make sense of complicated regulations andlaws Clients will only receive useful advice if they speak candidly with theirlawyers without having to fear that their conversations could later incriminatethem            The scope of theattorneyclient privilege remains broad Courts in the last  years haveextended the privilege to corporations and even affirmed itsapplicability to dead clients             There are exceptions            Clients can waive theprivilege            It does not apply when legaladvice is used to plan crimes Conversations between a Mafia boss and hislawyer arranging the murder of a disloyal underboss for instance are notprotected But the distinction is not always so clear There is a fine linebetween abetting a clients fraudulent testimony which is not protected andplanning a legitimate defense            When alawyer becomes a defendant the privilege evaporates This applies tomalpractice suits filed against lawyers and in cases where the lawyer isimplicated in a clients crime this was the exemption under which White Housecounsel John Dean testified against Richard Nixon            The notes the Clinton White House wants toprotect were taken by two White House lawyers at meetings on July   andJan   also attended by Hillary Clinton and her private attorney DavidKendall The first meeting concerned the first ladys activities immediatelyfollowing associate White House counsel Vincent Fosters suicide  thesecond had to do with her testimony before a grand jury investigating thebilling records from her Arkansas law firm  The records had been missingfor two years before inexplicably reappearing in the first familys privatequarters            Thesenotes were subpoenaed by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr on June  In response White House lawyers immediately invoked the attorneyclientprivilege a claim upheld by a trial court            Last week however a federal appeals court in St Louisreversed the trial courts decision  It held that the lawyerclientprivilege does not protect conversations between government officials andgovernment lawyers during the course of a federal prosecutors investigationGovernment lawyers are obliged to enforce laws not to protect an official Ifan official desires a confidential discussion about a potentially criminal acthe should hire a private attorney            WhiteHouse counsel argues that  Courts have consistently recognized that theattorneyclient privilege applies to conversations between governmentofficials and government lawyers   Even Starr concedes that HillaryClinton should be treated as a government official  The appeals courtsdecision has nasty ramifications for the entire government From now onofficials will be reluctant to discuss tricky legal issues with governmentattorneys fearing that their conversations will come back to haunt them andwill instead secure private counsel             The White House need not turn over anydocuments until the Supreme Court adjudicates the case The ruling which isexpected in June will turn on the courts interpretation of the White Housecounsels mandate  No legal precedent presages the decision Some expertson the attorneyclient privilege predict that the Supreme Court will uphold itwhere the White House has an official interest the meeting related to theFoster suicide and reject it in private matters the billing records            White House officials saytheir rigorous assertion of the attorneyclient privilege is driven by a desireto prevent future incursions on the privacy of conversations between the firstfamily and its lawyers They say it does not amount to an admission that thenotes contain damning content
