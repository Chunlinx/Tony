                okay i guess theyre   okay so uh you go first yeah   okay um    i guess i um havent really thought about it for a while i guess um the uh job part of the one i have now there is a requirement that kind of came in after the fact that does since they have contracts one of their uh companies they contract with required it and uh you know by then it was it was kind of uh um you know they didnt explain up front that that might be a requirement but it sounded like it was kind of sprung on them by the uh firms they had contracts with   uhhuh   uh but its its not something i       think is appropriate i guess there might be exceptions you know if if youre in a critical position like youre a traffic controller or something like that   umhum   but um it should it it seems like uh i guess the employer uh is just i think a massing too much information theres its just an intrusion into uh kind of your personal life   right yeah that that thats how i feel i feel the um the employee um the employer has concern about you know whats going on in my body to the degree that it affects how i am doing my job and   uhhuh   um there are lots of factors that affect how i do my job i i dont personally take any drugs but you know thats one factor that could affect something an employees performance   right uhhuh   there are plenty of other factors like i know for me how much sleep i got you know what i ate for breakfast those things have a lot big impact on how i perform during the day   yeah   and unless theyre they want to get involved in all these other areas also you know like maybe providing healthy meals healthy breakfast for employees or something like that you know i mean i i   uhhuh   uh thats you know thats one step and it what it is what theyre getting into is the drug testing is a real quick and easy way and politically um feasible way of going about this because you know everybody is going to be against drugs you know well just about everybody is against drug use so lets test everybody for it   um   but the thing is its not its not my companys business what i do on the weekends or in in the evenings you know if i show up for work hungover   right   then theyve got something to say you know so hungover to the extent that im not able to do my job well   right yeah i know think most impairments would be obvious fairly obvious you know but   yeah yeah but on the other hand if i go out and have fifteen thousand beers but then im fine the next morning its none of their business   right   you know what i do with myself or if if i smoke fifteen joints or something and i hit or whatever um   umhum   and thats how i feel about it uh things drug testing for uh marijuana i guess can detect use uh or actually they can do tests with um with hair samples of hair and finger nails   uh   that can test or detect use like months and months and months previous   wow   you know and so its obviously that theres not you couldve decided okay im going to stop now and may have stopped for three months and still it would show up in these tests and thats completely unfair   yeah   um also especially its unfair when the companies dont offer some sort of treatment program also it you know its like oh we find you with drugs so huh youre gone   yeah   get out of here um luckily my company is doesnt uh do any of that sort of thing they they were talking about doing the policy of testing new people new employees as they come in but not anything it it wouldnt be random it would be everybody um   umhum   and it wouldnt be current employees it would only be new employees um but i you know i   yeah  seems like its a sneaky way to introduce it because eventually you know then everybody would   yeah yeah   done it and they they   right yeah it itll be   you know the climate would be different then   yeah and i i you know i dont think the companies have any cause to do that sort of thing unless theres you know reasonable suspicion you know if you come in obvious glassy eyed everyday from lunch or something its okay somebodys been smoking some pot here   uhhuh   then do a drug test if you have some reasonable suspicion but its   right   you know there there theres so many things i mean if if i were going through a divorce for instance which is something a lot of people experience that would really negatively affect my performance   yeah   you know are they going to require that i stay married or that i require me to some how have a perfect marriage or something well then you know that doesnt make sense   uhhuh yeah   so its   yeah it just seems like its a intrusion i mean the the only angle they might have is if um   yeah   i guess if theyre paying the insurance premium or something like that then it you know   uhhuh uhhuh   it might be that they the carrier the carrier theyre using has a has higher rates or something like that so theres theres probably an economic argument   right well in in in in that case charge the employees extra
