              Dear Friend      Thank you for your interest in futures for Children whose mission is      to improve the wellbeing of children by helping people help      themselves One of the ways we achieve this mission is through our      Friendship Program for American Indian children      Enclosed is information that describes this program as well as our      community education initiatives in over  American Indian Nation We      invite you to participate in Futures for Children by sponsoring an      American Indian child or by joining a Membership Circle to support our      community education projects      Futures for Children was founded over  years ago to provide unique      solutions for positive and sustainable social change by placing children      at the center of community decisionmaking and action For example      The people of Batavia on the Hopi Reservation in northern Arizona were      motivated by their desire to rekindle traditional cultural values among      younger generations when with the help of Futures for Children they      decided to restore traditional terrace gardens at the edge of their      village gardens that had been abandoned for decades During the      reconstruction project elders took advantage of the opportunity not only      to teach Hopi language and culture to their children but also to restore      a sense of balance and spiritual integrity to their community Now as      children tend their gardens they have a new appreciation of their      relationship to the land their cultural heritage and their      community      In  reservation communities in the Southwest over  American      Indian children participate in Futures Friendship Program building      crosscultural ties with adult mentors from around the nation and      Europe By means of supportive relationships developed through letters      phone calls and visits children are encouraged by their sponsors to      stay in school to be involved in their communities and to learn about      the world beyond their reservations the relationship formed between a      child and a sponsor often lasts a lifetime      Futures for Children relies on the generosity of individuals like you      by board policy we do not accept government or United Way funds      Furthermore approximately  of our total income is expended directly      on program activities Because of this and other factors Futures has      earned an A rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy as well      as the highest rating of the National Charities Information Bureau      NCIB      We appreciate your taking time to read about Futures for Children I      hope you are inspired to become a Sponsor andor a Member Our staff      would enjoy sharing additional information about our work and answering      any questions you may have Please call us any time at            Sincerely      Jim West President and Chief Executive Officer
