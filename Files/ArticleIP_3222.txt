                                 The Schumacher Hypothesis            I staggered out of a showingof Batman  Robin into Times Square The world looked evil and sadThe sun was sinking out of sight at the end of  rd Street wheresigns no longer read  rd Street but instead  rdStreet Adolph S Ochs Street in tonguetwisting homage to the patriarch ofthe New York Times  Five or six neonstriped

bloweverything up again I went into McDonalds hoping to find solace in an orderof SuperSize Fries They were stale Where can you go these days for decenttrash            When Isay that Batman  Robin is a punishing ordeal I want you to knowwhere Im coming from I have an appetite for Hollywood blockbusters of thesort that some literate people consider big and dumb I thought the firstWarner Bros Batman  Tim Burtons pulp opera had genius in it Itinvented a huge movie world in which the eyes could go dreaming It also hadthe wit to set a menacing hero against a merrymaking villainthe line betweengood and evil grew scribbly The last Batman  Joel SchumachersBatman Forever  was nowhere near as cool but it was clean campy funfrom beginning to end and it rode high on a maliciously daft Jim Carreyperformance I was also lucky to see Batman Forever in more pleasantsurroundings than the New Times Squarein a highmodern movie palace inHelsinki with an audience of hip Finns who giggled at subtitles that seemed togo their own way from the script At one point the Finnish text made somekind of joke about Chevy Chase No one was saying Chevy Chase onscreen orpossibly could have been            Now Schumacher is not a talentless filmmaker Indeed asophistical argument could be made that his films while meretricious arealways at least mildly entertaining If your next dinner party threatens

and twentysomething dreamboatMatthew McConaughey            But thisSchumacher is a pompous idiot your dinner guests sputter He once said onThe                Charlie Rose                Show that he made commercial pictureslike Batman so he could afford idea pictures like A Time toKill  All too true But lets at least admit his flair for trash At hisbest he offers an empty but internally consistent flamboyance He is skilled atevoking places Falling Down captured with precision what Los Angeleslooks like on a vicious summer day He is also good with faces particularlymale faces This is not to make assumptions about the mans sexualityhe mightjust happen to be as gifted a director of slowwitted male models as sayGeorge Cukor was of fastwitted female actors I enjoy this aspect ofSchumachers work although I wonder in the case of A Time to Kill whether he worried about McConaugheys inability to enunciate or to assumedifferent facial expressions The acting is not always an embarrassment inFalling Down  the one Schumacher film that threatened to be decentMichael Douglas delivered one of the creepiest slow burns of the decade            Batman  Robin quashes the SchumacherHypothesis for the time being I will have to return to my old contrarianstandby the Unsung Greatness of Oliver Stone It has none of the minorvirtues of Schumachers other films It looks bad cluttered surfacesproduction design reminiscent of overblown Broadway musicals editing too fastfor the eye to catch up poor staging of fast action The first few minutes areparticularly tryingdirection seems to have been handed over to a fractiouscommittee of prepubescent speed freaks And while this kind of movie doesntcry out for a coherent plot it does need surprises Most of Batman Robin s clichs were parodied in advance by Austin Powers  WhenCommissioner Gordon shows up on a TV monitor warning that Mr Freeze has takenover Gotham Museum Austin fans will think fondly of the

casenot even his big frame adds much to a waddlingicicle role            One of the movies few redeeming features is partiallywiped out by one of its worst excesses Elliot Goldenthal the best filmcomposer now working has written typically imaginative music rich in jaggedharmony and deft scoring That eerie wailing at the end of the title theme is ateam of trilling horns Schumachers regard for this composerhe used him alsoin A Time to Kill is one sign of latent tastefulness In movies likeInterview With the Vampire and Heat  Goldenthal returned theobsolescent Hollywood orchestra to some of its old glory But in the newBatman  the score was apparently deemed insufficient Its repeatedlyblotted out by the sound effects that erupt in tandem with every move or twitchonscreen One whip of a
