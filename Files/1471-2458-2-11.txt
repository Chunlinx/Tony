                    Background        Class B biosolids the most common form of processed        sewage sludges used in agriculture are treated to reduce        levels of pathogens by various processes including        anaerobic digestion and pH elevation lime stabilisation        The finished product may contain a wide variety of        contaminants with a potential for adverse health effects            This includes enteric bacteria viruses endotoxins        inorganic and organic sulfides volatile fatty acids alkyl        amines and ammonia      No formal pathogens risk        assessment has been carried out for public exposure to        Class B biosolids     and complaints of sludgerelated        illnesses reported by residents have not been previously        studied        Retrospective studies have been done on workers exposed        to sewage sludges who have reported illnesses Gregersen et        al     for example investigated five workers who        experienced fever and flulike symptoms after repairing a        decanter used for concentrating sludge at a sewage        treatment plant High concentrations of         Legionella pneumophila serogroup         found in the sludge along with positive antibody titers in        all five workers indicated that they developed Pontiac        fever from contact with sludge Similarly NIOSH        investigated five workers complaining of headaches stomach        cramps and diarrhoea at a sludge processing operation            Investigators isolated a variety of enteric        opportunistic pathogens from bulk sludge samples and        airborne particulates including species of the genera         Mycobacterium          Pseudomonas  and         Staphylococcus  Based on the nature        and timing of their symptoms investigators concluded that        ingestion or inhalation of pathogens in sewage sludge        probably caused the illnesses        Dorn et al on the other hand found no elevated risks        of infection in the only epidemiological study done with        residents exposed to sewage sludges     The authors of        this prospective study however did not determine whether        any pathogens were present in the material Also because        of the low application rates used in the study they        cautioned against extrapolating their data to other        sites        Our retrospective investigation was designed to use a        survey for describing adverse effects reported by        residents develop an approach for assessing their        environmental exposures and evaluate whether any        infections associated with exposure to sewage sludges were        prevalent within the group                    Methods                  Surveying residents          To indicate the general symptomatology we surveyed           affected residents at ten land application sites in          Alabama California Florida New Hampshire Ohio          Ontario Pennsylvania and Texas Table           Questionnaires were patterned after a previous          epidemiological study in Ohio and based on symptoms          associated with exposure to sewage sludges      More          specifically residents were queried about their symptoms          and how much time elapsed between exposures and onset          Individuals who were previously questioned by          environmental activists were excluded from the survey and          medical records were obtained in cases involving death or          serious illnesses those requiring medical          attention          Using chisquared analyses proportions of individuals          reporting a particular symptom at each site were compared          with the combined reports for that symptom at all sites           P indicated how consistently a          symptom was reported from site to site that is the          degree to which numbers of individuals reporting a          particular symptom at a given site could be expected          based on the frequency of that symptom for all sites          combined Low           P values were indicative of          symptoms that were largely independent of confounding          healthrelated and environmental factors eg previous          medical history demographics sources of biosolids and          environmental conditions          This survey which did not include an unexposed          control group was primarily intended to describe and          document selfreported illnesses It also provided          guidance on which exposure routes eg contaminated          drinking water dermal contact or inhalation of          aerosols should be the focus of the research Exposure          on the other hand was evaluated using a doseresponse          curve in a separate part of the study concerning          environmental assessments                          Assessing environmental conditions          Sludges used at all but one agricultural site          Ontario according to county records were limed or          applied to alkaline soils then exposed to weathering          Whether sludges used for mining reclamation in Osceola          Mills were lime stabilised however was disputed          Residents reported that the area was limed after          sludging          County records indicated that biosolidsrelated          complaints for individual patients described in this          study were concurrent with land application of Class B          biosolids In the case of one family Residents           however records indicated that dairy wastes rather than          biosolids had been applied Unconfirmed reports that          dairy wastes had been mixed with Class B biosolids prior          to application at this site however precluded the          authors from ruling out biosolids as a possible cause of          the symptoms According to county officials soil in this          area is naturally alkaline such that irritation similar          to that observed with exposure to limestabilised sludge          may occur          The NH site was used to develop an approach for          assessing exposures to windborne contaminants At the          site approximately  metric tons dry wt of Class B          biosolids containing  metric tons of lime and  kg of          Stockhausen BC cationic polymer Stockhausen Inc          Greensboro NC were applied to a ha field in late          October  The field was located at the end of a paved          road with eight houses AH and  residents          Historical records of symptoms experienced in the          neighbourhood were kept by one of the residents Records          began approximately  weeks after sludges were applied          and continued for approximately two years           Descriptions of symptoms included coughing burning eyes          burning throat congestion and difficulty in          breathing          To evaluate wind conditions at the site at the time          sewage sludge was applied we used a computer program          WRPLOT Version  Lakes Environmental Corp Waterloo          Ontario topographic information and historical weather          data from Pease Air Force Base located approximately  km          from the site Exposure times h which were based on          duration of wind passing directly from the field toward          each house were determined from wind frequency data          averaged for three day periods after sludges were          applied between October   November            Distances m each household resided from the nearest          edge of the treated field were  A B  C           D  E  G and  H          Concentrations of air pollutants to which residents          were exposed relative to concentrations over the treated          field were predicted using an Industrial Source Complex          ISC Dispersion Model     This prediction was not          specific for any pollutant Instead it was used as a          means for possibly ruling out the effects of ammonia          organic amines or other gaseous or volatile pollutants          Should airborne chemical contaminants be present only at          a fraction of a percent of the concentrations present          over the treated field the result would argue against          airborne chemical pollutants as a cause of adverse          effects If on the other hand pollutants are          sufficiently concentrated to cause burning eyes and other          symptoms of irritation at the application site these          same effects may occur among residents in areas where          pollutant concentrations are not highly diluted          The ISC air dispersion model is designed to predict          concentrations of pollutants off site based on emission          rates of the pollutants at their sources and local          meteorological conditions This approach is unreliable          when emission rates cannot be accurately determined          Microbiological process rates which largely control          emission rates of airborne pollutants produced by sewage          sludges are highly unpredictable To circumvent this          problem the model was used only to predict the relative          concentrations of air pollutants between the treated          field and potentially affected residences This approach          is based on the dispersion of air pollutants as winds          carry them over land surfaces irrespective of their          emission rates at the source                            Results                  Residents survey          Demographic data for the  residents surveyed along          with their symptoms are listed in Table  The average          age of the group was  years  were female  were          smokers Residents who complained of adverse effects          lived within approximately  km of the treated fields          Symptoms were primarily associated with sites where          freshly applied limestabilised sewage sludges remained          on the surface and were exposed to wind erosion          The primary complaints a fourth or more reporting the          symptom within  h of exposure were coughing            sites burning throat   sites burning eyes            sites and headaches   sites Within           h residents developed nasal and chest congestion            sites difficulty in breathing   sites          nauseavomiting   sites fatigue   sites          and flulike symptoms   sites In some cases          symptoms of chemical irritation eg burning eyes          burning throat recurred for over a year after          applications ceased          Proportions of individuals reporting coughing and          burning throats exhibited the greatest consistency from          site to site            P   respectively Half          of the residents reported bacterial viral or fungal          infections within  month of exposure    sites          Most residents also reported symptoms indicating exposure          to infectious microorganisms or microbial products          endotoxins These included flulike symptoms            sites nauseavomiting   sites diarrhoea            sites rashes   sites and sinusitis            sites          The most common infections identified by medical          records were caused by           S aureus  residents at  sites          including the additional patients identified in          Robesonia Records indicated that one infection            S lugdunensis  Resident  was          probably hospitalacquired Affected residents in          Greenland NH recalled that respiratory infections          experienced by individuals in several households treated          by the same physician responded to erythromycin an          antibiotic primarily used for treating gram positive          bacterial infections          In Menifee CA two family members complaining of          chemical irritation developed different staphylococcal          infections Resident  experienced recurrent           S aureus infections of the nasal          passages and oral cavity The spouse was hospitalised for          an invasive           S epidermitis infection that          developed approximately two days after an undressed          surgical incision became contaminated with sand blowing          from an adjacent field treated with Class B          biosolids          Mild chronic maxillary sinusitis in one child          Resident  living in this household deteriorated into          recurrent unidentified bacterial infections The          patient responded poorly to oral and IV antibiotic          therapy tonsillectomy and removal of the adenoids          Rigorous antibiotic therapy including intramuscular          injections of rocephrine also yielded unsatisfactory          results          County records showed that Class B biosolids were          applied to an adjacent field at the time the          abovementioned illnesses developed The paediatrician          treating patients in the area author C Pumphrey noted          that children living near the land application sites          appeared to develop abnormally persistent sinusitis                          Environmental assessment          Samples of sludges collected at the NH site which          were frozen since  retained a strong faecal odour          Microbiological assays showed that they contained               colonyforming units of bacteria per gram but          almost no culturable fungi Predominant culturable          bacteria were identified as common gramnegative          environmental isolates and included           Alcaligenes faecalis and           Brevundimonas diminuta  which          occasionally serve as opportunistic human pathogens          Exposure times h for each household when initial          symptoms of chemical irritation were reported Oct            Nov  were    A    B C    D             E and    G H mean  standard          deviation           n   The airdispersion model          indicated that adverse effects from exposure to airborne          pollutants from the land application site could not be          ruled out as a cause of adverse health effects Air          pollutants at Household C for example were frequently          present at concentrations of approximately             compared with concentrations  m directly above the          treated field Fig           Numbers of individuals who reported adverse effects          compared with the total numbers of individuals per          household respectively were   A   B            C   D   E   G and   H Data          from one household F were unavailable Based on a          leastsquares analysis proportions of individuals with          symptoms increased linearly from  to  h            r  with time exposed to wind          blowing from the field all occupants in households with          exposure   h reported symptoms Fig  Proportions          of individuals with symptoms also decreased linearly with          distance from the field from  to  m            r  all occupants in          households living   m from the field reported          symptoms                          Prevalence of S aureusinfections          Two cases involving mortality from           S aureus occurred with individuals          who directly contacted freshly applied biosolids In the          first case an yearold male in Osceola Mills PA with          an unremarkable medical history died of staphylococcal          septicaemia The patient developed a sore throat          headaches and furuncles on one leg and one arm within          several days after riding a motorbike through sewage          sludges applied nearby for mine reclamation purposes A          primary care physician prescribed antibiotics and the          patient was admitted to the hospital the following day          with difficulty in breathing and high fever          S aureus was isolated from skin lesions and IV          antibiotics were administered The patient developed          septicaemia and expired six days after contacting the          biosolids Mine workers in the same area requested a          health hazard evaluation after experiencing similar          respiratory and skin irritation symptoms that they          attributed to biosolids exposure          The second mortality was associated with an outbreak          of           S aureus in Robesonia PA          According to state records Class B limestabilised          sewage sludges from a local wastewater treatment facility          were applied to ten fields comprising a total of           acres Applications began in and continued through          December  Sewage sludges were applied five times a          week at a rate of approximately  tons dry wt per          year          Of nine individuals living in or frequenting the house          where the outbreak occurred eight developed           S aureus infections over a          fiveyear period beginning in February  Table           The house was located across a paved road approximately           m from the treated field Three individuals Patients             were granted hunting rights on the farmland and          frequently traversed treated areas during the application          period          Eight additional individuals lived in four other          houses that were also located in close proximity to the          field  m These individuals complained of odours          inundation with houseflies and respiratory symptoms          They associated these problems with application of          biosolids however they could not recall having any          infections          Residents reported that feral cats occupying a barn          near the treated field had to be destroyed after          developing multiple boils and weeping sores after sewage          sludge applications began Similarly residents at the          New Hampshire site reported that one individual and          numerous pets dogs cats developed boils after sewage          sludges were applied Pets may have served as a reservoir          of staphylococcal infections in these neighbourhoods and          in some cases transmitted their infections to          humans          Medical records were available for three of the four          infected residents Patients    Patient  a           yearold male with a history of excellent health was          treated for a furuncle of the knee in February then          succumbed to           S aureus pneumonia in March           after contracting a rotavirus infection and viral          pneumonia Each of four relatives who frequented the          house   dwk was also infected with           S aureus  The first of these          Patient  developed furuncles concurrently with          dermatophytic infections identified as tinea          cruristinea corpora All but two individuals Patients            sought medical attention These patients were          selftreated using antibiotics prescribed for other          family members The last           S aureus infection at Robesonia          Patient  occurred approximately two years after          biosolids applications ceased          Overall the prevalence of           S aureus infections in this study          was approximately twentyfive times higher than          infections among hospitalised patients a recognised risk          group for           S aureus                                Discussion        Chemical irritants of concern with biosolids include        endotoxins lime ammonia and alkyl amines These        contaminants may cause allergic and nonallergic reactions        that could contribute to bronchoobstructive and        inflammatory responses     The senior author and two        accompanying individuals for example experienced        coughing burning eyes burning throat headaches        congestion and difficulty in breathing within  h while        conducting a site visit in Menifee CA The visit occurred        during a time when residents were reporting these same        symptoms Although high winds were blowing sand from the        treated fields no odour was evident at that time This        experience argued against attributing the symptoms to        odourrelated psychosomatic responses which are thought to        play an important role in selfreported illnesses        associated with human and animal wastetreatment operations                   The lower human colon is the primary reservoir for         S aureus  therefore the organism        is a common sewage contaminant It is known to survive        desiccation for days to weeks and can be aerially        transmitted     It tends to invade irritated tissue        and infections are a common complication of diaper rash        after prolonged contact with urine and faeces             Although it can be part of the natural skin and nasal        microflora risks of infection vary widely among different        strains and increase with exposure to virulent strains from        other sources It is a leading cause of nosocomial        pneumonia and surgical site and bloodstream infections            however the EPA considered it to be a low risk to        public health with land applied sewage sludges            In the case of recurrent         S aureus infections in Robesonia        Table  it was evident that a persistent source of         S aureus was present It was        unclear however whether the strains responsible for the        infections had a common environmental source lasting for        several years or if certain individuals or pets became        persistent carriers and continued to expose others even        after land application ceased Residents reported that        tilling the heavily treated soil still seven years later        draws large swarms of houseflies to the area        A lack of any documented risk of staphylococcal        infections among workers processing and handling wastewater        and sewage sludges may reflect the fact that workers are        more immunocompetent than the general population or that        adequate epidemiological studies have not been done It may        also reflect differences in exposure routes or it may        suggest that incubation in the field can lead to increased        concentrations or virulence of the organism        Risks of infection with         S aureus may also depend on        environmental processes that enhance the ability of sewage        sludges to irritate the skin and respiratory tract As gram        negative bacteria die off after sludge application        endotoxin concentrations a potential source of        broncopulmonary irritation increase As sludges dry in        the field lime and other irritant chemicals become        concentrated and therefore may be more irritating upon        dermal contact and inhalation                    Conclusions        Federal guidelines advise wearing protective gear and        exercising good personal hygiene when handling Class B        biosolids or exposed to the aerosols      The nature        and timing of symptoms reported by residents suggest that        steps should also be taken to protect the public from        exposure to airborne contaminants from land application        areas Airdispersion models such as the one used in this        study could provide guidance in selecting application        sites where exposure of residents would be minimal        The Osceola Mills case Robesonia outbreak and the        occurrence of staphylococcal infections among residents at        other land application sites suggest that risks land        application practices pose from these pathogens may be        higher than expected Chemical contaminants in sludges        which irritate the skin and mucous membranes may be        responsible for an increased host susceptibility        Further research is needed to address illnesses among        residents exposed to Class B biosolids especially airborne        dusts and the role irritant chemicals may play in risks        posed by low levels of pathogens                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors
