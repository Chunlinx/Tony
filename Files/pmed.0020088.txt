                            P        LoS Medicine was launched at a time of unprecedented concern about the        influence of hidden competing interests on the medical literature As a new journal we had        the opportunity to help create the fully transparent world that is desirable  What        are we doing to promote transparency and is our strategy going far enough        We ask all authors and reviewers to declare any competing interestsfinancial personal        and professional and authors declarations are included with all published articles We        reject articles when we believe that authors competing interests have compromised their        work for research articles this means compromised in either the conduct of a study or its        interpretation When we are concerned that reviewers competing interests may prevent them        from giving an unbiased assessment we find alternative reviewers And as recommended by        the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors  we decline to publish studies        when the sponsor controls the decision on publication        Our main strategy for managing competing interests is disclosure Financial        relationships between industry researchers and academic institutions are widespread         and disclosing these competing interests is a crucial step in helping to protect the public        and the reputation of authors and of         PLoS Medicine  Disclosure also matters because there is increasing        evidence that authors competing interests have a strong influence on their conclusions        For example review articles looking at the scientific evidence on the health effects of        passive smoking have reached different conclusions a study of these review articles found        that the only factor associated with the conclusion that passive smoking was harmless was        whether an author was affiliated with the tobacco industry  A study of  randomized        clinical trials found a significant association between authors financial competing        interests and their favorable conclusions about an experimental intervention         We cannot rely entirely on peer review to detect bias in the conclusions of an article        because although peer review may help to uncover some types of bias such as bias in the        study design it cannot detect other types such as bias in the studys conduct Because a        competing interests statement accompanies every article published in         PLoS Medicine  readers can take these interests into account when they        assess a paper themselves The reality is that readers are wary of competing interests In        one study readers were randomly sent the same paper with or without                  Financial relationships between industry researchers and academic institutions are          widespread                the authors having disclosed a financial competing interest  Readers scored the        paper with the competing interest significantly lower on all five measures interest        importance relevance validity and believability of the study        Our policy of asking authors to disclose their competing interests is not of course        foolproof The Center for Science in the Public Interest recently examined  articles in        four scientific journals and identified at least  articles for which authors did not        disclose relevant conflicts of interest that should have been disclosed according to the        journals policies  Bero and colleagues compared the statement of competing interests        of the authors of a          BMJ paper on the health effects of secondhand smoke with internal tobacco        industry documents describing financial ties between the industry and the authors         Although the authors met the         BMJ s requirements for financial disclosure the disclosure did not        provide readers with a full picture of the industrys longstanding involvement with the        authors        Should we as journal editors be investigating authors ties for ourselves We do not        have the resources to do so and agree with Bero and colleagues that an elaborate policing        operation is not feasible or necessarily desirable  But in this particular case say        the authors a quick search of the tobacco documents that are freely available online        eg at httpwwwlegacylibraryucsfedu or httpwwwbatlibraryucsfedu would have        been revealing Maybe we are heading towards an era when such searches become more        commonperhaps initially by randomly selecting papers for investigation        At last years Council of Science Editors retreat on competing interests editors came        up with a list of questions to think about when formulating a journals competing interests        policy Table S Some are straightforward Should editors declare their own competing        interests We think so and have declared ours at        httpmedicineplosjournalsorgperlservrequestgetstaticnameeditorsinterests        Others are more complex When editors discover that a published author failed to declare a        significant competing interest what should they do Should they impose sanctions on the        author Should they publish a correction or even retract the paper        To help us answer such questions and to advise us on individual cases for which we are        concerned about competing interests or broader ethical questions we have appointed an        external advisory group The group Table S has expertise in clinical medicine medical        editing research health policy law and bioethics and includes a lay member In        addition an internal committee at PLoS meets monthly to consider competing interests        across the organization We are taking this issue seriously because we recognize that        journals are seen as the gatekeepers of published research We welcome your feedback on how        we are doing at protecting the probity of our content                    Supporting Information
