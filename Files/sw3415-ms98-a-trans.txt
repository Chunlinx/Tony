                well what do you think   well um gosh it set up on a scale one to ten   yeah one being total control total uh restriction and ten being none well im probably dead in the middle   uh you know i i think i would too i think id straddle the fence   because my husbands a truck driver okay   uhhuh   and he travels a lot of states and im always thinking of New York and all of them now they get New York and Californias got New York and Washington should i say   uhhuh uhhuh   got the strictest gun control law there is supposed to be   uhhuh   and it look what it done its its nothing the people more people get killed in New York than than anywhere from guns   uhhuh yeah well   so the only people the only thing that i think gun control does to me is it keeps the normal people or should i say lawabiding citizens from having guns because the criminals going to get their guns   right right yeah   its not going to do any good to now if they ban like the automatic guns and all that from   uhhuh   period then you know then if they catch them with one then fine but just gun control aint going to stop them from having a gun   right yeah   then then that you know   oh well see i agree with you uh it seems like the the crime rate has gone up even more um here this year theyre talking about uh therere more murders in Dallas um almost uh since last year and   yeah well the guy that broke in the store stole a bunch of guns and because the owner didnt have a a burglar alarm or something and that that to me that was stupid they should at least make him have   umhum uhhuh   an alarm or make it a requirement on them on them gun stores   uhhuh   you would think  but they   oh yeah oh yeah so yeah but i i just i wouldnt want to ban it completely um but uh somehow there needs to be the one thing that i did like was that where you had to wait seven days um you know um   well no umhum well i dont mind waiting thats that that i could care less   yeah yeah you know waiting waiting seven days so that they can make sure that check it out and everythings okay and to me that was uh that was perfectly acceptable   you know but umhum   you know because if you are a lawabiding citizen youre not going to want to you know its not going to matter to you if you have to wait a little while   humum and see the the the thing about it to me that they was talking about having gun control so people wouldnt kill anybody but       i am a true believer that if somebody wants to kill somebody okay   umhum   i dont care if they cant get a gun theyll find something else   oh yeah  oh yeah   it doesnt matter that they the only thing is is the gun is the quickest way they they had or they had accessible to   umhum umhum   but if they dont have a gun theyll find something else especially if they want or theyll wait on their seven days because theyre not crazy   oh yeah uhhuh oh yeah   yet i mean you know they havent proved to nobody that theyre crazy or theyre in no federal no no no uh   yeah   uh what do you call it record or nothing so theyll get a gun then they can go kill somebody and then thatd be it   yeah  oh i agree with you yeah um   and then they still going to get it so i dont think the gun control is going to help as far as you know just taking everybodys gun away because Japan well is it Japan one of those those foreign countries has gun control but all the mob people have guns   uhhuh oh yeah yeah no i i dont think that they should ban it i really i really dont um you know i i dont have a gun in the house myself because i have uh children and uh you know feel really uncomfortable about that but if i was by myself id definitely have a gun   well i have a gun you know my well my sons fifteen but   uhhuh uhhuh   my husband and me he knows that he dont even touch it and its not a hand gun see   uhhuh uhhuh   its a shotgun so it just sits there and its in its in my bedroom and hes not allowed in there anyway so   oh okay uhhuh yeah so thats thats a great   but its not nothing that he can like  and thats another thing with these kids with these guns i blame more the parents     oh yeah   because i grew up with guns i guess you know in the house my father had a gun cabinet   uhhuh   uhhuh   but we wasnt allowed to touch it and Lord help us if we did     oh yeah yeah but see these people i know they keep them up underneath their pillows and you know sitting right on top of their dresser drawers i mean its no wonder you know the kids get in there and then they blow uh other people away so you know   uhhuh no yeah little kids in the house and i dont like that i dont like it when they have kids little small kids   umhum   because uh when i have small kids over i close my door   oh yeah oh yeah   and my house is i live i live in an apartment so you know if the door opens i can see like what are you going into my room for  its not like a big house to wheres i cant see if they go in my room   umhum oh yeah yeah  yeah uhhuh umhum umhum   ill know if they go in the room because there aint but two bedrooms so its like right there   oh yeah yeah so that um yeah but that thats about the biggest reason why i just never never and and i wont even let my my son play with play guns either you know not even get that idea about about them   yeah i think the only gun my son has is part of the Intendo  you know with the TV thingy thats about it because   yeah there you go there you go thats right there you go yeah me too   the the you know i dont i dont like that i dont thats thats i dont know i just humum but i dont think the gun control as far as i guess i would probably vote right in the middle if if if there is a way to vote   uhhuh
