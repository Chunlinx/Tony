KOMMUNIKATIONSDIENSTE WIK GMHHRD KNIGSWINTER SEMINAR COST OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE NOVEMBERIntroductionThe delivery function is comparatively new to modern postalservices Originally the post was simply an intercity letterservice One could deposit a letter at the post office in a cityfor transportation to the post office in another city where therecipient would call for it It was not until the midnineteenthcentury that city delivery began on a regular basis in the US Bythe end of the century rural delivery was started on a limitedbasis but it did not become ubiquitous until the early part of thetwentieth centuryDelivery changed the post in many ways No doubt it has been asubstantial cause of the tremendous growth in volume since itsinception But delivery also changed the economics of the modernpost because it introduced a large amount of fixed costsWhile the letter mail monopoly preceded the introduction ofdelivery service the fixed costs associated with delivery underliethe two modern justifications for the letter monopoly First it isargued that a letter mail monopoly is necessary to assure universalservice at a uniform price Second it is argued that delivery is anatural monopoly and that legal protection is necessary to preventcream skimming and thereby to maximize the benefit of theuniversal delivery system The first argument is a political onewhich presumes significant urbanrural cross subsidizes indelivery The second is an economic argument which presumes thatthe Postal Service as a monopolist is an efficient provider ofdelivery The analysis presented here is an attempt to address thesecond argumentCampbell James I Jr An Introduction to the History of thePostal Monopoly Law in the United States The Last Monopoly TheCATO Institute Washington DC For purposes of this paper cream skimming refers toconcentration on serving only those markets that exhibitlowerthanaverage delivery costs regardless of the characteristicthat causes those costs to be less than average Suchcharacteristics are not confined to network density and couldinclude favorable geographic demographic or operationalcharacteristics For example in the US curb delivery is lesscostly than park and loop delivery which is less costly than footdeliveryIn an unsubsidized postal system as in the United States thepostal customer bears all costs of the system The customertherefore is the beneficiary where return to scale are maximized byhaving a single firm a monopoly provide delivery On the otherhand monopolies can be harmful to consumers when they protecttechnically inefficient behavior and allow economic rents to beextracted This paper sets up a framework to examine the followingquestion Do the economies of scale in the delivery function exceedthe technical inefficiencies and economic rents of the PostalService In short does the monopoly increase or decrease the priceof postal services to postal customersThis paper measures the returns to scale of the US deliveryfunction It then compares this benefit with the cost that themonopoly imposes on the consumerBecause delivery involves so much fixed cost it would create atremendous barrier to entry even if the legal monopoly wereabolished Thus it may be that having once enjoyed a de juremonopoly national posts would enjoy a de facto monopoly even ifthe legal one were abolished  This paper provides aquantification of the barrier to entry in the letter mail market inthe United States caused by high fixed costs in the deliveryfunctionThis paper next estimates the value of scale in deliveryexhibited by  national postal systems based on data from anunpublished paper which was presented at the  Stockholmconference on Postal and Delivery Services  Finally it comparesthe estimated value of scale with an estimate of the wage premiumin each countryIt is also claimed that monopolies harm consumers with lowerquality of service and by being less innovative than firms whichmust competeIt is important to distinguish postal consumers ie payingcustomers from recipients of mail The latter may derive greatbenefits from a monopoly in the form of services that would not beprovided in a competitive postal environment These might be calledpolitical rents Consumers being forced to underwrite thepolitical rents and any inefficiencies and economic rents in thesystem may be better off in a competitive environmentThis may well be the case in Sweden which abolished its monopolyin  A letter mail competitor began operations in Stockholmwhere it captured  percent of the market but nonethelessfailedAn Exploratory Quantitative Comparison of PostalAdministrations in Industrial CountriesThe data for each country is from  and is based on UPUstatistics which have been verified and revised as necessary basedon communications with officials in most of the countriesThe Uniqueness of the Delivery FunctionWe distinguish what is known in the US as the inofficedelivery function and the street delivery function The former isan extension of mail processing it is where the mail is sortedinto the delivery sequence Delivery function as used in thispaper refers to street deliveryRecent empirical research confirms the widely held belief thateconomies of scale exist in the delivery of mail Other functionalcomponents of the Postal Service are presumed here not to exhibitsignificant scale economies although this has not beendemonstratedJohn Panzar has characterized street delivery as a bottleneckfunction because a single firm can deliver to a recipient at alower total cost than multiple firms delivering to the samecustomer He suggests that processing and transportation of mail donot seem to be characterized by scale economies and that theycould be provided by competing firms Under this scenario hesuggests that rates be set to allow nondiscriminatory access to themonopoly delivery service by the firms competing in processing andtransportationThe Postal Rate Commission and the US Postal Service haveimplicitly recognized the absence of significant scale economies inmail processing and transportation functions in the PostalServices rate structure Postal rates in theUS allow for a substantial degree of competition with thePostal Service in mailprocessing and transportation For examplethe US Postal Service gives sorting and barcoding discounts toabout  percent of FirstClass letter volume Mailers performabout  percent of this worksharing while third parties performtheNatural Monopoly and Technological Agnosticism The Case of theUS Postal Service MichaelD Bradley and Jeff Colvin June Panzar John Competition Efficiency and the VerticalStructure of Postal Services Regulation and the Nature of Postaland Delivery Services Ed Michael A Crew and Paul R KleindorferKluwer Academic Publishers rest  In some classes mailers transport much of their mailto downstream locations to take advantage of zoned rates fortransportationStreet Delivery CostWhile the Postal Service collects extensive data on the costbehavior of city delivery carriers it collects little data on thecost behavior of rural carriers For purposes of this analysis weassume throughout that rural delivery cost behavior is similar tothat of city delivery In the US street delivery costs forrural and city carriers combined comprises  percent of totalcosts See Table Table  USPS Operational Costs by Major FunctionNote Nonoperating costs such as payments made to the Treasuryfor retroactive charges are excludedThese thirdparty sorters collect mail from mailers sort andapply barcodes and deliver the mail to the Postal Service for aportion of the discount In addition discounts encourage bulkadvertising mailers to sort their mail all the way to the carrierswalk sequence thereby avoiding the carrier inofficefunctionEconomic rents in the form of a wage premium paid by the USPostal Service partially explain why mailers and third parties cansort mail at a lower cost than the Postal Service When thirdparties compete with the Postal Service however in highlyautomated operations such as applying barcodes with opticalcharacter readers and sorting barcoded mail a wage premium wouldseemingly not be a very significant factorThe US Postal Service has two types of delivery personnelcity delivery carriers and rural carriers In  there were thousand city delivery routes with  million delivery points and thousand rural routes with  million delivery points Ruralcosts were  percent of total delivery costsFor example it is assumed that the ratio of rural carrierinoffice cost to total rural carrier cost is the same as the ratioof city carrier inoffice cost to total city carrier costThis paper adopts the analysis of street delivery costspresented by the US Postal Service in several rate proceedingsover the past  years That analysis disaggregates street deliverytime into three subcomponents route time access time and loadtime Route time is the time it would take a carrier to walk ordrive the route passing but not accessing any delivery pointAccess time is the time it takes a carrier to deviate from theroute in order to make a delivery This may mean departing from thebasic line of travel and walking or driving to a delivery point andreturning to the basic line of travel or it may mean slowing downfrom normal driving speed stopping to make a delivery to acurbside mail receptacle and then resuming normal speed Finallyload time is the time it takes a carrier to place the mail in amail receptacle  Table  disaggregates street time in theUSTable Note For simplicity coveragerelated load time million is included in access time and street support ispiggybacked on all three functionsRoute time costs are essentially fixed while access is partlyvariable andload time is  percent variable with volume The analysis ofvariability of accesstime involves estimating the number of new accesses that wouldbe caused by anincrement of volume In the US approximately  percent ofall possible stopsreceive mail each delivery day  Consequently the number ofnew accessesLoad time is divided into elemental and coverage related loadtime Elemental load time varies with the number of pieces beingloaded Coverage related load time is the fixed portion of loadtime at a stop it varies with the number of stops Thus it ispartly variable and partly fixedA stop consists of one or more possible deliveries For examplea  unit apartment house with a cluster of  mail boxes would beone stop and  possible deliveriescaused by an increase in volume would be small Regressionanalysis of carrier street data indicates that at the currentvolume the variability of access cost is about  percent In otherwords a  percent increase in volume will yield a percent increase in the number of accessesThe Postal Service regularly collects a representative sample ofstreet delivery costs volumes and delivery point characteristicsfor city delivery carriers The Postal Services FY  data setcontains observations from about  routes Observed every twoweeks over a one year period data is collected from about stops This data is used to model the behavior of access costsThe coverage function shown in Figure  models the change in thepercentage of possible stops that are accessed on a route as aresult of changes in volume  Marginal access cost can beestimated from the coverage function As volume per stop grows andcoverage approaches  percent the volume variability of accesscost approaches zero As the volume per stop declines coveragedeclines and the volume variability of access costs risesMeasure of Scale EconomiesOur methodology for measuring scale economies essentiallycompares the cost of providing delivery by a single firm with thecost of providing delivery by two firms We measure the returnsto scale in the US postal delivery function by first determiningthe total cost of delivery provided by the Postal Service Next wedetermine the total cost of delivery performed by the incumbent anda second firm that is assumed to be equally efficient We assumethat the two firms share the market equally each delivering arandom half of the mail Further each firm servesSee the testimony of US Postal Service witness Bradley inDocket No R USPST at pp The Postal Service developed the coverage function and firstused it in the Docket No R rate case For this paper we havealtered the Services model slightly Unlike the Postal Servicesmodel all stop types and mail classes are consolidatedOf course the cost of providing delivery by a single firm couldalso be compared with the cost of three or more firms This wouldsimply inflate the measure of scale economiesthe entire country each delivery day Thus each firm would haveto incur the same route time costs that the incumbent currentlyincurs Since each firm will have only half the volume the numberof accesses by each firm will be less than the incumbent currentlyexperiences The number of total accesses by the two firms willhowever be greater than the total experienced by the incumbentalone This is because some stops receiving multiple pieces willreceive delivery from both firms We assume here that both firmsprovide the same frequency of delivery dailySince route time is essentially fixed it would double withtwo firms providing service each with half the volume Converselybecause load time is  percent variable with volume it would notchange since total volume is assumed not to change Access costwould fall somewhere in between since it is partly variable andpartly fixed Access cost variability is estimated from thecoverage function shown in Figure  Under the duopoly scenariodescribed it would grow by  percent Given these responses tovolume total street time cost would increase from  billion to billion The difference  billion represents an upperbound on the benefits from scale economies of deliveryMonopoly Rents and InefficienciesIn  the average US postal worker subject to collectivebargaining received  in pay and allowances and anadditional  in fringe benefits To put these earnings intoperspective the median annual earningsA niche incumbent might provide delivery less frequently or to asubset of possible stops These would be special cases of the moregeneral case analyzed hereThe slight variability the Commission has found in route time isignored here for convenienceCeteris paribus less efficient postal services do not havegreater scale economies than more efficient ones Theoreticallyscale economies in delivery are not firm specific They are aproduct of the territory served and the current state of technologywhich would be employed by an efficient firm The  billionfigure is inflated by any inefficiency andor wage premium whichcharacterize theUS Postal Service and in that sense it is an upper boundThe fringe benefit figure excludes unfunded civil serviceretirement liability certain annuitant benefits workerscompensation unemployment compensation repriced annual leavebonuses and awardswithout fringe benefits was  for fulltime US workersin that year Michael B Wachter of the University ofPennsylvania and his colleagues conclude that there is a wage andfringe benefit premium for the postal bargaining labor force of percent with respect to comparable workers in the privatesector Such a wage premium would amount to  billion inmonopoly rents for the entire postal system Wachters  billionsystemwide wage premium exceeds the  billion delivery scaleeconomy by  billion Wachters wage premium for the deliverynetwork alone however amounts to only  billion which is billion less than the value of the scale benefit from deliveryUnlike labor costs technical inefficiency of the Postal Servicehas not been analyzed There is however some indirect evidence ofinefficiencies in the Postal Service Since  total factorproductivity has increased at an average annual rate of only percent This is in spite of the fact that little mechanizationexisted in the Postal Service prior to  and large amounts wereadded in the s Beginning in the early s and continuing tothe present about  billion has been invested to automated mailprocessing including the inoffice carrier sequence function andforwarding for undeliverableasaddressed mail Additional billionshave been invested in buildings in part to house the automationIn spite of this investment productivity appears to have increasedonly in response to hiring freezes or reductions in the averagewage and fringe benefit package caused by special circumstances  Statistical abstracts of the US Table  The Comparability of US Postal Service Wages and Benefits tothe Private Sector Evidence from the Total Compensation PremiumNew Hire Increases Quit Rates and Application Rates Michael LWachter Barry T Hirsch and James W Gillula July   DrWachter has published a number of studies on the Postal Serviceslabor costs under contract to the USPS Critics of previous Wachterstudies claim that they ignore the fact that the Postal Servicepays minorities the same as it pays white males The critics arguethat it is the Postal Services minority employees not white maleemployees who earn more than their private sector equivalents andthis only means that the Postal Service does not discriminate See A study of US Postal Service Productivity and ItsMeasurement Staff Study of the Postal Rate Commission May Other indications of inefficiency are management claims thatwork rules are unnecessarily restrictive and that  grievanceswere filed by employees in FY  and not resolved at the locallevel In addition the Postal Service has failed to capture alarge market share in two areas of direct competition with theprivate sector which are relatively unaffected by the PrivateExpress Statutes Parcel Post and Express overnight Mail Thismay have been in part caused by either a wage premium or technicalinefficiencies or a combination of both The Postal Service arguesthat aFigure  presents the consumer benefit from delivery scaleeconomies net of inefficiencies which are expressed as a percentageof total postal costs The top curve incorporates any wage premiumthe Postal Service may have the bottom curve nets out Wachters percent wage premium The top curve shows that if the PostalService has  percent inefficiencies with its current wage premiumthe measure of scale economies equal  billion If the PostalService were about  percent inefficient there would be zero netscale benefit The bottom curve shows that at  percentinefficiencies the net scale benefit is  billion if the valueof scale is adjusted for Wachters wage premium Any inefficiencywould exacerbate the loss If the wage premium is accuratelycalculated by Professor Wachter it would be difficult to defendthe US postal monopoly on purely economic grounds Moreoverunderstanding the net economic cost of the monopoly allows one tosee how much universal service costs postal customers at leastunder current institutional arrangementsFigure  presents the same information considering the streetfunction alone Wachters wage premium amounts to only  billionfor the delivery function alone Thus the net scale benefit isinitially positive whether or not we adjust for the wagepremiumIt is far more likely that a monopoly for delivery alone wouldproduce net benefits for consumers than would a monopoly thatincluded processing and transportation as well as delivery Thisresult lends support to the Panzars suggestion of openingprocessing and transportation to competition while maintaining amonopoly in deliverylack of pricing flexibility has contributed to the PostalServices failure Others argue that the quality of serviceproduct features and underlying cost of these Postal Servicesofferings make them uncompetitiveBarriers to EntryBecause a large proportion of street costs are fixed the unitper piece street cost initially declines rapidly as volumeincreases and continues to decline at a decreasing rate A firmwith a small share of total volume that competes with an incumbentin delivery only will find its unit cost high relative to theincumbent even if the competitor pays no wage premium and or ismore efficient A competitor can reduce its fixed costs by reducingthe level of service ie deliver less frequently than theincumbent Many FirstClass mailers do not require daily deliveryand most advertising mailers do not require daily deliveryWhile it may be politically difficult incumbent postaladministrations have the possibility of reducing deliveryfrequency Table  displays the cost savings if theUS Postal Service were to reduce delivery frequency Thesavings are substantial relative to the current  billiondelivery costs They are not so substantial when considered in thecontext of the total Postal Service expenditure in  of billionTable  Cost of Delivery FrequencyTable  illustrates how difficult it would be to enter the USdelivery marketThe table displays the market share that a competitor would haveto capture in orderIn the US about  percent of street cost are fixedOver and above the problems discussed here the US mail boxlaw represents a huge barrier to entry The law forbids any privateparty from placing anything in a receptacle used to deliver mail toa residence or businessto have the same unit costs as the US Postal Service Forexample if a competitor delivered six days a week and its combinedwage and efficiency advantage is  percent the competitor wouldhave to capture  percent of the total market in order to have thesame unit delivery cost as the Postal Service Even if thiscompetitor delivered only one day per week it would have tocapture  percent of the total market in order to have the sameunit delivery cost as the Postal Service on a national basis Thisis about  billion pieces per year or  million pieces per weekAssuming a competitor would capture volume slowly and would have tocharge rates no higher than the incumbent the competitor wouldhave to be ready to sustain large loses before it could break evenThus the effects of economies of scale in delivery presentsignificant barriers to entryTable  BreakEven Market Share for CompetitorsCompetitor Combined Wage and Efficiency AdvantageAn International Comparison of the Values of Scale in Deliverywith Wage PremiumsAs mail volume increases in postal systems variable costsprocessing and transportation increase and fixed costs decreaseas a percentage of total costs Therefore street delivery costswhich are largely fixed decrease as a percentage of total costs asvolume increases Route time cost which is a fixed cost and thelargest component of street delivery costs decreases with a risein volume The fixed access cost as a percentage of total costwould increase with volume until all stops are covered while thevariable access cost percentage decreases as volume increasesFigure  shows these relationships for the US Postal ServicecostsConversely as volumes decrease fixed costs become a higherpercentage of total costs For example if the US Postal Servicevolume were one third of the  level then delivery costs as apercentage of total costs would increase from approximately percent to  percent of total costs In equally efficient butsmaller volume postal systems street delivery costs should also bea much greater percentage of total costs than the  percent in theUS Postal ServiceTable  displays the implied coverage the percentage of totalcost represented by street delivery cost and the percentage oftotal cost represented by fixed delivery cost for the  countriesbased on their respective per capita volume in   Forexample Germany had about  pieces per capita which yields acoverage of about  percent Its per capita volume andcorresponding coverage imply that its fixed portion of deliveryequaled about  percent of its total costs The US bycomparison had about  pieces per capita and had  percentcoverage for  Thus the fixed portion of delivery in the USamounted to about  percent of total cost The implied coveragesrange from  percent to nearly  percent The impliedproportions of fixed delivery cost tot total cost ranged from percent to  percentThis assumes that the coverage function Figure  developedfrom an analysis of delivery routes in the US is valid for theother countries included in this analysisTable  Fixed Delivery CostsNote Assumes fixed costs are incurred only in the deliveryfunction All other functions are assumed to vary with volumeFor each of the  countries in the international data setdescribed above we calculate the value of scale in the deliveryfunction using the same approach we used for the US with a slightmodification For the US we calculate the value of scale bycomparing the cost of a hypothetical duopoly with the cost of amonopoly This is calculated using volume per possible stops dataand the coverage function For the other  countries we use aslightly different approach because detailed street delivery costand point of delivery data are not available We use volume percapita as a proxy for pieces per possible stop and assume that thestreet delivery cost to total cost relationship of the US is thesame for the other  countries See the Technical Appendix for amore detailed discussion of the methodologyUsing the  data we use the per capita volume for eachcountry to approximate pieces per possible stop We assume a directlinear relationship between volume per capita and pieces perpossible stop Using the estimates of pieces per possible stop foreach country we then calculate the monopoly and the duopoly costsbased on the US costs We then take the ratio of the value ofscale to the monopoly cost and multiply that ratio by the actualtotal costs for each country to estimate the value of scale foreach countryFor example for the United Kingdom the value of scale is about billion using the US model In  the total cost for thePostal Service was about  billion When we adjust the totalcost for the United Kingdoms coverage level the total cost wouldbe about  billion If we assume that all cost segments otherthan street delivery vary with volume the value of scale is about percent of the total cost at the United Kingdoms volume andcoverage levels We then apply the  percent estimate to theUnited Kingdoms actual total cost for   billion tocalculate the value of scale The value of scale for the UnitedKingdom is about  billion Table  displays the estimates ofvalue of scale for the  countries in our data set The value ofscale ranges from  million for Luxembourg to  billion forthe USA measure of a wage premium can be calculated for each countryby comparing the postal hourly wage with the average manufacturingwage in that country It should be noted that Belgium Finlandand Spain have a negative wage premium according to this measureThe net value of scale is the difference between the value of scaleand the wage premiumThe total costs for national postal systems other than the USare expressed in purchasing power paritiesThe postal data for calculating the wage premium comes from theabove mentioned paper The private sector data comes fromInternational Comparisons of Hourly Compensation Costs forProduction Workers in Manufacturing  US Department ofLabor Bureau of Labor Statistics Report  June Table  Comparison of Value of Scale in Delivery with the WagePremium in  National Postal Systems  millions  Note Expressed in US dollars based on purchasing powerparitiesIf the wage premium measure is valid then seven countries havea wage premium alone which exceeds the value of scale in thedelivery function Australia Austria France Japan LuxembourgSwitzerland and the United StatesIn these countries it appears that it would be difficult tojustify a postal delivery monopoly based on economic groundsBetter understanding of inefficiencies in national postal systemswould allow further evaluation of the economic basis for the postalmonopoly in the remaining countriesSweden and Finland do not have legal monopoliesTECHNICAL APPENDIXA Estimating the Coverage Function DataWe use the FY  data from the Postal Services City CarrierSystem CCS to model the behavior of access costs The CCS database contains a representative sample of street delivery costsvolumes and delivery point characteristics for city deliverycarriers The CCS FY  data set contains observations from about routes The Postal Service sampled each route every two weeksover a one year period resulting in about  routelevelobservations The Coverage ModelFor this paper we use a nonlinear regression model thatestablishes the relationship between volume and coverage We definecoverage as the percentage of stops on a route that receive mailIt has been well established that route coverages relate directlyto the fixed and variable nature of access cost The coverage modelspecification is as followsCOVi    e bPPSi where COVi  ASi  PSi ASi  Number

countries other than the US describedabove we use a slightly different approach because detailed streetdelivery cost and point of delivery data are not available We usevolume per capita as a proxy for
