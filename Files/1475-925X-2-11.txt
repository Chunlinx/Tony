                    Background        Today the use of mobile phones is widespread and the        number of users is increasing rapidly It is generally        known that an electromagnetic field of adequate intensity        and frequency may interfere with implanted devices Mobile        phones are regarded as a potential source of        electromagnetic interference with pacemakers               and defibrillators       An extensive review of the        literature     demonstrated that up to now no        examinations on electromagnetic compatibility aspects of        deep brain stimulators DBS and mobile phones have been        published The malfunctions inhibition switch to the        safety modus ie stimulation with a fixed rate and        stimulation with a false signal reported with pacemakers               due to the use of mobile phones may lead to        discomfort and in rare cases to menacing situations for the        pacemaker patient These malfunctions depend on various        parameters frequency transmitting power modulation        principle of the mobile phone system distance between        mobile phone and pacemaker implantation depth operating        mode of the pacemaker as well as the interference immunity        of the pacemaker For older pacemakers a safety distance of         inches  centimeters is sufficient to avoid        malfunctions although some publications recommend less        than  inches The use of the mobile phone on the opposite        side of the pacemakers location reduces the probability of        interference Subsequently pacemaker patients should not        carry the mobile phone in the breast pocket close to the        pacemaker or if the pacemaker is located in the abdomen        not on a belt when it is switched on Defibrillators seem        to be less sensitive than pacemakers regarding        electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones Generally        the same precautions  inches or  centimeter minimum        distance as in the case of pacemakers should be        encouraged If these precautions are adhered to the        possibility of interference with defibrillators can be        minimized        The increasing use of neurostimulators and mobile        phones and the lack of information on possible disturbance        of DBSs due to exposure from mobile phones motivated us to        carry out this study We studied the interference of the        DBS ITRELIII from Medtronic Inc Minneapolis MN USA        with GSM mobile phones operating at  MHz and  MHz        and with broadband diploes in the frequency range from         MHZ up to  MHz Unlike pacemakers and defibrillators        DBSs have no sensing inputs and therefore they should be        more robust regarding electromagnetic interference        However stimulation leads could act as antenna picking up        radio frequency RF currents and leading them into the        device Feed through filters should be able to handle this        problem However the manufacturer did not disclose        information of the implant design the electronic circuit        design whether feed though filters where used or not and        which other electromagnetic compatibility precautions were        taken        Neurological pulse generators are used as DBSs in the        treatment of Parkinsons disease or as spinal cord        stimulators This study deals only with the ITRELIII as a        DBS Located in the chest region under the skin the DBS        stimulates certain areas of the brain namely the thalamus        or subthalamus      Due to its superior programming        possibilities the ITRELIII and ITRELII are the DBSs        preferred by our center for neurosurgery A programming        device can telemetrically adjust the stimulation parameters        such as frequency amplitude and pulse duration Two        critical locations of the phone in respect of interference        that correspond to typical use scenarios can be found The        region around the ear due to the closeness of the mobile        phone antenna to the leads of the DBS and the breast region        due to the potential closeness of the mobile phone to the        DBS                    Methods                  Tests of commercially available mobile          phones          The electromagnetic compatibility behavior of the          ITRELIII was examined while exposing the ITRELIII to          the fields of  different types of GSM  MHz mobile          phones and  different GSM  MHz mobile phones Every          mobile phone was tested in three different positions next          to the phantom using  different electrode          configurations and  different stimulation parameters          SeeFF Table  Altogether  different test          configurations were examined The power control of the          handsets was adjusted at  MHz and  MHz using the          GSM tester CMD  from Rhode  Schwarz The maximum          radiated peak power was  W   dB at  MHz and  W            dB at  MHz respectively          Different spatial configurations of the implant          leadshape and leadsize can affect the interference due          to different RFbehavior Particularly loops in the          leads are able to pick up more RF currents With respect          to RFbehavior two significantly different lead          configurations were chosen the loop and the meander          Figure shows the two different lead configurations for          interference testing          All mobile phones were tested in three positions next          to the phantom  in front of the chest  directly over          the implant with the mobile phone touching the phantom          shown in Figure            next to the ear  in a typical position while          making a telephone call This position is defined in             as the cheek or touch position shown in Figure                     in a nontypical position in front of the skull          directly over the loop or meander shown in Figure           To observe the function of the ITRELIII the output          signal at the connection of the lead to the implant case          was monitored via a shielded cable on an oscilloscope          Interference with the field of the mobile phone and the          monitoring cable was prevented by routing the monitoring          cable out of the phantom to the oscilloscope on the          opposite side back of the phantom of the interference          source          Different mobile phones have different types of          antennas and each antenna has its own current          distribution The current distribution on the antenna and          the antenna location on the mobile phone case affects the          field distribution in the patient and therefore the          interference behavior Another major difference between          mobile phones is the emitted peak power due to the GSM          specifications which allow a peak power tolerance of            dB To get a representative coverage we tested           different GSM mobile phones indicated in Table           Ad hoc testing of electronic implants with special          types of mobile phones only gives reliable results for          the tested phones To know the safety margin for possible          interference it is necessary to perform tests with more          general interference sources Therefore broadband dipoles          were used to find out which power levels depending on          the frequency would cause interference                          Susceptibility tests using broadband dipoles          The purpose was to determine the interference level of          the ITRELIII in the frequency range from  MHz to           MHz We used broadband dipoles shown in Figure  The          dipole consists of two equilateral triangles with a          length L of a quarter of the wavelength We used two          different broadband dipoles with dimensions for  MHz          and  MHz Dipoles were mounted on the surface of the          phantom directly over the implant and driven by an RF          amplifier The RF signal was a continuous wave CW The          dipole touched the surface of the phantom and had a          distance of  mm to the surface of the ITRELIII  mm          phantom plastic shell and  mm phantom liquid see          Figure           Such a scenario corresponds to the situation when a          patient carries a mobile phone in his jacket At each          examined frequency the transmitting power of the dipole          was increased until the implant showed an influence This          power level is defined as the interference level Special          diligence was taken to measure the radiated power          forward minus reflected power Generally RF          transmitter frequency tests were performed in frequency          steps of  MHz The frequency increment was reduced to           MHz only in bands where low interference levels were          observed          To estimate the electric field E field inside the          phantom at the position of the implant we modeled at           MHz and  MHz a simplified test setup using the          Finite Difference Time Domain FDTD method with a grid          size of  mm A halfwavelength dipole was placed          directly on a  mm thick flat plastic layer Behind the          flat plastic layer we modeled the liquid phantom material          with dielectric properties for Muscle tissue given in          Table  The model with the resulting E field          distribution at  MHz is shown in the results section          in Figure                             Results        No influence on the ITRELIII was found during tests        with GSM mobile phones despite a maximum transmission peak        power of  W  MHz and  W  MHz No inhibition or        changes in the shape of the stimulation pulse occurred        Tests with broadband dipoles and different power levels        showed that the output signal of the ITRELIII abruptly        failed inhibition when the interference level was        exceeded The inhibition was complete which means no        output signal was detected and the ITRELIII stopped        working The ITRELIII returned to normal operation after        reducing the transmit power below the interference level        The primary settings and programming parameters like the        amplitude and the pulse repetition rate of the output        signal of the ITRELIII remained unchanged This kind of        implant behavior was found at all tested frequencies        Figure shows the frequency dependence of the interference        level        The observed interference level at  MHz was  W        CW or  Vm inside the liquid at the location of the        implant and  W CW or  Vm inside the liquid at the        location of the implant at  MHz A variation of the        stimulation parameters does not lead to any essential        change of the threshold value The extremely low        interference level at  MHz should be noted In this        frequency range a few milliwatts    Vm were        sufficient to inhibit the ITRELIII Tests on other        locations of the dipole relative to the phantom near the        ear the loop or the meander showed no influence up to a        maximum available radiation power of  W The uncertainty        of the transmitting power measurement was less than          and is basically composed of the uncertainty of the power        measurement itself and the uncertainty of the direction        coupler parameters        Figure shows the E field distribution for  MHz at        a transmit power of  W which corresponds to the        observed interference level at  MHz The magnitude of        the E field at the location of the implant dashed        rectangle is about  Vm The calculation at  MHz        shows an E field of about  Vm at the location of the        implant for a transmit power of  W                    Conclusions        The examinations have shown that the exposure of the        ITRELIII to electromagnetic fields of GSM  MHz and         MHz mobile phones does not result in inhibition or changes        in the shape of the stimulation pulses The investigations        performed with mobile phones did not indicate a direct risk        for ITRELIII patients while using the tested mobile phones        in positions corresponding to the intended use Tests with        increased transmitting power have shown that an inhibition        of the ITRELIII is caused at frequency dependent power        levels An OnOff switching of the reed switch of the        implant could not be observed Both interference levels        found with CW signals using broadband dipoles  W or         Vm at  MHz and  W or  Vm at  MHz are        below the maximum nominal peak power of GSM mobile phones        The GSM specifications allow a  dB offset from the        nominal output power of  W at  MHz or  W at  MHz        respectively Even the lower boundary of the GSM power        specifications  W at  MHz and  W at  MHz        are above the interference levels found with CW signals        using broadband dipoles The question of why we could not        find interference with real GSM phones although the        interference levels found with broadband dipoles are below        the emissions of GSM specifications remains open A        possible explanation is that a mobile phone is covered with        a plastic case with losses which absorb energy and        therefore reduce the emitted fields Our broadband dipoles        were not covered with plastic Furthermore the plastic case        of the mobile phone prevents the antenna or other metallic        parts from touching the phantom shell as with the broadband        dipoles we used Particularly low interference levels were        observed in the frequency range around  MHz This        frequency range is used by Japanese mobile phones Further        examinations including mobile phones operating in this        frequency band are recommended A major finding was the        strong frequency dependent interference level Due to lack        of information about the implant particularly details        about the electronic circuit design the reason for the        strong frequency dependence of the interference level and        the very low interference level around  MHz could not        be determined Other types of neurological stimulators        could also have a frequency dependent interference level        but with interference levels below the emissions of mobile        phones at other frequencies Unfortunately such        neurological stimulators eg ITRELII Soletra Kinetra        were not available to perform similar tests The assumption        that the implant with a low battery level would be more        susceptible to electromagnetic fields proved to be wrong        Both tested implants showed the same interference level        Regarding mobile phone safety of neurological pulse        generators Medtronic only has information about the Activa        System          Medtronic Web Site         httpwwwmedtroniccomneuroetfieldshtml         Most of the electrical devices that        people are around in a normal day will not harm the Activa        System This includes household appliances computers        office machines cellular phones and personal radios        Special circuits inside the neurostimulator protect it from        extreme electrical stress  Until information is        available about the mobile phone compatibility of other        neurological implants especially older models and there        is a clarification of the ITRELIII interference below the        emissions of GSM mobile phones we recommend the following        precautions based on investigations with cardiac        pacemakers  To use the phone at the ear opposite the        side of the implant and  To carry the cell phone on the        opposite side of the implant when it is in use or in        standby modus Due to the fact we were not aware of any        investigations on DBS and mobile phones using other        technologies as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System        UMTS we suggest that patients with DBS should take into        account the safety recommendations given above
