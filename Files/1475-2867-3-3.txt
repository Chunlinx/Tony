                    Background        Vitamin E is an essential fatsoluble vitamin The        general term vitamin E refers to eight naturally occurring        and synthetic tocopherols and tocotrienols and their        acetate and succinate derivatives Although the naturally        occurring forms of vitamin E have lipidsoluble antioxidant        properties that protect cell membranes against damage by        free radicals the acetate and succinate derivatives that        are esterified at the C position of the chromanol ring do        not have antioxidant properties unless the esterification        is hydrolyzed and free tocopherol is regenerated                     Synthetic vitamin E a form of vitamin E commonly used        as a dietary supplement is the form used in the         in vivo studies reported here It is        a mixture of eight stereoisomers in equal amounts        designated dl or allrac tocopherol and does have        antioxidant properties     Thus different forms of        vitamin E can have different antioxidant properties as well        as differences in their absorption distribution and        metabolism     There are also reports that some forms        of vitamin E have activity against cancer cells         in vitro      For example        tocotrienol and vitamin E succinate are reported to have        antiproliferative activity in human cancer cells whereas        some forms of vitamin E are reported to induce apoptosis in        cancer cell types but not in normal cell types            Specifically these apoptogenic forms include        RRRtocopheryl succinate and RRRtocopherol while the          and  tocopherol and acetate derivatives of        tocopherol were not apoptogenic     There are few        reports on the use of vitamin E for treating tumorous        cancers         in vivo but the results are        inconsistent           It is therefore essential        that the form of vitamin E used in any research study as        well as the dosage and the mode of administration be        defined        The study reported on here was originally designed to        test the ability of a high dietary dose of sE to prevent        lipid peroxidation in nude mice bearing a human breast        cancer xenograft MDAMB      To assure        suppression of lipid peroxidation sE was added to the diet        at a dose level For example the vitamin E requirement for        mice when allractocopherol acetate is used as the        dietary source is  mgkg for diets in which lipids        comprise less than  percent of the diet     Thus the         mgkg diet used in this study is  fold higher than        this estimated requirement This is in contrast to human        recommendations which are given in mg of tocopherol        equivalents with the adult RDA set at  mgday and the        upper limit set at  mgday The observed antitumor        activity of this sE dietary supplementation was an        unexpected experimental result as sE was not previously        reported to have antitumor activity although vitamin E may        give modest protection against the risk of breast cancer            Based on the observed antitumor activity of high dose        sE in the diet it became important to investigate if the        sE supplement when fed at such a high dose was associated        with the modification of the fatty acid composition of        mitochondrial and microsomal membranes and if the sE was        acting as an antioxidant or possibly a prooxidant in tumor        and in host tissues Given that such a high dose of sE has        antitumor activity it also became important to look for        possible sideeffects in host tissues prior to further        preclinical trials                    Results                  Tumor growth          The mean tumor growth rate was calculated using linear          regression analysis of mean tumor size over time After          two weeks of dietary intervention the mean growth rate          of the group of mice fed the sE supplement was half that          of mice not fed the sE supplement however this difference          was not quite significant at the p   level Tumor          growth rate in mice not sacrificed after  weeks of          dietary intervention was followed for an additional four          weeks Analysis of mean tumor growth rate for the entire           days of intervention revealed that the mean tumor          growth rate of mice fed the sE supplement was  slower          than the mean tumor growth rate of mice not fed the sE          supplement significant at p   as illustrated in          Fig                           Lipid peroxidation          Tumor and host tissue malondialdehyde and          malondialdehyde byproducts were analyzed by the          thiobarbituric acid reactive substrates TBARS assay to          estimate the extent of lipid peroxidation after six weeks          of intervention The TBARS findings are summarized in          Fig  The mean value of TBARS was significantly p            lower in the tumor and in the liver of the mice fed          sE but was not significantly different p   in          the colon                          Fatty acid composition of microsomal and of          mitochondrial membranes          Data on the percent of the total fatty acid          composition for linoleic acid LA for arachidonic acid          AA and for docosahexanoic acid DHA in the microsomal          and in the mitochondrial fractions of tumor of liver          and of colon after two weeks of dietary intervention both          with and without sE supplementation are summarized in          Table  The mean levels of LA were lower in both          microsomal and mitochondrial fractions of the tumor the          liver and the colon of mice fed sE than in mice without          the sE That  of  mean values of LA were lower with sE          supplementation indicates a consistent pattern of          membrane LA composition change in the tumor and in the          host tissues Conversely the mean level of DHA was          higher in the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions of          the tumor the liver and the colon of mice fed sE than          in mice without the sE supplement That  of  mean          values of DHA were higher with sE supplementation          indicates a consistent pattern of membrane DHA change in          the tumor and in the host tissues The mean level of AA          in the membrane fractions of the three tissues was not          consistently changed          To further explore the effect of sE supplementation on          membrane fatty acid composition the relative level of          each of the three fatty acids in each fraction of each          tissue was expressed as a ratio of the level with sE          supplement over the level without sE supplement The          results of this exercise are plotted in Fig  The ratio          is consistently lower than unity for LA mean  and          consistently higher than unity for DHA mean  The          mean ratio for AA was near one indicating no significant          difference                          Body weight          Data on change in body weights at two weeks and at six          weeks from the body weight at the start of dietary          intervention are summarized in Table  The mean values          for change in body weights at two or at six weeks are not          significantly different due to diet The body weight loss          observed at six weeks can be attributed to the presence          of the growing tumor                          Blood counts          Results of blood counts as summarized in Table           reveal no significant differences in white cell WBC in          red blood cell RBC or in platelet PLT numbers due to          two weeks of sE supplementation                          Colon histology          Colon crypt height expressed in number of cells from          the crypt base to the crypt mouth was scored as an          indicator of damage attributable to sE supplementation          The crypt column heights number of cells mean  SE          was     for mice without the sE          supplementation and     for mice with the          sE supplementation These means are not significantly          different No histological differences attributable to          the dietary intervention with sE were observed                          Heart histopathology and antioxidant enzyme gene          expression          Histological crosssections of the heart taken          onethird of the distance from the apex were studied for          indications of sideeffects of high dietary levels of sE          Vacuole formation in the cardiac myocytes has been used          as a marker of cardiotoxicity     The mean percent          of cardiac myocytes with one or more vacuoles in the          subendocardial myocytes of the left ventricle was          significantly p   higher in mice fed the sE          supplement Fig  Based on this indication of          cardiotoxicity the remaining portion of the heart that          had been snap frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of          sacrifice was used to look for differences in expression          of antioxidant genes using quantitative RT PCR          methodology          The results of the RT PCR findings are summarized in          Table  Of the antioxidant enzyme mRNAs measured the          only mRNA that differed significantly due to diet was the          inducible form of heme oxygenase which is identical to          heat shock protein  A complete set of data was taken          on each heart which allowed calculation of the ratio of          each antioxidant gene transcript to each of the other          gene transcripts The results of this ratio analysis          reveal that the feeding of sE supplement caused the ratio          of MnSOD over GPX to significantly increase see Table                                    Assay for chromosomal breakage or loss          The presence of one or more micronuclei in peripheral          erythrocytes in mice is an accepted marker of chromosomal          breakage or loss that occurred prior to the extrusion of          the nucleus during erythrocyte differentiation Results          of the scoring of the numbers of peripheral erythrocytes          with and without a micronucleus are summarized in Table           Included in Table are data from mice treated with a          series of injections of doxorubicin Doxorubicin DOX is          a cytotoxic drug with prooxidant properties known to          cause genotoxic damage resulting in an increase in number          of erythrocytes with a micronucleus The results from the          DOX treated mice served as a positive control Results of          statistical analyses demonstrate a significant increase          in erythrocytes with micronuclei due to DOX treatment but          no significant difference due to sE supplementation Note          that the highest mean incidence of micronuclei occurred          in the group of mice fed the sE supplement and treated          with DOX                            Discussion        Vitamin E was established as an essential micronutrient        for proper fetal development    and the amount of        vitamin E required to maintain proper fetal development has        been defined in International Units In addition to its        role in reproduction vitamin E is known to be a        lipidsoluble antioxidant that blocks peroxidation of        polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes and is        known to stabilize biological membranes               Because vitamin E has multiple biological activities it is        best to report dosage in weight units The recommended        dietary allowance and tolerable upper intake limit for sE        the commercially available form has been calculated to be        about  and  mg per day respectively for  kg adult        humans            In animal species oral intake of up to  mgkg body        weight per day was reported not to result in noticeable        side effects     Thus we selected to use a dietary        dose of sE at the level of  mgkg body weight per day in        tumor bearing mice in an attempt to maximize inhibition of        lipid peroxidation in the cellular membranes of the tumor        without an expectation of finding harmful sideeffects        Specifically this experiment was originally designed to        test the hypothesis that DOX a prooxidative cancer        chemotherapeutic drug inhibits tumor growth by increasing        lipid peroxidation products in the tumor to cytostatic or        cytotoxic levels and that suppression of lipid peroxidation        by sE would suppress the antitumor effects of DOX             The results demonstrated that sE supplementation did        markedly suppress DOXinduced lipid peroxidation yet tumor        growth was still suppressed in mice treated with DOX and        sE It was concluded that increased levels of lipid        peroxidation products were not the sole cause of tumor        growth inhibition by DOX As reported here Fig  the        dietary supplementation with this high dose of sE by        itself retarded tumor growth to a significant extent        It is not known how such a high intake of sE works to        suppress tumor growth What is known from the current study        is that the sE supplement reduced lipid peroxidation Fig         and preferentially stabilized membrane polyunsaturated        fatty acids with more double bonds Fig  It has been        proposed that vitamin E may incorporate into cellular        membranes by association of the tocopherol side chain with        the polyenoic fatty acid residues in the membrane fatty        acids      This interaction may stabilize cell        membranes by making highly unsaturated fatty acids less        liable to peroxidation as well as by making highly        unsaturated fatty acids less available for phospholipid        hydrolysis by phospholipase      The latter action        may reduce mobilization of arachidonic acid AA from the        membranes and in this way reduce the amount of AA available        as a substrate to cyclooxygenase andor lipoxygenase to        produce eicosanoids with mitogenic and with inflammatory        properties      Other possible antitumor actions        include induction of apoptosis interference with hormone        production modulation of cellular signaling and gene        transcription and induction of differentiation                       In comparison to the inhibitory effect of vitamin E on        mammary tumor growth this report Cognault et al report        a stimulatory effect of vitamin E on mammary tumor growth        Specifically Cognault et al report that when the diet was        high in omega PUFAs tumor growth was significantly        increased by vitamin E supplementation However when the        diet was relatively low in omega PUFAs the promotional        effect of vitamin E was not observed     It is        noteworthy that the diet used in the presently reported        study was very low in omega PUFAs and that this diet        combined with the high dietary level of sE resulted in        suppression of tumor growth Thus the different results        may be attributable to the type and the amount of omega        polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs in the diet        Evidence for cardiotoxicity as observed in this study        was not expected as supplementation with vitamin E at        extremely high doses gave no significant indications of        harmful sideeffects in animals or in humans             Perhaps vitamin E supplementation acts to inhibit lipid        peroxidation but at the same time acts to down regulate        other protective antioxidant systems as suggested by the        antioxidant enzyme gene expression data in Table  If gene        expression levels in Table reflect antioxidant enzyme        activity then an increase in SOD and decrease in GPX        without an increase in CAT would result in accumulation of        inorganic and organic peroxides and hydroperoxides that can        react with Fe to yield highly reactive free radical        products that can damage cellular proteins and DNA as well        as lipids Likewise the sE supplementation used caused low        expression of the stressinduced isoform of heme oxygenase        HO HO catalyzes the breakdown of prooxidant heme to        biliverdin with release of carbon monoxide and iron ion It        should be realized that these observations are suggestive        of cardiotoxicity but are not definitive        Early studies suggested that vitamin E lessened the        cardiotoxic effects of DOX chemotherapy    whereas        other studies indicate potentiation of DOX induced        cardiotoxicity      Shinoyawa et al    suggest        that vitamin E when combined with DOX may increase levels        of toxic products in the heart and in the tumor while Liu        and Tan    suggest that vitamin E may have prooxidant        properties at high dosage levels        The micronuclei results in Table suggest that while sE        protects against lipid peroxidation it did not protect the        genome of erythroblasts against the prooxidant effects of        DOX in this study Thus while the toxic effect of DOX was        not significantly enhanced by vitamin E supplementation        neither was the toxic effect of DOX lessened by vitamin E        supplementation                    Conclusion        The adage that more is better may not hold true for        vitamin E as there may be beneficial effects at certain        levels but not at high levels Clearly more research is        needed on the antitumor effects of sE but caution is        advised that sE may also have sideeffects in the        heart                    Methods and

     heart was crosscut through the ventricles  of the          distance between the apex and the atrium and then the          apex section was fixed in OmniFix II Mt Vernon NY and          then
