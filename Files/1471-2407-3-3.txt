                    Background        Identification of biomarkers that provide rapid and        accessible readouts of drug exposure activity toxicity or        efficacy is becoming increasingly important in the clinical        development of novel molecularly targeted therapeutics        Surrogate endpoints can be applied in the assessment of        biological activity or clinical responses and perhaps in        selection of patients most likely to respond to therapy        Methodologies for largescale molecular profiling of        disease tissues have been well established      and        have been shown to be of utility both diagnostically           and prognostically     However application of such        approaches in the assessment of changes induced by cancer        therapeutic agents in solid tumors in man has been hindered        by limited accessibility or availability of tumor tissue at        multiple time points during treatment We evaluated the        utility of patients blood cells a readily accessible        source of material for the identification of surrogate        molecular markers of biological activity of SU a small        molecule kinase inhibitor that is a VEGF receptor VEGFR        antagonist with antiangiogenic properties         in vitro and         in vivo             Microarray technologies such as the Affymetrix Genechip        platform facilitate rapid measurement of the expression        levels of thousands of transcripts in a single experiment        and allow comparison of expression patterns across many        samples     Previous reports have described gene        expression profiles in blood that distinguish patients with        relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis    and systemic        lupus erythematosus    from healthy controls We        focused on blood cell samples from oncology clinical trials        that evaluated SU in patients with metastatic        colorectal cancer We reasoned that peripheral blood cells        may serve as a surrogate tissue since VEGF receptors are        expressed in certain blood cell types such as monocytes and        platelets     and thus signal transduction in those        cells may be directly impacted by SU also gene        expression changes in blood cells caused indirectly as a        result of therapyinduced perturbations might also be        detected in this approach        Subjects in the initial investigation were participants        in an openlabel multicenter international Phase III        study in which patients were randomized to be treated with        either the standardofcare FULV chemotherapy control        arm regimen alone or FULV chemotherapy coadministered        with SU treatment arm administered twice weekly via        intravenous infusion at a dose of  mgm for more        detail see      Affymetrix expression profiling        technology was applied to RNA from matched peripheral blood        mononuclear cell PBMC sample pairs before and after        treatment harvested from subjects for assessment of        changes in gene expression that might correlate with SU        administration Here we describe the approach and summarize        key findings from the study as well as some of the        practical challenges that were encountered A set of        transcripts that correlated with administration of the        SU regimen was identified and independently validated        in additional clinical samples discriminant analysis of        change in levels of these transcripts demonstrated their        potential utility in class prediction The implications of        gene expression profiling applications such as this one in        the clinical development of novel molecular therapies are        discussed                    Methods                  Study population          Patient samples were derived from  randomized          openlabel multicenter Phase III clinical trials          comparing standard of care chemotherapy alone or combined          with SU in patients with metastatic colorectal          cancer In both trials SU was delivered twice weekly          at a dose of  mgm via IV infusion In the first          trial designated Trial A the standard of care          chemotherapy consisted of weekly administration of FU          and leucovorin Roswell Park regimen in the second          trial designated Trial B the standard of care          chemotherapy consisted of weekly or biweekly          administration of FU leucovorin and Irinotecan          CPT A total of  pairs of patient samples were          included in Affymetrix microarray expression profiling          analysis  females and  males in the SU treatment          arm and  females and  males in the control arm The          median patient age was  and  years for the SU          treatment arm and control arm respectively For RTPCR          verification experiments samples from  females and           males from the SU treatment arm and  females and           males from the control arm were used The median age          for these patients was  and  years respectively          Clinical response criteria were defined according to          RECIST guidelines briefly complete response CR is          defined as complete disappearance of all measurable and          evaluable clinical evidence of cancer partial response          PR is defined as at least a  reduction in the size          of all measurable tumor areas progressive disease PD          is defined as an increase of  compared to baseline          or best response in the size of all measurable tumor          areas and stable disease SD is defined as neither          sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient          increase to qualify for PD                          Patient samples          All clinical samples for biomarker analysis were          harvested and handled in accordance with full          Institutional Review Boardapproved protocol and study          participants had signed the study informed consent prior          to any studyrelated procedures All blood samples were          collected into Vacutainer tubes containing sodium          heparin Ten ml of blood was withdrawn from patients          prior to receiving any treatment on day  and also prior          to dosing at end of cycle  day  in Trial A day  in          Trial B For PBMC preparations blood samples were          shipped overnight at ambient temperature to a central          processing facility Quest Diagnostics Inc          Collegeville PA USA for PBMC isolation via Ficoll          gradient method     Purified PBMCs were shipped in          RNA lysis buffer Clontech Palo Alto CA USA to SUGEN          where isolation of total RNA was performed For Trial B          whole peripheral blood samples were directly frozen at          the clinical sites and shipped on dry ice to SUGEN for          RNA isolation                          RNA sample processing          Total RNA was purified from PBMC samples using          Clontech Nucleospin RNA II kit reagents Clontech Palo          Alto CA and from whole blood samples using MRC TRI          Reagent BD Molecular Research Center Cincinnati OH          USA an adaptation of the Chomczynski singlestep method              according to the manufacturers instructions          All sample preparations included a treatment with          RNAsefree Dnase RNA yields were measured by UV          absorbance and RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel          electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining for          visualization of ribosomal RNA band integrity                          Affymetrix highdensity oligonucleotide microarray          analysis of PBMC expression profiles          In general the standard RNA processing and          hybridization protocols as recommended by Affymetrix          Santa Clara CA USA were followed in this study these          protocols are available in the Genechip Expression          Analysis Technical Manual Yields of total RNA for PBMC          samples were generally low and for the majority of          patients it was not possible to use the standard amount          of total RNA   g as recommended in the standard          protocol Therefore a double linear amplification          approach    was used in the generation of cRNA for          hybridization In these experiments equal amounts of          starting material were used for pre and posttreatment          samples from each donor typically  g Briefly the          protocol was as follows doublestranded cDNA was          synthesized from total RNA with Invitrogen Life          Technologies SuperScript Choice system reagents          Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA The TdT            oligomer was used for priming          firststrand cDNA synthesis Doublestranded cDNA product          was purified via phenolchloroform extraction and then          used as template in first round of in vitro transcription          IVT of cRNA The IVT reaction was performed with          BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit          Affymetrix according to manufacturers protocol but          with substitution of nonbiotinylated ribonucleotides for          biotinylated ribonucleotides The cRNA product was then          purified with Qiagen spin column cleanup protocol and          used as template in second round of cDNA synthesis This          second round of cDNA synthesis was similar to the first          round except that random hexamers were used in priming of          firststrand synthesis with TdT            oligomer priming the secondstrand          The second round of IVT of cRNA was as in the first round          but with biotinylated ribonucleotides rather than          nonbiotinylated ribonucleotides Purified cRNA was          quantitated chemically fragmented according to          Affymetrix protocol and then hybridized overnight on          Human Genome UA Arrays which contain probe sets for          the detection of approximately  transcripts          Hybridized arrays were washed and stained with          phycoerythrinconjugated streptavidin detection chemistry          in an Affymetrix Fluidics station Images were scanned          with a HewlettPackard GeneArray scanner                          Data Analysis          Data files were generated from scanned array images in          the Affymetrix Microarray Suite Version  program In          this program Average Difference AD values serve as          relative indicators of the expression level of          transcripts represented on the arrays Average Difference          determination relies on difference between          backgroundsubtracted signal from perfect match PM          oligos and corresponding mismatch control MM oligos          within a probe set representing a given transcript To          enable comparison of all hybridization data global          scaling was applied by multiplying the output of each          experiment by a Scaling factor SF to make its average          intensity equal to a userdefined Target Intensity which          was set at  for these experiments For comparisons          between time points from a single patient batch files          were generated with Microarray Suite These files contain          calculated fold change FC values which represent          differential expression between day  compared to          baseline and also Difference Calls DC which represent          a more conservative estimate of differential expression          with qualitative scores assigned to each transcript          measurement according to the following system Increased          I Marginally Increased MI No Change NC          Marginally Decreased MD and Decreased D          Subsequent data analysis was performed primarily with          Spotfire DecisionSite for Functional Genomics software          version package and its Array Explorer component          Spotfire Somerville MA Hierarchical clustering          analysis and statistical comparisons were included in          this step Further refinement of the data including          filtering by Difference Call scores was done with the          Microsoft Access  database analysis program                          SYBR Green quantitative RTPCR verification of          array results          Primers were designed with Primer Express  software          Applied Biosystems In all cases primers were designed          to bind within the sequence represented by Affymetrix          probe sets target sequence information available at          httpwwwaffymetrixcomanalysisindexaffx Total RNA          samples  g were reverse transcribed to yield          firststrand cDNA using the Applied Biosystems Reverse          Transcription Reagents protocol Applied Biosystems          Foster City CA USA The reverse transcription          reactions were then diluted  in distilled H            O SYBR Green PCR reactions were          performed in well optical plates and run in an ABI          PRISM  Sequence Detection System SDS machine For          individual reactions  l of each sample were combined          with  l of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix Applied          Biosystems containing the appropriate primer pair at           nM Data were extracted and amplification plots generated          with ABI SDS software All amplifications were done in          duplicate and threshold cycle C           t  scores were averaged for          subsequent calculations of relative expression values          The C           t scores represent the cycle number at          which fluorescence signal R           n  crosses an arbitrary          userdefined threshold Heat dissociation curve          analysis was performed after each SYBR Green run as a          test of whether a single product had been generated in          each PCR reaction multiple peaks in the dissociation          curves are indicative of multiple PCR products and thus          reduced specificity and sensitivity                          Quantitation and statistical analysis of SYBR Green          RTPCR data          The C           t scores for genes of interest for          each sample were normalized against C           t scores for the corresponding          endogenous control gene which was the glucuronidase          GUS gene Relative expression for day  compared to          day  was determined by the following calculation as          described in the Applied Biosytems users bulletin on          Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression and in                       Rel Exp   Ct          Where  C           t  Ct           Target  Ct           GUS

     the SU treatment and the standard of care control          arms The MannWhitney U Test with a critical alpha level          of  was used for statistical significance Individual          genes observed to be significantly different by          Affymetrix analysis and in both sets of SYBR Green RTPCR          experiments were screened as potential biomarker          candidates This subset of potential biomarker candidates          was tested subsequently for utility as class predictors          to discriminate between the SU and the standard of          care arms Discriminant analysis     a multivariate          statistical technique was used for this purpose The          genes were tested individually using all possible          combinations and by reducing dimensions Principal          Component Analysis in order to determine the subset of          genes predictor variables that yielded highest          classification accuracy Crossvalidation was used to          test the robustness of classification accuracy Results          from three different crossvalidations were evaluated to          select the best set of predictor biomarkers           jackknife method dropping one case at a time           randomly splitting the pooled data into two halves          prediction for building model and validation for          testing model sets and  using one trial as          prediction and the second trial as validation sets          respectively All statistical analyses were carried out          after naturallog transformation of the data SYSTAT           SPSS Inc Chicago IL USA software was used in          statistical analysis                            Results                  Affymetrix expression profiling of pre and          posttreatment matched PBMC samples          Total RNA was isolated from PBMC prepared from          patients blood samples taken before predose day  and          after predose day  administration of SU or          corresponding control regimen in a Phase III trial          designated as Trial A Due to typically low RNA yields          many sample pairs were of insufficient quality for          further use failure rate of at least  of  samples or           of sample pairs Only sample pairs in which both day           and day  samples RNA yields were of  g or greater          were used in expression profiling analysis Samples were          hybridized to UA highdensity oligonucleotide arrays A          total of  sample pairs from the SU treatment arm          and  from the control arm were analyzed in the primary          dataset The change in expression ratio of day           measurements to day  for each patient as calculated by          Affymetrix software was defined for each transcript          these are referred to as fold change FC values The FC          values for the  cases were analyzed with Spotfire          Decision Site software tools to compare patients in the          SU arm and control arm          A ttest analysis was used to identify transcripts          that were statistically significantly different between          the two treatment arms Over  genes with pvalues less          than  were identified however because there are          over  transcripts measured on the UA arrays some          of the genes would potentially be identified by chance          To further refine this subset of genes queries based on          Difference Call DC status were performed Difference          Calls offer a more stringent but nonnumerical measure of          differential expression and are derived from a decision          matrix that weighs comparison results from four metrics          used in the Affymetrix analysis platform The data were          filtered to identify genes that were Increased I or          Decreased D in a majority of the SU arm cases but          not in the control arm A group of  genes that          frequently showed increased expression was identified          Figure displays a schema of the DC scores assigned to          each gene for each patient sample pair all cases from          the SU arm show induction in at least  of the           genes Table lists the number of cases in each arm in          which an Increased call was assigned and includes a          brief description of putative functions of the gene          products The average fold change of all of these          transcripts was higher in the SU arm the lowest          average fold change was  for hypothetical protein          FLJ the highest was  for lactoferrin the range          of fold changes was also broader in this category          presumably reflecting variability among patients                          Quantitative RTPCR validation of differentially          expressed transcripts          A subset of these transcripts was chosen for          validation by quantitative RTPCR qRTPCR analysis          Primer sets were designed for  of the  genes matrix          metalloproteinase MMP thrombospondin TSP          CD defensin  lipocalin LNC and lactoferrrin          see Table  These  genes were chosen based on          potential functions of encoded proteins in the cases of          thromobospondin  and MMP these have known roles in          angiogenesis      or because of the extent of          differential regulation between treatment arms Also the          lipocalin gene LCN has been reported to be inducible          by dexamethasone in murine cells     dexamethasone          is one of the premedications administered to patients in          the SU arm          SYBR Green RTPCR was used to validate the microarray          expression profiling data SYBR Green is a dye that          fluoresces when bound to doublestranded DNA thus signal          is directly proportional to the amount of product formed          during PCR amplification      This method allows          rapid and inexpensive comparison of gene expression          across a large number of samples The qRTPCR validation          was performed with a total of  sample pairs  of which          had previously been analyzed on Affymetrix UA arrays          and thus allowed a direct comparison of the          correlationbetween the  transcript profiling methods          Data for each gene was normalized to expression of a          housekeeping gene glucuronidase GUS Direct          comparison of SYBR Green RTPCR results and Affymetrix          results from the same RNA samples n   day day           pairs showed an overall qualitative agreement ie          same trend of induction or no change detected by both          methods for each target of  as  of  comparisons          were concordant This number may be an underestimate          since results for one patient were inconsistent for all           transcripts          Figure summarizes the results from the RTPCR          validation and compares them to those from Affymetrix          analysis MannWhitney U test comparison of SU and          control results from both analyses indicates that three          of the six genes displayed statistical significance          pvalues less than  based on the SYBR Green RTPCR          data Table  these are CD lactoferrin and LCN          MMP exhibited a pvalue that was close to the          significance cutoff and thus was also selected for          further analysis Defensin  and TSP were not pursued          further Thus four of the six initial transcripts          selected from Affymetrix expression profiling were          confirmed as differentially expressed using a PCRbased          approach in a larger sample set from the same clinical          trial                          Quantitative RTPCR validation of differentially          expressed transcripts with samples from a second Phase          III SU trial          To further confirm these transcripts as potential          biomarkers of SU administration SYBR Green RTPCR          analysis was carried out in samples from a second Phase          III trial using SU Trial B This trial was also a          randomized metastatic colorectal cancer study comparing          a new chemotherapy standard of care FUleucovorinCPT              to standard of care plus SU RNA was          isolated from patients peripheral blood samples rather          than PBMC harvested at the beginning predose day           and end day  of cycle  In order to test if similar          gene expression changes occurred analysis was performed          on  sample pairs  from SU treatment arm and           from control arm          Figure summarizes the overall frequency of induction          of fold or greater in each arm of the trial It is          clear that these transcripts are more frequently induced          at day  of treatment in the SU arm than in the          control arm This is supported by statistical analysis          as indicated in results of the MannWhitney U Test Table           A visual representation of hierarchical clustering          analysis of the qRTPCR relative expression values from          both trials for the each of the transcripts is displayed          in Figure  This clustering pattern displays the          distinction between the SU and control arms based on          relative expression data and also indicates further          distinctions among subsets of patients as well as the          degree of overlap between trial arms in the clustering          pattern The extent of similarity between the relative          expression patterns for each transcript represented in          columns is also indicated the pattern of MMP is          distinct from the others as it appears in a separate          branch in the dendrogram structure A

 expression data from these samples could be used in a          predictive fashion to classify samples to the appropriate          trial arm In order to assess this discriminant analysis             of the RTPCR data was performed The relative          expression values from both trials were combined into a          single dataset and then natural logtransformed to reduce          the scale of the values making control and treated arms          more comparable When the cases were pooled n   and          subjected to classification prediction the overall          accuracy of assignment to the appropriate trial arm was           when lactoferrin CD and LCN were used as the          predictor gene set inclusion of MMP slightly reduced          the accuracy of crossvalidation Further          crossvalidation was performed by the jackknife method          which does a series of predictions randomly removing           case from the total each time and by splitting the data          set into  random halves one a training set and the          other a testing set          The results from each of these steps are summarized in          Table for a set of  of the  transcripts that gave the          best accuracy percentage As indicated it is predicted          that expression data from these  genes would accurately          distinguish SU arm patients from control arm in           to  of cases As a further test the dataset from the          first clinical trial was used as the training set and          the set from the second as the testing set as opposed          to pooling the two trials and randomly selecting cases          In this scenario the accuracy in crossvalidation was           and  for the training and testing set          respectively This suggests that results derived from one          trial might be applied prospectively in analysis of          subsequent similar trials                            Discussion        Largescale gene expression analysis was applied to        blood RNA samples from a clinical trial of the signal        transduction inhibitor SU to investigate changes in        gene expression that might correlate with exposure to this        experimental cancer therapy A set of  transcripts CD        lactoferrin LCN and MMP was identified whose        expression was significantly induced at the end of one        treatment cycle relative to baseline following SU        administration Discriminant analysis indicated that        changes in expression of these transcripts predicted the        trial arm to which a patient belonged with accuracy as high        as         This work represents a novel approach to clinical        biomarker discovery wherein expression profiling of        patients blood cell RNA is utilized as a surrogate readout        of dynamic changes occurring in patients bearing solid        tumors A recent report describes an expression profiling        approach as applied to bone marrow samples before and after        treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI in        patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia     This        work clearly demonstrates utility of the approach in        investigation of drugresistance development in        hematological malignancies However extending similar        approaches to solid tumor oncology is technically and        clinically challenging due to relative inaccessibility of        tumor tissue and difficulties in obtaining samples at        multiple time points In our investigation a relatively        small number of transcript level changes were identified        that were specific to patients receiving an SU dosing        regimen and  of these were independently verified in a        larger sample set Interindividual variation and        heterogeneity of response are two variables that have        likely impacted this dataset and it is possible that a        greater number of statistically significant changes might        be observed if a larger group of patients were used in the        initial Affymetrix analysis Further inclusion of more        than a single sampling timepoint after initiation of        treatment would also likely be informative in future        studies and presumably provide a window to more acute        physiological changes triggered by drug exposure Also a        relatively stringent criterion for significance  the        Affymetrix Difference Call  was used in the selection of        transcripts that were expressed differently in each trial        arm Mining the dataset with other analytical approaches        might lead to a different set of potential biomarkers        However it is worth noting that we have retrospectively        applied Significance Analysis of Microarrays or SAM           to the Affymetrix dataset  of the  most significant        genes identified by that method were among the  that were        verified by RTPCR LCN CD and lactoferrin with        MMP ranked sixteenth All of the transcripts listed in        Table were included among the  most significant with        the exception of thrombospondin ranked  th        Independent quantitative RTPCR verification of initial        array hybridization results was performed on larger sample        populations obtained from two conceptually similar Phase        III clinical trials that used SU Further exploration        of the differential expression data for these  transcripts        suggests that differences in expression are relatively        robust and adequate to allow classification of patients        into appropriate arms of the trial with an expected        accuracy of greater than  It must be stressed that the        subject population size in this qRTPCR study is not large        n   however the results are encouraging given the        challenges of working with samples from these two large        multicenter clinical trials        These four transcripts are considered to be biomarkers        of the SU administration regimen rather than activity        of SU specifically with the available samples we could        not exclude the possibility that altered gene expression        resulted from exposure to the administration vehicle        Cremophor or the concomitant premedications        dexamethasone and H and Hblocker antihistamines        rather than SU The mouse homologue of one of the        candidate biomarkers LNC has been shown to be regulated        at the transcriptional level by dexamethasone in murine        cells     However there is no published evidence that        the human LCN gene is likewise dexamethasoneinducible        and there is no description of glucocorticoidresponsive        elements in the  regulatory region of the human LCN gene            Further preliminary investigation in our        laboratory using         in vitro cultures of purified PBMCs        from healthy volunteers indicates that neither the LCN        gene nor any of the other  transcripts is directly        inducible by acute treatment with either SU or        dexamethasone data not shown The biological connection        between expression of these four transcripts and this        therapy regimen remains to be further elucidated However        the fact that SU is an inhibitor of VEGFmediated        angiogenesis may be of relevance to the expression of MMP        mRNA as the gene encodes a wellcharacterized enzyme with        roles in angiogenesis and tissue remodeling Also        noteworthy is a report describing bovine lactoferrin as an        inhibitor of VEGFmediated angiogenesis in a rat model            Intriguingly a recent report has identified a high        molecular weight urinary MMP to be a complex of MMP and        LCN herein referred to as neutrophil        gelatinaseassociated lipocalin or NGAL proteins            Such urinary MMP complexes have been described as useful        markers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis The relevance        of the MMPNGAL protein complex to the observed changes        in the levels of their transcripts in blood cells remains        to be determined        Investigation of expression patterns of these four genes        in samples from clinical trials designed to test other        angiogenesis inhibitors will allow further examination of        their validity as biomarkers of mechanism or drug exposure        This approach may also be useful in the identification of        biomarkers of clinical response Our initial analysis has        not yielded a definitive set of gene expression changes in        PBMC samples that are correlated with objective response        at end of first cycle this may be related to a limited        sample size or features of the specific trial design and        patient population Also as previously discussed it may        be essential to profile samples harvested at multiple time        points during the course of therapy in order to fully        capture the variability and extent of dynamic responses        specific to a given therapy However the methodology will        be applied to subsequent clinical trials involving other        antiangiogenesis agents and molecularly targeted        therapeutics        Additionally and importantly improvements in reagents        available for storage and purification of RNA from clinical        blood samples should also enhance quality of specimens        especially in cases where specimens are initially harvested        at multiple clinical sites the recently introduced PAXgene        blood RNA stabilization reagent is an example of such        improvement     The analysis of whole blood rather        than purified PBMC as surrogate specimens in future studies        may also minimize variations due to sample handling and        processing Nevertheless the results described here        demonstrate that human blood samples can serve as surrogate        specimens for biomarker investigations in cancer patients        and imply that largescale gene expression analysis may be        a useful approach for characterization of drug activity        from clinical trial samples This expression profiling        approach might also both lead to and be enhanced by        improvements in oncology trial design such as more        rational and tailored selection of indications or        individuals that are most likely to be responsive to a        given molecularly targeted therapy                    Conclusions        Largescale gene expression profiling has been applied        to peripheral blood cells harvested before and after        treatment from patients participating in a Phase III        clinical trial of SU Four transcripts were identified        as potential biomarkers of SU administration and        verified using a qRTPCR approach Discriminant analysis        indicated that expression profiles of these transcripts        could be used to predict the trial arm to which patients        belonged These results suggest that expression profiling        of peripheral blood cells is a valid surrogate approach for        biomarker discovery in oncology clinical trials                    Competing interests        All authors are employed by SUGEN Inc
