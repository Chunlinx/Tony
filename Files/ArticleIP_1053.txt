                                 Taxing the Internet            Virtually every type ofcommerce in the United States is subject to some form of taxation at thefederal state or local level The Internet industry made up of Internetservice providers and online service providers along with companies that dobusiness over the Internet is no exception Yet the fast growth ofelectronic commerce  and the novel properties of the industry posespecial problems for tax authorities            Thefederal government worries that the Internet could become a global haven formoney launderers and tax evaders  States and localities worry thatincreasing use of the Internet will erode their tax bases as consumers andbusinesses shop and do business outside of their taxing jurisdictions Whilethey are anxious to develop more sources of revenue and expand their tax basesthey also realize that unilateral efforts to collect from the industry maysimply drive the easily moved online operations over the state line Notsurprisingly the Internet industry opposes any new taxes on its burgeoningcommerce Major online retailers and service providers however recognize thatthere is no case for exempting Internet sales and perhaps services from thesame tax laws that apply to offline commerce But they are especially concernedwith developing uniform consistent and fair tax treatment by state and localauthorities Multiple taxation is seen as a particular threat            Who has responsibility for taxing Internet commerceAs the Internet grows and changes how is existing tax law being applied Whatcan and should be taxedgoods and services sold over the Internet Onlineservices themselves And by what levels of government These taxing questionsare likely to keep accountants lawyers and internationaltrade consultants inBMWs for years            Estimatedrevenues from the Internet are not hugeso far But predictions of wheretheyre going are very big According to industry research subscription andadvertising revenues from Internet and online services were as much as billion in  and may top  billion by the year  Advertising revenuesalone made up  million last year but not surprisingly this representedless than  percent of the ad money spent on other media            Online sales of products over the Internetamounted to approximately  million less than  percent of all mailordersales Forrester Research predicts this number will reach  billion by but that would still amount to only  percent of all predicted mailordersales But as more consumers become familiar with online commerce they mayvery well begin to shop for products over the Internet precisely to avoidstate and local sales taxes             Taxingonline sales of mailed products is one obvious revenue opportunity underexisting tax law The easy analogy here is to catalog sales although thesetoo have posed problems for state and local authorities If you buy a pair ofboots from LL Beans catalog the company must charge you sales tax if youlive in Maine or any other state where it maintains a place of business Bythe same token if you decide to use your computer to buy say a fiveliterbottle of  Napa Valley cabernet for  from Virtual Vineyard the samerule applies Virtual Vineyards location or nexus in taxspeak is PaloAlto so unless youre having the wine sent to a California address therewill be no sales tax            But the situation is different in practice if notprinciple in the case of products delivered over the Internet Establishing nexus can be a tricky issue for example when its a case ofcontentsuch as newspapers magazines books videos music or computersoftwarebeing downloaded The seller may have no idea of the buyerslocation and hence whether sales tax is due though new software packagesbeing developed for online commerce may help remedy this But the location ofthe seller may be even tougher to determine            As notedabove a seller must collect sales tax from a buyer if the seller has asignificant physical presence  in the same jurisdiction where the buyertakes delivery Suppose for example that the content in question is beingsold by an online service such as America Online the Microsoft Networkor any of a myriad of smaller services Where does that service do businessMost online service providers operate PointofPresence POP locations thatallow subscribers to log on to the Internet using a local phone number Thesetypically consist of a leased room with modems and routing equipment Alreadysome states have argued that POPs constitute sufficient physical presence fortaxing purposes But the  US Supreme Court case Quill vs NorthDakota would seem to defeat such an argument The Quill ruling protectssellers of tangible personal property from state taxation if their contactswithin the state are limited to mailorder catalogs telephone or theInternet            And what if the content is being sold by aseparate vendor through an online service Some states argue thattaxable nexus can be established if a vendor operates over an online orInternet service with substantial physical presence within the state Thisopens up a whole new basis for taxation opposed by the industry and unlikely tobe upheld by the courts After all to return to our catalog analogy if LLBean uses UPS to deliver its boots that doesnt expose the sale to taxation inevery state where UPS operates And even if states can win the nexus argumentin court Internet providers are likely to flee to more taxfriendlyjurisdictions thus forcing angry subscribers to incur longdistance phonecharges for online access            Inaddition to sales taxes  states also impose some form of tax on Internetand online services or activities These include Pennsylvania ConnecticutMassachusetts Nebraska Tennessee Ohio and Texas Many cities are doing thesame Officials in Fort Collins Colo decided last year that Internetproviders were subject to a city sales tax on telephone service and thatsubscribers would have to pay a  percent sales tax on top of their monthlyaccess fee The industry argues that it is not comparable to the heavilytaxed telecommunications industry and that such efforts result in doubletaxationsince service providers already pay taxes on phoneline usageaswell as for Internet vendors Again as in the case of wine sales states havetaxing jurisdiction over transactions only if the seller has sufficientphysical presence in the state            Tax authorities are further threatened by the growing useof electronic money  Ecash can be used to facilitate a host of illegalbusinesses including drug transactions thereby eliminating the need forsuitcases full of  bills It could also swell the underground economy aspeople use it to pay for services facilitating the avoidance of federal incometax            Another dicey issueconfronting Treasury Department enforcement officials is Internetgambling  Although federal law prohibits gambling by wire in the UnitedStates and most authorities interpret that to mean that Internet gambling isillegal here at least one online casino Casino Royale looks and feels like avirtual gambling emporium Sen Jon Kyl RAriz has just introduced a billto ban online gambling            Recognizing that the Internet effectively wipes out national borders andfearing that the development of new technologies may be impeded by inconsistenttax policies the federal government has been studying the issue ofinternational tariffs on Internet transactions At this point nocountries have imposed tariffs or other taxes on online commerce but at leasta dozen are considering them This is a big area of concern for theadministration since the United States exports  billion in servicesannually including software entertainment and information products andprofessional services            The Clinton administrations position isthat the Internet should be a federal dutyfree zone In releasing a draftreport on the subject Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Weabsolutely reject the idea that the Internet is some sort of golden goose whosefeathers should be taxed The key message of the report is no Internet taxesThis does not mean however that the federal government supports abolition ofany taxes on Internet commerce only that it plans no new taxes at thistime The Treasury report itself stresses that in principle the tax codeshould treat Internet transactions exactly like other channels of commerce            On March  Sen Ron WydenDOre and Rep Christopher Cox RCalif introduced the Internet TaxFreedom Act  The bill would impose an indefinite moratorium on state andlocal taxes on electronic commerce though it would exempt certain taxesincluding most sales taxes that are already in place The bill also calls onthe administration to develop a comprehensive plan to address the issue and toseek bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that make all Internetactivity internationally free of taxes tariffs and trade barriers            The administration isalready working with the World Trade Organization and otherinternational trade groups on uniform rules for taxation of electroniccommerce Meanwhile there are tricky aspects to assessing taxes under currentinternational tax treaties including  identifying the country or countrieswith authority to tax  classifying the type of income arising from thetransaction eg royalties sales of goods or services  tracingtransactions handled with electronic money and  identifying parties totransactions and verifying records In addition some countries imposequotas on content such as books movies music and software fromabroad but the origin of that content can be tough to trace in the thin air ofcyberspace
