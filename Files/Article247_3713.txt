                                 We Cant Make Japan Fix Its Economy                        Theres something almost comical about the recent frustration over the Bankof Japans refusal to take action to lower the value of the yen which hassoared in the past month against the rest of the worlds currencies includingmost obviously the dollar The kind of action the bank would have to take toweaken the yen after all is precisely the kind of action it would have totake to jumpstart the Japanese economy And if it wasnt going to take actionto do the latter its hard to see why we should it expect to act to do theformer            The impact on a countrys economy of the value of its currency is ofcourse very complicated primarily because any country is made up both ofconsumers who like it when the currency is strong making imported goodscheap and producers who like it when the currency is weaker making theirexports more affordable But former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin always saidsimply that a strong dollar was in the best interests of the United States soyoure probably pretty safe to leave it at that            But that doesnt mean that the United States needs to be too obsessed withthe recent fall of the dollar against the yen In the first place currencymarkets are markets  which means that they will occasionally overreactas currency traders seem to have done to the news that the Japanese economyactually grew in the last quarter albeit at a minuscule rate In the secondplace the dollar has remained strong against the worlds other majorcurrencies So concerns that a weak dollar will spark inflationary pressuresare overplayed            The Japanese on the other hand have reason to worry about the yensbecoming too strong when their economy is still barely limping along Much ofJapans industrial production remains concentrated in export industries and atoostrong yen will hurt them At the same time it might be tempting forJapanese leaders to see the value of the yen as a referendum on their economyIf they do thatll hold back the kinds of changes Japan needs            The best chance the bank has of lowering the value of the yenand it wouldbe only a chancewould be to effectively print a lot of new currency Itcant act to manipulate interest rates since rates are already near zeroThis would of course have an inflationary impact But as Ive said herebefore and as                   Slates Paul Krugman has said many times beforethat would not be a bad thing Japan remains caught in a liquidity trap whichmeans that even though money is effectively free people are not using it toinvest or spend One way of encouraging them to do so is to make the cost ofnot spending higher than the cost of saving which is to say making acommitment to inflation            For all this though we need to stop expecting the Bank of Japan to stepin It is not interested in taking action either to spark growth or drive downthe yen The bank takes its devotion to inflationfighting very seriously andit does not believe the admittedly heretical view that sometimes a littleinflation is not a bad thing So if the United States is counting on the bankto help save the dollar it should stop and look to something else Maybe wecould worry about the trade deficit
