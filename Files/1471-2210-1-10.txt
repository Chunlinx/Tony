                    Background        High levels of serum cholesterol and low density        lipoprotein LDL have been associated with the genesis of        atherosclerosis a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases        that affect a large number of people all over the world It        has become clear that the pathological conditions        associated with an excess level of LDL are actually caused        by the oxidized products of LDL     More specifically        cholesterol oxides also termed oxysterols the oxygenated        derivatives of cholesterol appear to be the major        cytotoxic components in oxidized LDL      These        compounds have a hydroxyl or a keto group on the        cholesterol molecule Examples of cholesterol oxides        include OH keto OH OH and        OHcholesterol see    for a recent review        Tissue damage caused by cholesterol oxides has been the        subject of many studies Cholesterol oxides are cytotoxic        to a variety of cell types     These compounds can        damage endothelial cells smooth muscle cells and        fibroblasts all of which are major components of the        arterial wall Cholesterol oxides are also toxic to cells        derived from the immune system such as macrophages        thymocytes lymphoma cells and leukemic Tcells        Pharmacological agents capable of reducing cholesterol        oxide toxicity are yet to be discovered        The mode of cell death caused by cholesterol oxides has        generated much interest recently There is evidence showing        that programmed cell death PCD also known as apoptosis        occurs in some cells treated with cholesterol oxides              PCD is a special type of cell death that can be        induced by growth factor deprivation or toxins              By using the PCD induced by nerve growth factor        deprivation in sympathetic neurons as an example the cell        death process begins with the generation of reactive oxygen        species followed by a significant decrease in glucose        uptake RNA and protein synthesis activation of the        immediate early protein cjun and release of cytochrome c        from mitochondria Cell death is executed by the activation        of a family of proteases termed caspases Morphologically        cells dying of PCD appear atrophic and exhibit condensed        nuclei which can be stained with nuclear stains        bisbenzimide or propidium iodide or by the TUNEL assay        DNA extracted from cells dying of PCD is often fragmented        and shows a characteristic laddertype pattern on the        agarose gel upon electrophoresis        MAP kinases MitogenActivated Protein kinases have        very important roles in PCD The MAP kinase pathway        consists of  major parallel pathways designated as the ERK        p Extracellular signalRegulated Kinase SAPKJNK        p StressActivated Protein Kinase cJun NHterminal        Kinase and p pathways       Activation of each        pathway above involves phosphorylation of a number of        upstream and downstream family members of the pathway        During growth factor deprivation induced PCD in neuronal        PC cells there is a sustained activation of the JNK and        p pathways while the activities of ERK pathway is        inhibited It was proposed that a dynamic balance of        JNKp and ERK can determine if the neuronal cell will        live or die     Similar interplay of the MAP kinases        was shown in the PCD of nonneuronal cells     It is        known that oxidized LDL can cause activation of MAP kinases             Whether cholesterol oxides the main toxic        components in oxidized LDL can induce MAP kinase        activation and whether MAP kinase activation has a role in        cholesterol oxide induced PCD remain to be investigated        and is the subject of this study        Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors PPARs        belong to a group of nuclear receptors which includes        steroid retinoid thyroid hormone receptors and others              There are three types of PPARs PPAR is found        predominantly in the liver heart kidney brown adipose        and stomach mucosa and is important for lipid catabolism        PPAR is found in adipose tissues and is important for        adipogenesis PPAR is found in most tissues but its role        is less welldefined        PPAR is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions    and        is important in the process of atherogenesis Depending on        the experimental system and the particular question asked        PPAR can be involved with proatherogenesis or        antiatherogenesis For example PPAR is involved in a        positive feedback mechanism that induces the formation of        foam cells     On the other hand activation of PPAR        was shown to inhibit monocyte    and macrophage           inflammatory responses by preventing the activation of        nuclear transcription factors such as NFkB nuclear        factorkappa B AP activator protein and STAT         signal transducer and activator of transcription  Since        inflammation plays an important role in atherogenesis this        antiinflammatory effect of PPAR should help to reduce the        risk of atherogenesis Development of PPAR agonists that        retain the antiatherogenic activity but dismiss the        proatherogenic activities will be of great value                   Many naturally occurring or synthetic compounds are        agonists for the PPARs      For example a number of        prostaglandins are agonists for PPAR  The prostaglandin        deoxydelta  PGJ          dPGJ           is the most potent endogenous PPAR        agonist known On the other hand many synthetic compounds        such as the nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs        are PPAR and PPAR agonists     Since these are        agents used clinically for other purposes it is important        to determine whether interaction of these agents with PPARs        could modulate atherogenesis in a positive or negative        manner        While most research regarding cholesterol oxides are        focused on the cardiovascular system it should be noted        that the nervous tissue has the ability to generate        cholesterol oxides which may exert toxic effect on cells        and tissues of the nervous system For example it has been        shown that synaptosomes and mitochondria prepared from CNS        tissue can convert cholesterol to cholesterol oxides which        may play an important role in brain tissue damage during        oxidative stress     Consistent with this notion we        have shown cholesterol oxides are toxic to neuronal PC        cells     and neurons derived from sympathetic        ganglia     retina    and cerebellum            Microglia in the central nervous system express        scavenger receptors and are involved in the oxidized LDL        uptake and metabolism     These cells are thus the        macrophageequivalent in the central nervous system            Results from this laboratory showed that cholesterol        oxides can cause programmed cell death in microglia            which suggests that microglia similar to macrophages can        be a potential target for oxidized LDL toxicity        Based on the observations that  cholesterol oxides        cause PCD but the involvement of MAP kinases remains to be        investigated  PPARs are important in atherosclerosis but        the effect of PPAR activation on cholesterol oxide induced        PCD has not been determined this study was designed to        test if a dysregulation of MAP kinases was associated with        the cholesterol oxide induced PCD and to determine if PPAR        activation could modulate the cholesterol oxide induced        PCD                    Results                  Cytotoxicity of OHcholesterol toward          microglia          A set of dose and timeresponse experiments indicated          that   and  M OHcholesterol treatment for one          day reduced the viability to   and  of controls          respectively Fig  This agent at  M reduced the          viability to  of controls after a day treatment In          contrast OHcholesterol was much less toxic to          microglia such that this agent at  M showed little          toxicity to the cells after a day treatment Fig  A          day treatment of the cells with  M          OHcholesterol reduced the viability to  of          controls These results confirmed and extended those          obtained from our previous study                              Activation of cjun as a result of          OHcholesterol treatment          Because cjun was shown to play important roles in          programmed cell death in many cell types      and          microglia were shown to undergo programmed cell death          after cholesterol oxide treatment     experiments          were performed to determine if cjun activation was          involved in cholesterol oxide induced microglial cell          death Cells were treated with  M OHcholesterol or          OHcholesterol for  hours then processed for          Western blot analyses Antibodies against cjun          phosphocjun at position serine  or ERK  an          antibody which can recognize both ERK  and ERK  were          used in this set of experiments Results indicated that          both cholesterol oxides caused an increase in cjun in          microglia with OHcholesterol showing a more          pronounced increase Fig  Furthermore          OHcholesterol caused the phosphorylation of cjun a          phenomenon not observed in OHcholesterol treated          microglia The levels of ERK  were not altered by          either treatment These results suggested that cjun          activation was associated with the toxicity of          cholesterol oxides          A set of experiments was performed to determine any          dosedependent change in cjun activation by          OHcholesterol Microglia were treated with               or  M OHcholesterol for  hours then          processed for Western blot analysis Results indicated          that OHcholesterol treatment led to an increase in          cjun and phosphocjun at serine  The levels of ERK           were not altered by this treatment Fig                           Timedependent change of MAP kinase          activities          Further studies were performed to determine the effect          of OHcholesterol on different members of MAP kinases          The timedependent change in cjun ERK and p levels          was determined Cells were treated with  M          OHcholesterol for     or  hours then          processed for Western blot analyses Results indicated          that there was an increase in cjun after          OHcholesterol treatment between  hours of          treatment This protein dropped to a nondetectable level          at  hours after treatment In addition there was an          increase in the levels of phosphocjun on the serine          residues at both position  and position  The          levels of JNK JNK  and JNK  however were not          altered Fig           The levels of ERK were similar during the first           hours then dropped between  hours after treatment          The levels of phosphoERK increased between  hours          after treatment then decreased to a nondetectable level          afterwards Fig  This decrease in phosphoERK          expression occurred at a time coincided with the          appearance of phosphocjun The changes in p or          phosphop levels were minimal Fig                           Modulation of cjun activation by PPAR          agonists          It was reported that PPAR activation could          downregulate the activity of AP by interfering with          the functions of cjun      Therefore the          following set of experiments was designed to test if PPAR          activation could reduce cjun activation in          OHcholesterol treated microglia PPAR agonists          including the prostaglandin dPGJ             and two nonsteroid          antiinflammatory drugs indomethacin and ibuprofen were          tested in this series of experiments Cells were treated          with  M OHcholesterol together with these PPAR          agonists for  hours then processed for Western blot          analyses Antibodies against cjun phosphocjun at          serine  and ERK  were used in this set of          experiments Results indicated that while          OHcholesterol induced the expression of cjun and          phosphocjun these PPAR agonists reduced the expression          to various degrees The apparent potency to reduce          phosphocjun among the three agents tested was dPGJ             indomethacin  ibuprofen          Fig  These results indicated that while dPGJ            was very effective in inhibiting          cjun activation ibuprofen appeared to be ineffective in          this regard                          PPAR agonists attenuate cholesterol oxide induced          cytotoxicity in microglia          Since PPAR agonists appeared to reduce the cjun          activation caused by OHcholesterol treatment the          following experiment was designed to test if these agents          could reduce OHcholesterol induced cytotoxicity          Cells were treated with  M OHcholesterol together          with PPAR agonists to be tested for  days then the          viability of each treatment was determined Results          indicated that dPGJ            could prevent OHcholesterol          induced cell death in a dosedependent manner While          treatment of the cells with  M OHcholesterol          reduced the cell viability to  of controls addition          of     or  M dPGJ            raised the viabilities to              or  respectively Fig  The rescue by  M          and  M dPGJ            was statistically significant p            This agent at concentrations above  M was          toxic to microglia The solvent for dPGJ             methylacetate was without any          rescue effect          Indomethacin also prevented OHcholesterol induced          cell death in a dosedependent manner Fig  This          agent at    or  M raised the viability          from  to    or  of controls respectively          A further increase in indomethacin to  M did not          increase cell viability The rescue by  M          indomethacin was statistically significant p            Ibuprofen on the other hand had little rescue          effect even at  M Fig  It is important to note          that this agent also had no inhibitory effect on cjun          activation Fig           While dPGJ            is considered to be a PPAR agonist          indomethacin and ibuprofen can activate both PPAR and          PPAR     The following experiment was conducted to          determine if a pure PPAR agonist WY could          modulate the OHcholesterol induced cytotoxicity          Results indicated that this agent was without rescue          effect at   or  M At  M WY raised the          viability from  to  of controls The difference          was statistically significant p   No further          increase in viability could be achieved by this agent          Fig           Since OHcholesterol induced an alteration of          phosphoERK  during the first  hours of treatment          Fig  an experiment was performed to test if          inhibition of ERK pathways could affect OHcholesterol          induced cell death Microglia were treated with  M          OHcholesterol together with  M AG ERK          inhibitor PD MEK inhibitor an upstream member          in the ERK pathway for  days then the viability of          each treatment was determined Results indicated that          neither of the pharmacological agents tested had any          rescue effect toward OHcholesterol induced          cytotoxicity Similarly the p pathway inhibitor          SB had no rescue effect under the same          experimental conditions results not shown                            Discussion        Cholesterol oxides are formed in cholesterolcontaining        food powdered milk cheese egg products during storage            or during cholesterol catabolism in animals            The level of cholesterol oxide in meat product increases        significantly during the cooking process     Animals        can take up cholesterol oxides in a way similar to the        absorption of cholesterol Cholesterol oxides given        exogenously can be cleared from plasma rapidly and be        widely redistributed in different parts of the body            Cholesterol oxides and authentic cholesterol are        transported within the cell by a similar mechanism but the        transport is more efficient for cholesterol oxides            High levels of cholesterol oxides have been observed in        hypercholesterolemic animals For example the plasma level        of OHcholesterol increases from  M to approximately         M in rabbits fed with high cholesterol diet for         weeks            Cholesterol oxide treatment can lead to alterations of        cellular functions These compounds can activate some        nuclear receptors including steroidogenic factor            and LXR which may be partially responsible for their        biological activities      Cholesterol oxides are        inhibitors of HMGCoA reductase the key enzyme of        cholesterol biosynthesis pathway     The ability to        bind to an intracellular receptor oxysterol binding        protein may be responsible for their inhibition of        cholesterol biosynthesis      It should be noted        that addition of cholesterol does not prevent cholesterol        oxide induced cell death which leads to the suggestion        that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis is not the cause        of cholesterol oxide induced PCD      The critical        events that result in cholesterol oxide induced        cytotoxicity remain to be determined        Results from this study indicated that OHcholesterol        was very cytotoxic to microglia such that a day        treatment with  M OHcholesterol reduced cell        viability to  of controls In contrast        OHcholesterol was much less toxic to microglia Fig          Selective toxicity of cholesterol oxides toward a        particular cell type was also observed in our previous        studies        Further experiments with Western        blot analyses indicated that the cytotoxicity of        cholesterol oxides was associated with their abilities to        cause cjun activation as evidenced by the increase in        activated cjun ie phosphocjun in OHcholesterol        treated cells but not in OHcholesterol treated cells        Fig  There was a dosedependent increase in cjun        activation in cells treated with OHcholesterol Fig                It has been suggested that a dysregulation of MAP        kinases is responsible for the growth factor deprivation           or chemotherapeutic agent    induced PCD        Consistent with this idea results from this study suggest        that an unfavorable balance of the JNK and ERK causes the        cell death observed in cholesterol oxide treated microglia        Cells treated with OHcholesterol showed a        timedependent increase in cjun protein as well as        phosphocjun Fig  This cjun activation was apparent        at  hours after treatment In contrast OHcholesterol        caused a slight initial increase in phosphoERK which        decreased to a nondetectable level  hours after        treatment The change in p and phosphop on the other        hand was not as apparent It was reported that rabbits fed        with highcholesterol diet exhibited high JNK protein        levels and JNK activity in their atherosclerotic lesions        and oxidized LDL caused JNK activation in cultured smooth        muscle cells     Based on this study there is a        possibility that cholesterol oxides in oxidized LDL were        responsible for those previous observations        Activation of the JNK pathway can lead to the        phosphorylation of downstream members including cjun that        belongs to the AP transcription factor family             Because results from this study indicated that JNK pathway        was activated by OHcholesterol one could expect that        AP would be activated in cells treated with cholesterol        oxides Consistent with this idea it was shown that LDL        could induce AP activity in endothelial cells    and        cholesterol oxide treatment could lead to increased AP        DNA binding activity and AP dependent transcription in        other cell types      Results from this study thus        complemented and extended the findings of those        reports        The PPAR agonist dPGJ           functions as a general inhibitor of        microglial functions       For example this agent        inhibits the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase        tumor necrosis factor interleukin  and major        histocompatibility complex class II in activated microglia        Inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of        transcription  STAT and the nuclear factor kB NFkB        may be partially responsible for the inhibitory effects        Results from this study further indicated that PPAR        agonists could reduce cjun activation Fig  Given the        suggestion that an upregulation of cjun is a cause of PCD             a reduction in cjun activation by PPAR        agonists should attenuate OHcholesterol induced        cytotoxicity Consistent with this idea results from this        study indicated that dPGJ           indomethacin and WY could        attenuate the cytotoxicity caused by OHcholesterol to        various degrees Fig    Since the protective        effect of WY could be observed only at concentrations        higher than  M there is a possibility that this agent        acted on the PPAR receptor to achieve the protection        Similar protective roles of PPAR agonists have been shown        in other nervous tissues For example PPAR agonists were        shown to protect cytokineinduced PCD in cerebellar granule        cells     These agents could also block the neurotoxic        effects caused by amyloid activated microglia and thus        might be beneficial in the treatment of Alzheimers disease            In nonneuronal tissues PPAR activation was        shown to suppress both spontaneous rat hepatocyte PCD and        the PCD induced by transforming growth factor                               Conclusions        Treatment of microglia with OHcholesterol caused an        induction of cjun phosphocjun and a reduction in        cellular viability PPAR agonists reduced the        OHcholesterol induced cjun activation and attenuated        the cytotoxicity This group of compounds may be useful in        future development of pharmacological agents against        cholesterol oxide induced cytotoxicity                    Materials and methods                  Cell culture          The N murine microglia cell line was a gift kindly          provided by Dr P RicciardiCastagnoli     This          cell line has been used extensively as a model for          microglia       These cells were derived by          immortalization of day

medium was removed after          treatment then  l MTT solution  gml prepared          in MEM was added to each well The cultures were          incubated at C for one hour in a tissue culture          incubator The MTT solution was then removed and the          cells in each well were lysed by the addition of  l          dimethly sulfoxide The plate was placed on a shaker for          one hour at room temperature to complete the lysing          process then the optical density of each well was          measured by a well plate reader with a filter setting          at  nm reference filter
