                                 The Inscrutable Value of AOL Time Warner                        One of the more telling things about the complexity of AOLs acquisition ofTime Warner is the simple fact that no one seemed able to agree on just howmuch the deal was worth Consider            According to AOLcom yesterday it was a  billion deal            I wrote yesterday that it was  billion            And TheStreetcom first said the deal was worth  billion go figurethen came around and by the end of the day said it was worth  billion            According to the New York Post today it was  billion            But todays Wall Street Journal said no it was  billion You haveto love the  part of that            Todays New York Times thought it was  billion            Part of the confusion stems from the fact that its an allstock plusdebtassumption deal so that as AOLs stock price fluctuates so does the sizeof the deal But the confusion also stems from uncertainty about how manyshares Time Warner has outstanding the lack of a collar and a generalvagueness about how AOL and Time Warner decided on how big the new companywould be            The right way to calculate the deals value by the way is to multiply theprice of AOLs stock by  multiply that by the number of Time Warner sharesand add  billion I think            The confusion isnt overwhelmingly important of course But the idea thatsomehow it doesnt really make a difference whether AOL is paying  or billion for Time Warner is wrong and seems emblematic of the fawning embraceof this deal by the press Though not by Wall Street Just because its instock doesnt make it less real Eleven billion dollars in shareholder value is billion
