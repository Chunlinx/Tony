                                 Re Is Clinton the Devil Or just his good friend                        Katha            Actually I do think that Clintons inability to take responsibility foranything is far deeper than Reagans I remember that broadcast where RRfinally said that although his heart told him he didnt exchange arms forhostages the evidence proved that he had There He did admit it I dontthink Reagan was deeply involved in the armsforhostages process either Inbroader areas Reagan clearly stood for thingsanticommunism forexampleand stuck to his guns so to speak He remained answerable for theresults Clinton has stood for very little and what little he has stood for hehas slithered away from at every opportunity if it meant any cost or painEven Bush was bettera war he could have lost a defensible taxhike he paidfor dearly There was risk because there was a small degree of conviction WithClinton there is no conviction no risk no reward            So I think people are genuinely uneasy with Clintons character Im uneasywith it because it goes against the values I was brought up with you tell thetruth stick to your principles and face the consequences of your actions Hedoes none of this from petty obstruction of justice to bigissue betrayals Ithink some conservatives are uneasy with him for the reasons you cite andbecause they associate him with the boomer generation whose moral andpsychological grip on reality is famously suspect I dont think theyrejealous The Bubba vote actually rallied round Clinton once he became arecognizable redneck philanderer rather than a liberal pinko sleaze As toHillary she is of a piece with Bill in my book whatever David Brocksays            bestAndrew            ps Oh and talking about responsibility a hilarious I suppose momentthis weekend which reminded me of our chat last week Walking down th Streeton Saturday I was greeted by a May Day Communist march About  people redflags slogans about the working class and a sstyle poster of StalinMost people laughed at it but I was stunned at how many of the marchers wereunder  One teenager seriously explained to me that the Ukrainians starvedthemselves Yes I know these people are representative of nothing But Iwonder what our response would be if a group of young Nazis walked down thestreet with swastika flags pictures of Hitler and claims that the Jews ofEurope never perished Would we smile indulgently Has our moral sensibilitybecome sadly dependent on identity politics Im not saying of course that weshould pay less attention to Hitlers evil merely that we need to pay more toStalins One generation has already clearly forgotten
