        um i would take it that you probably read quite a bit if you picked this category   okay yeah well i picked every almost every category well they said you well they said pick fifteen categories and there wasnt really all that much i was into i mean im interest interest of course i do read a lot but thats uh   oh youll talk about anything right       but i i also picked gardening and  i mean i tried to talk about that for five minutes i dont really garden very much  but books i could talk about you know forever i     uh me too what kind of books do you read   well mostly fiction and um i i the nonfiction i like are are the usually the crime stories   i see   see and um   were gonna get along well  well i like fiction uh matter of fact well my favorite would be horror type stories such as Stephen King and such   oh you too oh see now i dont like i dont like those types i i cant relate to stuff like that its so weird you know its     that thats why i read it because i dont have to relate to it   i yeah well i like uh i i like a book i could in some way relate to and and thats i dont know its so off the wall most of that stuff you know you really i you cant really believe it i mean you its hard to to to read it and and really think that this could really happen its its i dont know its not believable to me at all   well thank goodness  believe me   well well thats true i mean you dont have to read a book and believe that you know stuff can happen but i dont know i guess i just go more for realism     have you read The Firm   oh yeah its very good   oh that was one of the best books ive read for a long time   yeah yeah that was good i read that oh quite a while ago   and um see another one i just read that i thought was really excellent was uh Jurassic Park   oh by um oh  Crichton right Crichton now now what is that about is that uh an espionage thing   Michael Crichton or something like that have you read that one no its about um this multimillionaire that has decided that he wants to start a theme park and its about dinosaurs well theyve taken DNA material from dinosaurs and and   oh   really recreated dinosaurs   uhhuh   and well its a little far fetched also but um it was really an excellent book it held my interest have you read any of his other things   yeah yeah yes i have but i  Terminal Man was that was that one of his   Terminal Man yeah ive seen seems like ive seen the movie   he he writes stuff his writing books are similar to Robin Cooks have you read any Robin Cook   ive read a couple of Robin Cooks   yeah and theyre sort of similar you know the in the you know he deals a lot in you know scientific stuff or you know stuff that um you dont know whether could it could happen or not you know its just um   umhum   you know but i mean most of it is good i uh havent uh i havent read anything by him in a long time   well i noticed he had a couple i dont know how recent they are but i think Sphere was one and something else uh another one word title and i thought i might pick up one of those books because   Fear is that what you said Fear   Sphere S P H E R E   oh oh no i dont know im not familiar with that no   well how about did you read Silence of the Lambs   oh oh yes  oh yes you did you read his other one The Red Dragon yes now uh both of them were terrific   yes i did they were uh Silence of the Lambs though was i i could not put the book down i   well see now i couldnt either now i uh a friend of mine started to read it because you know i told her its terrific and everybody shed spoke to said it was terrific she couldnt get into it   youre kidding   well shes sort of a lightweight anyway you know her her uh her reading consists of uh have you ever heard of V C Andrews     oh yes   yeah  you know stuff like that you know Danielle Steele you know you know stuff like that so she really she couldnt get into this but she i think she said she saw the movie she liked the movie i dont you know   i see the movie was wonderful you didnt see it   yeah the movie was good but i well you know compared to the book right no   well true it didnt have the impact but i thought that they stayed uh they stayed very faithful to the book   well they did but um i dont think it was as scary as i expected it to be i i really you know i i dont know i just didnt think it was as suspenseful as as i expected it to be i dont know but it was a good it was a good movie   well its hard to top that book   yeah well thats true and im waiting his new one comes out sometime in the spring i think   oh really whats it about have you another serial killer   yes uh probably another murder thing you know thats usually what he you know well this thisll be i think his fourth or fifth book and the other the previous ones were murder um the he wrote also Black Sunday which was a about the uh bombing in the in the Superdome oh it was oh and they made a movie out of that   oh Two Minute Warning   um gee i dont know i think it was called Black Sunday it was about fifteen well no about ten years ago i guess it uh you know   you know i think youre right i think i   but um   ill have to look back and see what else hes written because he   thats all hes written Red Dragon  that one and uh Silence of the   really
