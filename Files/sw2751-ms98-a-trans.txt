        okay what did you buy   okay a Ford Explorer a a Ford Explorer   im sorry what oh really   yeah one of the new ones   yeah   and um id id probably buy another this is the first American vehicle ive owned so i would probably purchase another one   uhhuh   um i would be more selective in the dealership that i purchased it from but as far as uh the quality seems to be there um its quiet its it handles well um   yeah   but i believe id get that or a Porsche one of the two   oh really   no not     um if i had the money i think i would love to own a a BMW   and why would that be   i dont know i from what or either that or Mercedes just because theyre put together so well it seems like they last forever   whats wrong with the Volvo   oh i dont know theyre theyre not as nice looking   oh   oh  uh meant to me i dont know im sure there are some that are but everyone ive seen is kind of plain but   what what what city are you calling from   Sherman   oh   wherere you     im Dallas um   Dallas       yeah   BMW or Mercedes yeah well thats uh thats um   if i had money um had the money i mean thats just i know i never would own one but uh i dont know i like my actual favorite cars is were uh like the Ford Thunderbirds of nineteen eighty five i really like that style body style   umhum   but i dont own one of those neither   what do you presently drive   um Mercury Topaz   um fun   cheap taste cheap taste in cars okay     well there nothing wrong with those uh   yeah theyre all right its its a good car i mean ive never had any problem with it   theyre theyre nice vehicles theyre nice vehicles nothing wrong with those it um   its just everybody has their own taste but man the Mercedes are expensive my wife has a Volvo and it its nice i mean you know its okay an     sorry i roped on Volvos then   huh     sorry i roped on Volvos then   oh no no no no no no no it it i i kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the GL rather than the DL but because they it is the safest car on the road um oh yeah     oh is it see i dont much about them i guess   yeah theyre the safest thats the reason why we mainly got it we got white and its the safest four door and its good for if you have a family which we do we just we just dominated everyone out and so its its uh um   yeah   you know theyre kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer you know i presently i used to have a two eighty Z and im a tall guy and and uh theyre hard to get around in traffic to see because you cant see a car ahead of you but theyre fast as lightning and all that crap but the Explorer i mean youre sitting up on top of everything and you can really see real well and i just its its so comfortable and   really uhhuh   and uh so youre what are your feelings about American versus European cars   um i like anything besides Japanese course everything has Japanese parts in them anymore i dont like Japanese cars but uh   why not   European i dont have have any i mean those are the kind i usually end up liking the most American cars a lot of people say they they dont last long but ive never had any problem with um my Mercury or my Cougar my husband has a uh Cougar and hes never had any problem with it either so i dont know   thats the way it goes i guess           well what are your i guess this is your first time to buy American so   yeah i was real hesitant but it was   yeah   i dont know uh i mean i think European cars are great course youve got to have metric wrenches and stuff and theyre easy some some of them are easy to work on a Volvo being a four cylinder is very easy to work on uh excellent warranty i mean just unbelievable warranty   really   and and uh course Ford isnt too bad i think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle uh but all of it has to do in my opinion with the service and the attitude of the service of the dealership   yeah yeah   i wouldnt send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford theres Middlekauff Ford in Plano   where okay   their just their attitude is just slimy and and uh ive written a a letter to Middlekauff and ive told them that matter of fact i got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division theyre still concerned about my attitude and it it will never change about that place and uh       but uh anyway thats my own personal comment i guess but   yeah this girl that works for me just bought a car down there and she they they had a problem with they uh took their Camaro in to get it traded and they they hadnt signed any papers and they had all ready uh taken it in to paint it and everything and everything was stolen out of it and the people um wouldnt reimburse reimburse them for anything   Middlekauff wouldnt she needs to find herself a lawyer shed shed come out like a champ on that one   yeah so ive heard some stuff about them but um   so have have you been using well anyway   what   that was i was asking you some questions about the telephone and how long and how many have you been doing but thats they they dont want to hear that but   oh just just about a week   is that all a week   yeah yeah   good Lord i think i started in January or February oh God ive im like twenty some phone calls   so really oh wow   thats why i i wasnt sure if this was the second time around or what well look ive enjoyed speaking with you   yeah you too   and keep smiling   okay thanks bye   bye bye
