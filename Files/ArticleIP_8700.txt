                                 Eyes on the Prize            These days studios areinordinately attentive to my viewing habits As a member of the NationalSociety of Film Critics which votes a slate of yearend prizes Im fieldingcalls from eager publicists who want to make sure Ive seen all thoseawardworthy movies featuring all those awardworthy performances Ive triedto stay mum so as to keep my voting options open but its hard for a guybrimming with opinions to be circumspect Beloved  A worthy effortOprah Worthiness incarnate I feel unworthy even to sit in judgment MerylStreep in Dancing at Lughnasa  Ian McKellen in Gods and Monsters Leonardo DiCaprio in Celebrity  Damn worthy actors I enthused aboutDiCaprio when the sour Celebrity opened the New York Film Festival inSeptember since it shows up in theaters this week you might want to clickhere sothat I dont have to quote myself            Streepshould be awarded a rubber chicken for irradiating us with her yokel devotionin One True Thing  but in Dancing at Lughnasa she goes along way toward winning back her good well pretty good name As Kate Mundythe stickinthemud schoolteacher who presides over four younger unmarriedsisters in  Donegal Ireland she holds her facial muscles tense andsignals with her eyes her exhaustion from keeping them so fiercely in place Itis a terrible responsibility upholding her societys values and preventing hersiblings and Michael the illegitimate son of her youngest sister ChristinaCatherine McCormack from descending into chaos and impoverishment Not tomention the fact that shes regarded by all as a stupid gooseor as they callher in town mocking her sexlessness the gander            Streeps performance is layered and compelling but thefilm doesnt click Closely based on Brian Friels play it wilts intranslation the way Friels potent but static dramas always do On stage everycharacter every prop every interjection has a precise symbolic function onfilm those elements no longer stand out in relief In Dancing atLughnasa its pronounced LOOnassa the sisters reside in a sterile andrepressive Irelandbut one in which the pagan past continues to bubble upmost visibly in the harvest feast of Lughnasa when peasants take to the hillsto build fires drink to even greater excess than usual and danceorgiastically The rite is liberating but also frightening Remove a cork froma bottle so pressurized and the contents are apt to explode            The storynarrated by the nowgrown Michael in the shopworn manner of The GlassMenagerie  is set in motion by the return of the boys Uncle Jack MichaelGambon from Africa where he has toiled as a missionary priest Delusionalbarely remembering his English Jack becomes a rambling and to the localpriest horrific spokesman for paganism encouraging all his sisters toemulate Christina and have children of love            There isnt much else in the way of a plotKates position at the school which is overseen by the local priest isimperiled by the subversive presence of her brother Michaels handsome dadRhys Ifans roars back on a motorcycle to flirt with marriage to ChristinaWill he stay or go fight the Fascists in Spain Each sister chafes in her ownway under Kates oppressive ruleespecially Rose Sophie Thompson thesimple one who might or might not be having an affair with a man whose wifeand children have abandoned him for London A weaving factory is opening nearbyand threatens the household income In venerable Chekhovian fashion whathappens on the surface only hints at the titanic plates that shift beneath butthe actressesespecially Streep Thompson Kathy Burke and Brid Brennanaresupreme at conveying whats at stake They create an indelibly gloweringensemble            So whyisnt Dancing at Lughnasa more involving Its probably because thedirector Pat OConnor cant tell the difference between images that expressFriels themes and Hibernian wallpaper and because his idea of expansivepictorial beauty proves no substitute for Friels powerfully compressed stagepictures In the theater the radio that crackles on and off signals a worldelsewhere and when its repaired and the stage is flooded with music and thesistersbeaten down confronted with only the grimmest of economic and socialprospectsbegin to dance and then lose themselves in the freedom of the dancethe moment is truly cathartic Onscreen it means the movies almost over            People think Im kidding when I say that my favorite filmis The Bride of Frankenstein  but I cant imagine how Id havesurvived an especially grisly puberty without the comfort of watching BorisKarloff express his anguish to an uncomprehending world through a misshapenbody and halting language Few films have ever offered so inspired a blend ofsentimentality Grand Guignol horror and sophisticated camp or suchdeliriously inventive laboratory bricabrac The films director James Whalehas long been venerated for this and other droll s entertainments amongthem The Old Dark House  and The Invisible Man Lately he has also been scrutinized for being openly homosexual in an era whengay directors such as George Cukor kept that part of their lives rigidlycompartmentalized But not even David Ehrenstein in his trenchantly gossipy newbook on the Hollywood closet Open Secret  wants to make the case thatWhale was penalized for his sexual preferences If anything the director seemsto have suffered from a surfeit of dignity proving too proud to overcome theloss of a powerful patron and a couple of ambitious flops Comfortably rich hetook to painting and traveling before a series of strokes drove him to drownhimself in his swimming poola suicide though that fact was concealed fromthe public for  years                           Gods and Monsters based on Father of Frankenstein  a novel by Christopher Bram exploresthe last days of the director Ian McKellen through the prism of a fictionalfriendship with a handsome muscular and heterosexual groundskeeper BooneBrendan Fraser Critics have been unanimous in predicting statuettes inMcKellens future Why The movie is psychologically thin artistically flabbyand symbolically opaque Whales Frankenstein films werent personaltestaments but in Gods and Monsters theyre raided for murky fantasysequences In one the groundskeeper is the monster staggering around withWhale in his arms in another Whale is laid out on a laboratory slab beingoperated on by the groundskeeper Whats the metaphor The script meanwhileis the stuff of bad two character plays with spurious excuses for conflictBoone storms out when Whale speaks tenderly of the naked young men who oncepopulated his pool and a long climactic monologue about a fictional wartimetrauma that ostensibly shocked Whale into keeping his past under wraps InBrams novel Boone is vaguely dangerous a plausible suspect in Whales deathbut Fraser plays him ingratiatingly as a lovable lunk and the conceptionremoves whatever tension the material might have had            As WhaleMcKellen wears his elegance lightly His face is fascinatingly two tiered leanin long shot in closeup its features distend to the point of acromegaly themouth going slack with lust But Whales plangent ruminations are slack aswell Ive spent much of my life outrunning the past and now it floods allover he tells Boone in what is surely the most generic line for a memoryplay ever written Something about your face makes me want to tell thetruth All this mawkishness would likely have annoyed the real Whale whoexited the world on his own terms and steered clear in his art ofbanality            Waking Ned Devine is this years stab at The FullMonty  which made more than  million and even snagged an Oscarnomination Set in a quaint olde Irish seacoast village it tells the story ofan elderly lottery player Jackie OShea Ian Bannen who learns that one ofhis fiftyodd neighbors holds the winning ticket to a  million pound drawingBy a process of elimination he and his buddy Michael OSullivan David Kellyend up at the remote stone house of Ned Devinewhom they find dead in hisarmchair with the ticket between his fingers the shock of his windfall havingfelled him As Devine has no living relations it makes sense for theimpoverished old men to cook up a scheme by which Michael will assume the deadfishermans identity and the pair will divide the money betweenthemselves            It was no surprise to readthat Kirk Jones the films writer and director doesnt hail from a small townin the Irish Republic or anywhere close He makes TV commercials in LondonDeciding hed like to make an eccentric regional comedy with universal themeshe journeyed to a village in Ireland set himself up in the pub and took noteson what he saw and heard Then he wrote a script thats one part Bill ForsythsLocal Hero  one part Preston Sturges Christmas in July and about five parts synthetic whimsy            The movieis a passable entertainmentcall it The Half Monty  It has standardissue but funny farcical sight gags and a score of panpipes to provide therequisite undercurrent of Celtic melancholy Theres a witchy Margaret Hamiltontype Eileen Dromey who rides some sort of electric wheelchair and attempts tospoil the whole caper Theres also a stock ingnue Susan Lynch who loves thetowns endearing pig farmer James Nesbitt but wont marry him because hesmells so badand Im not oversimplifying Waking Ned Devine might havebeen a snooze if Jones hadnt stocked it with a slew of old actors withmagically livedin visages The owlish Bannen can twinkle without lookingdeartheres something saturnine in that face As his Ed Nortonish sidekickKelly walks offor rather rides offwith the picture his skeletal frameplanted buck naked on a motorcycle as he rushes to reach Devines house beforethe man from the lottery I see a future for elderly male actors willing toshed their clothes for laughs but I dont see myself in the audience            The term slice of life has come to mean drearynaturalism but for the superb Richard LaGravenese who wrote and directedLiving Out Loud  that slice includes fantasy fairy tale connectionssultry musical interludes bridges that lead out and bridges that leadnowhere The movie one of the years most pleasant surprises is theantithesis of Todd Solondzs Happiness  a humanists answer to Solondzsevident conviction that life is all dead ends When her cardiologist husbandMartin Donovan leaves her Judith Nelson Holly Hunter goes out into theworld her pain making her receptive to everything and everyonefrom theelevator man Danny DeVito who returns her friendship with uninvitedamorousness to the torch singer Queen Latifah who takes her to afterhoursclubs where she dances ecstatically with young women Living Out Loudbecomes an ode to openness to letting in everything that the world throws atyou The movie made me remember why I like Holly Hunter I dont alwaysremember Her delivery isnt moistits prickly and blunt and she can jabberconvincingly so that the jabbering takes on a life of its own and leaves hersometimes horrified in the dust I might even vote for her
