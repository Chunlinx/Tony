                it seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution   yeah   and i can very clearly remember ten years ago i was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and and exploring trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful and we did end up with uh IBM PCs which i now would not have chosen but that was before the Macintosh   really yeah   and twenty years ago i was uh in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on on a manual typewriter   oh i know it     so i would say thats one of the largest changes in at least in my life   yeah ive ive seen that just in the last um even five years how much theyve increased uh increased in use or probably eight years when i was a freshman in college   uhhuh   uh my degree was in computer uh technology originally and it seemed like it would they were just getting out with the you know the disks and all that getting away with the cards   umhum   you know doing away with the the programming cards and uh   right yeah thirty years ago i i had a college job uh working as a programmer and we had to write code in binary and uh  have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which i dont think exist anymore you never see one of those punch cards anymore   i know no um i think TV has a lot to do with the changes too dont you in like peoples attitudes   well very possibly uh im not sure in the last ten years its been very different from before uh certainly in the last thirty i would say there have been significant changes even even the change from black and white to color television thirty years ago i guess there were color TVs but i sure didnt have access to one   yeah oh   and uh by twenty years ago practically everybody had a color TV and now i think theyre as almost as many well there are more TVs than households so   yeah   its close to getting uh one TV per person they say   and now everybody uh has VCRs and two or three VCRs   umhum   and that kind of thing   yeah certainly ten years ago uh VCRs were just coming on the market so thats made a significant difference in the way i watch television for instance because uh now i almost never watch a TV program when its on   yeah i know   i tape it and then watch it when its convenient and that way i dont have to worry about being interrupted i can just put it on pause   yeah and you can you can flip through the commercials so you dont have to watch the commercials   right yeah   thats always hassle convenient   umhum yes you can watch a program in forty five minutes instead of an hour you skip the commercials   uhhuh so what was their question about decline in sociological   wasnt the decline so much i think they just said the changes in uh social social changes in the United States   yeah   how was life different ten twenty or thirty years ago so   well   it   i cant really remember back that far but  ten years ago um i dont know id say like in the nineteen seventies you remember how kids would walk around with AM what do you call those little AM radios and now people have jam box with CD players in them you know   yes yes thats certainly a difference   and hand held TVs and car phones   yeah thats another one yeah car phones is a good point and uh cellular phones of all types and beepers uh ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center and i had to carry a beeper around and they were   yeah   kind of bulky and all they did was just uh make a beep noise and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call   uhhuh   these days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of two or three pencils and they fit in your shirt pocket and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a a phone number to respond to and   those are cool   yeah those are pretty neat and they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off in a theatre or something and you can still get your messages   yeah yeah   but lets see social changes uh   where do you think its where do you think its going to go in twenty years   i havent the slightest idea i was just thinking though about a a a huge social change in the last ten years is AIDS   yeah   it was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago i i know that because i was writing a a paper about it   umhum   i was writing a a journal article uh and they still didnt even know what caused it or anything uh there was a suspicion that it was a virus but nobody had identified it and they were really just going on epidemiological uh   wow umhum   uh guesswork uh because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like uh hepatitis and then   yeah   from from the spread pattern of hepatitis they could work backwards to the transmission by uh blood and semen and then i   im curious what was your uh graduate study in   well i was i was in English as a matter of fact and medieval studies   oh wow uhhuh   uh but i went to work as an editor and writer so uh uh uh uh ten years ago i was working in the medical center uh publishing a journal and writing about medical topics   yeah     and lets see twenty years ago i guess were were just beginning to get into what they were calling the uh the sex revolution where uh after the pill and uh uh   yeah   freed people up from worries about uh illegitimate pregnancy and i guess in the seventies is the the time when that was supposed to have exploded thirty years ago there was no pill   umhum do you think thats caused a lot of pressure on like younger kids today to make choices that they probably shouldnt have to make   yep i do i really do i have uh   yeah   four kids in college right now children and stepchildren and i know that the expectation for them was uh to have sex and uh much earlier than the expectation when i was in college   umhum   in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be sleeping with their boyfriends   yeah yeah yeah   but they certainly didnt expect everybody to and it was really only uh acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in in the relatively near future   umhum   and i certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays   oh yeah its kind of scary when i think of what will happen in twenty years you know when i have kids and theyre grown and um just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more so seems like it cant get much worse   and i guess the answer is is stay flexible because nobody can predict whats going to happen in twenty years i certainly wouldnt have been able to twenty years ago tell you what uh my kids were likely to be like course one of them was just a a an   yeah   a brand new baby twenty years ago so i sure wouldnt have been able to predict   umhum   for him   hm   and some of the other ones werent born   yeah so sounds like Americas going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and   yeah   worldwide communication and   electronic mail i just got on that this past about a year ago and thats made a difference in the way i do my job because its so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things   yeah   even when theyre another on another continent   yeah   its pretty wild   yeah and even you know that reminds me Federal Express was around ten years ago but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency   uhhuh   and nowadays people use Fed Ex all the time   yeah sure do huh   people do seem to travel more its much more common for people even teenagers to be going to Europe and South America and Asia uh   yeah   i was almost thirty before i got off this continent and uh both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school   yeah       yeah i know thats what uh what my family was talking when i picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana and they were like well you know twenty thirty years ago we wouldnt have done that you know   umhum   and uh especially come home every couple months   yeah   you know and
