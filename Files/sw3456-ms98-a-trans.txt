        now were ready  yeah i had a      there we go okay   a family reunion this past year first time in many many years and   uhhuh   and i had uh three of my sisters there with their family and we all got together in Gatlinburg Tennessee and   oh great oh   spent the week there up in the mountains and rented a little little house little house and   how nice   sort of visited and got to know each other we hadnt been been around each other for quite a while over the years so it really was sort of nice   oh well that is nice was it was it awkward at first or did it work out fairly fairly good   well it worked out fairly well you know as a kid i dont know about yourself but we used to have big reunions and it was so nice and   yes uhhuh   you know its just something that you dont do anymore and uh we had such a good time that   right umhum   that were already deciding to have one in two years say in Disney World or somewhere in Florida just get together and   oh great uhhuh   just something you need to make time for   now are you from from quite a ways away from each other so that you dont see each other real often   yes we are  were sort of uh were in Texas and i have sisters in North Carolina West Virginia Virginia Florida everywhere  Georgia   oh oh yes   so we dont get to see each other very often   oh yes okay well we have um several different reunions when i was like you say when i was growing up we had a lot of family reunions and they were the extent of the cousins and you know relatives and greataunts and and uncles and um those have dwindled down to just we go to one a year we have one at Christmas time and its my fathers family and   sure well thats great   yes it is and it and these are people that we see you know just once maybe twice a year   uhhuh   and we get together then and have a Christmas party and and you know have a dinner and a program and renew acquaintances and um and then in the summer on my moms side of the family we we go camping up in up in the mountains like you mentioned yes it is its fun   well thats neat which you in a great area for it   yes we are theres lots of lots of nice places to go and i know some families have a real formal type thing where they send out the letters and um  assignments and have parts on the programs and quilt drawings and stuff we we dont do anything that big you know   uh i admire people do that but were just not that well organized and you know everyones heading different directions so its very hard to get together     yes yes that is in fact i in a in a magazine id read an article about different ways to plan a family family reunion and you know if you had a real big like you say a real big organization and a lot of a lot of planning went into it that would that would be great but we tend to stick to the call each other and you know that we plan on those two that i mentioned every year for sure but   sure thats the important thing just the important thing is to do it   yeah thats right   and thats great   thats right because you you do you forget the the cousins i have uh they grow up and change and you know you wouldnt even recognize them sometimes other than these these times that you get together   oh you bet   so do you have any with your extended family or is it mostly your your sisters and   mostly my sisters and brothers right now but as far as cousins we we havent done that like i said before its God in just forever i dont know how wed ever get all of our cousins together you know   umhum uhhuh yeah   its like its like high school reunion high school and college reunions uh i didnt go im i just turned fifty years old recently and   uhhuh   didnt go to many reunions until i hit my twentieth i believe and of course i havent missed one since then because its just so enjoyable   oh oh yeah   you get to see all your old friends and whats going on and its just a its a neat deal i look i look forward to them   uhhuh boy ill say yeah so do you when you have your when you got together with your sisters last year did was there a lot of catching up to do   oh yes   a lot of changes that had happened since the last time   yeah kids kids getting older getting married and graduating high school and college and whatever   umhum oh   just lots of things to catch up on and and we spent that time to do that   uhhuh did you get take your kids with you or was it the adults   no this was this was just for the big guys just for the parents   oh how fun oh thats fun   it was sort of neat though in fact we uh we had a little rule that we would we would not take the kids with us this time but all of our kids are a little older so   oh uhhuh that that makes a big difference   yes all of our kids are in a middle and high school and college so and married so   uhhuh oh   so we just all got together and it was sort of neat   that is that is thats its a fun thing to do and i think its important that we keep doing that because everybody is so busy you lose you lose you lose touch and you lose ties   you bet because my mother and dad both were there so it really paid off   oh were they   yeah it was neat and and and her four kids were there and their spouses so it worked out real well   oh well great boy ill say yes i my brothers are scattered all around too and thats you know   are they   yes theyre  theyre all over the place
