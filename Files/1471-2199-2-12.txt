                    Background        The cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p Kipplays an        important role in regulating cell cycle progression by        inhibiting the cyclinCdk complexes responsible for        promoting the transition from Gphase to Sphase             In normal cells p Kiplevels are high in GO and decrease        rapidly in late G allowing entry into Sphase             p Kiphas also been implicated as playing a role in tumor        formation and progression         p Kipknockout mice display        internal organ hyperplasia and are highly prone to        pituitary adenomas       In human cancers such as        breast     prostate     colorectal     and        others low levels of p Kipexpression correlate with        decreased survival rates Since mutations of the         p Kipgene are rare in cancer cells            loss of p Kipmust involve changes in the        mechanisms that control its expression        Changes in the levels of cellular p Kipare regulated        by multiple mechanisms In general transcriptional control        of the         p Kipgene is believed to play a        minor role in regulating p Kipexpression However        recent reports indicate that transcription of the         p Kipgene can be activated by        neuronal differentiation     treatment with vitamin D             interferon and cytokines       and        exposure to hypoxic conditions    or xenobiotics            Transcription of the         p Kipgene can be negatively        regulated by growth factors    and by cMyc            Some of the growth factor and cytokine effects on         p Kiptranscription may be mediated        by the forkhead family of transcription factors that appear        to be regulated downstream of the phosphatidylinositol        kinase signaling pathway        The use of        alternative promoters leading to multiple transcription        start sites as reported here suggests an additional type        of transcriptional control        Posttranscriptional controls appear to be the major        regulatory mechanisms that determine the levels of p        Kipin the cell     These include ubiquitination and        proteasomal degradation    and sequestration and        mislocalization    of the p Kipprotein In addition        changes in the rate of         p KipmRNA translation have been        shown to be important in regulating cellular p        Kiplevels The rate of         p KipmRNA translation is higher in        quiescent cells than in growth factor stimulated cells            p Kiptranslation is also enhanced during        differentiation of HL cells            Recent studies have shown that elements within the         untranslated region          UTR  of the         p KipmRNA are able to enhance        translational efficiency     and several proteins        that bind to the          UTR have been identified     The        mouse         p Kip         UTR has recently been shown to be        able to mediate capindependent initiation of translation            In addition a Urich element within the         p Kip         UTR may be involved in regulating         p KipmRNA stability            Together these findings clearly demonstrate the importance        of the          UTR in controlling cellular p        Kiplevels However from the work published to date it is        not clear what sequences constitute the full         p Kip         UTR in either human or mouse        The  end of the         UTR is determined by the site of        transcription initiation and several papers have reported        putative         p Kiptranscription initiation        sites In mouse Kwon et al    reported a major        transcription start site  nucleotides upstream of the        AUG start codon They also reported a second transcription        initiation site  nucleotides upstream of the start        codon In contrast Zhang and Lin    reported that the        mouse         p Kiptranscription start site is         nucleotides upstream of the start codon They found no        evidence for the downstream initiation sites reported by        Kwon et al     The gene sequences upstream of the         p Kipstart codon including the        putative promoter regions are highly conserved between        mouse and human However it has been reported that the         p Kiptranscription start site in        human cells is only  nucleotides upstream of the AUG        start codon      In contrast to these findings Ito        et al    reported multiple start sites in the region        from  to  nucleotides upstream of the AUG as well as        minor sites  and  nucleotides upstream of the AUG        Thus for both mouse and human         p Kipgenes there are discrepancies        between the reported transcription start sites In        addition despite the high level of conservation in         p Kipgene sequences the reports        in the literature show no correlation between mouse and        human initiation sites which would result in very        different          UTRs in the final         p KipmRNAs        Given the importance of the          UTR in governing p Kiplevels and        the disparity among the reports described above we felt it        necessary to further investigate the         p Kipgene transcription initiation        sites We have used a method that accurately identifies the        capped end of mRNAs together with RNase protection        assays Our data indicate that the major transcription        start site is at exactly the same sequence in mouse and        human cells and that transcription initiation from this        site produces a         p Kip         UTR of  nucleotides in mouse and         nucleotides in human These findings represent        important sequence information relevant to studies being        done on both transcriptional and posttranscriptional        control of p Kiplevels                    Results                  Determination of transcription initiation sites          using RNA ligasemediated rapid amplification of  cDNA          ends  RLMRACE          To identify transcription initiation sites RLMRACE          was performed This method has a major advantage over          other methods of mapping transcription start sites such          as primer extension nuclease protection assays or          traditional  RACE in that only authentic capped           ends of mRNAs are detected The first step in RLMRACE is          treatment of the RNA sample with phosphatase This          removes the  phosphate from incomplete mRNA fragments          and from nonmRNAs eliminating their ability to          participate in subsequent ligation reactions In the          second step of the procedure the methylguanosine cap of          mRNAs is removed using a pyrophosphatase that leaves a           phosphate group These fulllength decapped mRNAs are          thus the only RNA molecules that can be ligated to an RNA          oligonucleotide adapter in the next step of the          procedure Finally the RNAs are reverse transcribed          followed by PCR amplification using a genespecific          primer and a primer homologous to the RNA oligonucleotide          adapter          This procedure was carried out using total RNA from          the mouse NIH T cell line the nontransformed human          MRC cell line and the human breast cancer line MCF          The initial PCR was performed using a primer          complimentary to the           p KipmRNA sequence just upstream          of the AUG start codon see Figs Band C together with          the adapter primer Nested PCR was then performed using          the first PCR product as a template and the gene specific          primers indicated in Figs Band C The nested PCR          products were then cloned and sequenced          In mouse three bands were obtained after the  RACE          nested PCR reaction Fig A with estimated sizes of            and  base pairs with the  base pair band          being the most intense Cloning and sequencing of these          PCR products revealed three different DNA sequences each          preceded by a sequence corresponding to the RNA          oligonucleotide adapter and thus representing authentic          cap sites These sites map to   and           nucleotides upstream of the ATG translation start codon          in the mouse           p Kipgene Fig B          When the RLMRACE procedure was performed using RNA          from the nontransformed human MRC cell line a single          major band of approximately  base pairs was observed          after the initial PCR reaction Fig A With the human          MCF breast cancer cell line two bands of approximately           and  base pairs were observed Fig A Nested          PCR confirmed these bands and revealed several faint          bands of various sizes Fig B Direct cloning of the          RLMRACE products followed by sequencing demonstrated          that the major mRNA cap site in MRC cells is           nucleotides upstream of the AUG Fig C For MCF cap          sites were observed at  and  nucleotides upstream          of the AUG start codon          By gel purifying DNA fragments from the faint bands          obtained after the nested PCR reactions and then          reamplifying it was possible to obtain additional          clones These presumably correspond to minor start sites          that map to   and  nucleotides upstream of the                    p Kipstart codon in MCF cells          Using this procedure for MRC cells we were able to          detect a minor cap site  nucleotides upstream of the          AUG                          Determination of transcription initiation sites          using ribonuclease protection          The RLMRACE procedure identifies authentic          transcription start sites but does not provide a          quantitative measure of the efficiency at which the          various sites are used To verify the results of the          RLMRACE and to provide a measure of transcription start          site usage an RNase protection assay was employed          Labeled antisense RNA probes were made by in vitro          transcription using the cDNA sequence of the most          abundant longer transcripts identified by  RLMRACE as          a template The human probe was  nucleotides in          length consisting of           p Kipsequences from  to           nucleotides upstream of the AUG with the remaining           nucleotides derived from non           p Kipsequences The mouse probe          was  nucleotides in length and included           p Kipsequences from  to           nucleotides upstream of the AUG The labeled probes were          hybridized with total RNA from various sources followed          by digestion with RNase and analysis of the protected          RNAs on denaturing acrylamide gels          Using either NIH T Fig A or mouse liver Fig          B RNA for the RNase protection assay resulted in a          single predominant band with an estimated size of           nucleotides Figs Aand B arrows This corresponds to          the distal cap site detected by RLMRACE  nucleotides          upstream of the AUG Very faint bands of approximately           and  nucleotides Figs Aand B brackets were          also detected and these correspond to the other two cap          sites mapped by RLMRACE Using NIH T RNA an          additional faint band of approximately  nucleotides          Fig A arrowhead was detected This band does not          correspond to any known transcription start site The          various protected fragments were quantified by          densitometry After correction for length the major band          at  nucleotides represents   of p KipmRNAs          in NIHT cells and   in mouse liver The other          protected bands represent approximately equal proportions          of the remaining p KipmRNA population          RNase protection assays were performed using RNA from          three separate human cell lines MRC MCF and BT          For all three lines a single band of approximately           nucleotides was observed Fig  arrow This          corresponds to the major transcription initiation site           nucleotides upstream of the ATG as identified by          RLMRACE                            Conclusions        In mouse it was previously reported that the major        transcription initiation site for         p Kipis  nucleotides upstream        of the start codon with a minor start site  nucleotides        upstream of the ATG     We also detected transcription        start sites  and  nucleotides upstream of the ATG but        have shown that these are only rarely used The RLMRACE        and RNase protection assays described here show that the        overwhelming majority of mouse         p Kiptranscripts are initiated at        a position  nucleotides upstream of the ATG This is        true for both mouse liver and NIH T cells Zhang and Lin            using nuclease protection assays estimated the        mouse         p Kipstart site to be         nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon Our results        agree with these investigators but precisely position the        start site  nucleotides upstream of the AUG        In human cell lines the major transcription initiation        site is  nucleotides upstream of the ATG Both RNase        protection assays and RLMRACE Figs and  demonstrate        this This site exactly equates to the major transcription        start site in mouse Fig  Using RLMRACE we were also        able to detect minor cap sites in human cells An        initiation site  nucleotides upstream of the ATG was        easily identified in MCF human breast cancer cells Fig         and a significant portion of the initial clones were        derived from RNAs capped at this site In contrast  of        the initial clones from the RLMRACE procedure using the        nontransformed human MRC cell line were from products        capped  nucleotides upstream of the AUG By gel        purification and reamplification we were able to detect        additional cap sites   and  nucleotides upstream        of the AUG However these can only be very minor start        sites since they were rarely observed by RLMRACE and were        not detected by RNase protection assays Using an RLMRACE        procedure similar to that used for this study Ito et al           mapped a cluster of transcription start sites        surrounding nucleotide  upstream of the ATG However        their data did not demonstrate which site within this        cluster served as the major initiation site        In another study the transcription initiation site for        the human         p Kipgene was reported to be         nucleotides upstream of the ATG      The experiments        reported here do not support these findings Using        RLMRACE a faint band of approximately  base pairs        could be observed after nested PCR Fig A but we were        unable to clone an authentic RACE product equating to a        start site  nucleotides upstream of the AUG In        addition no bands corresponding to a start site at this        position were detected by RNase protection assays        indicating that if there is a transcriptional start site        at  it is extremely rarely used in any of the cell        lines that we tested The         p Kip         UTR is predicted to have extensive        secondary structure     It is possible that this could        interfere with primer extension analysis which was used by        Minami et al    to map the putative transcription        initiation site in human cells It is also possible that        differences exist between the cell types used here and        those used in previous reports However this is unlikely        since we observed exactly the same results with three        separate human cell lines        Both the mouse and human         p Kippromoter regions have        previously been characterized using reporter gene        constructs All of the constructs that have significant        levels of promoter activity contain the major        transcriptional start sites identified in this study               Mouse         p Kipreporter constructs        containing  base pairs upstream of the ATG start codon        had virtually no activity      Similarly a human         p Kipreporter construct containing         base pairs upstream of the ATG was inactive            Our data indicate that this is because these constructs did        not carry the major transcription initiation sites or the        promoter sequences necessary to position the transcription        complex In this regard it is noteworthy that the major        transcription start site for both mouse and human is        positioned  base pairs downstream of an ATrich element        that may serve as a TATA box This element in the         p Kipgene TTTAAT matches the        consensus TATA box sequence TATAATAAT at  out of         positions        It has been shown that expression of         p Kipis controlled at the        translational level      and that the         p Kip         UTR is able to mediate enhanced        translation rates     In addition it was recently        reported that the         p Kip         UTR has an internal ribosome entry        site that allows capindependent initiation of translation            However none of these reports have utilized the        full          UTR that results from transcription        initiation at the major start site The longest fragments        of the         p Kip         UTR that have been analyzed include        only the first  nucleotides upstream of the AUG for        human    and  nucleotides for mouse     It is        very likely that the additional  nucleotides at the         end of the major         p Kiptranscript as reported here        will play an important role in regulating p        Kipexpression It will therefore be necessary to        reexamine translational control of         p Kipin the context of its full                 UTR         The data presented here show that although there is a        single major site there are also alternative transcription        initiation sites for both mouse and human         p Kip This adds a new dimension        to studies on         p Kipexpression One interesting        possibility is that different start sites may be used at        different points in the cell cycle or during cellular        differentiation It is known that         p KipmRNA levels stay relatively        steady throughout the cell cycle However usage of various        transcription start sites could be regulated differently        This might affect the length of the          UTR and thus translation of the         p KipmRNA Additional studies will        need to be done to determine if and when different        transcription start sites are used        The region of the         p Kipgene upstream of the ATG        start codon is highly conserved in mouse and human Fig         This includes the region encoding the          UTR and the promoter region The high        conservation between the mouse and human genes extends at        least an additional  nucleotides upstream of the        sequences shown in Fig      Our data indicate that        the major transcription start site is at exactly the same        sequence in both human and mouse Fig  large arrows        Based on these new results we propose usage of the gene        numbering system shown in Fig  For mouse  is         nucleotides upstream of the ATG and for human  is         nucleotides upstream of the ATG This information should be        useful in designing experiments to analyze both        transcriptional and translation control of p        Kipexpression                    Materials and Methods                  Cell culture and RNA extraction          Human breast cancer cell lines MCF and BT human          fetal lung cell line MRC and the mouse NIH T cell          line were maintained in Dulbeccos modified Eagles          medium with  fetal bovine serum Total RNA was          extracted using TRI Reagent Molecular Research          Cincinnati OH and stored in ethanol at C                           RLMRACE           RLMRACE      was performed using the          GeneRacer kit Invitrogen Carlsbad CA In short the          total RNA was dephosphorylated using calf intestinal          phosphatase then decapped using tobacco acid          pyrophosphatase to target fulllength messenger RNAs An          RNA oligonucleotide was then ligated to the fulllength          decapped mRNAs and reverse transcription was performed          using random primers PCR was done to amplify the          resultant cDNAs using the GeneRacer  primer and a          primer consisting of bases immediately upstream of the          translation start site of the           p Kipgene          CTTTCTCCCGGGTCTGCACGACCG for human and          CTTCCTCCTCGGGCGGGTGT for mouse Nested PCR was then done          to eliminate the possibility of artifacts using the          GeneRacer  nested primer and           p Kipprimers
