                    Background        DNA microarrays have proven very useful in establishing        molecular definitions of human cancer subtypes            In some cases cancers that were assigned to a single        diagnostic category by conventional morphological        diagnostic methods have been found to have different gene        expression profiles and belong to distinct molecular        subtypes In particular diffuse large Bcell lymphoma        DLBCL was shown to consist of at least two molecular        subtypes that differed in the expression of over several        hundred genes   Furthermore patients with these two        DLBCL subtypes had strikingly different longterm outcomes        following conventional multiagent chemotherapy Patients        with germinal center Blike DLBCL had a favorable        prognosis with an apparent cure rate of  On the other        hand patients with activated Blike DLBCL had a poor        prognosis with less than a quarter of these patients alive        five years following therapy Therefore for patients with        activated Blike DLBCL alternative therapeutic agents must        be identified        For this reason we have begun a survey of novel cancer        agents in order to identify drugs with significant activity        against activated Blike DLBCL One drug identified in this        screen flavopiridol was found to be significantly        cytotoxic for cell lines derived from activated Blike        DLBCL Flavopiridol is a member of the growing family of        cyclindependent kinase CDK inhibitors that have varying        activities against the multiple CDK family members CDK        CDK CDK CDK and CDK by competitively blocking their        ATPbinding pocket       In addition to        arresting cells         in vitro at the GtoM and the        GtoS transitions flavopiridol decreases the rate of        progression through S phase Since flavopiridol is being        evaluated in multiple cancer clinical trials    and        has been shown to be highly active in inducing apoptosis in        hematopoietic neoplasms   we were interested in        whether flavopiridol might be effective against activated        Blike DLBCL        Although it is clear that flavopiridol inhibits CDKs        whether flavopiridol inhibits other cellular targets is not        known Recently flavopiridol was found to inhibit the        activity of a transcription elongation factor PTEFb a        complex of cyclins with CDK   PTEFb phosphorylates        the carboxyterminal domain of the RNA polymerase II        complex   facilitating transcription elongation It        was not known however whether PTEFb regulates        transcriptional elongation of all cellular genes or whether        other factors promote transcriptional elongation on subsets        of cellular genes        Using DNA microarrays we found that flavopiridol        inhibited gene expression broadly in a manner highly        related to other transcription inhibitors such as        actinomycin D and        dichloroDribofuranosylbenzimidazole DRB We        were therefore able to use flavopiridol to study the        turnover rate of mRNA on a genomicscale mRNA turnover is        regulated by a variety of cellular factors acting on        ciselements in mRNA molecules For many labile mRNAs        adenylate uridylaterich elements AREs are required for        their rapid degradation Three different classes of ARE        have been defined   A conserved motif present in two        of these classes AUUUA plays an important role in        transcript stability for many cytokines and earlyresponse        genes ERGs   However there is now increasing        evidence that other motifs may determine the stability of        transcripts          By measuring mRNA turnover rates comprehensively we        identified unexpected relationships between the function of        a gene and its mRNA stability In addition we found that        genes that were transcriptionally inducible were        disproportionately represented in the class of genes with        labile mRNAs thus revealing a coordinated strategy to        rapidly modulate the mRNA levels of these genes This        understanding of mRNA turnover on a genomic scale provides        fresh insights into the effectiveness of flavopiridol as an        anticancer agent                    Results and discussion        To investigate the effect of flavopiridol treatment on        activated Blike DLBCL we used cell line OCILy as our        model of activated Blike DLBCL as its geneexpression        profile closely resembles the profiles of lymphoma biopsy        samples from patients with this type of DLBCL   OCILy        were treated for  hours with flavopiridol  M and gene        expression changes were monitored using Lymphochip DNA        microarrays   In comparison to untreated OCILy        cells flavopiridol treatment decreased expression of         out of  microarray elements  by at least        twofold data not shown Similarly profound decreases in        mRNA levels were observed following flavopiridol treatment        of other lymphoma cell lines data not shown The        magnitude of the flavopiridol effect on gene expression was        related to the dose of the drug used Figure a We found        that there was almost no effect on gene expression in cells        treated with  nM flavopiridol for  and  hours whereas         nM flavopiridol induced broad changes in gene        expression and  mM flavopiridol was yet more potent in        decreasing mRNA levels Patients receiving infusions of        flavopiridol achieve a biologically active concentration in        plasma of  nM   To relate these gene expression        changes to the biological activity of flavopiridol we        assayed the viability of OCILy cells treated with        different doses of flavopiridol Figure b Flavopiridol        at a concentration of  nM had no effect on viability even        after  hours treatment In contrast  nM flavopiridol        decreased the viability of OCILy cells at  hours Given        the similar doseresponse effects of flavopiridol on        cytotoxicity and gene expression it is likely that the        global reduction in mRNA levels caused by flavopiridol is a        major contributor to its cytotoxic action        Flavopiridol is a member of the growing family of CDK        inhibitors that have varying activities against the        multiple CDK family members As most of the CDK inhibitors        bind to the ATPbinding pocket of the CDKs   and all        CDKs have similar ATPbinding pockets it was possible that        other CDK inhibitors also inhibit transcription We        determined whether the inhibition of transcription is        specific to flavopiridol by comparing gene expression        profiles of flavopiridoltreated cells with those of cells        treated with the CDK inhibitors roscovitine and        nitropaullone Roscovitine is a purine derivative that        inhibits CDK CDK and CDK and blocks cellcycle        progression both in late Gearly S and in M phase             nitropaullone the most potent member of a        novel class of the paullone CDK inhibitor family inhibits        CDKcyclin B at fold lower concentrations than        flavopiridol and roscovitine     As shown in        Figure c the gene expression changes caused by        roscovitine and nitropaullone were different from those        of flavopiridol and only flavopiridol globally reduced        mRNA levels        To determine whether flavopiridol affects transcription        globally we compared the gene expression profile of        flavopiridol treatment with the gene expression profiles        induced in OCILy cells by treatment with two wellstudied        transcriptional inhibitors actinomycin D and DRB        Actinomycin D inhibits transcription initiation broadly by        intercalating into DNA whereas DRB inhibits the        transcription elongation factor PTEFb   PTEFb is a        complex of cyclins with CDK and flavopiridol can also        inhibit this kinase   However it was not known        whether PTEFb regulates transcriptional elongation of all        cellular genes nor was it known whether flavopiridol would        inhibit the same set of genes as DRB OCILy cells were        treated with each inhibitor and the resultant changes in        gene expression were found to be virtually        indistinguishable Figure a For the majority of        wellmeasured genes on the Lymphochip the mRNA abundance        decreased with firstorder kinetics Figure  and could        therefore be used to measure mRNA turnover rates see        Materials and methods Genes are grouped according to mRNA        halflife in Figure a The turnover rates of        representative mRNAs were verified by northern blot        analysis in Figure band quantitated in Figure c These        findings demonstrate that all three compounds behave as        global inhibitors of transcription and demonstrate that        PTEFb regulates the transcriptional elongation of most        cellular genes Further the similar effects of        flavopiridol and DRB argue that the predominant effect of        flavopiridol on gene expression results from its ability to        inhibit PTEFb        To investigate whether the mRNA degradation rates were        firstorder we fitted a linear regression model for the        three drugs for each gene see Materials and methods The        adjusted Rsquared statistic which is a measure of        correlation between the observed data values and the        predicted values from the linear model shows how well a        firstorder kinetics model would describe the mRNA        degradation rates Figure shows a histogram of the        adjusted Rsquared statistics obtained from fitting a model        for each of the  genes The median adjusted Rsquared        was  and  of the genes had an adjusted Rsquared        statistic over  showing that most of the genes had        firstorder mRNA degradation rates        Given the demonstration that flavopiridol is a global        transcriptional inhibitor we wished to understand the        selective activity of flavopiridol against certain cancer        types         in vivo  Clearly genes with short        mRNA halflives would be most rapidly and quantitatively        inhibited by flavopiridol and thus we wished to assign the        genes with short halflives in OCILy cells to functional        classes First we searched for genes involved in cellular        proliferation that have unstable mRNAs as decreased        expression of these genes might provide a mechanism by        which flavopiridol preferentially targets proliferating        cancer cells Microarray gene expression analysis can        readily identify a proliferation signature consisting of        hundreds of genes that vary in expression between        proliferating and quiescent cells    Genes can be        assigned to the proliferation signature on the basis of        high expression in diverse cell lines and low expression in        chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL a malignancy in which        the leukemic cells are primarily in GG phase of the cell        cycle   Figure apresents  genes with halflives of        less than  hours for which the average expression in six        cell lines was fourfold greater than the average expression        in three CLL samples This selection criteria identified         cmyc  a gene previously known to        have a shortlived mRNA and an obviously important target        of flavopiridol given its role in GS phase progression          Interestingly roughly half of these genes  are        expressed preferentially in M phase andor encode proteins        involved in Mphase events These genes represent important        targets of flavopiridol action as they encode Mphase        regulatory kinases PLK auroraIPLrelated kinase and        ckshs Mphase checkpoint proteins CHK and chromosome        segregation proteins CENPE CENPF Figure a Given        the relatively short duration of M phase in most cells the        short halflives of these mRNAs may be important to ensure        that key Mphase regulators are not expressed as the cell        progresses from M to G phase        Another important class of genes that might contribute        to the efficacy of flavopiridol would include        antiapoptotic genes with rapid mRNA turnover Figure b        Two antiapoptotic Bcl family members that were expressed        in OCILy cells  A and MCL  had mRNA halflives        shorter than  hours Three members of the IAP family          cIAP cIAP NAIP  had very short        mRNA halflives and encode antiapoptotic proteins that act        by directly binding to caspases   and    The NF        B target gene         A  an inhibitor of tumor necrosis        factor TNFinduced apoptosis   is expressed in        OCILy cells and had a very short mRNA halflife As TNF        is expressed by OCILy cells inhibition of A expression        by flavopiridol treatment may contribute to its cytotoxic        effect on these cells In accord with these results        flavopiridol treatment was recently shown to downregulate        two of these antiapoptotic proteins MCL and Bag and        induce apoptosis in BCLL cells treated with flavopiridol                 The majority of the genes with labile mRNAs however        did not fall into the cell cycle or apoptosis categories        but instead included many genes that are known to be        inducible by cellular signaling For example transcription        factors belonging to the NFB family are activated by a        wide variety of cellular signaling events and several        known NFB target genes          A A cIAP cIAP IB alpha IB        epsilon CD IL IL TNF IRF  were found to        have unstable mRNAs Figure d This observation led us to        investigate the possibility that the class of genes that        are transcriptionally induced by cellular signaling events        is enriched for genes with labile mRNAs We used Lymphochip        microarrays to profile the changes in gene expression that        occurred in response to a wide variety of signaling events        Bcell lymphoma cell lines stimulated by crosslinking the        Bcell antigen receptor or by treatment with phorbol ester        and ionomycin PI resting peripheral blood T cells        stimulated with PI and peripheral blood monocytes        stimulated with lipopolysaccharide Figure dshows genes        with relatively short mRNA halflives  hours and         hours that were also transcriptionally induced at least        threefold in one of the cellular activation experiments        described above Roughly one third of the inducible genes        in OCILy cells were in this rapid mRNA turnover category        Figure c By contrast  of the genes that were not        induced by these stimuli had mRNA halflives of less than         hours          P          This analysis of mRNA turnover in OCILy cells        therefore suggested that transcriptionally inducible genes        are as a class likely to generate labile mRNAs To test        this notion we profiled mRNA turnover rates in peripheral        blood mononuclear cells PBMCs after stimulation with PI        PBMCs were stimulated with PI for  hours at which time        flavopiridol was added and mRNA levels were subsequently        determined by microarray analysis Genes were assigned to        the inducible class if their mRNA levels increased more        than fourfold by PI in  hours As shown in Figure a a        substantial proportion  of the inducible genes had        mRNA halflives shorter than  hours By contrast only         of the noninducible class of genes had mRNA halflives        less than  hours and more than  of these genes had        mRNA halflives longer than  hours          P   Figure a This        result confirmed in an independent cellular system the        observation that transcriptionally inducible genes        preferentially encode rapidly degraded mRNAs        We next investigated the functional characteristics of        the genes assigned to each mRNA turnover class Figure b        More than one third of genes regulating apoptosis were both        inducible and had mRNA halflives of less than  hours By        contrast only  of the genes encoding cellsurface        proteins were in this class The apoptosis regulators        included several antiapoptotic genes discussed previously                 A MCL cIAP  as well as        potentially proapoptotic genes such as those for Fas        ligand and TNF receptor type II PHLDA is the human        homolog of TDAG a pleckstrinhomology domain protein        that may modulate apoptosis by regulating Fas ligand        expression following stimulation through the Tcell        receptor It is well known that apoptosis in T lymphocytes        is an elaborately orchestrated process following lymphocyte        activation that allows clonal expansion of the activated T        cells while eventually eliminating the clone through the        process of activationinduced cell death   Thus        antiapoptotic gene products are required early during        lymphocyte activation whereas attenuation of the clonal        burst eventually requires proapoptotic signaling through        Fas and the TNF receptors This change in apoptotic        responsiveness may be accomplished rapidly by combining        transcriptional regulation with rapid mRNA turnover of key        apoptosisregulatory genes        Transcriptional reprogramming following lymphocyte        activation involves the coordinate induction of        transcription factors   and many of these were found to        have labile mRNAs Figure b Several of these genes are        known to encode immediate early transcription factors for        example FosB NAB ATF NOT that are induced by a        wide range of cellular stimuli and this class of        transcription factors is well known to have unstable mRNAs          Other inducible transcription factors with labile        mRNAs have more lymphocytespecific functions such as        IRF a factor that is required for lymphocyte activation        but is not required in other lineages          Not surprisingly the most inducible class of genes in        PBMCs encoded cytokines chemokines and their receptors        Figure c Within this class more than  of genes had        mRNA halflives of less than  hours As expected many        cytokine mRNAs were both rapidly inducible and rapidly        degraded Figure d Unexpectedly the chemokine genes had        much more stable mRNAs than the cytokine genes even though        they were strongly induced by PI treatment Figure d The        mRNAs for the cytokine and chemokine receptors also        differed in their stability The inducible chemokine        receptors CCR and CXCR had labile mRNAs whereas most of        the inducible cytokine receptors IL IL IL receptor         chains had relatively stable mRNAs The differential        mRNA stabilities of cytokines chemokines and their        receptors reflect their divergent biological functions        Cytokines potently induce activation and differentiation of        target cells in a tightly regulated temporal fashion during        immune responses   To limit inappropriate effects of        cytokines both temporally and spatially on bystander cells        the levels of these factors must be modulated rapidly        which can be achieved given their short mRNA halflives On        the other hand chemokines are chemoattractants that signal        leukocyte migration by setting up concentration gradients        that are recognized by chemokine receptors   The        inducible chemokines are used in inflammatory responses and        wound healing to attract the appropriate complement of        immune cells to the affected tissues These cellular        reactions need to be rapidly initiated but are slowly        resolved a kinetic profile that can be understood in light        of the relative stability of chemokine mRNAs        Finally we investigated whether known         cis acting mRNA motifs could account        for the mRNA turnover rates measured in the present study        Adenylateuridylaterich elements AREs mediate rapid        turnover of some mRNAs Three different classes of ARE have        been defined two of which include the core motif AUUUA          A recent bioinformatics analysis of labile mRNAs with        AUUUA motifs extended this core motif to the nonamer        UAUUUAWW and a database of mRNAs that have matches to this        motif in their  untranslated regions was created          Using this database we examined the distribution of these        AUrich motifs among the classes of mRNAs with different        halflives Figure shows that this motif was found        preferentially in the most unstable mRNAs and was observed        with decreasing frequency in mRNAs with longer halflives        Nonetheless  of the genes in the long halflife        category  hours contained AREs demonstrating that        the ARE motif is not completely predictive of rapid mRNA        turnover Furthermore many of the RNAs with unstable mRNAs        lacked the ARE consensus motif suggesting that other         cis elements may be responsible for        their rapid degradation                    Conclusions        The systematic determination of mRNA degradation rates        described in the present report revealed an underlying        logic that relates gene function and mRNA stability The        largest category of genes found to have unstable mRNAs        included genes that were inducible by various cellular        signaling events The inducibility of many of these genes        is known to be due to transcriptional activation of their        promoters Thus the rapid degradation of these mRNAs        allows their levels to rapidly drop when transcriptional        activation is terminated By categorizing genes using the        functional properties of their encoded proteins we found        that certain functional classes were relatively enriched        for unstable mRNAs Two such classes the cytokine genes        and immediate early transcription factor genes were        previously known to have unstable mRNAs The class of        apoptosis regulators however was not previously known to        be enriched for labile mRNAs However given the need to        rapidly modulate apoptosis during development cellular        differentiation and immune responses this property of the        apoptotic genes can be readily understood Another        unanticipated finding was that many critical regulators of        M phase of the cell cycle had rapidly degraded mRNAs In        light of the short duration of M phase these labile        Mphase regulators may need to be eliminated rapidly to        allow correct entry into G phase of the cell cycle        The initial impetus of this research was to understand        the mechanism of action of the anticancer drug        flavopiridol The regulatory logic of mRNA degradation        revealed in this study gives us insight into how this        general transcriptional inhibitor can have selective        toxicity for tumor cells In particular the short        halflives of mRNAs encoding Mphase proteins and other key        cellcycle regulators for example cMyc may contribute        to the cytotoxicity of flavopiridol for cancer cells but        may also contribute to the doselimiting toxicity of        flavopiridol for gut epithelium leading to secretory        diarrhea   However the present results also suggest        that flavopiridol may be more effective in treating certain        types of cancer cells that are highly dependent on genes        with unstable mRNAs For example OCILy lymphoma cells        constitutively express two antiapoptotic BCL family        members A and MCL which are not expressed at high        levels in normal lymphocytes The instability of the A and        MCL mRNAs therefore may contribute to the toxicity of        flavopiridol for these lymphoma cells Gene expression        profiling demonstrated that the OCILy cell line is an        excellent model for the activated Blike DLBCL subtype          Indeed fresh lymphoma biopsies from such patients        revealed high expression of A and MCL in most cases          These results suggest that activated Blike DLBCL might be        a particularly attractive candidate disease for new        clinical trials of flavopiridol                    Materials and methods                  Chemicals and cells          Flavopiridol and

nm filter The          background was subtracted using a dualwavelength setting          of  and  nm                          Microarray analysis and northern blotting          Microarray analysis was performed as described            Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent Gibco BRL          according to the manufacturers instruction For each          sample  g of total RNA was used for the labeling          reaction All primary microarray data are available at          our website            Ten micrograms of total RNA were used for northern          blot analysis The probes were prepared from PCR          amplification of the cDNA clones used for printing the          Lymphochip                          Data analysis          The raw data from each cDNA array were normalized as          described   Data extracted must fulfill the          following criteria Spot size must be  m and          expression levels for all flavopiridol studies must be           relative fluorescent units RFU for the Cy          channel and  RFU for the Cy channel PBMC          induction studies  RFU for both channels          For the halflife studies in Figures    the          array elements genes were selected for each of the          indicated time points Figure  X h for example on the          basis of three criteria First the mRNA abundance at X          h as measured by the ratio of the array element          CyCy must have decreased by at least twofold          Second the average of the geometric means for the array          element at the later time points for example Z Z          and Z must be less than the twofold decrease of that          element at the indicated time point Third the average          of the geometric means for previous time points for          example Y and Y must be greater than the twofold          decrease of that element at the indicated time point          The expression data for array elements representing          the same gene were averaged Hierarchical clustering was          performed using Cluster software and visualized using the          Tree View software                            AREmRNA database          The accession numbers of transcripts with one to five          copies of AUUUA were downloaded from the AREmRNA          database   These transcripts were categorized by          their halflives according to the PBMC database                          Mathematical analysis of mRNA halflives          A firstorder kinetic model would imply that the          logratio of Cy to Cy would decrease linearly with          time For each gene we fitted a linear regression model          of the logratios to the time points where the model          included a separate intercept and coefficient term for          each of the three drugs          log            CyCy             Flav             Flav           t   I           Flav             ActD             ActD           t   I           ActD             DRB

      on whether or not that treatment drug was used for the          Cy measurement of that logratio and            Flav             Flav             ActD             ActD             DRB  and

to have identical error distributions          in their assay variability The mRNA halflife for each          drug treatment was computed as the negative of the          inverse of the coefficient for each drug                    t           Flav             Flav            t           ActD             ActD            t           DRB             DRB                           Statistical analysis          The following test   was used to evaluate whether          the proportion of induced genes with halflife less than           h is statistically different from the proportion of not          induced genes with halflife less than  h for both the          OCILy Figure c and PBMC Figure a                    z             p                       p                           n
