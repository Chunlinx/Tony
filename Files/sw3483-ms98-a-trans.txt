            well i guess i dont have as much time for hobbies as i used to   what is your hobby isnt that the truth   uh i got two young boys uh four and two so i spend a lot of time with them  but uh whenever the weathers nice and uh we can get out i like to work in the garden a little bit uh     get that mud up in your fingernails yeah yeah i know how it goes   yeah yeah you know thats pretty relaxing to me like this   oh hey i tell you what getting outdoors is wonderful i do too my wife always gets mad at me for doing it so much because she says you know i always come in so hot and sweaty and tired i said yeah but i love it       but for my you know my hobby believe it or not is really a collection i i collect Mickey Mouse   really   and i it is a full time hobby of going out there and finding things to to add to the collection i got well over two thousand Mickey Mouse items so thats thats my hobby   wow thats great   uh at one time and this is about fifteen years ago i actually uh got some uh what do you call it uh   umhum   uh plywood board and i made some Christmas cut out figures that i put in the yard and i mean they   umhum   everyone always talks about you know whered i buy them and i keep telling them but i didnt buy them i i made them you know and they stood there now for some fifteen years so uh and that in itself was a lot of fun you know but ive never worked with a jig saw before but it sure did work you know     wow thats pretty neat yeah   and i guess the other hobby that i did at one time i dont do anymore is good old needlepointing and uh that was my wifes hobby and   hm i see   so i picked it up and i did some stuff and i entered it into the state fair and i won a couple ribbons and said well okay but  for some reason it just didnt really catch my thing but my hobby of collecting Mickey Mouse     yeah   i think ive got the disease now   now that you have more and more time on your hands right   true true but i dont know you know its you youre right though uh with the kids and i now have a six year old i dont have as much time for the hobbies as i used to   what yeah yeah i know what you mean they take up all my time now im kind of looking forward to the time when uh theyre a little bit older and they can get out and you know get a little more active in sports and   well  at this point my kid is six years old the we just finished our first season of flag football and daddy had a ball now i dont know if he had a good time but i had a great time and   ah     so i look you know more forward to that i guess maybe that stage of my life i i dont have enough time to do hobbies but i do have enough time to to play with the kids and thats what i wanna do   yeah me too im im really i cant wait for that time  i really cant wait   uh  i took them out to a a a little Tball and that that that worked out real nice   it   he he enjoyed it uh im not sure that he understood what was going on but you know   yeah   but at six years old i i think theyre still a little bit young   yeah see my oldest is four   but the but flag football he picked up that real quick he loved it   really that thats great   yeah and daddy loved it too i mean     thats pretty good yeah mines um uh just now has started getting into well you know like all the other little little young kids he was up on the Turtles and stuff but now hes trying to get into Robin Hood   ah   and so were gonna get him some one of those Nerf Robin Hood bow and arrow things   well  im going to be doing for this Christmas uh im buying him a uh swing set which includes a fort and everything else       uhhuh oh   and they say it only takes thirteen hours to build im thinking uhhuh so i have a feeling i might find myself with a full time hobby  ive got a uh a fence builder whos gonna come over there to help me so         oh thats good   hopefully between the two of us we can figure out how to put that sucker together   yeah yeah it always always helps to get somebody to help you out   got oh yes the the swing set that we have a little Jim Dandy uh made out of metal is okay but hes much too big for that and his imaginations much bigger so we weve got the monkey bars and the fort and you know it goes on and on and on   hm uhhuh yeah wow yeah yeah whenever uh um every now and then ill take mine to the park and they like to play on all of that stuff thats at the park and and its like you said its got the fort and you know its the whole works   oh yes umhum   made out of wood   and and now who knows maybe the kids in the neighborhood will wanna come to his house to play you know  so   he always goes over their houses huh   uh right now we always do because he says theres nothing to play with at our house so well okay so  id like to have my turn to be able to invite the kids because i i dont know about you but i love having the kids around its fun       yeah uh there arent too many right now actually mine are the oldest on our block uh the other ones are at least a year to two years younger so ours is a a block of pretty young kids right now   ah uh i think in my neighborhood theres about two or three at the same age but most of them are about two or three years older so mine my  a little bit younger so but oh well hell hell hell get there   oh i see i see   yeah i wanna know this side of it and and they do they do tend to congregate around our house and and you know i never really thought about that much either all the little ones come over and they kind of hang around our front yard but uh   so so i guess the bottom line conclusion is take
