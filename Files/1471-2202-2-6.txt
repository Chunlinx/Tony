                    Background        Taste receptor cells are specialized epithelial cells        which are organized into discrete endorgans called taste        buds Typical taste buds contain  polarized taste        cells which extend from the basal lamina to the taste        pore where apical microvilli protrude into the oral        cavity The basolateral membrane forms chemical synapses        with primary gustatory neurons Fig A In mammals        lingual taste buds are housed in connective tissue        structures called papillae Fungiform papillae are located        on the anterior twothirds of the tongue and typically        contain  taste buds each Vallate and foliate papillae        are found on the posterior tongue and house several hundred        taste buds each Taste transduction begins when sapid        stimuli interact with the apical membrane of taste cells        usually resulting in taste cell depolarization calcium        influx and transmitter release onto gustatory afferent        neurons Simple stimuli such as salts and acids depolarize        taste cells by direct interaction with apical ion channels        In contrast complex stimuli such as sugars amino acids        and most bitter compounds bind to G protein coupled        receptors initiating intracellular signaling cascades that        culminate in Ca influx or release of Ca from        intracellular stores              Inositol trisphosphate IP           is an important second messenger in        both bitter and sweet taste transduction In both pathways        activation of taste receptors stimulates a G        proteincoupled cascade resulting in activation of        phospholipase C PLC which cleaves phosphoinositol        bisphosphate PIP           to produce the second messengers IP          and diacylglycerol DAG The soluble        messenger IP          binds to receptors located on calcium        store membranes causing release of calcium into the        cytosol while DAG remains in the membrane where it can        activate downstream effectors While little is known about        the role of IP          in sweet taste transduction        considerable data indicate that IP          plays an important role in bitter        transduction The first evidence for the involvement of IP          in bitter transduction was obtained by        Akabas et al   who used Ca imaging to show that the        bitter stimulus denatonium causes release of Ca from        intracellular stores More recently biochemical        measurements have shown that several bitter compounds        elevate IP          in taste tissue               Other studies however suggested that a decrease in        cAMP rather than an increase in IP           mediated bitter transduction In         a chemosensory specific G protein gustducin was        identified in a subset of taste cells          Alphagustducin which is closely related to the rod and        cone transducins activates PDE to reduce intracellular        levels of cAMP   Evidence for gustducins role in        bitter taste came from knockout studies in which a        targeted deletion of gustducin resulted in mice with a        reduced sensitivity for bitter compounds   More        recently a variety of bitter compounds have been shown to        activate gustducin in biochemical assays    causing        a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels via activation of        PDE   It is now known that individual bitter receptors        modulate both the IP          and cAMP pathways Fig B Bitter        compounds bind to a family of G proteincoupled receptors        called the TR    or TRB   receptors which        activate a heterotrimeric G protein consisting of        gustducin and a  complex containing    and           Alphagustducin activates PDE to decrease intracellular        levels of cAMP   while its  partners stimulate PLC        to produce IP          and DAG          Although it is clear that IP          binds to receptors located on        intracellular Ca stores the specific identity of IP          receptors in taste cells is not known        There are at least  known isotypes of IP          receptors encoded by different genes          Each protein product is about  Kda Four subunits        assemble to form a functional channel Both homomultimeres        and heteromultimeres have been reported   The N        terminus of each subunit houses the IP          binding domain while the C terminus        anchors the protein to the membrane is involved in the        formation of the tetrameric protein and forms the Ca        pore region The general structure of each isoform is        similar however they differ in primary sequence        distribution regulation and IP          affinity          In this study we used immunocytochemical methods to        determine which IP          R isoform is expressed in taste cells        and to examine the expression patterns of IP          receptors relative to other proteins        known to be important for taste transduction We report        that the Type III IP          receptor is the dominant isotype        expressed in rodent taste cells and that it is primarily        found in the same subset of taste cells as other known        signaling components of bitter transduction A preliminary        account of this work was published in abstract form                             Results                  IP Receptor Isotypes          Forty micron thick rat sections containing          circumvallate papillae were exposed to either antiIP            R antiIP            R or antiIP            R antibodies and appropriate          secondary antibodies Laser scanning confocal microscopy          of the resultant sections was used to examine the          distribution of IP            receptor immunoreactivity in rat          circumvallate taste buds Labeling for IP            R and IP            R was negligible Figs A B In          contrast immunoreactivity to IP            R was robust and present in a large          subset of taste cells Fig C Generally          immunoreactivity extended throughout the cytoplasm of          labeled cells Immunoreactivity was found only in taste          buds and was not present in the lingual epithelium          surrounding taste buds Primarily intragemmal taste cells          were labeled proliferative basal cells of the taste buds          did not appear to be labeled In addition gustatory          nerve fibers did not appear to be labeled Controls in          which the primary antibody was omitted showed no specific          labeling Fig D                          Coexpression of IP R with known bitter signaling          components          To determine if IP            R could be involved in bitter taste          transduction we performed doublelabel          immunocytochemistry with antibodies to IP            R and components of the bitter          signaling pathway For most experiments mouse as well as          rat tissues were examined Exposure of tissue to          antibodies against gustducin and IP            R showed that all gustducin          immunoreactive IR cells were also immunoreactive for IP                     R however a subset of IP            RIR taste cells lacked          gustducinIR Fig  Further analysis with antibodies          to other signaling components of the bitter transduction          pathway are shown in Figs   Immunoreactivity for          PLC and IP            R showed nearly complete          coincidence of labeling Fig  Immunoreactivity for          PLC extended throughout the cytoplasm as did          immunoreactivity for IP            R However some taste cells          appeared to differ in the degree of labeling for each          antibody with some cells showing more intense label for          IP            R and others for PLC We also          compared IP            R IR with  IR in rat and mouse          circumvallate taste buds As shown in Fig  nearly          complete colocalization was again observed for both          antigens Results from PLC and  double label          experiments were similar for mouse and rat taste buds          Taken together these immunocytochemical data indicate          that IP            R is the predominant isoform of IP            receptor expressed in taste cells          and that it is found in the same subset of taste cells as          other components known to be involved with bitter taste          transduction                            Discussion        IP          R is heavily expressed in a large        subset of vallate taste cells of both mouse and rat        suggesting that IP          R plays a similar role in both        species IP          R appears to be located throughout        the cytoplasm of taste cells consistent with its expected        location on the smooth endoplasmic membrane   In other        cells IP          receptors have also been found on the        plasma membrane   but because of heavy cytoplasmic        labeling we were unable to resolve whether it was also        located on the plasma membrane One caveat is that antigen        retrieval was necessary to observe IP          R labeling However using this        method with gustducin PLC and  antibodies did not        alter their immunoreactivities similar results were        obtained with and without antigen retrieval Thus we do        not believe that antigen retrieval compromised our        interpretation of the results        Taste cells expressing IP          R have an elongate bipolar        morphology suggestive of Type II taste cells          Indeed a subset of the IP          R immunoreactive taste cells is also        immunoreactive for gustducin which has been identified        exclusively in Type II cells   However whether IP          R is expressed exclusively in Type II        cells awaits further investigation It is noteworthy that a        subset of taste cells does not express IP          receptors This raises the question as        to whether these cells have intracellular Ca release        mechanisms Ryanodine receptors also mediate release of Ca        from intracellular stores however a previous study        showed no effect of ryanodine on bitter taste responses in         Necturus taste cells          IP          R immunoreactivity was expressed in        the same subset of taste cells as PLC and  and by        inference from other data    Antibodies against        these proteins have been shown to inhibit IP          formation to bitter compounds in taste        cells     suggesting that they are important        components of the bitterstimulated IP          pathway It is of interest that only a        subset of IP          R IR cells express gustducin a G        protein known to be involved with bitter transduction        These data suggest that alpha subunits in addition to        gustducin must be involved with the IP          signaling pathway in gustducin        negative cells Several G protein alpha subunits have been        identified in taste cells and are potential candidates for        this role These include transducin   Gi Gi        Gs   and G and Gq   Further experiments will        be required to identify the additional alpha subunits that        couple to this pathway and the receptors that activate        these G proteins        In addition to its role in bitter transduction IP          is involved in the transduction of        artificial sweeteners   Interestingly mice lacking        gustducin are compromised in the detection of sweet        compounds as well as bitter compounds suggesting that        sweet receptors may also couple to gustducin          Approximately twothirds of the gustducin positive        vallate taste cells express TRTRB receptors   It is        possible that the remaining gustducin positive vallate        taste cells express receptors for synthetic sweeteners and        that they couple to the IP          signaling pathway Thus IP          R may be involved with sweet as well        as bitter taste transduction        IP          R is widely expressed in cells in a        variety of tissues including adult pancreatic islets        kidney gastrointestinal tract salivary glands and brain           Many of these cell types including taste cells        are polarized where Ca signals are initiated on the        apical membrane and must propagate long intracellular        distances IP          R is particularly well suited for        this function since it is the only IP          receptor isotype that is not inhibited        at high Ca concentrations   In fact under certain        conditions Ca can stimulate IP          R making it a likely candidate for        participation in the propagation of Ca oscillations In        taste cells Ca oscillations have been observed in        response to bitter stimuli T Ogura and SC Kinnamon        unpub observations and its likely that IP          R participates in these Ca        oscillations        Another interesting feature of IP          R is that cAMPdependent        phosphorylation can inhibit its activity in pancreatic        acinar cells    In these cells cAMPdependent        phosphorylation decreases Ca release from intracellular        stores and slows the frequency of Ca oscillations These        data suggest a possible role for gustducin in bitter        taste transduction Specifically activation of        gustducin which decreases intracellular cAMP by        activation of PDE   may lead to a decrease in the        cAMPdependent phosphorylation of IP          R This would disrupt the negative        control of the receptor and potentiate the Ca response        Interestingly Gi another alpha subunit heavily        expressed in taste cells   also functions to decrease        intracellular levels of cAMP and may lead to regulation of        IP          R Further experiments will be        necessary to clarify the role of these alpha subunits in        regulation of the IP          pathway in taste cells                    Conclusions        The principal finding in this study is the        identification of IP          R as the dominant isoform of the IP          receptor in taste cells IP          has been shown to be an important        second messenger in both bitter and sweet taste        transduction and IP          R likely mediates the Ca release        from intracellular stores in response to IP           In bitter taste transduction many        signaling components have been identified and IP          R is coexpressed in the same taste        cells Fig  Bitter stimuli bind to TRTRB taste        receptors coupled to a heterotrimeric G protein complex        consisting of gustducin and its partners  and         Alpha gustducin activates PDE causing decreases in        intracellular cAMP while its  partners stimulate PLC        to produce IP          and DAG IP          subsequently binds to IP          R causing increases in cytosolic Ca         due to release from intracellular stores Fig B The        unique properties of IP          R including its regulation by Ca        and cAMP dependent kinases are consistent with known        characteristics of bitter signaling in taste cells                    Materials and Methods                  Animals          Adult male Sprague Dawley Rats and adult CB
