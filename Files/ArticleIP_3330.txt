                                 Between Erotica and a Hard Place            I recently heard that thereare  pornography sites on the Web Sex is one of the few things peopleare consistently willing to pay for online sports and stocks are among theothers and there are obvious reasons for thissay privacy and convenienceYou may be able to find the same stuff as whats online at any decently stockedporn shop but to do so you have to go to that neighborhood physically enterthat store and then worry about what the clerk thinks of your interest indominant transvestites Browsing at home its just you and your modem andusing the mouse only takes one hand            Therecently launched literate smut Webzine Nerve might be Sex Site No  but dont call itporno In a letter to the readers the sites twentysomething editors declareNerve intends to be more graphic forthright and topical thanerotica but less blockheadedly masculine than pornography  Ifpornography encompasses all those hot n hunky sites out there and erotica isthat safe and boring territory of romance novels and scented candles thenNerve wants it both ways rough sex and soft lighting meaningful talkand meaningless orgasm            You wonder why no one has ever tried this before Go toYahoo and type in literature  sex and you get sites such as Madelines Sex Offeringswhich contains articles such as SomePhilosophical Thoughts on Giving Head by Madeline herself And this isthe high end More typical are sites such as Pussy Vision and Blow Job of theDay Search for erotica thousands of matches and get sites such as YellowSilk the online version of the Berkeleybased journal the UtneReader called a tasteful celebration of the sensuality of every day lifeOr the Web site of Mary AnneMohanraj whose most recent book Torn Shapes of Desire  is toutedas eminently literary wellwritten and tasteful theres that wordagain            Theeditors of Nerve feel no need to be tasteful God bless em What youfind here are actual writers holding forth on subjects near and dear to theirhearts and other organs writing that generally seems to know the differencebetween the precious and the precise And they do it without sacrificing lustand the promise of sexual possibility As Ruth Shalit says in her review oftwo books about predator women Candace Bushnels Sex and the City andAnka Radakovichs Sexplorations  When staging a literary revolutionit never hurts to be sansculottes             In its architecture Nerve is notespecially revolutionary There are seven distinct sections within the siteeach with its de rigueur icon in the margin In Smut Cut the reviewssection you will find pieces like Shalits Roles features essays on sexgender and relationships Pedantry presents pieces by public figures such asformer Surgeon General Dr Joycelyn Elders on favorite subjects take a guessEx Libris comprises favorite erotic passages from our writers librariesSkin is photos of flesh Threads is occasionally interactive eroticfiction and The Bar is a yettobelaunched chat area Nerve wants toprovide something for everybody theres homeless sex prison sextheres evenNorman Mailer who says in a yearold interview published heresimply because its Mailer that he draws the line at child porn Everyone hashis limits Though the author of Advertisements for Myself has alwaysliked his sex the way a schoolboy likes his pieany way he can get ithe wasnever the hippest cat in the pack witness The White Negro his attempt tograpple with the Beats which proved the adage that those who had to ask whathip was werent In the interview Mailer recalls reading a line from WilliamS Burroughs in  that flat out cleaned his clock I see God in my assholein the flashbulb of orgasm            Iremember reading it and thinking I cant believe I just read those wordsrecalls Mailer I cant tell you the number of taboos it violated First ofall you werent supposed to connect God with sex Second of all you neverspoke of the asshole certainly not in relation to sex If you did you werethe lowest form of pervert Third of all there was obvious homosexuality inthe remark In those days nobody was accustomed to seeing that in print Andfourth there was an ugly technological edgewhyd he have to bring inflashbulbs            While Nerve hasnt violated many taboos yet thesite does betray some expectations Skin the photography area is doubtlessheavily trafficked The pictures are quick to download Nerve is veryuser friendly good navigation great design and an intelligent use of iconsSome images like Richard Kerns New York Girls  are as softporn as aPlayboy calendar But GregFriedlers blackandwhite photos from his book Naked New York areslightly disturbing New Yorkers who answered an ad in the VillageVoice  are photographed twiceclothed and nakedand the picturesjuxtaposed side by side beforeandafter fashion Their change of expressionor lack thereof is itself a comment on the meaning of nakednessmany appearmore defensive unclothed as if to counteract any vulnerabilityand the effectis almost antierotic            Equallyunarousing are Barbara Nitkes pictures from the sets of porno filmswhere she worked as a still photographer There is a sad Felliniesque qualityto these images bored and exhausted women lying on a kingsize bed surroundedby dildos of towering dimensions an actress being eaten out while the directorcasually talks to her about the scene Once I got focused on their underlyingsadness says Nitke of her subjects it was all I would see for years            So far Nerve has avoided mostsentimental yougottahaveheart reminders that people need more than justsex The attitude seems more carnivorous and unapologetic We need sex letsindulge and save talk about those other important things for Nightline True there are lapses FionaGiles editor of a book called Dick for a Day What Would You Do If YouHad One surprise most women would have sex with themselves has amoment of sadness when having gone dickless for months she finds herselfwalking down the street thinking I should ask someone for a hug BarbaraNitke also recalls a porn star saying all he wanted was a hug The moralWhether getting laid consistently or not people need hugs For the most partthough Nerve is a hugfree zone            It will be interesting tosee if Nerve can keep it up The editors seem to know good writing whenthey see it Novelist John Hawkes makes an unexpected appearance with a newintroduction to The Passion Artist  and Poppy ZBrite has a touching fantasy of John Lennon and Paul McCartney holdingmore than each others hands Coeditor of Nerve Genevieve Field wasexecutive editor of MTV Bookswords that linked together look about asstrange to my eyes as God and asshole did to Norman Mailers PissChrist creator Andres Serrano is to be featured in Skin soon so we knowJesse Helms will be bookmarking this page And if the editors are ever temptedto take themselves too seriously they can always refer to LisaCarvers hilarious essay on the differences between sensualists andsexualiststhose who like talking about it and those who like doing itSensualists have sex without orgasm on purpose she
