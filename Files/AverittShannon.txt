                     Dont be nervous         OK         Whats your name                     Shannon Averitt                     And how old are you                                          And where are you from                     Charlotte NC                     Where in Charlotte                     West side of Charlotte                     OK         And how was growing up in Charlotte         Did you like it or                     Yeah I liked it a lot         When um I was little I lived more near Lake Norman side of Charlotte         If youre not from Charlotte youre not going to know where thats at but um it was really far away from everybody and behind the airport and stuff like that         And um my junior year of high sch high school we moved into like the city the west side of Charlotte and I went to West Meck and that was a um culture experience  I guess                       How  how come                     Because it was more diverse         Like in most schools in Charlotte if you go on other sides its like everybodys just white but in my school there was every kind of person you could ever meet         So I havent met one person at UNCCharlotte that I didnt meet in my high school         I can compare them to like black white Asian whatever grunge redneck it doesnt matter                              Do you think thats a good thing that it helped culture you or                     Yeah it did because I know people from Charlotte now that went to like not to slam Providence because I like a lot of those people but they like have like so many like stereotypes of people because they dont know anybody         But then like I know people like that and theyre people just like anybody else is                     OK         And so is there anything in particular about growing up that you want to share that maybe changed you as a person         Or made you the person that you are         Anything in particular                     Hmm                     Tough question                     Yeah         OK         My dad um cause I wasnt really like I was a girl I mean I was a girl         I mean like my junior year of high school the first dress I ever owned was my junior year prom dress                      Like because my dad always treated me like a boy because I was like I was the first girl on my dads side of the family in like four generations or something like that         Like my greatgrandfathers brothers and dadadada and then my dad had one brother and my two older cousins were both guys         And then there was never like any female blood Averetts until like my oldest cousin had kids         But like so I was always raised like a tomboy and everything like that and my dad treated me like a guy all the time         And thats like I can totally see my dad in my personality         Like when I lived at home we did not get along at all for anything in the world we would fight all the time         I moved out and we get along perfect         Cause were like now I can say this because Im older or whatever and I can like deal with it Im exactly like my dad                                                               But when I was younger I would have shot myself before I would have admitted that me and my dad were the exact same                     So you guys get along really well now                     Yeah         Unless Im like when I go home for like Christmas break after being there for like two weeks it was like Id never moved out and we get kind of like tense with each other         Basically because we both um always think were right                     I know about that         Now what about your mom         Were you close with her when you were growing up                     I was closer with my dad when I was little just because I did all the sports and everything like that and Ive always been close to my mom it was never like I didnt like my mom but um me my mom and I never really fight or anything like that but now me and my mom are a lot closer         When I started doing like the whole shopping thing the makeup thing everything like that me and my mom got really really close         And then like now that Im in college like I call her like all the time and it wont occur that I should talk to my dad too         But then like me and my mom will talk all the time and shell come over here and shell like have a beer and a cigarette with me and it doesnt matter anymore                  Just because you know she knows how I am I guess                     Do you think thats hard for your dad maybe that youre closer with your mom now than you are your dad         Or do you think he kind of understands thats just the way                     Um it was hard for him at first I think because um like all of a sudden I was like so into softball so into sports and everything like that and Im still like Im still like that         But it wasnt like Daddys Little Wannabe Tomboy thing anymore you know         Like I started doing more things with my mom I started doing this and I started doing that         I think that was kind of hard for him you know                     Do you think he resents that now or                     I dont think he resents it I think he kind of had to suck it up and get it over with get over it                                                               Because like he saw that like I think he saw that I was like him before I would admit that I was like him         Because he knew that I was going to do what I wanted to do without disrespecting my parents or do anything like that because I was still like not going to run out in a rampage and kind and be like a horrible person but it was just like my life now and                     And whats your major                     Theater                     Theater         How do they feel about your being a Theater major                     Uh funny         Actually my first semester at Charlotte I was a PreBusiness major to go into Marketing and Advertising because I did that in high school too         But I never wanted to do that         I did that because thats what my dad wanted me to do         And cause I was really involved in theater and stuff in high school and everything like that         And kind of like coming in to college or whatever he kind of convinced me that what else am I going to do                     Uhhuh                     If I hes like Youre not going to do anything dadada         He wasnt real supportive about it at all         But um after my first semester was over with and I had like a real Theater class I knew thats what I still wanted to do                     Really                     And so I changed my major without telling my parents                     Oh gosh                     Then they got the whole schedule thing for the next year with the tuition bill on it and everything like that and my mom was reading it and it said Major THEA and she was like What is this         She knew I was going to do it but Dad was pretty irate         Then I started paying him half the tuition bill         So                     Really                     Yeah         That was the deal for them to get off my back and let me do what I wanted to do         I pay half of my everything                     Was that hard for you                     Yeah         Because my whole first year I didnt work         But then ha ha that changed quickly         Well actually when I went the whole first year the whole first semester because I worked at the pool on campus for a year                     Uhhuh                     That was horrible                     Uhhuh                     Because Im like a lifeguard every summer and this year I had to get a winter job all year         And its hard to go from having like your whole day to go to classes and do whatever you want to do and space out everything then like having to like drive across town and go to work         Just to be able to have a job because Im not a big work fan         Thats probably why Im a theater major so I can kind of you know do what plays I want and then move on                     Do you think theyve become more ex do you think theyve accepted more what youve decided to do or thats going to take a while         Or if they ever will at all                     Um my mom has because she knows how important it is to me and everything like that and my dad actually two weeks ago when I went home I dont even remember why I went home but I went home for something and hes like hes still trying to convince me to double major         To have something to fall back on and everything like that         And Im like Im trying to convince him to you know if I dont make it and theres a strong possibility I wont I know that Im not stupid Im nor going to go to LA and make five million or more than that                                 Right                                       And do all that and I mean if I dont make it my lifes not going to be over or something like I cant go back to school                     So youll go back to school if that doesnt work out                     Yeah                     Did you tell parents that                     I think they know         My mom knows         My dad he I dont know he doesnt think Im stupid but he doesnt he wants better for me than what he has         He thinks you know its just kind of that whole thing he wants me to get everything now because he thinks once youre his age its too late         But he realizes its not like that         He could go and make more his self if he would get off his butt and do it                     What does he do         What does he do for a living                     Hes a brick mason which he builds like buildings                     Oh                     And hes been doing that since he got out of the hospital         He went to college for two weeks and dropped out                     Oh youre kidding                     Yeah         Like neither like Im the first one in my family to go to college on my dads side                     That must be a really big deal                     Yeah         It is         Thats why its such like a big thing because my uncle he went he went into the military and then came out         I dont know what he sells like cars or something                  And like my cousins like one of my cousins hes just like slack he dropped out of high school his senior year                              So Im kind of like the hope I guess                     Thats a little bit of pressure though                     I guess         I dont I kind of dont think about that though because Im like my life is my life you know         And like my familys a big part of it         I love them all to death but what they do doesnt like reflect who I am                     Right                     you know         And stuff like that         Im kind of going to do what Im going to do         Thats why I stand out in my family         I think thats why they expect so much more of me         It kind of gets tiring and thats what I dont like you know I dont like to talk about myself when I go around my family         You know theyre all like Oh good         Dadadadada         Im like                     Do they praise you a lot                     Yeah                     And you dont like that         I love it                     I do but it gets to a point where like I feel like if I fail its just going to be like way too much for everybody         And I dont know its like my grandparents Im the youngest one         Im the only girl you know besides my cousins kids who are like two and three                     Uhhuh                     So nobody knows what theyre going to be yet and considering Chris is raising them that doesnt you know say too much for them two little girls                              Whose girls                     My cousins                              Oh         Oh yeah                              Im making my family sound really bad but theyre really not that bad                     No         Everybodys family is different         What does your mom do                     Shes a she works in a warehouse now actually         She used to be a waitress for the longest longest time         Now she works at US Aid         She does packages like First Aid stuff                     Does she like what she does                     Uh no                  No she doesnt at all         She waits tables like one night a week at another job to help put me through and everything like that         So                     What do you do         Where where are you working now                     Now Im starting my whole lifeguard thing this summer         Im opening up like five pools and theyre giving me a headache because they all turned green today so thats like the most fun job for me         This is the fourth summer Ive done it         So now Im going to run three pools over the summer                     A big responsibility                     Yeah but Ive done it for so long Im used to like lifeguard and like everything like that         Last year I managed one pool and the other pools are kind of small and like a few of our sisters are working for me         So thatll TAPE  SIDE B                     work on stage and then go to LA and work in movies to begin with anyway                     So you wouldnt stay in Charlotte         Your parents will be sad                     They know         Ive told them         My dad still doesnt believe me         My mom believes me because she knows Ill go         But um Its not like Ill never come back and visit or anything like that         Like I mean if lets say I make it really big you know big famous person or whatever Ill live here         And then Ill go and everything like that when Im big enough to make my decisions on when people are sending me scripts by then instead of me having to like audition and stuff                     You have a good attitude about it though         Thats good though you need to I guess                     You cant go into it and be like Oh         Im going to be a big movie star one day         and everything like that because the people like that are the ones that are disappointed the most and then like end up nowhere                     Right                     You know like I know one day Ill have to sit down and decide if Im where I want to be in life or if Im not         And if Im not Ive got to do something about it                     Thats a good attitude         Well I definitely think youre going to do something with it and I want to thank you for talking to us                     No problem                     Bye
