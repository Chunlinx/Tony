        got to discuss movies you seen a movie recently Mark     uh yeah as a matter of fact uh most recently i saw uh  Dead Again   ive heard that was real good   yeah i liked i liked it uh i went with a girlfriend of mine   and enjoyed it huh whos the star   yeah its oh jeez  you know i dont even remember now   but it was good is it its not a comedy is it   no its uh   oh i know uh yeah i know the movie youre talking about yeah that guy and his wife star in it Brannigan or something   yeah yeah i cant i cant even remember whos in it   yeah yeah where they were married years before or something   yeah they were they were married and then uh so the lets see who was it the the the maid the maid kills the wife and then the the husband yeah the   yeah yeah i know what youre talking about Kenneth Braun oh really i didnt know the story but i knew it got a good review   yeah the maid kills the wife and the husband dies years later something and they both come back as new people and it all kind of happens again   uhhuh uhhuh i bet that was interesting sounds interesting   it was it was kind of strange yeah   well i had the i i read the most reviews dont see too many movies we rent a few on   yeah   we dont go to them but i do enjoy a good movie i guess uh the most recent one i can think of that i saw was uh on the TV on the you know rental was Home Again did you see that Home Alone i mean   yeah yeah i saw that uh just a couple weeks ago as a matter of fact i finally got to see it   did you well its been a little longer than that since i saw it but it was the first time i seen it and i thought boy about three fourths of the way boy i thought what a i cant believe this movie is so highly rated   yeah   until about the last ten fifteen to twenty thirty minutes of it then it then i was just rolling in the floor it was just hilarious   yeah i think thats what it i think thats what it is is its that last you know fifteen thirty minutes or so that people really get into it and they go hey this is a good movie   but i was really bored with it for so long that would made the movie yeah it really is it was just hilarious but i did enjoy that well what else have you seen lately   yeah uh  i also saw uh the last of the uh Nightmare on Elm Street series uh   i never have seen any of those they must be good i like some of those kind of movies was this one pretty good   yeah um this this last one here wasnt very good at all it was it was only like an hour and a half long hour and fifteen minutes   it wasnt uhhuh oh really i cant believe it was so short   and uh it was i mean it was just boom its over and and it wasnt very good the the three D effect that they have for the last twenty minutes of it was   uhhuh   one of the worst ive seen yeah its its   uhhuh and it truly is supposed to be the last of that series isnt it   yeah it is um the uh   maybe its a good thing they bury it huh   well the the writer director of the series is is going on to a new plot of of horror  i i i saw his new movie commercial on the other day i dont remember what its called     oh really   yeah   so hes moving on uhhuh   yeah on to another another topic of of horror yeah   of horror film  well well its been   when you when you when you do it for so long its all you ever basically know how to do is horror films   well that but if you you know if its probably made him a extremely rich man too if its successful i guess just keep with it  go to a different   yeah most likely yeah   different territory seem thats sure done wonders for old Stephen King hasnt it   yeah really  even even even with crazy women that try to claim that he stole their story and stuff like that   writing all those horror yeah isnt that crazy i dont think he did do you     no hes hes got too much integrity to do something like that yeah it it just   that and hes too successful and and too too warped a mind   i i think it just happened that some woman looked like you know kind of the character and everything and she decided well i can just say this is my story and   sure yeah and they say oh thats mine he stole theyre trying to get some money thats all basically all theyre trying to do i i would think anyway   yeah yeah   but uh but i cant lets see im trying to think of another movie that ive seen lately and i cant think of   i i saw another rented one uh friend of mine rented it i cant remember the name of it   isnt that funny you see them   must not have been good if i cant remember the name   you see them all the time and when you try to recall   yeah yeah you you ive ive watched so many movies here in the last few months just you know seeing ones that i havent seen before   uhhuh well its good entertainment and its its so easy to do   yeah you can go to Blockbuster and get you a movie and you know three or four people can watch it rather than paying six seven dollars and   uh yeah yeah Blockbusters so successful i we dont go to them we just go  we dont watch that many but when we do we just go up here to Kroger because on Tuesday theyre ninety nine cents each for all their movies if you get down there in the morning you can you know get some pretty darn good movies   yeah yeah yeah   but uh but boy Blockbuster lot of people do go to them dont they   yeah i ive got a a membership card at two different Blockbusters i   uhhuh oh one one would doesnt work at all of them   no they they they issue a different card for each Blockbuster its its got their their particular address on it and stuff so that you dont try to take movies back to the wrong Blockbuster   got to have each oh uhhuh yeah oh i see well and its successful the way theyre running it so cant knock it   yeah i i i had moved for a while and thats when i got the other one and then i came back home so i   uhhuh and you live in Richardson my wife just made her call she talked to someone in Plano   do
