VirginiaIncorporated and Hugh F ODonnell its executive directorcollectively CCLS appeal an order of the district courtgranting judgment in favor of the Legal Services Corporation andtwo of its officers collectively the LSC on CCLSs claims thatvarious actions by the LSC exceeded its statutory and regulatoryauthority For the reasons set forth below we conclude thatCongress has not authorized judicial review of these claims Wetherefore vacate and remand with instructions to dismissIIn  Congress enacted the Legal Service Corporation ActLSCA which created the LSC for the purpose of providing legalassistance to indigent people in civil matters See  USCA  West  The LSC does not itself provide legal servicesbut rather grants federal funds to legal services programs acrossthe country CCLS which provides legal services to indigent peoplein the coalfields region of southwestern Virginia has been an LSCgrantee since ODONNELL v EIDLEMANThis litigation involves CCLSs challenge to certain actionstaken by the LSC in connection with the LSCs consolidation ofservices areas undertaken as a costcutting measure andimplementation of a competitive bidding program for grant moneyFollowing a bench trial the district court rejected CCLSs claimson the meritsIIIn our recent decision in Regional Management Corp v LegalServices Corp  Fd  th Cir  we concluded that adecision by the LSC regarding certain lobbying practices by grantrecipients was not subject to judicial review in an action by alender claiming injury as a result of such lobbying See ReglMgmt  Fd at  First we concluded that the LSC is nota federal agency for purposes of judicial review under theAdministrative Procedures Act See id at  Second we held thatthe LSCA did not explicitly authorize a private right of actionagainst the LSC See id Finally we determined that there wasno basis for finding that Congress intended to create an impliedprivate right of action against the LSC IdIn determining that Congress did not implicitly establish aright of action we considered the four factors set forth in Cortv Ash US    internal quotation marks omitted whetherthe plaintiff is one of the class for whose especialbenefit the statute was enacted  whether there is anyindication of legislative intent explicit or implicit either tocreate such a remedy or to deny one  whether it isconsistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative schemeto imply such a remedy and  whether the cause of action isone traditionally relegated to state law in an area basically theconcern of the States so that it would be inappropriate to infer acause of action based solely on federal law We determined thatthe first Cort factor was controlling Lenders affected by thelobbying activities of LSC grantees were not part of any specialclass to be benefitted by the LSCA Regl Mgmt  Fd at internal quotation marks omitted Rather we noted that Congressspecifically intended the LSCA to benefit indigents who have legalgrievances but who are unable to afford the legal means necessaryto redress them Id internal quotation marks omittedODONNELL v EIDLEMANThe reasoning of Regional Management is controlling here As weheld in Regional Management the LSCA was intended by Congress forthe especial benefit of indigent persons in need of legalservices Although legal services programs such as CCLS are anintegral part of the process of delivering those services theprograms themselves are not the beneficiaries of the Act BecauseCCLS is not part of the class Congress sought to benefit inenacting the LSCA we must conclude that Congress did not intend toimply a private cause of action by CCLS to challenge the LSCsexercise of its statutory and regulatory dutiesIIIFor the reasons set forth above we conclude that the districtcourt was without authority to review the actions of the LSCAccordingly we vacate the order of the district court and remandwith instructions to dismissVACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONSWe note that three other circuits have concluded that rationalbasis judicial review is available for decisions of the LSC thataffect grantees See Tex Rural Legal Aid Inc v Legal ServsCorp  Fd  DC Cir  San Juan Legal Servs Inc v Legal ServsCorp  Fd   st Cir  Spokane County LegalServs Inc v Legal Servs Corp  Fd   th Cir We find these cases distinguishable for the reasons statedin Regional Management
