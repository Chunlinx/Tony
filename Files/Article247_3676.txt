                                 Did Taiwan Shake All Day                        The day after Taiwans massive earthquake newspapers reported that therehad already been more than  aftershocks Even using conservativeestimates this implies at least one aftershock every minute for more than hours Could this be true            Yes Most large earthquakes produce thousands of aftershocks but themajority of them are imperceptible And although Taiwans reported rate isabove average it is not considered extraordinary            Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of pressure that has built upbetween two tectonic plates Because the stress is rarely discharged in asingle jolt earthquakes almost always occur in clusters first a few smallforeshocks then the strongest quake or mainshock then aftershocks Anaftershock is defined as a quake that occurs on or near the original faultusually within  miles of the epicenter and before the regions seismicactivity has returned to normal            Some faults such as the San Andreas in Southern California are seismicallyactive long after a major quake and can experience aftershocks up to a decadelater But most aftershocks happen soon after the primary quake In factseismologists have a rough method for predicting the number of aftershocks on agiven day It declines in inverse proportion to the time since the mainshockie day four has onefourth the number of quakes as day one            Experts estimate that  percent of aftershocks are below  on the Richterscale and not generally perceived by people Click here for agood explanation of the Richter scale and here for the effects of various quakes In the three hoursfollowing Taiwans mainshock for example there were only seven quakes thatwould have done more than lightly rattle dishes So Taiwan was technicallyshaking all day But most people probably didnt know it            Next question                           Explainer thanks                                  Slate                               reader Tom Castle forsubmitting this question and Professor Leon Peng of the Southern CaliforniaEarthquake Center and Bill Smith of the US Geological Survey EarthquakeInformation Center for helping to answer it
