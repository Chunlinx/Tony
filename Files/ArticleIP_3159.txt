                                 Brother From Another Planet            In  the jazz pianistknown as Sun Ra recorded a remarkable album Jazz in Silhouette  Bornealoft by splendid dancing melodies and oftenstartling syncopation Jazz inSilhouette soared in the manner of Duke Ellington The compositions wereingeniously conceived suites where a boppish swing might break into a Cubanchachacha or a trumpets eerie whisper into a thunderous row of pianoclusters The best Sun on vinyl Jazz in Silhouette is also the mostobscure Click for a clip from the album            Thatsbecause Sun Ras reputation was established not by Jazz in Silhouettebut by albums like the  Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra  whosegarrulous improvisations and expressionist timbresdevoid of a tonal centerwith much less of a tune to hang on tomade it an exemplary statement of freejazz From a strictly aesthetic perspective neither of the two volumes ofHeliocentric Worlds holds up well against freejazz albums from the sameyear by Cecil Taylor John Coltrane and Don Cherry The saxophones crybalefully the drums rumble ominously the marimba echoes warmlyyet thecombined effect is more curious than moving Click for a clip fromHeliocentric Worlds             But then as John F Szwed makes clear in his newbiography Space Is the Place The Lives and Times of Sun Ra  Sun Ranever aspired to conventional lyricism he wished to recreate the roars andthe silences of the cosmos And in Heliocentric Worlds  he forged anoriginal style intended to do just that Rejecting chordsthe traditionalfoundation of improvisationas an impediment to creativity Sun Ra favored themore supple backdrop provided by a hypnotically sustained drone or spacekey This freed his sidemen to pursue the music in their headsa fairlyturbulent journey as it turned out Even today the music sounds pretty farout clanging with esoteric percussion electronic distortion and novelinstrumental voicings Heliocentric Worlds was also an expression of SunRas persona a persona so extraordinary it ended up casting a permanent shadowover his art The cover illustration of the second volume linked Sun Ra to avisionary heritage of space explorers including da Vinci Copernicus GalileoPythagoras and Tycho Brahe The songs were interstellar tone poems bearingtitles like Cosmic Chaos and Outer Nothingness            Sun Rasfascination with outer space was no publicity stunt Born Herman Blount inBirmingham Ala he took the name of the Egyptian sun god in  Sun Ragenuinely and fervently believed that he was a visitor from Saturn He deniedthat he had been born and therefore that he would diea claim he maintainedright until he died at age  in  A short rotund black man dour ofexpression he appeared in garish flowing robes a shining turban and spacegoggles For nearly four decades this cosmic jazz messenger performed livedand traveled across the world with an entourage of Afrofuturist troubadourscalled Arkestra a cross between ark and orchestra Sun Ras menbelieved in the myth of their leaders origins and like him waited to berescued from Earth by alien spaceships According to Art Blakey Arkestrasaxophonist John Gilmore often boasted about his fans on Mars or Jupiter Thebands concerts were filled with dance light shows midgets fire breathingand space chants            Unlike most jazz musicians Sun Ra was not achild of the black bourgeoisie Poor and fatherless he grew up in sBirmingham one of the most segregated cities in the country As an adolescenthe was afflicted by cryptorchidism an especially ferocious hernia Terrifiedthat others might find out and that he might be treated as a freak he becamea recluse burying himself in music When not practicing piano he was delvinginto mystical treatises at the blackrun Masonic Lodge Declaring himself aconscientious objector to World War II he directed a poignant appeal to theNational Service Board I dont see how the government or anyone else couldexpect me to agree to being judged by the standards of a normal person            Sun Rasstruggle with disability is the real revelation of Szweds book Oddly enoughhe neglects to mention Sun Ras apparent homosexuality to which jazzaficionados refer as if it were common knowledge Unfortunately Szwed doesnot explore it enough Might it help explain Sun Ras attraction to theosophyhis repudiation of physical reality as a prison his conviction that ourbodies are mere vehicles his obsession with secret layers of meaning Sun Rahinted at such connections to the tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin I must befrom someplace else because Im a total misfit Many of us have entertainedsuch a thought about ourselves The difference is that Sun Ra actually came tobelieve it Theres a tale here as rich as and in some ways akin to MarshallApplewhites            Like many s outcasts Sun Ra came into his own in thes He was honored as an elder statesman of the avantgarde housed inOakland by Bobby Seale hired as a guest lecturer at Berkeley embraced bywhite hippies His appeal to different constituencies isnt hard to fathom Toflower children the Arkestra was a commune to black admirers a blackcommune The bands ensemble structure seemed to prefigure the black musiccooperatives then being set up in Chicago St Louis and Los Angeles as wellas such emerging family funk bands as Sly and the Family Stone In  theeccentric funk pioneer George Clinton said of Sun Ra This boy was definitelyout to lunchthe same place I eat at It was a compliment            Sun Ra sawhimself as a charismatic leader who would deliver his followers throughpatriarchal discipline The anarchism of his music was deceptive Sun Rasdream was to rule something like an intergalactic Singapore Music hebelieved provided a model for government That model combined futurismEgyptology and black uplift In the postSputnik age Sun Ra argued it wasincumbent upon black musicians to master electronic instruments notably theMoog synthesizer As he put it Black people are behind on these things andtheyve got to catch up If Sun Ra were around today he would almost surelybe an Internet zealotas is for example Ornette Coleman whose performancepiece Tone Dialing  owes much to Sun Ra            His followers were to achieve transcendencethrough selfabnegation In living with Sun Ra Arkestra members renounceddrink drugs and sex Until the moment of emigration to space Sun Ras wordwas the law He could wake up the men in the middle of the night if he desiredfor rehearsal or for a windy lecture on ancient Egypt Those who crossed himrisked corporal punishment Were less than his pupils explained oneArkestra musician Were nobodies with the master Gilmore a brilliant tenorsaxophonist who influenced Coltrane and played with both Blakey and MilesDavis gave up what was bound to be a distinguished solo career to play withSun Ra for four decades He never led his own group            How was Sun Ra able tocommand this kind of sacrifice Szwed stresses the musicians affiliations witha powerful current of black American prophecy From slaves dreams of beingtransported magically back to Africa to Toni Morrisons Song of Solomon the idea of a miraculous exodus has loomed large in black American narrativesIts understandable why this fantasy of flight would take root in blackAmerica which at numerous moments in its history has been given reason tofear that conditions in the diaspora can never be improved Sun Ras spaceshipsdid not come as it were out of nowhere But Szwed overlooks a crucialdistinction between Sun Ra and his forebears He and his associates werentoperating at the level of metaphor Like the Nation of Islam which claimsElijah Muhammad is currently circling Earth on a space shuttle Sun Ra made hisvision of liberation in Saturn the ideological bedrock of a rigorous theologyorganization and enterprise There is a word for organizations that obey acharismatic leader uphold fantastic founding myths and assemble a body ofsecretive lore but Szwed cant bring himself to call the Arkestra a cult Itstoo bad hes squeamish As a jazz composer Sun Ra never fulfilled the brightpromise of his early recordings like Jazz in Silhouette  But by foundinga cult he earned a lasting place in the larger culture which otherwise mighthave eluded him
