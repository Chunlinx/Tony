              okay what uh TV shows do you like and what do you watch   well i i tend to be a a uh sports news and uh not very many of the modern sitcoms   uhhuh   what about what about yourself   well uh i like a variety of things you know uh the like the sitcom wise i like uh Major Dad im in the im in the Navy so i kind of you know can associate even though hes a Marine officer i uh i you know i kind of associate with that a little bit and i kind of like the way its done   yes   um i like uh Cheers i dont get to see it as often as as id like to though uh uh let me see what else oh theres some on HBO that ive uh i like its a Tales from the Crypt theyre kind of like those you know those Alfred Alfred Hitchcock Tales from His Crypt type of things i like watching that too   umhum   and uh i just uh i like you know enjoy the horror or the mystery or whatever just kind of seeing you know what the twist would be and uh same thing i like if i catch old Twilight Zone and stuff i like those so   well what i find is that outside of uh well sports because im a sports fan is the the ones that i do watch is uh Saturday Night Live   uhhuh yeah   except i i wish they didnt have so many reruns   right right   and otherwise were caught up with uh because we are pretty good at sitting down to dinner in the six to seven oclock period uh good ole Wheel of Fortune   uhhuh uhhuh   which is uh an interesting combination of a a lot of luck and uh the its probably as good a program as any for the audience to play along and see if you think youre smart or smarter then then those folks are   right   uh i have a family that is very much into sitcoms and and i have to at six oclock uh fight getting the news on versus uh having the channel changed on me because they want to watch Cosby or one of the other ones that     right right   running on one of the uh the off channels   uhhuh well thats uh i dont do it so much now i guess in the last year or so but before that i would at the same time thing were happening to me in front of the TV at a certain time i was watching Jeopardy uh Jeopardy   umhum   and i thought that was kind of interesting you know trying to answer the questions and you uh you learn some good things i thought you know pick up some interesting facts   yeah certainly more educational than Wheel of Fortune   right  but the one uh that slipped my mind but the one that i my favorite TV show right now i would say is Star Trek uh The New Generation     uhhuh   i really enjoy it its uh its uh you know i thought that i really liked the old Star Trek and this Star Trek uh is so much better you know of course the uh special effects are better and the the story lines just seem to be really good and its its uh i really like it enjoy it   umhum   and i but i always you know i i got to start getting into the habit of trying to record it on the VCR because i always forget you know the kids bedtime is a little after it starts so i kind of lose track of time putting the kids to bed and uh so i always end up missing it   umhum   but i do like that show a lot because it follows uh follows a good story line   yeah i find that it seems to me and uh maybe this is as you get older im in my mid forties now but uh uh i guess from my vantage point i think the quality of TV has gone down or else my interests have changed because there were       there were various series over the years that i would always make sure i watched and yet i find that now im theres hardly anything that that except Saturday Night Live that draws me to say i want to try to watch that i may watch something just because its on but i uh   umhum   i tend to go more to the educational channels if theres uh something that seems interesting there i just uh as i say dont find the modern sitcom very uh   umhum   well just very appealing to my interests   well there is a lot of things that interest me too that i catch catch you know as im i flip through the channels on the Discovery Channel and i do like a lot of shows on that yeah   yeah yeah do you get AE   yes uhhuh uhhuh   because thats one  we dont have cable so uh theres a few things i miss because i dont have cable and AE is one whenever im on a business trip   uhhuh   and they have it i find that it has things that are uh that interest me they have a lot of series uh i guess im into uh im a history buff so with all their reruns of uh the aviators over the ages and uh who built what planes and all that was uh   right   that type of stuff interests me   uhhuh yeah thats uh one of the things here is we we we kind of have to have cable here with the reception in the Virginia Beach area you you maybe if youre lucky get three channels okay   hum   and uh otherwise uh if you want anything more than that you need to get it you need to get uh cable TV   yeah i guess that varies from place to place being in the Dallas area because we have we have about seven without uh cable and then with cable who knows how many you can get   right right   seven seems enough   yeah  yeah that sure is plenty but uh let me see what other oh theres a new TV show out called Dinosaurs did you catch any of that   uh ive read a little bit about it but uh i havent i dont even know if its running here in Dallas It kind of shows the level of interest i have in looking at the TV schedule what times it on there   well i i dont know that its showing anymore i thought i saw it show once or twice i saw the first one you know because i was interested in seeing what it looked like and it wasnt really that good i mean you know the muppet stuff was really was was okay but uh   umhum uhhuh   the the comedy on it wasnt wasnt very very funny or anything and uh i think it might have been cut already because uh same with you i havent really paid attention but i hadnt seen it you know just glancing through the TV Guide or whatever   umhum   so it mightve been cut and uh i thought that was surprising being a new show and im sure it cost a lot of money to make   well they do but it its amazing these days if something isnt making it the word of mouth uh of people talking to each other can cause a program which gets bad reviews to uh to uh not last for very long and even though they did invest money in it   umhum umhum   that they uh its i think the comparison is like baseball managers this year they seem to uh say two weeks in uh youve had your chance time to uh     yeah   since you arent making it were going to find somebody else   yeah thats true how about any of the other shows like uh you know Thirty Something or LA Law or or uh what Shannons Deal i guess is another one   well you know LA Law seems to be real hot and in fact because of the particular business im in im not a lawyer but i work with lawyers a lot   umhum   and the lawyers seem to be very much into watching it and yet i again i have to say because of uh   umhum   uh i have not watched very many episodes of it   umhum   uh again its i dont know what i do with my time but i certainly dont spend it watching uh TV in the evenings     right right well same here usually its already by the time we get everything done its uh time to go to bed   umhum   but uh ive caught that a few times you know Thirty Something and all and uh and even LA Law and usually the episodes that i watch you know im not a fan of it or anyt hing
