        okay   so who is your favorite football team   guess i bet you cant guess   well i would say the Saints after   you got it and i want to tell you something   whats that   theyre going to go somewhere pretty shortly   yeah     yeah i think they are because theyre getting better every year   yeah   and uh they got a lot   cant call them the New Orleans Saints any more   i dont think so   no   we went to the playoffs   yeah   yeah   well im a im a Buffalo Bills fan   yeah now i like them too   from a from a long time ago so its good to its good to see the Bills doing so well now and   they are they are doing a whole bunch better whos their quarterback   yeah whats that   whos their quarterback   uh Jim Kelly   yeah yeah i like to watch them too theyre the i like to watch almost all the football but um of course i watch every Saints game that i can watch   uhhuh   but i think theyre going to i think theyre really going to do good because it seems like theyre finally all coming together   yeah   if they would just quit blowing it   well the it the the NFL draft really seems to be doing its job because got teams like like Buffalo who werent certainly werent a powerhouse uh ten years ago now theyve been able to get some good players and come around and the New Orleans the same story and uh and uh a few years ago Denver was a powerhouse and then they uh they werent getting the draft picks and now the uh other team so it seems to be uh moving around and uh to to New Orleans benefit and uh you see how look at the Cowboys now theyre uh theyre hurting   yeah umhum   and uh   really bad   yeah   but they got so much bad publicity too and i think that hurt a lot of you know people even wanting to play on their team   well yeah well well well yeah uh firing firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson what what kind of uh uh doesnt give you much respect for their team at all any team any team that that where the owner would fire Tom Landry you know is like one of the greatest coaches of all time   right right   and just because they had had a couple of bad seasons and you cant even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching   yeah yeah because all the problems i mean if you think about those years that we had the losing season of how bad i mean his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs because of uh   right   you know messing with young children and i mean it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other   right and he always and uh had a lot of trouble with injuries too   with them yeah   you know hed uh never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy and then even like uh what is it Eric Dickerson left the team you know that youre right you know like people were jumping ship right and left   umhum right   and i dont know that sounds to to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem but then the team was sold   yeah   so   but uh that Jimmy Johnson came in too though and he just you know when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided you know this is the way its going to be and it was bad   yeah   i mean it really was to me it was like its going to take them quite a while to rebuild because everything everything i mean anything that Tom Landry wanted or had he was going to change it   right   i mean its that i mean you know thats the way i felt about it but i tell you what if New Orleans ever gets a quarterback aint nobody going to beat us   well yeah     in fact nobody going to beat us then because look how good we did without a quarterback this year   i know who was the quarterback see i cant even think of who the New Orleans quarterback is   well they had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it uh Arcade was for a while and then um i cant remember that guys name the one that held out for the money and he was across the river uh i cant think of the i cant think of his name now but really we didnt have a quarterback that was the whole problem we had one guy that couldnt throw and we had one guy that couldnt run   yeah huh   and it was it was just bedlam we really didnt have a quarterback it was uh defense winning winning winning all the games   did they were they able to draft anybody this year   i dont know because you know they gave away a lot of their drafts   uhhuh   for different people for you know other places   right   so i dont know i hadnt heard you know whether they have a new one or not   well when is the NFL draft hasnt has the NFL draft even gone yet   but uh huhuh not yet but i mean i dont know whether they have one of the first you know choices of somebody that would be real good   right right well theyve yeah theyve   i mean yeah everybody gets in draft   sure   but i dont know whether theyll be far enough up where they can do any good   right   but uh   or even making the playoffs so that doesnt doesnt help you in the draft   right but we really i mean really and truly we just dont have a quarterback   yeah yeah   thats all there is to it but the players and stuff they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too because we had some you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback   umhum that was a few years ago   yeah well he was good but we every time wed get a real good player theyd treat him bad   uhhuh   and of course we had a different coach then too but theyd treat him bad and then hed leave   umhum   or either theyd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies   right   and it was weird it was like they were trying if you were good boy lets dont have you on our team you know but um this year they had all good players except for the quarterback     yeah   the quarterback all of them every one that they played i think they played uh i cant remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks but all of them were bad i mean they were terrible they could not pitch you know they couldnt even take handoffs it was terrible   hum right   but um all the other places i mean our defense was unbelievable   oh thats one its one thing yeah Buffalos lucky though to have uh Jim Kelly then now hes the number one rated quarterback in the NFL i think im pretty sure he was this past season and uh   did you get to watch any of their games yeah   then with uh uh the defense with Bruce Smith Bruce Smith there at linebacker there theyve got a very well rounded team and it seems that theyve gotten over their bickering and their fighting as they problems they had in the past and now theyre uh really playing as a good good together as a team   yeah   so   um do you watch it every Sunday   uh when i can im a im a musician and uh the band i play in uh i this is just something on the side and uh the band i play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays so i missed a lot of Sundays during   um did you ever get to watch any of the uh New Orleans games   this actually i id have to confess i dont really scope out the New Orleans games per say New Orleans just isnt isnt one of the areas ive lived in so many places ive lived in uh   im a   Denver but i dont like the Broncos theres   um   no love for the Broncos but ive lived in uh   no   uh i was born in Buffalo and i lived in uh outside of Boston for five years and then my family lives in Philadelphia now and uh so i tend to look for uh uh and i lived in Detroit too so i like uh first of all first and foremost the Bills games i want to see and then ill uh normally check out the Eagles or the Patriots and Patriots were so depressing this last year that   teams in your area i know it   yeah that uh i kind of gave up on them   yeah   but uh first and foremost the Bills i even went i went to got to go to a Bills game this year which was fun it was the the Bills Eagles game which appropriately enough   oh thats neat   fortunately the Bills won   yeah   and it was good weather   yes   we beat Buffalo in in and was it third of December   oh my goodness   and it was sunny and forty five degrees so we couldnt have done much better than that in Buffalo   no because usually its snowing  ice and rain and everything   yeah sure   but i tell you what if you get to watch some of these now i dont know how it will be this year you know but i mean these games go right down to the wire   uhhuh   it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair you know going oh no no and one uh i cant remember it was about uh it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the playoffs or not   uhhuh   so were watching the game all right the other team got the ball and we had like no we got the ball back thats the way it was and they had to kick and uh to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us   umhum   so we had to sit there you know and they cut the show off and showing started showing us another football game we did not get to see the end of the game you talk about people calling in it was wild i mean here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair you know and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another you know one that was going on   oh my gosh sure and then they changed the game right   cut us off right there the last few seconds the station finally you know how theyll put the little message down at the bottom started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had cut that off that it was the national you know   right right it was the network   uhhuh and because it was funny i mean everybody was furious i was so mad i got up and went and called  you know i couldnt believe that but almost every game that i watched it would come right down to the end we would be ahead you know but then at the very in the fourth quarter theyd let them get up there either with them or you know right ahead of them   right   and itd come right down to the end and either we made it or we didnt oh and it was it was something else i said this is the most if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl   yeah   theres no question about it because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks and the quarterbacks just didnt do anything   yeah well thats the thats the guy that counts   yes but maybe we maybe well get your guy   well i       i dont think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time
