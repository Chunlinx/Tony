        okay ill just go with you first what kind of eating out do you enjoy     okay  well i like dining out of course it means that i dont have to cook but um im a divorced woman i have one child and you know when when we dine out   right umhum   we go to like medium priced restaurants i dont i dont particularly i think its sort of a waste of money to go real to a real high priced restaurant   umhum do you go like home cooking like BlackEyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria   um yeah um not really we go  more for the um Chinese and Italian and stuff like that Mexican stuff that i cant cook  yeah   me too uhhuh Mexican uhhuh uh we do too we do the same what are your favorite places   um well i like Chinese food um uh theres a little place down on what is that Coit Road um   umhum   Chinese Pavilion or something that is really good and i like it and um i do i do like Chinese buffets   uhhuh oh yeah well we go weve gone to August Moon and we think that was real good but our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to Taiwan or May Dragon   uhhuh uhhuh   and those are excellent theyre really a nice place you could take someone to eat its not the the rinkydink Chinese decorations but its a very elegant nice place to eat  we go   right uhhuh uhhuh   very very often we go out for fajitas thats my husbands just gotten stuck and we go to On the Border   oh uhhuh   and lots of places that have uh i think Costa Rosa and some of those and get fajitas and hell just eat chips till weve got three or four baskets coming back   uhhuh   and then uh last weekend we went out for Italian also and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to wanna go eat  lasagna and  garlic bread  so we went to El Sorrento   right uhhuh uhhuh have yeah have you ever um tried Pappasitos   and it was fun you know what this is thats real funny you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church and Bob pointed to it and he said i keep hearing good things about that place were gonna have to go   oh it is delicious   thats what he said that in fact youre about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that   umhum   so i guess well have to do it he   its you always stand in line when you go but its worth the wait   thats what thats what it D Magazine said that it said there was always a line but thats probably i mean thats a good thats a good sign   umhum uhhuh  and have you ever tried um the Macaroni Grill up on   yes we did now my kids didnt like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti   uhhuh   or lasagna and most of those things were a little more northern Italy   right   and they like just the traditional theyre not very   that theyre theyre the Spaghetti Warehouse type  right yeah yeah  my little girl likes uh Spaghetti Warehouse real well  its real entertaining for her   yes they are exactly  exactly the place of the seventies umhum yeah most kids do  what do you ever go for steak just a steak and potato and salad bar that kind of thing   um not really thats a steak something that i cook at home   umhum   you know that that you grill out and i really dont particularly um   yeah well im im real curious to try this one that has such horrid commercials the uh that Del Lincoln and oh what is that guys name they do those real corny commercials   hm   its um over theres one over there in Addison i cant remember his name anyhow its some   steak   yeah its some famous steak place over in Addison theres a theres a second one downtown and they have these really corny radio commercials but their steak their steak is supposed to be wonderful so i had i had not tried that my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie   uhhuh umhum   and it seems like ive been we we found those one time and then they discontinued it was over in Addison and then they um closed up  so most of these places are pretty much just uh theme restaurants around here   hm yes right i think thats what goes you know really goes right now in the in the Dallas area of course you know down   umhum   next to downtown up around McKinney and everything you know theres just a theres a different class   uhhuh well thats exactly true  thats right   of restaurants up there that i cant even touch   thats right yeah thats right   you know itd probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and  have one meal up there but um   thats even  yeah thats right uhhuh i had a friend who was taken to Lawrys downtown for prime rib and i havent been we usually dont go for beef really anymore were weve gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that thats thats usually the way well go if were not going lasagna   uhhuh uhhuh right umhum umhum yeah when when i go out its its normally to get um some specialty type of food besides you know because you chicken and steaks and everything i grill at home   umhum umhum i know well i understand   and and really its theyre a lot better than what i get in the restaurant  thats right  saves you a little bit money   thats right and save you some money too well now what your whats your childs favorite place to eat   um favorite place uh she has a lot Taco Bell  yeah thats right   oh yeah  theyre easy  yeah  well   thats right   mine enjoy that too they like to go
