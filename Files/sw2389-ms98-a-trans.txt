                okay   if you want to go first go ahead   oh i think i think that the um womans role has come a long way weve gone more into the business aspect of uh like i say of i dont know working more and then and we i think weve even gone into more of the labor aspect of it also   yes definitely   uh with the pay and everything you know   well i feel that uh i weve missed as far as the top jobs go you know the the higher echelon   yeah uhhuh   because if you look at most corporations there isnt a woman you know thats on the board of directors or that type of thing theyre mostly all men there there may be a few but very incidental  and uh i i really think that itll be a long time probably before we see that   umhum yeah   in one sense um im im an older person in my fifties so i feel that weve lost some things in the sense that women have to work today   uhhuh   you know that that theyre not in the home by choice anymore   umhum   its most of the time you know even even if you want to say home you cant you really cant   oh and a lot of times you cant yeah   its its its you you know its its gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i dont think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff uh you know as far as your medical insurance and uh just groceries and gasoline and all this you know   umhum   so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we have were allowed to vote in you know like you say were out in the labor force but i think weve lost something too   yeah my mom um shes a housewife and well theres twelve kids in my family so my mom never could really work you know because she was kind of pregnant from day one she never really had a chance to work   oh God love her yeah   uh she worked before she got married but um she um she doesnt believe in shes very old fashioned she doesnt believe in the woman working unless she has to   thats what i mean and and you know theres a lot of truth to that if youre not going to have a family then thats fine then you you know a career is is a smart choice and i think its great   yeah umhum   but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility   umhum   and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know   umhum   uh i think that both the mother and the child lose and i think thats why theres so many problems you know with kids today because they dont have the family roots anymore   yeah   you know im not saying that that its totally gone but its nothing like what it used to be   yeah uhhuh   you know in that sense   yeah um and also like my mom my mom thinks and i mean she shes kind of right with it when both um partners of of the marriage work she feels that thats taking more away from thats thats increasing more unemployment for people that need to work   oh definitely   you know like for for the men that dont have jobs if you know she feels that if those women werent out there just because they want to do it she said that you know they could stay at home and with yeah   thats right they dont want to take care of the kids and the house and that kind of thing thats very true but then they shouldnt have a family   umhum yeah   thats what im saying you know i i think its great that women have a choice today   umhum   that there are ways to prevent families you know like those basically theres contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies theres no need to have children if you dont want them   yeah well what what do you think about that do you think that um what do what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business   thats fine that thats the freedom of choice and i i agree with that because anyone who has children that doesnt really want them isnt going to be a good parent   i uhhuh uhhuh   uh well i shouldnt say theyre not going to be a good parent they wont be a caring parent like they wont have that uh   umhum or they wont be as good as they could be   right thats thats what i mean it theyll feel like its uh a job   umhum   its its not like something that they really wanted like i had three children and i mean i i i wanted every one of them   umhum   im not sorry i had any of them and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them   yeah   you know i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible   uhhuh   in fact at one time i worked as a second shift and uh uh one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that and i was sitting there it was like i didnt belong anymore       and it was because i had worked for about nine months and when they were coming home i was going to work   uhhuh   and i wasnt there at supper time or bed time or they couldnt tell me what went on at school because theyd be coming in the door id be going out   exactly   so we were i i felt i was losing my family   uhhuh   and thats why i said thats it i either have to quit or you know try something else so i went on third shift   umhum   and i worked that shift for eleven years   oh my   yeah   Bless you   yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home   uhhuh   you know and i feel thats very important it really is and its too bad because because mothers miss out on so much too so i mean in the sense that weve come a long way yes but weve sacrificed a lot to get there   umhum yeah i i agree   and uh i really think that if uh like after second World War when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because the men werent here anymore   uhhuh   but then it got to be a point where they got some independence   and they just enjoyed the income the extra   exactly a man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries   umhum   and i notice todays uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes   umhum   and we had to walk before we had a car   exactly   and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday what what do they get they get a car   oh i know   and uh it to me its like weve lost our values in this country   uhhuh   we really have and i im not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but i i dont think if you unless you earn something and youve worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me   umhum   youll take better care of that and youll prize that possession more than someone handing something to you   exactly umhum   and its just like college too i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but i dont think you should pay the whole way   see yeah see now um my parents theres no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college and um   of course   so far theres only two of us that have gone and my older brother has paid his entire way and im on my i have six weeks left for and ill you know ill graduate and i paid my entire way and thats the way itll go down the line and   yeah   like we i dont have a car because im paying for college and if i want a car my parents always said if we wanted a car we paid for the car and we paid for our own insurance and and i think thats right because   sure but ill bet your values are a lot higher you know your your and your self esteem and the way the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense   umhum yeah   than these kids that dont have that responsibility   umhum like ive had my you know like um like i know kids up here that have their own cars their moneys just given to them like they still get their allowance theyre twenty years old and they still get an allowance   you that that   well ive held a summer job since i you know i was in the eleventh grade   sure yeah   and i have had to take care of my own money i have my own checking account i pay for my own life insurance and i know a lot of kids that dont even know what i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor you know   sure they probably dont even have any   well if they do they dont know of it you know   or yeah exactly and thats what i say youll youll be youll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but its because youve been there   uhhuh   and no one can tell anyone anything anything you know youre going to find out for yourself but i mean i dont think you should just not listen to advice even if you dont take it just listen   oh i know uhhuh   you know theres theres no harm in that whereas sometimes you cant even get that from a kid you know       just attention you know   uhhuh   but really uh what what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing women in politics and   um   president someday maybe   actually i think abortions going to take a turn where theres not going to be as many because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think   yeah yeah   i i really i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives and with the abortion it i i dont think theres going to be many abortions but i dont know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion   yeah yeah   i think itll be freedom of choice   well i i still think people have a choice i you know if you can live with it and its not you know your conscience is clear   uhhuh   then i mean all all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i dont know i mean no ones said for sure you know   exactly yeah umhum yeah   but uh   i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i definitely i think itll definitely be freedom of choice   yes yes   umhum   which i mean i think it should be anyway   i i do im Catholic and i we were not supposed to you know say that thats okay but i really feel that its freedom of choice   no yeah because i mean you as an individual what you would do that that to me is your business   i do umhum   and uh   and and different circumstances call for different things   exactly exactly thats
