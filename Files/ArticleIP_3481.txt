                                 The Cutting Edge            Back in the midsDetroits Big Three automakers saw they had a problem Nearly everyone had acar and the population wasnt growing The only way to keep making money wasto make each automobile more expensive and more profitable The goal theirmantra went was not to sell more cars but to sell more car             Themarketing strategy was to link automobiles to the glamour and speed of thesupersonic jet fighter planes that the Navy and Air Force had introduced in and  Their sweptwing and deltawing designs were sharp yet curvyaquality that was abstracted into the parabolic boomerang shapes that startedto turn up on objects such as ballpoint pens and surfaces such as Formica In Chrysler adopted a double boomerang corporate logo to symbolize what itcalled the forward look By the end of the decade American cars were bananasplits on wheels dripping with the extraneous decoration that stylists calledgorp            Flash forward to  Gillette dominates the globalshaving market Like Alexander the Greata Gillette hero because he demandedthat his soldiers shavethe Bostonbased company has no new worlds to conquerYet its lofty stock price assumes continued growth            The solution not to sellmore razors but to sell more razor The  million result the triplebladeMach  Its name means three times the speed of sound The three blades on thehead look appealingly like a tiny Venetian blindan image emblazoned on thepackage like a scene from a s noir movie The plastic package is alsoembossed with parabolas and the razor itself is festooned with them Startingin August a  million advertising campaign will show jet pilots breakingthe sound barrierand then being magically transported to their bathroomswhere theyll enjoy the quickest slickest shave in history            And yesGillette plans to charge  percent more for it than for its previoustopoftheline product the Sensor Excel By  Gillette has told analyststhe profit margin on each Mach  replacement cartridge will reach percent            Its like  all over again onlysmaller            Yet the Mach  is not thesort of retro design that evokes bygone imagery of progress with selfconsciousirony Unlike the lounge music revival its aimed not at a hip coterie but atEveryman            The Mach  razor appears tobe a sincere attempt to embody progress For the last quarter century or sodesigners have not made this a high priority Products have evoked cool RayBan sunglasses or competence Sub Zero refrigerators upperclass aspirationsRalph Lauren home furnishings or adolescent rebellion just about anysnowboard Few have tried to communicate that things are actually gettingbetter as the Mach  does            Theimmediate reaction a lower stock price for Gillette and quite a few jokes            There is on the face of it something ridiculous about athreeblade razor Gillette introduced the twinblade Trac II razor in and three years later Saturday Night Live ran a parody of a threeblademodel It featured an animation sequence that showed the second blade cuttingwhat the first one missed and the third getting even closer The tag lineBecause youll believe anything            So is thisMach  an improvement or a mockery of consumer gullibility The product itselfwont be in stores until summer so its way too early to know how the shavingpublic will respond I do know that a couple of mornings with the Mach  hasjust about wiped the smirk off my face The damned thing works            Just as the promotional copy promises I amable to shave with fewer strokes This shortens an unpleasant activity andspares me those final touchup strokes that often leave me bleeding            Since its first safety razoralmost a century ago Gillette has always conceived the actual razor mainly asan inducement for selling replacement blades Mach  represents the culminationof this trend its mainly the cartridge thats been upgraded            Gilletteclaims  improvements beyond the extra blade Somesuch as a colored strip toindicate when the blade needs replacingare aimed more at beefing up theprofit margin than at improving the shave But otherssuch as thinneredgedblades with hard coatings and individual springloaded pivots for each bladewith the Sensor the two blades pivot togethermay for all I know beresponsible for the razors improved performance            The razors body is functionally just a handle But itstill needs to communicate that the Mach  is worth the extra cost So Gilletteis touting the rubberized boomerangs on its top and bottom as gripping aids tokeep it from slipping in your hands even though the parallel ridges on theSensor line probably work about as well The difference is all in thestyling            Most of the improvements inthe Mach the tiny springs and metallurgical manipulationsarent evenvisible to the casual shopper Like the microchip and the altered gene theyfall beneath the threshold of visual perception With its outward imageryGillette is trying to evoke a midcentury aesthetic of progress identified withmilitary might brute force and speed And yet while the Mach  looks like athrowback to a time when progress took a back seat to empty stylistic gesturesdeep down inside the razor really does represent an advance
