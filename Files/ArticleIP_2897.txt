                                 The Only Living Boy in New York            I wasntpaying much attention to the inhouse music on Christmas EveI think it wasLittle Drummer Boy in the bookstore Jingle Bell Rock in the toy store ormaybe vice versabut entering the flower shop it hit me instantlyBernadette From Paul Simons Songs From the Capeman  The bit justbefore he slows the whole thing down and goes            I am SalMineo and I need you so            Its agorgeous song Simons voice sounds as young as it did on Homeward Bound andthe number brims with all the possibilities of teen romance in those hot ssummers Ive been singing it ever since I heard the demo tape and Im gladthat that florist liked it enough to play it            But I wonder how many others will get to hear it TheCapeman  the story of an adolescent Puerto Rican killer is having a hardtime taking off The album is selling tepidly the shows been picketed byvictimsrights groups and is under threat of more pickets by Puerto Ricansopposed to racial stereotyping the openings been postponed to the end of themonth and depending on which rumor you believe the directors either socomplacent that he only bothers dropping by once a week or so dozy that hehasnt noticed hes been more or less replaced by Mike  The Graduate Nichols Nick  Miss Saigon  Hytner or most recently Jerry  Guys andDolls  Zaks            So far sonormal for a Broadway show in previews But The Capeman isnt justanother dud musical like Sideshow or The Scarlet Pimpernel  Itwas supposed to be the show that would heal the great historic rift between popmusic and theater scores the first show written specifically for Broadway by amajor rock songwriter and the one that would entice all the others in endingthe Great White Ways dependence on its shrunken nontalent pool of insipidSondheim clones            They say they want something new butthey dont really says Paul Simon They want something old Were standinga gazillion floors above Broadway about a week or so before it all began to gowrong One wouldnt want to characterize the diminutive balding rock star asbeing in Cole Porters marvelous phrase down in the depths on the th floor but a faint tinge of melancholy hangs in the air Whatdo you think he says Do you think they want something new            Theyare the elderly lizardlike survivors who preside over whats left ofBroadwaythe nonshowy showmen party bookers and theater owners into whosehands Simon has more or less delivered himself He seems genuinely befuddled bythem In the rock biz most of the executives are old too But at least theymake an effort sporting ponytails and U tour jackets they dont continuallygive the impression that they wish there was a part for Robert Goulet inwhatever it is they are working on Around Broadway the standard line is thatSimon with his reputation for arrogance and as a control freak hasdisdained their expertise            In the beginning says Simon they said tome theres about five or six people in the world who can do this and here aretheir names And I believed itwhat did I know Thats why weve been throughseveral directors Derek Walcott and I didnt want an auteur director We hadtaken years to write it so why would we want someone who says I think thispart should go over here and that character is really a woman His voicetrails away If thats arrogant             To preparefor The Capeman  Simon put himself through a dispiriting crash course inrecent Broadway attractions I saw a couple of shows I liked but most Ididnt I really liked Tommy  I liked Guys and Dolls  er I kinda liked Show Boat  But the rest of the stuff I cant say Ifound interesting One wouldnt want to exaggerate the points of contact butcuriously The Capeman is the first musical since Show Boat in to use the word niggers in its opening number            Afraid toleave the project to cross into another                      neighborhood            The blancosand the nigger gangs well theyd kill you                      if they could            Theyre not quite the first Simon lyrics to be heardonstage That distinction belongs to Leonard Bernsteins hippie theaterpiece Mass  which contains one quatrain by Simon            Half of the people arestonedAnd the other half are waiting for the next electionHalf the people aredrownedAnd the other half are swimming in the wrong direction            He justliked the lyrics says Simon I said he could have them in return foropeningnight ticketswhich he never sent me They were originally writtenfor a Zeffirelli film that Bernstein and Simon were working on Lenny fanciedhimself as pretty hip but his young collaborator wasnt impressed by the oldermans attempts at rock He played a melody and it was an awkward moment Hesaid If were going to collaborate we have to be completely honest So whatdo you think I said Well thats not very good Thats not rock n rollHe was taken aback The composer drew himself up and said huffily This isLeonard Bernstein music            If youre a bona fide rock star its hard to takeseriously the theaters nervous tiptoeing into the territory I never thoughtHair was really rock n roll says Simon but now supposedlyhegrinsits a classic Hair  Godspell  the title song ofPhantom  the current sensation Rent the rock opera that sodistracted killer Brit nanny Louise Woodward from her household duties allare unconvincing hybridsneither good rock nor good show tunes Theconventional wisdom argued by Sondheim among others is that rock is difficultto use dramatically Well I dont think its difficult retortsSimon But the people who were trying to write it werent coming from rock nrollthey were doing an impression of rock n roll And sinceeveryone knows what rock n roll sounds like it wasnt fooling very manypeople            Infairness the theater found it hard to attract genuine rockers At the end ofhis life Alan Jay Lerner author of My Fair Lady  used to bemoan thatSimon and his generation had never written for Broadway But rock lyricistsearn their reputations with the kind of elliptical poetic impenetrability thatlooks great reprinted on a  gatefold LP sleeve However when youresitting in a theater you get one chance to grab those words as theyre flyingacross the footlights at you Its a surprise then to find that TheCapeman s lyrics are more direct less allusivethat after years ofwriting more and more about himself Simon has been able to write in the voiceof characters far less articulate I dont know whether hes arrogant or acontrol freak in the studio or the rehearsal room but where it countsinthe music and lyricsyou can hear a man who is at  still trying tolearn            Just under a decade ago I did a TV specialwith Simon that was filmed partly at his office in the Brill Building Thedirector spent the morning setting up a perfect shot for the interview lookingdown Broadway the picture framed by the Cats marquee at the WinterGarden and the  nd Street billboard in Times Square Simonpeeked through the camera and said Thats just a generic shot of BroadwayThats nothing to do with who I am So everything was dismantled and the crewset up at the opposite corner of the room away from the window It was atelling image Simon was literally turning his back on Broadway            Not anymore Clearly itsstill not an entirely comfortable fit But whatever happens to TheCapeman  I hope he wont give up on the theater Theres more musicalinvention in a song like Trailways Bus than in the entire score of the muchballyhooed Ragtime  Its nothing to do with rock vs showtunes onlywith the cruel truth that most contemporary Broadway music isnt very good notpopular music not serious music but existing in some grisly limbo in betweenBroadway cant afford to kiss off a rare musical voice like Simons no matterhow much glee it might afford the Schadenfreude set Negotiating atricky midlife career change caught between rock and a hard place Paul Simonfigures that sometimes as with Graceland  the gamble pays off Everyfew years people decide theyre bored and they want something fresh So thatsa good time to have something fresh He shrugs fatalistically The rest ofthe time they say nyyah I dont get it
