        so um are you working right now     uh yes i am im working in the computer science department here uh at CMU   uh what kind of what kind of work do you do   uh im doing basically system system design work and uh implementation work for the speech   umhum   for the speech group uh here   ah what is that how you heard about this thing   yeah actually through electronic mail   uh uhhuh me too i work at uh the Georgia Tech Research Institute   umhum   um im a coop student so i work and go to school about halftime and uh i really dont have any job benefits to speak of were kind of um i dont know they just kind of forget us on that end we dont really have any vacation or you know sick days or health care or anything really so   right so your pretty theyre theyve got you slaving away at at this point  yeah well um   exactly exactly what about you     im research staff here now so what they they have uh um okay benefits package its not quite as good as industry but one of the significant um benefits here is that you can take uh up to two courses a semester um and they pay for you know pay for the classes so for Carnegie Mellon that works out to be um a reasonable a reasonable benefit   hm yeah uh they do that i think if youre uh research title staff here then i know of some of the people that have gotten their masters and i think that um they might you know pay for that pay for the classes and stuff but i know they let you theyll let you decrease how many hours you work by any kind of percentage you know theyll let you work halftime if you want to if you wanna finish you wanna   umhum if you wanted to do it quickly   yeah if theyll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about so if if you wanna get your masters and then i think of course you get like a with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so   umhum umhum   thatll probably help out but   yeah yeah so i i dont know in in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary id you know i   do you get any kind of health care type stuff   yeah we we do we have to contribute a certain amount uh to it   uhhuh   and its kind of split between CMU and and you know the employee   yeah yeah i think i mean thats pretty important thats a pretty important uh part of it there because that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems my dad i think my im still covered on with my dads uh health plan at his where he works but   right   it definitely be something to look into i guess once i get my own   yeah yeah and its also right now its uh the like everywhere else uh here in Pittsburgh the health care uh rates are are going up pretty quickly   uhhuh   thats a whole nother topic   yes   to begin with too but yeah but its youre right i i i really agree that that thats pretty important   the only i think the i guess the only real um benefit i guess you could say working for me working here besides i mean im learning and stuff because im at you know in school but   right right   theres theres some weird law where um       um student employees working for the government dont have to pay Social Security tax   umhum   oh now thats a big win   though thats about five percent right there so   yeah yeah uh thats   thats about the only real bonus   yeah   i have so i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate like how much i get paid relative you know because if i was working somewhere else id have to you know pay an extra five percent or so   yeah i figured for  and theyve just raised the um income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying   hm yeah   paying that as well yeah well if you could call it a benefit that CMU i mean the the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is is consult for um you know other companies   oh yeah   um so thats that kind of helps out in terms of you know keeping uptodate with  contacts in industry   umhum yeah i imagine thatd help a lot   you know in case you know in case you ever need to  bail out   yeah see around around here its like uh we pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors   umhum   a theres not theres not a whole lot of you know funded research from
