interesting have you made a lot of uh a lot of vases and things or   no i i do ceramics i i you know the pieces are made from a mold and i paint them   what kind of oh   uh you know you get them you clean them up you know get the uh mold line off   umhum   you know you scrape that off and uh make it as smooth as possible uh then you uh put it in a kiln and fire it you know its like a big ogen oven   umhum   and uh when you pull it out its called bisque uh it started it off with greenware when you first start off and then it goes to bisque and thats when you can paint it   huh do you have your own kiln or do you do you   no ive uh you you can rent peoples kiln they they uh you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and uh pay them theres one woman that charge ten dollars a month for fire all that i wanted   oh oh well that that doesnt sound like its too expensive a hobby does uh does the uh clay and and the paints and things are they expensive   the paints and stuff can get expensive the greenware it depends on what you buy now i bought a a chess set for my husband and painted it for him and id say the greenware for you know twenty four pieces i think is what theyre no no thirty two pieces is a was cost cost me about eight dollars   umhum well that doesnt sound very expensive to me   no i liked it i had fun with it but uh you know uh im a little shaky when it comes to detail work so i couldnt get the fine pieces so you know i had to   umhum   get parts that had big spaces in them   yeah   uh couldnt do the fine detailed fine detail on it   hum   but uh you know i made my son his uh Donald Duck and you know the Disney characters painted them for him in real bright colors   uhhuh   and uh he enjoyed them till he was about two and then he uh had fun throwing them and broke them   hm oh no well   and that was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and he just kept giving them to him and letting him breaking them   well children will tend to do that   yeah well i didnt get mad at the kid i got mad at my husband for giving them to him   oh well i i i enjoy working out when i i get home from work just to just to have something
