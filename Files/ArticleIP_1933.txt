                                 Soft Microeconomics            I wrote this piece inWordPerfect not Word mainly because Words equation editor is awful are youlistening Mr Myhrvold and I may as well use the same software for plainEnglish articles and professional gobbledygook I surf with Netscape Navigatorand check email in Eudora So I am not a fan of Microsofts productsMoreover for reasons explained below it is in the public interest to haveBill Gates always running a bit scared of the Justice Department Nonethelessthe more antiMS propaganda I read the more proMS I get There is acase against Microsoft but it is not the one you hear and I would hate to seecrude misunderstandings posing as sophisticated analysis prevail            Probably the first thing oneought to say is that the public has no interest in helping Bill Gates rivalsfor their own sake Its easy to think of the people who run software companiesother than Microsoft as underdogs fighting Big Bad Bill But those littleguys are no more in need of extra money than Gates is and if allowing him toget an extra billion at Larry Ellisonsor even Marc Andreesensexpense isgood for the rest of us so be it Those of us who do not get paid in softwarestock options should not allow ourselves to become pawns either way instruggles among those who do            So whatis the public interest            The case for leaving Microsoft alone does not rest on somenaive faith in the perfection of free markets Software is an industrycharacterized by powerful increasing returns in both production andconsumption The more units Netscape ships the lower its per unit cost themore copies of Navigator in use the more attractive it is to the typical userThese increasing returns make the kind of atomistic perfect competition thatprevails in the market for say wheat impossible in the market for browsers orword processors Necessarily each type of product will in the end be producedby only a few companies perhaps only one            But howdoes this concentration of production take place One of the depressing thingsabout public discussion of the Microsoft case even among supposedlywellinformed people is that much of it has come to be dominated by abasically primitive view about what increasing returns do to marketsnamelythat they convey monopoly power purely randomly on whoever happens to be inthe right place at the right timeand that this path dependence allowsclearly inferior technologies to become locked in Now path dependence hasits placebut when applied to the Microsoft case it misses the point Afterall hightechnology companies are themselves quite aware of increasingreturns and their strategiesabove all the prices they charge when they aretrying to establish themselves in a marketare very much affected by thatawareness            Consider for example one particular form ofincreasing returns The socalled learning curve which says the more unitsof something you have already produced the lower the cost of producing thenext one You might think this means that whoever gets into a market first willsimply have a snowballing advantage But as Stanfords Michael Spence pointedout in a classic yearold paper on this subject profitmaximizingcompanies that know they face a learning curve will compete fiercely to movedown it more rapidly selling cheaply in the early stages of a product cycleand therefore losing money in the hope of making the money back later            The samelogic applies to increasing returns on the demand side As a manufacturer if Iknow that a typical customers choice of browser depends both on the price andon the number of other people using that browser I will initially make my ownbrowser cheapmaybe even freeso as to build market share In either case Imust incur initial losses that are in effect part of the price of entry intothe marketan addon to the cost of developing a product in the first placeAnd because nobody will want to pay this entry fee without a reasonable hope ofearning it back only a few companies will enter a market subject to strongincreasing returns The point is that the eventual domination of an industry bya few companiesand a high rate of profit on sales for these companies in thelater stages of the cycledoesnt happen because these companies just happenedto get a head start On the contrary it is precisely because it isntpurely a matter of luckbecause everyone competes so fiercely on prices in aneffort to get some of those nice increasing returnsthat only a few dareenter            Of course there is also an element of luck Itsnot true that whoever gets a head start always dominates the marketif acompany has a small head start but offers a clearly inferior product or hasclearly higher costs rivals can and will overtake it But nobody can be surejust what an asyet undeveloped product will cost to produce or how it will goover with consumers Thus competition in a market characterized by increasingreturns isas it must bea sort of demolition derby in which only some ofthose who enter cross the finish line Those who do make it across the finishline will typically make big profits But this profitability is necessary tothe enterprise Who will enter a demolition derby without the             So this isthe case for leaving Microsoft alone Hightech competition is necessarily acompetition that ends up being won by a handful of players Those who make vastfortunes may not always be the most deservingbut so what For the rest of uswhat matters is not who wins or loses but how they play the game And if theyknow or suspect that too much success will be punishedthat anyone who doestoo well will become a target of envydriven litigationthey will have thatmuch less incentive to play hard            Now there is of course also a case againstMicrosoft Never mind the crude complaint that it is too big or tooprofitable or that nerdy types tend to dislike its products The real concernis that because Microsofts victory in an earlier derby happens to have givenit control over a particularly strategic part of the industrybecause itsupplies operating systemsit is in a position to squeeze out rival suppliersof other software And that is a real concern If Microsoft had for examplewritten Windows  in a way that made it hard or even impossible for me to useWordPerfect the Justice Department would have been absolutely justified incalling out the arsonists            But thefact is that MS has been very careful not to use its undoubted power topractice any crude obvious version of what is known in the trade as verticalforeclosure WordPerfect and Netscape work just fine on my Windowsbasedmachine This restraint may partly reflect Microsofts market strategyafterall Microsoft beat Apple partly because Apple did practice verticalforeclosure and as a result inhibited the development of complementarysoftware although the main problem was Apples persistent belief despite allthe evidence to the contrary that everyone would be willing to pay a premiumprice for a niftier machine For sure however Microsoft has mainly beenrestrained by the knowledge that any crude use of its power would indeed landit in court            And yet despite all that restraint Microsoft is in courtanyway Any nontechnologist ventures into the browser wars at his peril buthere is how I understand it After initially missing the significance of theInternet Microsoft has gone to the other extreme designing Windows  so thatit uses an Internetlike metaphor for everything It makes sense then for abrowser that can find both internal and external documents to be an integralpart of the systemunless that is you regard browsers and operating systemsas still basically different things and view Microsoft as practicing verticalforeclosure under the guise of product enhancement Well maybebut its apretty subtle point Microsoft isnt preventing anyone from using Netscape orcharging Netscape for the right of access its providing Internet Explorerfree but then that would be normal practice in this kind of industry even ifIE wasnt allegedly an integral part of Windows  You can argue thatMicrosoft has stepped across the line on this onebut surely by only a fewinches            Heres what worries me Giventhe subtlety of the real issues here what is the chance that this stuff willbe decided on its merits When you hear that despite the fact that he haseconomists who know better the Justice Departments Joel Klein apparentlyeither believes or chooses to claim that this case is about pathdependence you start to wonder And when you hear that the antiMicrosoft sidehas retained the services of that economic and technology expert Bob Dole youstart to despair
