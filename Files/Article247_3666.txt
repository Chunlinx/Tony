banks might have been used to launder  billionin Russian funds Banks the paper mentions by name as suspected FleetFinancial Group BankBoston and JP Morgan None of these banks norpreviously identified ones like the Bank of New York are accused ofwrongdoing although USAT mentions as does afrontpage NYT reefer that in congressionaltestimony Wednesday the BoNY CEO said some of his banks employees used

development is tucked withlittle ado midway into an inside story about the reorganization of theDepartment of Energy            The papers explain that the governments civil fraudsuit seeks to recover the federal monies spent over the years onsmokingrelated health care through Medicare as well as through the budgetsfor military personnel and federal civilian employees expenses not covered insettlements the tobacco manufacturers previously made of suits where statesfiled to recover their smokingrelated healthcosts Its also noted that the civil filing despite its appeal to aracketeering statute marks the end of the governments attempt to bringcriminal charges against the tobacco companies            The LAT andWP accounts of the suit go higher with theindustrys adamant response that it will never settle this case out of courtThe Wall StreetJournals report says in its first paragraph that the suit is based ona risky interpretation of federal law One question that doesnt getaddressed How do the tobacco companies reconcile their denial of this suitwith their settlement of the state actions            The two Times stories agreethat the FBIs China spying doover means that itsoriginal effort focusing on one scientist Wen Ho Lee at one lab LosAlamos was inadequate But the NYT  which ranhard with stories raising suspicions about Lee earlier this year is rathermeasured about where this leaves things settling for the bureau does not yethave any new suspects The LAT is much harshersaying the Lee allegation has effectively evaporated            The WP

making more than  a year to  who do The piece quotes various city employees defending the practice ongrounds of competitiveness etc but never cites any baseline specifics aboutwhat most people make It
