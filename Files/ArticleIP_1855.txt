                                 Bob Dylan            In recent photos Ive seenof Bob Dylan hes wearing a lopsided bemused grin the smile of someone whocant quite believe whats happening to him If you were Dylan youd bepuzzled too In December President Clinton and Washingtons elite paid homageto the singer at the Kennedy Center Honorsan event that usually celebratesold respectables such as Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra Dylan shaved and even worea tuxedo Last week it was the recording industrys turn to suck up to DylanHaving all but shut Dylan out of the Grammies for the last  years itlavished three awards on his new record Time Out of Mind  includingAlbum of the Year            There isgeneral agreement that the Dylan honors signify Something Very Important aboutthe s The most popular explanation is a political one Dylan in a tux isthe final ironic nail in the counterculture coffin The establishment hasfinally coopted the ultimate antiestablishment figure Dylan the story goeswas the icon for the lefty politics of the s He sang Blowin in the Windand Masters of War and was the role model for a generation of protestorsOnce he sang Dont follow leaders Nowsniffhes hanging out withClinton            But this is a misapprehension of Dylan He was never asmuch of a counterculturist as his fans believed and he was certainly nevermuch of a politico Except for a brief awkward foray into the civilrightsmovement Dylan essentially ignored political activism during the s At atime when every musician spoke out against the Vietnam War Dylan did not Heignored presidential campaigns and lefty crusades He never preached or muchsympathized with hippie rhetoric He denied and still denies that his songshad a political significance He licensed The Times They Are AChangin  fora bank advertisement            If thereis a decade of which Dylan is a symbol its the s He has always pursuedselfactualization rather than protest artistic fulfillment rather thanpolitics Pause for requisite Dylan mantra He not busy being born is busydying For a personalgrowth slogan this is pretty gloomy But it is apretty grim song Neocons have always claimed that narcissism not ideologyinspired the rebelliousness of Dylans generation Dylan the most inwardlooking of musicians a selfish genius gives that claim credence            Other musicians pander to their public Dylanhas built a career designed to satisfy no one but himself In  forexample Dylan went electric abandoning folks soft sound earnest politicsand rabidly loyal fans When some pop musicians turned to psychedelia in thelate s this one stripped his songs down and played basic American countryA decade later at a time of high hedonism he found Jesus and composed gospelmusic Dylan who modeled himself on James Dean spent a vast amount of timeaway from music trying to build a movie careerdespite a total absence ofacting charisma            Throughout his career Dylan has frustrated fans by deconstructing his goldenoldies When he plays his hits in concerts Dylan often twists them garblingtheir lyrics and sandblasting their melodies into strange new creationsAnyone who has attended a Dylan show in the past  years knows the feelingHe plays a song youve always loved and you cant even recognize itThat was Tangled Up in Blue            Dylan got bad but he never got stale His constantreinvention and his constant touring saved him from rock geezerhood If you goto a Rolling Stones or Eagles concertand I strongly advise againstitthreequarters of the crowd will be paunchy baby boomers reliving theirglory days Theyll sing along to yearold songs performed exactly as theywere  years ago Were there any more embarrassing five minutes during theGrammies than Fleetwood Macs performance Bloated sloppy and greedy theband regurgitated a medley of s hits to vast applause But Dylan has beentouring nonstop since  winning over an entire generation of fans to hismusic both new and old America may be waxing nostalgic over Dylan but therehas never been a musician less concerned with nostalgia            In an age when celebritiesexpose themselves promiscuously Dylan rejects public selfrevelation Is thereany star about whom we know less Its not that Dylans invisible He plays concerts a year and he does occasional interviews But he says little abouthis music and nothing about his life His marriage his divorce his personallife All are ciphers in the public consciousness            He hasmellowed slightly since his younger days when he took pleasure in torturingthe press                           Reporter What do you do with your money                           Dylan I wear it                           Anotherreporter What are your songs about                           Dylan Some of my songs are about four minutes some are about fiveminutes and some believe it or not are about  or             And Dylan never schmoozed much within the musicbusiness His failure to win Grammies during the s was hardly a surpriseThe Grammies have always trailed hipness by a decade or more In the midswhen Dylan was at his peak Herb Alpert was winning Album of the Year awardsRecently the Grammies have become more current by adding categories and theyhave begun to repay artists for years of neglect Besides honoring Dylan theacademy also gave John Fogerty his first Grammy this year Fogerty never wonan award for the brilliant records he made with Credence Clearwater Revivalthree decades ago            Dylan probably wontreinvent himself again He said recently that songs dont come to him easilyanymore Time Out of Mind is his first album of new material in eightyears Its a wonderful record Its bluesfolk songs are bleak beautifulhypnotic But it sounds like a return to something old and comfortable ratherthan progress to something new and strange            And even if Dylan does haveanother transformation within him his voice may not Opera singers who takecare of their voices can perform only into their sixties Dylan is  and hisvoiceripped by drugs alcohol and cigarettes and never that good to beginwithis much older Writing in                   Slate                last year Alex Ross calledTime Out of Mind the first great rock album of old age in part because Dylanmanages to sing around his weak voice As you can hear on this clip fromTime Out of Mind s Not Dark Yet Dylans voice doesnt have much leftHis range already narrow will soon be just a bleat But better to go outbleating Not Dark Yet than croaking through Blowin in the Wind for the th time
