              have you snow had any snow up your way   no we havent had any since uh oh just before Christmas and uh we got a lot before Christmas the ski resorts were really excited and uh but now uh   um   we have weve had fog for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion so but no uh no snow   um   the snows all melted off the mountains uh   well i talked to a woman who lived up in the hills uh mountains in uh Utah uh       guess this last weekend and she had uh quite a bit of snow on the ground her way   uhhuh i guess there theres different parts of the state of Utah that that that does have some but uh not usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts and theyre down between thirty eight and uh forty inches   um     this time of the year and uh weve been in a drought for the last five years this is the sixth year and its getting quite serious as far as water next summer   yeah well the weather uh here is always a topic of conversation in Texas   right   but uh we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather but we have our share of cold weather as well the uh temperature this morning was right at freezing it didnt stay there but it was   oh well thats thats different isnt it   right at     um   we usually have some of our coldest weather toward the uh end of January but this year it wasnt bad at all i guess thats because we had so much rain   i know my son was telling me about the rain down there he said yeah well it just  and we read in the newspaper southern part of Texas i guess   oh yeah   flooded out   well my uh       my sister lives in Houston and they uh the river there was uh in the flooding stage near where her son lives and that uh caused some uh concern of course they have a uh lake cabin and uh their dock was completely under water on the lake   oh wow   so we really had a lot of rain   yeah my son in Plano he lives fairly close to theres quite a wash that goes down uh through Plano   right   and uh theres walking trails on both sides a walking path and uh when ive gone down to visit him ive gone on that but uh that was clear full and up to up to some of the streets i guess it just gets   yeah we had a lot of flash floods in the area we had a few people who ran into uh water and a few fatalities just uh just uh a few not more than ten   umhum thats funny that uh we cant have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much   but   seems like   well the uh       theres an old profane expression about Texas weather its always too damn cold too damn hot too damn windy   yeah well its uh interesting uh im going down to El Paso next week       and uh i was wondering what the weather was but i imagine that if its that cold in Dallas it   well El Paso wont be cold   its not a doesnt get that cold i guess huh   no its its quite southern and its its rare to get real cold in in El Paso the uh youll be flying in there   yes   well uh take off is uh fun from El Paso because you normally the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain the Rockies   uhhuh yes   and theyre towering above you and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again   right yeah were kind of used to that here in Utah of course there are mountains and i fly into Montana a lot and we have a       the mountains are are really uh high and a lot of places we go into you just kind of uh its in the little valley but and i uh sure hope we we really need the moisture i hope we can get uh get some theres supposed to be a storm but it split went down through uh northern Arizona and southern Utah and   well   theyre not predicting any for the next uh week anyway up here so   well i noticed on the weather map on uh cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way but i guess it didnt pan out huh   yeah well thats thats what the  went above uh       some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana so that just left us we got a high pressure   hm   system thats just been sitting in here and uh we broke the record for the amount of fog that weve had uh you know airports been shut down uh till about noon everyday and they they seed the clouds or seed the fog to try to   oh boy umhum   to get the airplanes in and out   huh       well we uh had a bad siege last uh Christmas a year ago we went up to visit my wifes uh sister who lives in uh Calgary Alberta Canada   umhum
