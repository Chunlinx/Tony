                                 How CNBC Exacerbates StockPrice Swings                        OK so on some days stocks really do go in just one direction see DotCom Mania IsMore Selective Than You Think In any case even though all were goingto get for the next  hours at least are a parade of commentators offeringup a host of explanations for todays massive selloff in the Nasdaq and theDow the best rule to follow is just to assume that all those explanations willbe wrong or at the very least inadequate Selloffs can get triggered for onereason and continue for different reasons they can reflect genuine changes ininvestors ideas about the future or simply panic and so on Shortterm marketmoves are almost by definition impossible to parse successfully            Having said thatand you knew this was coming didnt youthere are acouple of interesting things to note about what happened today The first isthe resurgence of the idea that rising interest rates actually do matter tostock prices Ill have a piece on this for tomorrow The second is that whensomething like todays selloff happens it makes obvious the extent to whichin the short term you can no longer separate the event from the mediascoverage of the event            What I mean by this is that todays selloff does not happen in a vacuum Onthe contrary thanks to the spread of the Internet and the rise to prominenceof CNNfn and above all CNBC the selloff occurs with realtime commentaryrealtime commentary that is already almost before the fact labeling whatsoccurring as a selloff a prelude to a correction or the first prick ofthe techstock bubble And this is commentary that the investors who aremaking the decisions that will either continue or end the selloff are hearingas they are trying to make those decisions In other words what the media issaying becomes part of the information that is influencing how stock prices aredetermined            This matters because the true magic of a market as Ive writtenabout before is the ability of its collective but decentralizedintelligence to reach conclusions that are smartermore accuratethan theconclusions any single member of the market could reach which offers someevidence for this Thats why markets are better at allocating capital andsetting prices than any planning board ever could be The problem is that mostof the experimental evidence on collective decisionmaking shows that groupsmake better decisions when each member of the group reaches his or her decisionindependently of everyone else In other words its not through an open debateor an attempt to reach a consensus that the best conclusion is reached Itsonly through the aggregation of independent individual conclusions that itis            But when CNBC is running a show called Special Tuesdays Selloff andits analysts are doing realtime commentary from the market floor talking abouthow traders are feeling it becomes much harder for investors to reach anindependent decision about the only question they should actually beconsidering What are these stocks actually worth This is again asignaltonoise problem see Going BananasOver Stock Splits The signal is material information about companiesfuture earnings prospects about interest rates and about inflation Noise isjust about everything else But in todays mediasaturated investingenvironment the shortterm noise can be overpoweringly loud            In the long run hard as it may be to believe this does not matter Whichis one reason why bubble talk is overblown But in the short run its arecipe for increased volatility So huge price swings are probably with us tostay Yet another good reason not to adopt a traders mentality
