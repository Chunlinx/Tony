              okay uh lets see when it comes to to uh sentencing i im a little confused because the the only things that i read about sentencing and juries well the only things i know are the things that i read and the things that i read are are either how should i say it theyre theyre written by people that that have an axe to grind so if somebody thinks that the judge is judges are too lenient why i read all kinds of lets throw them all in jail and then if i ive you know ive ive read other things that i i wish i could see a uh an informed uh discussion as opposed to just what i see these days as one side you know some one sides mad   uhhuh   and uh so i uh i i guess what im trying to say is uh i have mixed feelings because sometimes i think that the judges um are overstepping their bounds and they shouldnt be the the juries should be the only ones that uh have a say in it and other times i think well no the juries are out of hand the judges need to step in   yeah uh you know the it comes down to a hard call because um       i now im personally have never served on a jury uh ive been in school and so thats waived my jury duty and so exactly some of the procedures that they go through for the jury uh as far as sentencing goes im not real clear on but from i understand theres sometimes whenever the juries make the verdict i mean the uh the sentencing and sometimes they dont   on the case ive remember reading a a discussion about a jury that that uh heard a case and they and they awarded uh uh how should i say it they agreed that the one person was guilty and they and they agreed that the fine should be so much and then the judge came along and set aside the judgement which the way the article was written was a terrible injustice   oh really   uh but like i say i uh theres i rarely see uh both sides of that i just hear about it from one side i dont hear the other side the the one thing that i am kind of upset about is the fact that juries are selected   uhhuh   uh to be the lowest uh how should i say this they have any opinions at all theyre weeded out been one or the other of the uh of the lawyers   oh yeah yeah   and so to be honest with you ive ive uh i dont think thats right and if i ever am called to be a a juror and they ask me if i have strong opinions im im just im not   youll       youll probably be weeded out huh   well i i i if i answer honestly if i answer honestly ill be weeded out if i if i just like looked at him and say uh no i dont have strong opinions because i feel like you know i want to be part of the process   uhhuh   and uh like i say it bothers me that that the that the lawyers can weed anybody with a college education or anybody uh oh lets say with a with any college educations you know much schooling or certain  uh uh backgrounds like for instance if youre a if youve go to church once a a a month or something like that why they dont want you on the jury or you know things like that it it bothers me that that that were judging people on the basis of of uh what do you call it uh   on on on what they do and and   no well what im trying to say is the jury jurors are selected to basically be from what ive been told milk toasts if they have any opinions if they could understand anything an engineer could never be uh a juror for instance because hes hes uh hes not easily uh persuaded or or or how shall i say this this its easy to hoodwink or its its hard to hoodwink him that kind of thing   persuaded yeah yeah yeah   so thats what im kind of worried about   well i think in a way it also depends on what kind of trial it is um because sometimes you know if if its dealing with with a more technical thing such as like a malpractice not not like a criminal suit youre going to have to have somebody that that can understand the uh like the medical or the legal implications   right uh thats what you want but on the other hand if the lawyer thinks no i dont want a bunch of people in here who are going to be able to weed their way through   you know   uh you know to weed the good from the bad they will absolutely go for people who uh how should i say it the scrub the scrub women and the the janitors im im   uhhuh uhhuh   trying not to be prejudiced against them but you know any any education will disqualify you in in many cases ive been
