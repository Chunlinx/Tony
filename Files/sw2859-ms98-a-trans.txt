          my name is Diane   im Cliff Penn   hi well whats your favorite team i like the Chicago Bears     well i uh dont have uh much much of a favorite team since the Cowboys havent done much so i guess ill just have to say the Cowboys   the Cowboys well they havent done much for they never did much  even when Landry and Staubach were playing im being real sarcastic  did you like them back then      um    oh yeah in fact most of the world liked them back then whether you did or not   touch yes well when i moved here in the uh mid seventies um are you in Dallas yes so am i uh i just use to laugh because back then i was a Steelers fan im from originally from Pittsburgh   yes umhum umhum   and that was not the thing to be in Dallas when they their preseason games at the stadium you know where the Cowboys versus what do you think theyre going to do this year   yeah oh they may be a little better but uh they got a long way to go   uhhuh in   after Landry got the shaft   he sure did that i agree with you on yeah what do you think of uh the guy whos coaching them now from Miami i cant remember his name off the top of my head i can picture his gray hair but     well they all start with J so yeah hes Johnson right   yeah yeah thats right   well hes hes learned a little bit but the first year he was here he was playing college football and it was pretty simple stuff   uhhuh are you a football fan  uh by nature or is this something you grew into   yeah i i in Texas uh footballs the game instead of baseball   thats true i agree with you there though at least it has a little more action than baseball   yep umhum yep   well i dont know why i like the Bears but i do i just think they have some good players but   well theyve had some very good players and fact uh the best tight end in football is now their coach   umhum eighty nine yeah Mister Ditka well you cant say too much bad about him i mean he did learn his hone his trade under Landry   well actually he was uh as as a coach he learned his trade under Landry but as uh as a player i remember seeing him as a young man   thats what i meant   fighting everybody off while he caught a pass on a tight end   yeah the University of Pittsburgh well i was probably a little bit too young for that but um i know we just laugh now in terms of not specific teams but um we have company and one of the men got bored earlier this afternoon and he turned on the television and one of the ladies said whats you know whats the football game  and i wasnt even aware i mean i knew it but i just i guess i kind of shut it out like most females   yeah something   right yeah the the World Football League is playing uh Frank uh playing in Germany i think ive forgotten where they are Germany and somebody that   oh funny San Antonio and San Antonio has a team or something   yeah Landry is down there over San Antonio now yeah   oh youre kidding oh goodness are you that avid a fan that you would watch it regular uh year round   no no i uh actually i havent uh watched it as much since uh the Cowboys demise as i used to i used to watch it every weekend but irregardless of who was playing whether it was Cowboys or not   uhhuh yes it it seemed like its up to about ten to twelve years ago i mean all the sports including football it used to seem uh before the higher ticket prices in terms of just not for fans but i mean what what the salaries some of the players were getting     yeah yeah now that its uh well i think a lot went out of it when they had the strike too   yeah i mean i um i mean like i was just reading something in todays paper about Herschel Walker and i had to chuckle you know i mean you wonder what he really is  i mean i really dont care but what happens to a player when theyre sitting in their cars and they fall asleep because um theyre so tired and the carbon theyre overcome by  carbon monoxide fumes   yeah yeah thats hard to believe all right   you know um  but i think its still healthy i mean i have a nephew that plays football and if thats what he wanted to do i certainly wouldnt tell his parents to encourage it but i think its still an honorable sport   yeah who do you think uh Chicago will have quarterbacking now   i have no idea who is he who um the guy the young guy from uh Ohio State i think hes already over the hill isnt he oh i cant remember   hum it seems like it   i cant even remember his my mind went blank today it must be the heat um i dont know i just uh i actually like you know i was probably was like you were when the when Payton was big you know this is probably about five years after when everything was the America team but um  i actually once Payton left i kind of just lost you know   yeah he was a superstar all right   yeah i kind of just lost um and i dont think Ditkas going to stay around much longer i dont know if he renewed a two year or not i think hes either in the middle of that or just did that   yeah it seems seems like the spice has gone out of it for him   yeah its kind of you know i mean uh its its kind of like when the Cowboys the Bears and the Steelers went you know like i said about ten twelve years ago it seemed like football was really interesting the and it didnt matter who was playing it just it was worth watching   yeah there yeah there were several really good teams in that time frame yeah   yeah and it was competitive and it seemed a little cleaner i dont know um   yeah i think it probably was the uh now then theres a lot of dirty stuff going on on the line that the  that the referees dont call things get out of hand   yeah and theres some technical stuff you know this Minicam stuff these instant replay things that uh im not sure that i would agree with some of it but i still think its a good sport   yeah well actually i think if theyd a had that technical replay technical uh bit where they replayed it at Dallas wouldve won two Super Bowls that they didnt win because of bad calls hum yeah   umhum some of those calls well i have to agree with you because i can remember um when they played the Dolphins and i saw Ditka take the touchdown and i remember there were one or two calls in that game i think it was in seventy was that seventy three or seventy two i cant i cant even go back that far anymore   yeah yeah yeah there was one that uh supposedly uh uh fumble after a touchdown and uh   umhum   the Cowboys theoretically lost it but uh  they didnt really  in fact the guy uh who had recovered who was supposed to have recovered it later admitted that he had uh   umhum so now i know   after it had already crossed the the goal line in the other guys hand he jerked it out of his hand so it was he admitted that he had done that after the fact but you could see it on camera when it happened but the officials couldnt see it     yeah usually usually when that happens and i mean it always seems to go the way of the refs call though it never seems to go the way of you know either the coach or somebody protesting um   yeah   but thats really i guess what i know about football     the where do you work where do you work   pardon me right now im not im a homemaker yeah yeah true   youre a homemaker well thats work enough   my my wife says that is plenty work enough   domestic engineering domestic engineering there you go yeah its um   pardon domestic engineering right right   i dont know i just really had to laugh today i mean the what the subject was when i placed this call when the subject was football because uh we had just had that on that that was uh you know wear year round and i said oh theyve got to be kidding i just dont think financially theyll make a go of it and then my husband said to me well it was somebody from the Vikings uh Mike Lynn or somebody who um was one of the promoters of that     yeah right   i said uh you know wouldnt they be defeating their purpose to go away from the NFL   yeah i think they would   but nobody seemed to uh you know nobody just thought that it so the motive was just another way to make a profit   yeah the Vikings to me will always be Fran Tarkenton though   yeah actually you know i mean thats just um thats the era im talking about i mean i remember when uh Gale Sayers played i i mean i can remember thats kind of when it seems like it was   yeah yeah any team could beat any other team in that time frame and thats what made it so good yeah yeah   right any probability could happen i mean now its just its and usually its one team thats great over the entire season and then its kind of flat watching some of it i mean its um   yeah and its whoever has got the most money that gets the players and so forth   right exactly i mean i can remember when drafts and Heisman i mean i could remember i mean i just i mean i used to think Dorsett was good now i look at him and i think well why did i ever think that   well he was good in his younger days he really yeah he really was   in his younger yeah and Walker now i mean i dont know if hes dried up or not the way theyre talking that uh   well hes hes getting old enough to be uh his legs wearing out but the last time i saw him play when he was healthy he looked mighty good   did he and whos going to quarterback the Cowboys this year i dont even is it still the blonde headed guy Aikman it what do you think of him   itll be itll be Aikman yeah oh Aikman himself if he had some talent around i think theyd be a super team but he cant do it by himself hes got to have a line in front of him that knows how to block   uhhuh so you think its the defensive element thats really lacking in the Cowboys   yeah well no i think its mainly the offense the defense is better than the offense really the the the uh offensive line is is   uhhuh in terms of running yeah   just hasnt been able to keep down the pass rush at all so that Aikmans had time to get rid of the ball and hes been and the main reason hes been hurt on occasion its like most of them the offensive line didnt do its job he got blindsided or something so   protecting him yeah didnt he just go through through some rough elbow surgery or something about five months ago   yeah yeah they found a whole bunch of chips in there that they though though they had one chip and they uh   ooh uhhuh   they uh got ive forgotten my son keeps up with this more than i in fact he should be on this network hes the one that knows all about sports  yeah   sure probably my husband should be too i just you know you just go through and you check those subjects and you go well  theres not too much well listen i wont keep you on a nice Sunday afternoon   right well i appreciate the call   okay no problem and you have a good day okay byebye   same to you byebye
