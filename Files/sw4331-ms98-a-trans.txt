        John im kind of in favor of capital punishment how about you     i am i yes and uh uh what was the first part of the uh subject that you   well uh do you think it should just be restricted to certain crimes   oh i i basically do i think uh other than murder uh the probably uh i dont think theres a need for it if uh if its not if the case is doesnt involve murder i dont see any need for it in anything else any other circumstances i guess its an eye for an eye     well there are those that say its not a deterrent to others but i think it certainly deters the one that uh   oh yeah   gets the capital punishment   well yeah i guess the other argument is that you might execute the wrong person but uh i dont know i just think the chances of that happening are pretty slim of course its  its not reversible uh obviously but uh i just think the way the system is set up uh the chances of the wrong person being executed are are really very small uh   yeah   uh ive served on a few juries and they take a they seem to take a lot of care to make sure theyve got the uh the right person whatever for the conviction levied   thats thats true well certainly Texas uh       as a state believes in capital punishment i dont know i wonder if we execute more people than other states or   umhum i dont know you every once in a while if you hear  if theres some whos fairly famous or notorious being executed in another state you read about it or hear about it but uh i dont know how we rank up there with the other states but uh i think its a deterrent i i dont i mean it wouldnt be a deterrent for everybody obviously but i think uh if it uh if it saves one persons life it may be worth it uh if one person who was going to kill somebody thought otherwise because of the uh possibility or a possibility of capital punishment it uh it may be worth it but i think its a deterrent   yeah i think so too uh       and and we fail so miserably in rehabilitating any kind of criminal   umhum right and   and i i dont know i wonder if there are other crimes uh a repeated rapist for example or   yeah     uh i dont know kidnapping of course is a capital crime but i   well is that uh is that punishable by death in Texas or is that up to the jury to decide or the judge   i doubt that i i dont know   i never thought about that but is that is that a capital crime   dont know i think so but maybe not maybe not i could be confused what do i know   huh         dont hear much about dont hear much about kidnapping anymore kidnaps uh   im not a kidnapper well thereve been a few over in in i guess i not recently i guess   but the uh the whole judicial system is a mess like you said theres no rehabilitation in the prisons and so they get out of prison and theyre theyre back to doing what they were doing before they went to prison   thats right   they havent learned a lesson   well i certainly dont agree with a with a murderer getting a sentence of twenty years and being out in seven or whatever it is   umhum yeah   i think thats just totally inappropriate   yeah well like you said rape uh that theres a possibility there for uh capital punishment and that thats a serious enough crime that uh it maybe warrant capital punishment but what gets me is the uh i may be getting off the subject somebody might get forty five years for stealing i mean for robbing something of course that i think to get that theyd have to be a repeat offender thatd be more than one or two cases involved but the the whole judicial system seems to be lopsided messed up   yeah you dont uh so you dont think that capital that capital punishment is appropriate for repeated robber or   no no i really dont uh no murder and again rape possibly a repeated uh rapist may be uh a candidate for capital punishment but uh the really serious stuff i dont this burglary and robbery and uh that sort of thing even if theyre multiple offenders or repeat offenders i i wouldnt condone capital punishment for that   no uh yeah i i dont know what the consensus in the state is i know it was it was a few years ago that the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment didnt they didnt they tell the states to go back and review the circumstances   yeah yeah that uh it was it was uh there was no capital punishment for a long time there i dont know fifteen twenty years maybe   something like that they   and uh i know when i was growing up there was uh there were a lot of uh electrocutions up in Sing Sing up in New York upstate New York and then uh they did away with like you said Supreme Court outlawed it and then it came back on a state by state basis   yeah   but uh
