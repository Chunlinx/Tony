        talk in the background  shes i dont know what she sees outside well what kind of music do you like     oh well   well mostly rock   rock   yeah what about you   oh oh everything um   well i like well i like different you know different things but uh   um   primarily you know rock and roll   what era of rock and roll or whatever did you prefer   oh you know well you i i really like more of the modern stuff you know but i like the oldies you know theyre okay but i you know i listen mostly mostly to the you know the modern stations   um um i guess we listen to a lot of things um i grew up with the with rock and roll and older brothers and sisters   yeah uhhuh   and uh so i would i remember always being kind of ahead of my peers just because um you know in third grade i was listening to to groups and stuff that people you know third graders usually arent interested in music by that time   uhhuh yeah   and i think now i listen we listen to a variety of stuff um jazz or country and western or   see now i dont like country and western uh   do you not i dont i dont like the old the old   i dont like most you know most of it i dont like but i recently saw that Garth Brooks show   yeah   and i thought he was terrific and i really thought i mean i thought he was a great you know really wonderful entertainer the way he um he you know he he was very good   yeah i i there i think country music i dont like the real old twangy stuff like the   i dont like twainese no i nont   you know but that it has undergone undergone a lot of change and theres a like theres a guy named Lyle Lovett that he could be considered   oh hes really not that uh country i mean ive heard him sing stuff that really doesnt sound too you know   but yeah see he does its more what do they call it   i dont know   sometimes ive heard it called Rockabilly where its like rock and roll and or country but um but they refer to him you know as a country singer but a lot of his stuff sounds really jazzy   yeah yeah right i  yeah i have heard him and uh i didnt think he was a country singer you know i   um they i mean they they term him as that but i i know well ive watched like the music awards or the country music awards before and they had him on as a new up and coming country singer   yeah uhhuh oh well   so its kind of i mean but theres a lot of people kind of like that that theyre theyre playing theyre right on the line and you know the   yeah thats true   at the the i guess the rock and roll side might be so saturated that you know theyre trying out this and and weve gone country and western dancing before and   oh you really   but and it when i dont i dont dance i mean country dance that well but you know just watching the people when they get out there is when they start playing the rock and roll music while the bands taking a break   oh   you know i mean they get out there and jitterbug and or you know whatever you want to call it   umhum   and uh so i think theres theres a lot of people out there now that arent arent just Johnny Cash fans or or you know or um   yeah yeah   uh i dont even know what the alternative   well you know i said let me watch this and see what all the fuss is about i mean everybodys raving about this guy you know and my son is i have a a son hes uh twenty four and of course he hates country music and he said ma i cant believe youre gonna watch that i said i have to find out       my best friend said she likes him i said i if Linda likes him i said hes gonna not he he couldnt be all wrong you know i mean hes theres got to be something good about the guy   umhum yeah     so i watched it and really i i just thought he was terrific   i saw previews of it and it looked more like a rock and roll concert than a   i dont know but i mean and his songs uh uh were you know i liked them uh were they werent that silly country western stuff that you know they used to do years ago you know with with dopey lyrics you know very simple lyrics   yeah yeah and theres still some out there like that too   uh you know theyre yeah oh there are but uh uh yeah i think as a whole its gotten more definitely more sophisticated in the you know in the past few years   yeah i do too i do too   you know but then i wouldnt listen you know listen to it uh you know steadily uh you know i wouldnt listen to it at all actually  you know i just dont really care for it any you know it as a whole but uh   umhum umhum what station do you listen to radio   i usually listen to either the uh classic rock its uh ninety two or or uh one oh two   yeah i switch around   yeah   um   and then my husband loves the oldies you know every time he he gets in the car the car he sticks on the oldies station   well its funny because my my father um im youngest of six and we all play some type of music interest instrument instrument and i had a couple of brothers that were in rock and roll bands and so forth so you know he was constantly having to grow up with us so at Christmas or his birthday were always buying him   yeah   tapes you know to keep him   uhhuh
