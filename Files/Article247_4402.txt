                                 What So Different About Cyberspace                        It seems as though the initial roundof discussion between Larry and myself has produced a two cultures problemwhich it is worth setting out briefly here Over the past several years I havehad extensive contact with the Internet not only as an academic but also as alawyer But it is not because of any affection for or preoccupation with itstechnical architecture or with its internal folkways Rather I have come toit by indirection If you have an expertise in privacy and defamation thensomeone will ask you to testify on the question of whether one should allowstrong encryption by private parties on the Net or whether the publicationonline of confidential information obtained by fraud or trickery is protectedunder the First Amendment For someone who sees the Internet as the latestadvance in technology which is not all that different from the radio the cellphone or the fax machine there is a strong tendency to see issues on theInternet as though they were outgrowths of familiar problemselsewhere            I thought and still think that one of the great strengths of Larrys bookis the way in which he integrates nice examples from physical space with thosefrom cyberspace Thus he is right on to say that there are two ways in which toreduce the theft of car radios Page  one of them is to increase thepunishment for theft and the other is to render them useless once they aretaken out of the car by someone who does not know the code oldfashionedsense for their release Here I might add that the second remedy is inconventional terms a better one that the first The higher penalties will havemultiple effects One is to reduce the number of thefts but another is toencourage more violent action by the thieves that remain when faced with therisk of capture The marginal cost of killing an innocent party would be quitelow if the sanction for stealing radios were life imprisonment for firsttimeoffenders But the puzzles of marginal deterrence are not invoked if the radiosare disabled when removed and so architecture or technology works nicely inreal space and it should work well in cyberspace to avoid similarproblems            So far so good No one could doubt that architecture matters in cyberspaceThe ability to limit the number of times that someone can resort to a computerprogram for example means that technology allows for a form of pricediscrimination that eliminates some of the unwelcome crosssubsidies associatedwith the sale of certain programs just as an accurate billing system meansthat pricing for phones is not subject to flat fees only Here again the pointis useful to make but does not get us to the question of the proper approachfor understanding the distinctive use and regulation of cyberspace            So we come to the third point Larry mentions that the original architectureof cyberspace was given to us by researchers and hackers And so it was Theusual ethic among both groups is for the public dissemination of informationWith researchers the community I know best the free interchange of ideas ofcritical for the advancement of knowledge There are no secrets in this worldBut many of the best researchers also have jobs that require them to work forindustry where the protection of innovation via trade secrets and patents isthe norm and for equally good reason Business cannot turn a profit if all itsimprovements are instantly appropriable by others            Now it happens that the best minds are frequently used for both researchand commerce and we have to develop protocols and we do develop protocolsthat deal with the potential conflict of interest as they move from one regimeto another And in ordinary space we have both public and private propertywith the same individuals participating in both regimes            In ordinary affairs I do not think that the rise of commerce results in theloss of liberty As a member of the university community I have worked overthe years in setting out the guidelines to deal with conflictsofinterestregulations that allow most people to participate in both I see no reason whythat cannot happen in cyberspace as well Those people who wish to set upcommercial portals through which others must come do not violate the liberty ofthose who choose not to enter The different values are certainly there butthe Net is a richer and not a poorer place by virtue of the fact that somefolks can live in gated communities while others can run free over a commons onsome other part of the Net There is no more loss of freedom here in anyintelligible sense that there is a loss of freedom when my neighbor erects anew house to which he invites only his friends Of course the values incommerce are different from those in the code ie practices of theInternet But these new arrivals will not as Larry suggests flip thecharacter of the Net The original enclaves can hold firm as new people open upnew territory The Net is not some single homogenous object that admits to onlya single culture We can have private and public commercial and charitablespaces on the Net just as we do anywhere else If in so doing we change thecharacter of the Net we do so by proper means and so be it            That said how does this tie into the grander questions of what alibertarian does or should believe Larry says that his point was really thatthe attitude of leave the Net alone will lead to a loss of liberty His wordsare ominous My argument is that this response will lead to a Net with farless liberty than the Net we know now with a potential to be far moreregulated than any world we have knownever I dont get it In one sensethe statement is right If folks can defame at will on the Internet and escapethrough anonymity there is something deeply amiss But if the argument is thatcommercialization poses the same dreaded threat to the Net as defamation thenI think that he is wrong given that the two could live side by side in themanner just described            These conclusions follow I think from any account of libertarianism thatpays attention to the views within the ivory tower It is I might addrelatively close to that which is given the idea of liberty by the ordinaryman Your freedom to use your fist stops at the edge of my face is arecognition of the universal duties of forbearance that lie at the heart of thelibertarian code But I am told that there is a different world out there thatrepresents some present and powerful political reality It is a world in whichit is wrong to think about defamation wrong to think about trade secretswrong to think about blackmail That would make me a Red So here is the ironyTo take a traditional libertarian position makes one a Red If thislibertarianism has the message keep government out then perhaps it is wrong todescribe this as a form of anarchy Rather it starts to resemble aselfappointed militia that wants to keep out others who do not want to sharein their values It is the most unlibertarian position of a monopoly on customand mores to the early arrivals            That said I dont think that Larry has tried in Code to respond tothe popular sentiment on the street The passages I quoted in the first roundcome from Chapter  of his book What Things Regulate which begins with areference to that most ivorytowered individual John Stuart Mill the author ofOn Liberty  who articulated the famous harm principle with whichlibertarian thought of all stripes has grappled since he wrote Mill as Larrypoints out did believe that public opinion was one counterweight to privateaction and it has been a hard question since that time whether popularsentiment is an equal obstacle to individual freedom as law backed by force orwhether it works with sufficient cohesion to influence conduct in a singledirection That is a fair and important set of questions to ask but again itis not one that is unique to cyberspace            Larry then goes astray in my view when he writes Threats to libertychange  The labor movement was founded on the idea that the market issometimes a threat to libertynot just because of low wages but also becausethe market form of organization itself disables a certain form of freedom Inother societies at other times the market is the key not the enemy ofliberty Page             So here is where I am left I do not understand how the market is the enemyof liberty at least if the competitive market is understood I do not see whylow wages could ever be regarded as a threat to liberty even if workers wouldprefer ceteris paribus  higher ones I do not know what it means to saythat the market form of organization itself disables a certain form offreedom At most the competition of new forms of social organization drawpeople away from older forms of association So that said the passages that Iquote do not reflect a nonacademic view of liberty by guys on the street Itreflects at least in part the conception of liberty that was championed earlierin this century by such writers as Robert Lee Hale who found coercion in everyrefusal to deal Or to the extent that it really means keep the governmentout it sounds like an attempt by the earlier settlers of the new domain tomonopolize its structure at the expense of later comers who wish to play by adifferent set of rules in some portion of that space            I think that Larry is trying to reach a larger audience with his book andto do so he has to explain why under the influence of commerce cyberspace isbecoming highly regulable for those who do not participate in that commerceand why the regulation that commerce imposes on those who voluntarily join intoit should be a bad thing Stated otherwise the task that I think remains is totranslate the language and sentiments of those within the Internet culture sothat their positions can be better understood by those of us who do not yetunderstand what is so distinctive and special about the Net
