        well Jerry do you have a favorite team   oh yeah uh the of course the Dallas Cowboys yeah   Cowboys   yeah i live live and die with them   okay well theyre rebuilding right now yet i think its going to take them a couple more years before they can be a really good team   yeah yeah yeah uh of course i guess really the reason i like the Cowboys is because SMU was my favorite team uh college  pardon me college team and of course they started out with Don Meredith   right   and uh so that that tie there between SMU and the Cowboys   i think the Cowboys have shown a lot of improvement this uh past year   yeah uh Jerry Johnson surprised me   okay   i didnt think he was going to do very good because i thought he was a college football coach and not a professional coach   yeah okay yeah i think a lot of people had that impression that uh that he ought he should have stayed in the college ranks but uh looks like theyre going to do all right   yeah yeah course he he came after a legend too Tom Landry so he had some uh tough row to hoe there   my yeah big shoes to follow  well my favorite team is a is a sentimental favorite uh the Green Bay Packers i grew up in that area and have been following them   yeah yeah   pardon my for coughing ive been coming down with a cold   been following the Packers ever since uh they won the first two Super Bowls   yeah they used to have some uh bang up fights and dig in the trenches with the Cowboys the Ice Bowl and   yeah they sure did i remember those   the other uh games that they would play for the Super Bowls   yeah i actually know some people that went to the Ice Bowl   yeah at uh they had they had some good teams though   they could have had a good year this year uh unfortunately the quarterback uh controversy they had where Don McCowskey got hurt and couldnt play most the season   yeah yeah   they spent an awful lot of money on him too a million and a half dollars for a one year contract   yeah   so i dont know if hes going to be in shape to   and course they were they were kind of like the Cowboys in that after Lombardi who could fill his shoes   uhhuh   but uh   who did you root for in the Super Bowl   i i didnt really have a favorite in the Super Bowl i just wanted to see a good game   yeah both New York teams   i i was tired of blow outs   uhhuh well that turned out to be a good game   and it it was it was good to see a good good uh championship game   i think Buffalo is an up an coming team theyre going to theyre showing some real promise for the next uh few years   yeah   the Giants are always uh always there perennially a good team   yeah well their coach has a lot to do with that i think   i think they had a lot of luck there too with Montana getting hurt in San Francisco   yeah yeah   i think if if he was uh healthy San Francisco would have stomped those guys it wouldnt have been much of a contest   yeah yeah but uh theres a lot of parity now compared to what it used to be   yeah i think its getting better more competitive   yeah   uh we see uh teams getting in the playoffs every now and then with uh five hundred records or a little below even   yeah   the uh AFC Central is a lot like that with uh Pittsburgh Cincinnati Cleveland and Houston nobody really dominated that division last year at all   yeah yeah another one of my favorites was in the old uh AFL or the uh uh American Football League the Dallas Texans when they started   right   in fact they were they out drew the Cowboys there for quite a while   okay i wasnt living here then so i cant talk much about that   yeah but uh but some of these some of the uh i get a little disappointed sometime with with uh players now days compared with the old players it seems like most the players today are   right   are playing for the money rather than the the uh fun and for the uh competition that used to be in the older days   well theres no doubt about that the moneys there and the owners are willing to pay if unfortunately uh and you get star players like uh like Joe Montana making four million dollars a year and everybody else wants to match that type of salary now   uh yeah right   and of course the people end up paying for it are the fans   yeah   uh its no wonder ticket prices are so high   yeah   i dont go to games myself uh uh   yeah i cant afford to go to them   no you you really cant not when it costs twenty six dollars a ticket and uh so much for parking   nah you you take yeah you take just two just a man and wife by the time you pay the tickets the parking uh any kind of refreshments or anything there you can spend a hundred dollars right quick   sure   and not many people can afford to spend a hundred dollars on the weekend   yeah i think the owners have somewhat lost sight on that because uh they are all wealthy people and uh the expect that uh the average Joe is going to be able to to go to a game and uh pay for that type of entertainment   yeah yeah and also i dont like the deal uh with the uh Cowboys stadium where that you to get a decent seat you have to buy a season ticket   sure   the only seats they have available are in the end zone   yeah it looks like Jerry Jones is trying to make as much money as he can out of this deal uh hes got his own TV show and he opened the Cowboy Corral out in in the parking lot there   yeah yeah   and uh every every opportunity there is to make a dollar he seems to be exploiting that   yeah but thats thats true just about every   i think theres still a lot of distrust for uh for an Arkansas man to come here and own uh uh Texas team a team in Texas   yeah   and uh i dont think thats going to die very quickly he is getting some support there were a lot of people that are uh that were skeptical and the Cowboys are coming back and they have a pretty good team Troy Aikman looks like to be looks like hes got the star qualities for a quarterback   hum yeah yeah yeah if theyll just give him some protection and dont kill him before h e   yeah well i was surprised at the the way they drafted last year they didnt really didnt go for the uh big offensive lineman or the defensive lineman theyre going for the skilled positions so quarterbacks they really   yeah   really didnt need that type of uh player   yeah and i you know i think defense really is what wins wins uh in the long run you can have the best half back there is or the best quarterback but if they dont have any blocking maybe they cant do anything   yeah theyve got an awful lot of good draft picks coming up its going to be interesting to see what they do with them   yeah   so hopefully well see some more improvement   yeah   and uh the other teams in the NFC East uh theyre theyre getting uh older uh theyre going to have to like the Washington Redskins uh that thats an older team and theyre going to have to start rebuilding pretty soon too   yeah yeah   looks like well reach a point of uh parity there where the Cowboys may start being a little more competitive with the rest of those teams   yeah what   i dont know what Philadelphias going to do without Buddy Ryan it might be interesting to see   uh i dont know i i have mixed emotions about him uh sometimes i like him but at the same times i love to see somebody beat him   yeah hes uh one of those guys you love to hate   because hes got a mouth on him   kind of like uh Jerry Glanville   yeah man you love to hate   yeah they they do pick up the image of a team though uh and they create a lot of excitement locally so i think theyre good for the game just because they are diverse and they bring a different attitude   yeah yeah but um but he yeah to me hes just like the Yankees you just   but uh theyre not my favorite people either   you love to see someone beat him   uhhuh   but um they do have a good team   well Buddy will probably get another job   yeah and i think old uh i think Cunningham is an excellent quarterback   oh hes great i saw him play when he as at uh UNLV he was not only the quarterback but the punter and he can punt the ball sixty yards no problem   yeah yeah yeah i imaging he could play just about any position on the team except maybe a defensive lineman but hes a very excellent athlete   hes a very good athlete that is true uhhuh yeah Philadelphia expected to do a little better this past year unfortunately they uh they got cut a little short   yeah well i dont they uh the games they lost lost i dont think they lost by any blowout i think they were all close games   no i like the team i really really like the Eagles a lot but uh Buddy Ryan  is not one of my favorite people so i wasnt too disappointed to see them lose   no i im wondering where hes going to wind up   i dont think hes going to get a head coaching job this next year   um   hed be lucky if he can get an assistant uh job someplace   yeah   um hes just one of those guys hes created such a controversy in Philadelphia nobody wants to touch him right now   yeah but uh hell hell wind somewhere   im sure he will hes not going to have problems there if not in the NFL then in one of the other leagues   yeah im kind of interested how this new uh leagues going to summer leagues going to fare   the World Wide Area Football League WWAFL or whatever they call it WWAFL   World Football League yeah yeah   yeah i think that the NFL is going to use that league as uh uh kind of like as a minor league to recruit players   yeah the way people talk about uh theres not that it wont be as good as the NFL because uh theres not that many good or quality football players i cant believe that   not only that but they dont pay the money either   yeah but uh   uh its very low uh scale compared to the NFL   but uh i still think theres plenty of good football players around that just were not able to get on the NFL because the NFLs teams were just full   right well some people im sure the the more talented people in that league are going to try to uh impress NFL scouts with their play in that league   yeah but yeah and wind up in the NFL   possibly but thats thats uh one in a million shot if they have the talent to be in the NFL theyre going to get drafted and make a pro team there arent going to be too many people that thatll make uh the NFL out of uh WWALF   yeah yeah yeah   it will be like Italian basketball with the uh with with the uh NBA   yeah   some guys can come back and play in the NBA but most of them dont really dont have the physical skills or the talent   right but uh im im looking forward to the season i think its going to be fun yeah   i think it will be a good year the Cowboys are showing constant
