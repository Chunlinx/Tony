                                 What Psychic Friends Failed to Foresee            Its been a busy few weeksin the history of American kitsch First Planet Hollywood announced it washemorrhaging money then JeanClaude Van Damme got coldcocked in a stripjoint and now the Psychic Friends Network is no more Its parent companyInphomation Communications Inc has filed for bankruptcy claiming that it has million in liabilities and  million in assets Whats next Arevelation that Walt Disney really isnt preserved cryogenically            The bigloser in the demise of Psychic Friends is of course chanteuse Dionne Warwickwhos been the key spokeswoman for the network for almost five years now Youmight have thought that Warwick would have seen this coming two decades agowhen on the advice of a psychic she added an e to her last name and watchedher singing career go into the tank But like so many others Warwicks faithin the business of getting poor and desolate people to shell out enormousamounts of money they really shouldnt be spending for worthless adviceremained unshaken            The economics of the psychic phone business are in factabout as straightforward as that At  a minute the goal is to get peopleto stay on the line for as long as possiblethough not so long that they runup massive bills they will deny having amassedand to keep them coming backAs a result especially in the last few years the psychic business has triedto focus on establishing continuing relationships between individual psychicsand their customers I dont want just any psychic I want to speak toClarissa The implicit therapeutic element to consulting a psychic has thusbeen made more explicit After all a good analyst costs  well there maynot be such a thing as a good analyst but you get the point            Still while the psychicbusiness model is uncomplicated its very simplicity poses a very real problemto the dominant players in the field since it means that the barriers to entryare remarkably low The really big winners in the phonepsychicas in thephonesexbusiness are actually the phone companies since they take a chunkof every call and provide only the line Since most psychics work out of theirhomes you dont even need that archetypal room with a bunch of telephones init All you need is a few ads in the back of a magazine maybe a commercial onthat cable channel that tells you whats going to be on other channels in thenext hour and a half plus a gimmick and youre in In part of course thatswhy building customer loyalty to particular psychics is so crucial But itsalso why constantly differentiating yourself from the competition is essentialThe threat of commoditization in other words is omnipresent For more on thecommoditization scramble click here And herethe Psychic Friends Network really fell down on the job            They justdidnt change the product enough says journalist Stephen Glass who recentlydetailed his personal adventures as a telephone psychic for the PsychicBelievers Network in an article in Harpers  If you look at othernetworks they do ads focusing on the lottery on romance on work They justkeep repackaging and respinning the product But Psychic Friends was stuckwith these infomercials which just pushed psychics generally            Failing to target its pitchesneglecting toemphasize that psychics can help you win or at least tell you youre going towin large sums of money or find that woman of your dreamswas certainlyPsychic Friends first big mistake A probably more telling error was gettinglocked into the infomercial model of advertising While its competitors lookedto the second or twominute ad to push the product Psychic Friends remainedenamored of the minute pitch with Dionne smiling her toothy smile andeverything looking vaguely like it was still  Do you really think its acoincidence that both Gary Coleman of Diffrent Strokes and Ted Lange ofThe Love Boat he was Isaac the bartenderwere Psychic Friendssalesmen            Thedecision to stick with the infomercial model was certainly understandableAfter all the company is called Inphomation and its main business was theproduction and distribution of infomercials And the Psychic Friendsinfomercials had been among the most popular in history Between  and they aired more than  times and at one point Inphomation was shellingout half a million dollars a week to buy air time on cable stations It wasmoney well spent At its peak Psychic Friends was bringing in as much as million a year most of it through infomercials            Psychic Friends was not alone The infomercial boom of thelate s and early s was a logical response to the deregulation of cabletelevision in which means that like so much else we can blame PsychicFriends on Ronald Reagan As the number of cable channels exploded so too didthe demand for programming Infomercials were an ideal cash cow for the cablenetworks since they actually got paid to air them            But cable has changed inrecent years as relatively more substantive programming alternatives haveemerged the Classic Sports Network or the Cooking Channel may not be high artbut they are better than another Ab Roller ad and as the infomercial marketbecame saturated Those Psychic Friends programs had probably reached a pointof diminishing returns but Inphomation was stuck in an old mindseta classiccase of a company not realizing that what had made it successful would not keepit successful in the future GEs Jack Welch is fond of saying that the key tosuccess is changing before you have to Inphomation couldnt change even afterit had to And the fact that this utter failure of foresight happened to thePsychic Friends Network takes us needless to say somewhere beyond irony            I dontwant to belabor that point though it is fun as all the They should have seenit coming headlines on stories about Inphomations bankruptcy suggest Stillits worth recognizing that Psychic Friends was an enterprise created as aresponse to peoples uncertainty about the world its probably no accidentthat it cropped up around the time of the Gulf War And yet it ended upfoundering as a result of the inherent uncertainty of the freemarket systemStill a larger question remains Why dont companies ever quit while theyreahead            Imagine if Michael Lasky the former racinghandicapper who ran Inphomation into the ground had seen two years ago thatmargins were going to decline that in the absence of any professionalrequirements more and more psychics would be entering the market that the timefor infomercials had passed and that the Psychic Friends brand name had hitits peak And imagine if at that point he had liquidated the company andinstead deployed his capital elsewhere by buying stock in AOL or somethingToday the memory of Psychic Friends would live on in all our minds as a greatand kooky American success story we wouldnt have hundreds of psychics worriedabout their futures and Lasky would still be ridiculously wealthy            In the end it may be thatmost companies have naturally short life spans and recognizing that life spanand getting out before its over is a rare but crucial talent one Laskyclearly didnt have Weve been conditioned by a century of Fortune companies to see the large decadesold corporation as the model for allbusiness But much of the time striving for longevity means ending up inbankruptcy Psychic Friends like Michael Jordan could have gone out at thetop of its game Some crystal ball
