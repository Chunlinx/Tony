            so uh what do you think about our involvement in the Middle East     well actually i think its good i i i hope that we uh uh get a chance to uh promote peace out there uh because i think without peace were not going to get uh stable oil prices and and uh id id really like to see stability in in that area because im always afraid thats where uh another big war is going to start not that Desert Storm was a small one   yeah well yeah thats probably true i i suspect that if any world war is come at this point in time theyre going to come from there uh i would think anyway i mean it just seems to me that thats thats the most unstable part of the world as far as i can tell   i saw um just recently where uh uh the US is supposedly going to be uh putting pressure on all the you know the Israelis supposedly to to come to a bargaining table to uh actually i heard that the Israelis were even talking at least mentioned about giving up some of the Golan Heights   really   yeah   thatd be interesting because i um i actually um um im im im Jewish and im actually sort of not not not not not really a Zionist per se you know im not   okay   but i have a um i have a lot of friends you know who are sort of adamant you know Israel should its his right and they do whatever they want and i think theyve been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing and uh you know in some sense may the moderates may be right they may you know may be it is better if they give up just a little bit just to sort of settle things down   well uh i guess its one of those things that uh if its going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace   right then then then it then is it worth it at all   yeah   i mean i i because the way i mean sort of the way to think about it is well they won you know they sort of took over the um theyre one of the only countries in in in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war which they didnt start basically so   oh yeah   so i dont i dont know how to i dont i dont know what to do about it but um  but i think that that you know in general the region is really in bad shape   do you think the US is going to wind up keeping uh military bases over there   um probably oh isnt isnt there a plan now to make a command center there or something   i i havent heard that i i watch CNN every once in a while but i i havent specifically heard anything about that   i just heard something about moving recently about moving um there there theres some central command post in Tampa i think they now want to move to somewhere in the Middle East actually there was um a small country or small city i think well you know not actually in Saudi Arabia or or anything but a little bit off to the um east of it i think and i they want to keep something over there so that they dont have to um i guess its i guess its so that so they dont have to move troops out so quickly or something im not quite sure exactly why they want to do it but they want to keep some sort of central command post there   what i thought was interesting is that uh apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet   thats true yeah   and uh  well i guess theres still the possibility that uh hostilities with uh US troops could still break out   yeah that they they they claim thats why were still there i mean you know why only you note its only only a small number of people have actually come back yet     yeah   but i think thats actually the scariest part because when in the way what whats happening in Iraq right now you know just in itself it it it being so crazy there i have no idea what i mean what do you know just to imagine that one day theyre going to turn around and someones going to say we dont like you and just start attacking again and its going to be worse i dont know um   do you have relatives over in Israel   no i dont i have i i have some friends in Israel and and coincidently actually my wife is Syrian um   oh really   yeah so i am we are sort of we are the Middle East peace talks at home um       and uh pardon me im just sort of putting away some things from dinner now  in the background but we um we   yeah   she has sort of friends and family in Saudi Arabia actually well friends in Saudi Arabia and um i have some friends in Israel and we we talk a bit about it but we try and keep it out of out of the home life   do you uh does does she ever want to go back to Syria   no she was shes actually um i think its um for her not not really relevant because she was shes second generation American actually   oh okay     her parents who were born here would like to go see it though i think they would like to go to Syria but but they recognize that Syrias not the place that one wants to visit   no   right about now   no   you know just something about the place makes it not not quite enjoyable   do you ever want to go over to Israel   yeah i id actually been there um i was there a couple years ago when it wasnt as you know sort of dangerous to be out there i guess   oh okay yeah   and i do i do i do like it actually um i would never live there i think im too Americanized and um sort of have too much you know too much invested in sort of the the easy life but i do like the food   yeah yeah   if that if so       if that if if that amounts for anything   okay well who you know do you have uh a lot of Kosher foods there at your house   yeah actually my house is Kosher but um it turns out that one one of the strangest things about about Israel is that no um most folks dont realize that but all the food that people think of as sort of you know Jewish food and so forth um   umhum   and you know um in general really isnt the food that is eaten in Israel so you you im sure you probably typically think of it like bagels right you know bagels and lox   yeah     turns out you dont you dont you dont really find bagels in Israel what you find is sort of Middle Eastern foods the same foods that you find in um Syria and Egypt and everything else you find things called  have you ever had those   yeah no no no uh kishkes or knishes or   which is oh oh knishes no you dont you you you dont see a lot of that thats basically Eastern European Jewish food   oh   its its very different im i i was actually very amazed when i sort of figured this out for myself that everything i grew up with really wasnt Israeli it was more Jewish you know   i got you   it it it it is very strange um   yeah still get your Passover Matzi and all that right   that that starts tomorrow night       thats what im making thats what im d oing now im making dinner   oh really i dated uh i dated a nice Jewish girl for many years up in Chicago and i was the only Goyim at at all the you know Seder dinners and everything and i used to have to go with rolls of not pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would sell me   ought to buy the bread from thats great well youve youve youve really got a handle on this stuff ive noticed you   not not   got got the vocabulary down and everything   yeah not uh just just enough to get by   that that thats actually real good yeah we um we actually we have the reverse situation turns out that um um most of my friends arent Jewish and and and my wifes not but i   okay   but i um i sort of you know do a lot of these things so so that um Seders you know our our first Seder is tomorrow night and this is a rare exception there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night which and five of them will be Jewish   oh   two two years ago we had a Seder we had sixteen people each night sixteen seems the magic number for us   wow   and i was the only Jew both nights   oh really   so so which to me is wonderful because it means that people who never would get these to see this um so get to see it and my view is Passover is should sort of be in in in in in in my mind Passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway because it it sort of predates Christ   yeah   so   well they had the matter of fact i just watched uh Charles Heston this uh this weekend in the Ten Commandments   oh yeah i caught the end of that   did you   yeah every year i try and catch that       but yeah thats what always amazes me actually is that um is that you know my my wife and i always sort of bring this up about she her her being Syrian you know and my being Jewish and all we look alike we act alike we sound alike well not totally alike but you know       um um its amazing to think that people in the Middle East sort of all hate each other   well thats uh to me its its really um i i i guess i guess i can intellectually uh kind of come to grips with all of that but you know emotionally i have a real difficult time believing that uh that that people that believe in God and and love not war and to forgive cant get together   right   you know i mean i i know that the problems are so deep but i mean even even within the Muslim uh religions different sects they cant get together   right that thats actually the part that that that i find really strange i mean i i i sort of understand somewhat i mean i i knowing the history i understand that the hatred of the Muslims for you know the Israelis or whatever and i can sort of handle i can sort of handle that and the Palestinians but i sort of think about the Muslims sort of running around having jihads against themselves   yeah   you know i mean and and that seems really weird   or the uh the the you know the Catholics and the Protestants up in Ireland   right exactly   you know i mean i i   same same thing   yeah   i dont ill ill ill never understand it uh my view is look whatd you ever do to me   yeah yeah   didnt hurt me you know at at at the moment so um and and i i dont know theres a theres something about theres a poem somewhere i dont know if youve ever seen it or not um um Everything I Ever Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten have you ever seen this and it talks about how you know if we could just all get together you know when we were young everything was great because we you know just sort of all went to class together and in the middle you know we all had snack time together and then we all took naps and we all held hands and hugged   yeah   you know and thats and thats and thats what thats what kindergarten was like and wouldnt it be nice if if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and and took a nap together       woke up and had snack time you know and then hugged each other as as we left   it sounds like a it sounds like a John Lennon uh type   yeah  i wonder if he secretly did that   gosh
