                well what kind of requirements do you think youll  youll want for your next car   well  uh the the one we bought most recently and and i think thats a good guard because uh we uh we had requirements our requirements change we we now have two kids and so we need a little bit more room um the the one that we bought in in eighty eight uh was a response to the the first child being born and and for that we wanted something really dependable something with an excellent repair record uh something that we were not going have it in the shop a lot   umhum   and of all the things that of all the ones that we looked at uh we looked in Consumer Reports and and asked around friends and and looked at our own experiences we went with a a Toyota   uhhuh   uh we got a Toyota Corolla one of the the wagon kind so its not as big as the the nineteen fifties uh suburban tank   uhhuh   umhum   but its its spacious enough for for now we now we have two kids uh weve got to put two you know  you got enough room for two car seats and and that sort of thing um   uhhuh   and the repair record has been really terrific um its been very very nice so i think that um based on our own experience and how satisfied and and we know what sort of driving um requirements we have we we probably would go with that again it the repair record is is for us repair record and the gas and the gas mileage is what drives it for us uh not whether it has a moon roof or uh how many CD players you can stack in it but   umhum oh yeah   but the the repair record is is the thing for us   well i i have a Nissan thats what i bought and i i guess i originally bought it because of first of all because of the price because when i bought it i want you know i wanted something more you know most enough as much bang for the buck   umhum   and i bought the car and i bought the car used and i had almost sixty theres almost sixty thousand miles on it and i have almost a hundred and ten thousand right now   wow   and since ive had the car ive bought a new battery ive i had a  a fan belt pulley go out and the universals in the drive shaft   hm   but other than that i havent had any problems with it i when i bought it i went down to Sears and had them put four Sears Road Handlers on it       and theyve been on there for i guess almost forty seven thousand miles   thats good yeah   and they look visually they look brand new and it was i guess two months ago  well i i changed my the main thing is is the maintenance as you say and i do that i keep the oil changed with the high RPM motors little you know  and   yeah   i get took it to get it tuned up and when i first got it i took it i wanted the valves adjusted and i the guy went in and i had to pay for it the guy says you dont need them adjusted theyre fine and so i waited another forty thousand miles and they just adjusted them but they really werent out of adjustment he they looked at it and he goes it looks like a brand new motor its because i keep the oil changed and i says well i i wanted brakes changed and he said he looked at them and he says in the back you have three fourths of your pads and in the front theyre three fourths you dont need them and i so ive been driving all these miles and i didnt need them but i i changed the front i had the brakes done in the front anyway just because i wanted the front wheels you know packed the the bearings packed and things and it worked out so i mean i im just amazed at the performance and i the Japanese cars it just seems that as far as the well i just going interject real quick as a my next purchase i want something with a little more safety features i want the air bags and the antilock brakes thats thats something that i want   oh yeah yeah   but um i was going to interject say is that when General Motors they sell their car and theres too much of a i i believe theres just too much of a profit margin and you theyre youre not getting the car youre youre youre paying for you might say markup where the Japanese cars you youre paying but you you youre getting that performance and so thats i i said i said im im very very satisfied with my car in fact i its a you know its a little little Nissan pickup truck its five speed i just dont its im im not really that tall and it you know it sits me comfortable i have good visibility i mean it just it just a blast it handles like a little sports car just really satisfied with it   i i know it  it it almost seems a shame that of the  the approach perhaps that that uh Detroit takes is that if were going to make an economy car by God youre going to know its an economy car   uhhuh   whereas i get the feeling
