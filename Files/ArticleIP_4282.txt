                                 Positively FourthRate            All forms of appreciationsuffer from a tendency toward oneupmanship There are theater buffs who willonly recommend a play that has just closed There are art lovers who rave aboutpaintings locked in the basement of the Hermitage But to my mind there are noaficionados more annoying than music mavens who prattle on about bootlegs Whata coincidence that the really great records are the ones you cant get            The mostobsessive bootleg hounds are those devoted to Bob Dylan Week after week theotherwise delightful Ron Rosenbaum fills his New York Observer columnswith paeans to recordings you cant hear some of which even he hasnt heardrecordings that may not in fact even exist To professor of history SeanWilentz writing in Dissent  the best Dylan song of the s was theunreleased until  Blind Willie McTell The worst offender bar none isrock critic Greil Marcus who recently wrote a whole book InvisibleRepublic  in praise of the most famous of Dylan bootlegs the BasementTapes These recordings which Dylan made with The Band in  in WoodstockNY circulated clandestinely until Columbia finally released a two LPselection in             Ihappen to think Marcus is right about the BasementTapestheyre the exception to the rule of overrated bootlegs Where he isless persuasive is in his conviction that Columbia Records is still holdingback Dylans best work Marcus devotes seven pages of his book to themagnificence of a song titled Im Not There which is so underground it isnteven on the illegal Basement Tapes bootlegs There is nothing like Im NotThere  in the rest of the basement recordings or anywhere else in BobDylans career Marcus writes comparing it to the last page of MobyDick  The real point of course is that try as you might youll neverhear this song            Why dothese ish writers obsess like this about lost Dylan recordings One reason isthat Dylan is a genius whose output in the s was so voluminous that norecord company could keep up with it Before he finished cutting an album hedhave half a dozen new songs to try to squeeze in On Bob Dylan The BootlegSeries Volumes   which Columbia released in  you can hear the bestof those that didnt make it These include the uplifting Guthrieesque anthemPaths ofVictory and the Shakespearean ballad Seven Curses aversion of the story in Measure for                Measure  both of which werebumped from The Times They Are AChangin These are fine songs wellworth hearing But Dylan left them off to make room for songs such as When the Ship ComesIn and One Too Many Morningsmasterpieces of American popular musicthat I expect people will be singing and listening to in a hundred years Dylanin the s was writing at such a pitch of inspiration that even hissecondrate material is pretty fine            But the release of Dylans secondrate materialhas only caused his fans to bay louder for thirdrate Bob Dylan The hype isencouraged by Columbia which profits by releasing more and more unfinishedsongs rejected versions live recordingsand before long voice mailmessagesfrom its vaults Evidence that the law of diminishing returns has setin is provided by the latest archival release the socalled  Royal AlbertHall Concert For years collectors have paid good money for unreliable copiesof this bootleg Now the performance which actually took place not at theRoyal Albert Hall in London but in Manchesters Free Trade Hall on May  is out on a two CD set which is being sold as Volume  in the Dylanbootleg series            Criticsare legitimately fascinated with this concert which occurred at a crucialmoment both in Dylans career and in American cultural history Dylan went fromprotestfolk to modrock around the same time the civil rights movement wentfrom nonviolence to black power soft drugs turned to hard drugs and so onThe story begins nearly a year earlier in July  when Dylan turned up withan electric guitar at the Newport Folk Festival enraging Pete Seeger AlanLomax and various followers of the folk revival who were only interested inauthenticity and political dissent A hilarious chilling document is theStalinistsounding open letter published by folk music commissar Irwin Silberin Sing Out magazine in which Silber accused Dylan of abandoningprotest music for songs that were innerdirected  innerprobingselfconscious            Dylan though shaken by the fury of his fans pressedahead trading his work shirt and jeans for a velveteen Nehru jacket andplaying amplified rock n roll During the next year he was booed at nearlyevery stop in America and Europe Levon Helm the drummer for The Hawks whichwas to become The Band was driven off the tour by the abuse Dylan dealt withthe stress by ingesting huge quantities of drugs and generally acting like abastard At the end of the tour he broke his neck in a motorcycle accident Hedidnt perform live again until  by which point of course the s wereover A lot of Dylan worshippers seem to fixate on  as the moment beforethe fall of the counterculture Like Russian scholars obsessed with themistakes of the Kerensky government they keep going over the familiar storywondering if things might somehow have turned out differently            The problem is thatespecially after this buildup the Royal Albert Hall bootleg isdisappointing It was a reasonably good concert but hardly an outstanding oneAs he did in every concert on that tour Dylan soloed in the first half withhis acoustic guitar and harmonica and played electric guitar with his band inthe second half The first half was a concession to his fans but it bored himsilly and you can tell The songs themselves are beautiful His rendition of which some read as his farewell to the folkies is affecting in itsdruginduced nonsensical way But Dylans performance adds little to thestudio version doing nothing to explicate the obscurities of the lyrics such aswhy Baby Blue has reindeer armies or where theyre going home to He strumslistlessly in this ponderous   minute version of  The gibberish aboutEinstein sniffing drainpipes just reminds you that he was stoned senseless Atruly dreary nine minute rendition of Mr Tambourine Man follows            The secondhalf of the concert begins with a rousing song called  which Dylan neverreleased on record and which after youve listened to the acoustic side islike watching a blackandwhite movie turn to color The Bandtobe is tightand focused and theres less burden on Dylans quasinonsenselyrics when they have Garth Hudsons organ behind them Its amazing tohear booing and loud slow clapping meant to prevent Dylan from playing anelectric version of  Thats Rick Danko the bassist singing harmony on theword behind creating a perfect rock moment Amazingly half the audiencehated it At the end of the set someone in the crowd yells out the word  Towhich Dylan after a pause by sneering back the title of a song he justplayed I Dont Believe You Then after another pause he bellows  beforecranking into Like a Rolling Stone He played no encores            The hostility and weirdness surrounding thistour also come across in Eat the                Document  a film that has beenshowing at the Museum of Radio and Television in New York City to coincide withthe release of the record This hourlong work which was commissioned by ABCbut never shown is another famous bootlegit has circulated insamizdat for yearsand also an overrated one Coming after DontLook Back  the superb cinema vrit documentary DA Pennebaker madeabout Dylans previous European tour in  Eat the Document  whichwas edited by Dylan himself is a pointless coda Other than the snippets ofconcert footage and a few curious glimpses its a mishmash of drugaddledcamera confusion            Overrating Bob Dylansunpublished fragments probably wont do any damage to his real achievement Butit is oddly disrespectfullike arguing that the rough draft of The GreatGatsby was better than the novel F Scott Fitzgerald published Thetendency to prefer obscure unproduced recordings seems like the latest versionof the old folkie quest for the grail of authenticity And its equallywrongheaded Dylan sang his best songs on records that came out and becameinstantly famous Insisting otherwise makes him into a kind of idiot savant whocould create but not choose It elevates the critic and diminishes theartist
