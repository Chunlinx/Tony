                                 The Guy Reading Mike Gersons Speeches            It was the criticism of conservatives in George WBushs big speech on education last week that gotall the attention Far more interesting though was the idea of conservativeactivist government that the shrub articulated Our Founders rejected cynicismand cultivated a noble love of country That love is undermined by sprawlingarrogant aimless government It is restored by focused and effective andenergetic government W said And that should be our goal a limitedgovernment respected for doing a few things and doing them well            This phraseology recalled a series of articles writtenby David Brooks and William Kristol of the WeeklyStandard in  calling for what the authors dubbed national greatnessconservatism The echoes of their writing in Bushs speech were very clearindeed Brooks and Kristol cited examples of this kind of government fromLincoln Theodore Roosevelt and Reagan citing the Homestead Act the nationalparks and the Panama Canal Bush used the same presidents and the sameexamples Kristol and Brooks called for limited and energetic governmentBush called for effective and energetic government                           Brooks and Kristol Instead of arguing that governmentshould be limited  Republicans have often argued that government is itselfevil               Bush Too often my party has confused the need forlimited government with a disdain for government itself                        What this shows I think is that Bush wasnt simplytriangulating or pushing off rightwing conservatives like Robert Bork andTom DeLay He was tapping in candidates being allowed to plagiarize fromjournalists to a line of intelligent moderate conservative argument about thefederal governments rightful responsibilities But the question arises Howdid W come to adopt the BrooksKristol concept of nationalgreatnessconservatism Or perhaps the question should be how the BrooksKristol conceptfound its way into his speech            The answer is Bushs chief speechwriter and seniorpolicy adviser Mike Gerson            Gerson is an evangelical Christian and one of theoriginal champions of faithbased social programs an idea he promoted whenhe worked for Indiana Senator Dan Coats GersonsI mean Coatsidea was toallow tax credits and not just a deduction for contributions to charitiesSpeechwriter Gerson is also credited with Bob Doles attack on Hollywood in as well as the address Steve Forbes gave to the Christian Coalition in the one that convinced the religious right to accept Forbes conversionfrom the supply side to the Lords side After a stint working as a journalistfor US News  he joined the Bush campaign thisyear Gerson didnt return my phone calls but the assumption that he isresponsible for most of the intellectual and historical references in Bushsspeechessuch as a tribute to Albert Shanker of the American Federation ofTeachers in last weeks addressis widespread among conservative insidersBush doesnt mention Al Shanker when speaking off the cuff            Of course Bush is not the only politician who uses aspeechwriter Whats troublesome is the evidence that Bush has an unusuallydistant relationship to the material in his speeches Did Bush even read theBrooks and Kristol articles His boast to the Washington Post a few months ago that he doesnt waste his timereading policy tomes combined with the way he delivers his speeches mightlead you to suspect otherwise Bush squints into the teleprompter sounding outthe words streaming by as if encountering them for the first time In hiseducation speech he tripped over the term exemplary which came out of hismouth as exemplarary and he referred to the Walter Sisulu ChildrensAcademy a charter school named after the late ANC leader as Sizzleoo Hecalled the Manhattan Institute one of the more influential conservative thinktanks simply Manhattan Institute without the definite article aminorseeming mistake that suggests he doesnt fully grasp what hessaying            Bill Bennett unwittingly provided some additionalsupport for this suspicion when he appeared on Meet thePress on Sunday and tried to defend Bush from the charge ofconservativebashing Asked about Bushs slight against Bork Bennett describedit as unfortunate He continued                           And I as somebody who read that speech beforehandandI will take some responsibility for not seeing that The line is Republicanswho talk as if were slouching toward Gomorrah It was to represent a line ofthought not a personal attack on Bob Borks book But thats the title of thebook I think notes are going to Bob Bork saying you know It wasnt aboutyou Bob Bork it was about a certain line of thinking                        Bennett assumes Bush himself wouldnt knowandcouldnt be expected to knowthat someone named Bork wrote the bookSlouching Toward Gomorrah that Bush referred to Hemakes it sound as if Bush has no more responsibility for what he says in aspeech than Tom Brokaw does for a report he delivers on the nightly newsBennett doesnt even think Bush is the one who owes Bork an apology            So who does Must be Mike Gerson
