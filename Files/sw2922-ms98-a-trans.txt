          okay   so what kind of car do you want   well i think were we have pretty much narrowed it down to a Mazda minivan   oh   the new uh the uh M P V   umhum   the uh the one thats the all wheel drive   do you have a family   yes   uh that helps   well were we do it mainly because we travel we do a lot of traveling and i want to do it in comfort   umhum   right now we have we have we have a four door you know sedan but its just uh it just doesnt have quite as much room and its not very comfortable to drive long distance in   you you sound like youve been looking recently or youre buying soon   well weve weve been looking for about you know two years to decide but you know with the style changes you know theyre theyre a lot of them are changing right now and were trying to wait until we see what what its going to you know the style going to stay for a while   umhum   and uh supposedly the Mazda is going to change this coming year and well just well wait till the ninety twos come out   that wont be much longer   no so thats thats pretty much uh you know where we stand now how about how about you   yeah well actually i havent its funny i havent been looking at all i mean because um im a grad student and and my wifes got an eighty seven Olds Ferenza and i have an eighty two Bonneville which basically our our our our plan is to wait another year until im done with graduate school and then sell the Bonneville for whatever we can get for it and go out and buy another a a new car some place else and i think we probably im sort of stuck i want half of me wants some sort of little sporty thing just for the hell of it because it may be the last time i can drive one for a long time and the other half of me says be pragmatic and get some sort of um probably small economical car for a couple of years and then get something bigger like a minivan when when when we have kids and stuff or or or when we travel a lot   yeah yeah you pretty much have to take advantage of the uh the wild and crazy while you can and then you got to turn into the practical   yeah right   thats kind of the way ive had to transition i was into you know the sportier cars and then uh when when when it comes to putting car seats and all that kind of stuff in it you know you just dont uh cant get away with it any longer   yeah they dont work   or then and then you got to wait until youre you know after your kids are grown and you can scale back down again   yeah   but uh you know right now i have a pickup truck and its one of the supercabs and you can get you can get uh you know kids kids and everything in there the only thing is its its not very comfortable   right well its a its a its note like the ive seen that Mazda van and and it seems like it would be the right thing then   yeah well theyve made some changes over the you know the last couple of years since theyve come out this year theyre coming out with a new transmission a little bit heavier duty transmission which the Japanese are not well known for but uh   right   but theyre supposedly getting a new uh transmission in fact i think Board Warners the one that going to going to design it for them   oh okay thatll be nice   and thatll thatll help some and uh theyre going to change the interior to where the backseat itself can either be removed or laid laying down into a bed whereas now it cant   oh okay   you can lean it back a little bit but not all the way   right   so were looking at those type things also   thats just yeah its thinking ahead   yeah plus you know the the uh the wheel base uh   its real good   the way it is right now the all wheel drive its a little bit higher up off the ground but theyre going to raise it three more inches up and a little bit more clearance   thatll give you a little extra yeah   and uh you know not that i really need it for any but i like sitting up high so you can see   yeah its actually a real nice feeling i uh grew up driving the Suburban and then recently i test drove for some strange reason i test drove a Range Rover   yes   not because i was going to buy a forty thousand dollar Jeep mind you        but just but but because um my my wife works for a temporary agency and they and and they had a job and they called me basically i basically i was shopping the agent to make sure you know he was doing good things by Range Rover you know they sent me out as a to sort of act like i wanted to buy one basically and then report back to the company as to how the salesman is doing   um   so i had to act like a buyer and uh   thats kind of interesting   yeah its a neat little um its its its its its sort of like being a scab i guess in a sense but uh but i used you know i mean he did a wonderful job so i just went back and said wonderful things about him you know but we went and part of it was test driving a Range Rover and i realized afterward you know its a real nice ride because its nice youre nice and high lots of clearance and stuff like that like you said but   forty seven thousand dollars is   forty thousand dollars yeah thats just way too much for for a jeep in my opinion   its a little stiff yeah i agree i dont think even if i had the money to spend on it i dont think id buy one   no i wouldnt i mean i would get if i wanted to pick out a car like that id go for a Bronco or or or you know Blazer or something i figure its   plus nowadays you know you it cars are high anyway you know cant hardly get anything decent for less than you know nineteen or twenty   yeah   and thats thats a pretty big investment even nowadays and i want something thats going to last me for at least seven eight years   yeah   and uh i just cant see you know these people spending these thirty five to forty five thousand dollars on BMWs and Mercedes and then trading them every year or two   oh yeah this this is nothing i mean he um he was showing me they had this i was you know they had they had a beamer there that was seventy eight thousand and a Mercedes that was ninety   God thats so thats silly   you know and the man claimed that he sold fourteen of these Mercedes the previous year   i uh i like i say i dont i think even if i had the money i wouldnt want something like that its just not within my its just its impractical   it was amazing yeah it totally impractical and i i cant imagine whats that much better about them that   too many other good things you can do with the money besides waste it uh i just uh you know theres too many people that need things and   right   you know places that you can put it   yeah i agree   not not to waste money like that   itd be nice to think that i could afford it mind you but   yeah i mean itd be nice to be able to afford it but i im just not i even if i had the money i im i know for a fact i just wouldnt i wouldnt buy one i just cant bring myself to do that kind of stuff   yeah no i wouldnt   but uh we try to keep our cars on an average of eight to ten years if we can if we can get by with it we have a Volvo right now thats i ts seven years old and its got uh about eighty five thousand miles on it and it still drives like its brand new   i was going to say a Volvo at eighty five thousand miles is still being broken in isnt it     about thats about right and we we anticipate on keeping that car for hopefully another five six seven years if we can if we can make it go that long   i mean yeah those arent arent those the ones that that have is it Volvo or Saab that has like the three hundred thousand mile club and   well Volvos uh theres a lot of them that we in fact we have a mutual friend uh my my wife and i that uh they uh they just passed three hundred thousand miles on theirs   and the cars probably still fine right   its still mechanically fine now you you know theres theres money to invest in it during during that three hundred thousand miles you know uh timing chains and and various other things but   right   all in all if you if you take it mileage uh based on what you spent over that life of the car   its wonderful   relatively cheap   yeah   so uh you know i i so far i cant complain its been a good car and and were going were like i say well try to keep it for a long time its been paid off for several years   the thats thats nice to have no payments yeah   yeah and uh the the only other thing is you know the the pickup trucks nice but its impractical for for traveling and family so well get something that we can haul stuff in if we have to and then have it for you know trips and and everything   umhum thats great youve really thought this out it sounds like i mean im sort of you know i sort of look around and go yeah thats a nice car thats a nice car but i havent really   well nowadays it pays to shop because youre going to have to live with it for a while you know if you if youre paying for it for three or four years   right uh   uh thats a long time right there in itself and then you dont want to turn around and and you know the next time you buy a car its going to be more expensive and uh you dont want to start another payment thats going to be up around four or five hundred dollars a month   to be paying for a car thats true   so uh it its its crazy so   thats that that thats real true actually   but the little that eighty two Bonneville that you have that that uh thats probably a pretty good car   thats thats actually its got um its actually its low on mileage given that its eighty two its only got seventy five thousand on it and uh or seventy four or whatever you know and its its in uh its a funny coincidence that my my cousin sold me the car and shes up for the weekend now  so shes out babysitting in the next room  sort of perfect coincidence its a perfect time to be talking about that car um but yeah its just its just you know i have little problems here and there you know um stupid things start to go like the uh       i cant open it it has electronic windows unfortunately electric windows and doors and the uh and the passenger window is gone you know it doesnt open any more but im not going to fix it because im going to sell it in a year   yeah well you know uh things like that that go out you know if you replace them its just so costly anyway   yeah its its its seventy five dollars for the motor alone and then another seventy five to install it you know so that can that thats crazy or like the air conditioning went the air conditioning sort of blowing warm air so i went down to the you know my local mechanic and for forty dollars they did an air conditioning check and they   its crazy yeah   went through everything i told them to put in a shot of Freon and they said yeah it needs a shot of Freon but then he came back and he said well the reason youre losing the Freon is because you have a leak in this condenser line and when i and thats a hundred and fifty dollars to fix that and then while were in there we have to change this this and this and you know and so it would would would would have wound up costing me close to four hundred dollars but he said look if youre selling the car in a year dont bother doing it all he said ill give you a shot of Freon every now and then and and youre youre fine you know so   well and your wife has what kind of car   she has an eighty seven um Ferenza i its an Oldsmobile yeah its an Oldsmobile   oh Ferenza yeah okay thats Pontiac okay or Olds Firenza yeah   yeah no its Olds actually olds yeah thats actually a real good car im finding its uh mechanically is very sound um unfortunately the body was rust proofed by a company called Rusty Jones   umhum   which im not sure if youve ever heard of or not but uh Rusty Jones went out of business because their rust proofing wasnt very good   so now youve got some rust   and now ive got some i mean the eighty two has no rust at all and the eighty seven has some pretty big rust spots on it so its   thats terrible thats one thats one bad thing about living in an area where you have to put salt on the roads   so and yeah actually were were looking forward to getting out of here   oh   were yeah in a year im done and then were moving south or west or southwest
