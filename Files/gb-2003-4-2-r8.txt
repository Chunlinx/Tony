                    Background                Drosophila melanogaster has been a        leading model for the study of aging for over  years              The intensive use of         Drosophila as a model for        developmental biology has produced a wealth of genetic and        molecular biological tools that are readily adapted to the        study of aging Aging is associated with characteristic        changes at the physiological and molecular level however        organismal life span is still the best measure of aging        rate The most successful studies of aging generally        involve manipulations that increase life span Experimental        alterations of environment or genetic makeup that cause        decreased life span might create novel diseases or        pathologies that do not usually limit life span in a normal        individual In contrast a manipulation that increases life        span is thought to be more likely to identify mechanisms        that normally limit the life span of the organism        Laboratory selection of         Drosophila populations for latelife        reproduction results in extended life span     The        genetic selection experiments demonstrate that life span        has a large genetic component and is highly plastic        Increased life span was generally correlated with increased        stress resistance including increased oxidative stress        resistance    An important question in the study of        aging in invertebrates is whether life span can be        increased without a trade off with metabolic activity        Certain manipulations that decrease metabolic activity        cause increased life span such as lower culture        temperature   In the genetic selection experiments        life span is increased without a reduction in metabolic        activity           Single gene mutations have been identified that increase                Drosophila life span These mutations        identify negative regulators of life span as mutations        expected to decrease activity of the gene lead to increased        life span         mth encodes a protein related to        Gprotein coupled receptors and appears to negatively        regulate life span stress resistance and body size           Indy is related to a mammalian        cotransporter involved in membrane transport of Krebs cycle        intermediates leading to the suggestion that         Indy mutations might increase life        span by decreasing the availability of nutrients          Certain mutant alleles of either the         Inr or the         chico genes can increase         Drosophila life span            Inr is homologous to the mammalian        insulin receptor and insulinlike growth factor receptor        while         chico is homologous to the mammalian        insulin receptor substrate The data indicate that an        insulinlike signaling pathway negatively regulates life        span as had previously been found for the nematode         C elegans   This pathway for        life span regulation may be even more highly conserved        during evolution as there are many similarities with life        span regulation in mammals and in yeast The increased life        span regulated by the insulinlike signaling pathway in         C elegans is associated with        increased resistance to stress including oxidative stress             This has led to suggestions that        increased oxidative stress resistance and decreased amounts        of oxidative damage may be the mechanism by which mutation        of the insulinlike signaling pathway causes increased life        span Consistent with this idea lifespan extension in         C elegans is associated with        increased expression of the gene encoding the mitochondrial        antioxidant enzyme manganesecontaining superoxide        dismsutase MnSOD   In         Drosophila  mutations of         chico that extend life span increase        total SOD enzyme activity however resistance to oxidative        stress was not detectably increased at least not as        assayed by paraquat resistance   Therefore it remains        to be determined if mutation of the insulinlike pathway in                Drosophila increases life span by        increasing SOD activity or by some other mechanisms        Increased life span caused by overexpression of a gene        by definition identifies a positive regulator of life span        Several genes involved in oxidative stress defense have        been found to increase life span when overexpressed in        transgenic flies These include genes for both forms of        SOD the CuZnSOD found in the cytoplasm and outer        mitochondrial space and MnSOD found in the inner        mitochondrial space     These enzymes convert        the most common oxygen radical produced by the        mitochondria superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and water        Abundant catalase enzyme then converts the hydrogen        peroxide into molecular oxygen and water Overexpression of        CuZnSOD or MnSOD increases life span up to about  and        the amount of life span increase is found to be        proportional to the amount of enzyme increase in each case        The life span increase caused by SOD overexpression is not        associated with a detectable tradeoff in metabolic        activity as oxygen consumption was normal throughout the        extended life span of the flies   Overexpression of        the antioxidant enzyme peptide methionine sulfoxide        reductase is also associated with increased life span          Finally several genes implicated in repair and stress        responses have been shown to be able to extend         Drosophila life span when the flies        are cultured at elevated temperatures                    Testing specific genes by overexpression in transgenic        flies is a candidate gene approach meaning that the        investigator must make an educated guess as to which genes        are worth assaying by this relatively laborintensive        method Recently genetic methods have been developed that        allow for the efficient overexpression of random genes in         Drosophila  P type transposable        elements have been engineered to have transcriptional        promoters directed out through the end of the element           These elements will often insert upstream of gene        coding regions causing overexpression of the gene and        mutant phenotypes The         PdL P element contains an outwardly        directed teton promoter    The transcription of        this promoter is activated upon feeding the fly        doxycycline leading to conditional gene overexpression and        conditional mutations Conditional gene overexpression        mutations have several potential advantages for study of        aging and life span By waiting until flies are young        adults to activate gene overexpression effects can be        identified that are specific to adult aging The system        also provides powerful controls for genetic background        effects because control no DOX and overexpressing        DOX flies have identical genetic backgrounds and        therefore any differences in life span must be due to DOX        administration and gene overexpression The         PdL system allows the investigator to        search for genes that can increase life span without having        to guess ahead of time which genes these might be        Therefore the approach has the potential to identify genes        and pathways not previously known or suspected to be        involved in life span regulation                    Results        In the         rtTA transgenic construct the        powerful and tissuegeneral         actinC promoter drives expression of        the rtTA transcriptional transactivator   When flies        are fed doxycycline rtTA binds to target sequences in the        synthetic teton promoter in the         PdL P element This        outwardlydirected promoter often causes overexpression of        genes near the         PdL insertion site and yields various        mutant phenotypes           PdL is  kilobases kb long and        contains the P element inverted repeats the         miniwhite transformation marker        gene and the  basepair bp teton promoter directed        out through the  end of the element The teton promoter        contains no open reading frame ORF or translation        initiation sequences Therefore         PdL must insert upstream of an        endogenous translation intiation site ATG to cause        overexpression of a protein The transcripts initiated        within         PdL will therefore contain  bp of         untranslated sequence derived from         PdL itself        To search for genes that might extend life span new        insertions of         PdL were created on the second and        third chromosomes by appropriate crosses to a strain        expressing P element transposase Figure  Approximately         males bearing a new         PdL insert and an         rtTA transcriptional transactivator        insertion were generated The males were generated in eight        staggered groups each of around  individuals In an        attempt to increase the variety of mutations identified        two different         rtTA insertion strains were used The        first six cohorts of males contained an insertion of the         rtTA construct called         rtTAE that is associated with        moderate levels of targetgene expression and low levels of        leaky expression in the absence of DOX   The last two        cohorts of males contained an         rtTA insertion called         rtTAM which is associated with a        high level of targetgene expression and greater leaky        expression To obtain adult flies of defined age the        second cross was cultured at C in urine specimen bottles        Figure  Prior to eclosion of the majority of pupae        bottles were cleared of adults and flies were allowed to        emerge over the next  hours The majority of the males        will have mated during this time The males only were then        removed and were designated  day old and were maintained        at C at  per vial in culture vials with food        supplemented with  gml DOX and passaged to new vials        every  hours The expectation was that some of these        flies might live longer due to the overexpression of a        beneficial gene For the first four cohorts at        approximately  survival of the cohort each of the males        was individually mated with four thirdchromosome balancer        stock virgin females This was so that a stable line could        be recovered later if that fly was found to be one of the        longest lived Only about  of these males were found to        be fertile meaning that there was selection for males that        maintained fertility during aging After  days the        fertile males were removed from the crosses placed in        individual numbered vials and passaged every two days        until they were all dead For the rest of the cohorts the        males were mated at approximately  survival of the        cohort which increased the frequency of fertile males to        about  Stable lines were recovered for the        approximately  longestlived flies from each cohort        These  lines should therefore be enriched for ones in        which         PdL is causing overexpression of a        gene with a benefit for life span In addition lines in        which         PdL causes overexpression of a gene        with large negative effects on life span should have been        eliminated by this step        Each of the  new         PdL insertion lines was crossed to        the appropriate         rtTA chromosome strain and males        containing both constructs were assayed in large cohorts        around  flies for doxycyclinedependent effects on        life span Figure  The mean life spans of the different        strains in the absence of DOX varied greatly from  to         days Both increases and decreases were observed in the        presence of DOX For the  lines tested with         rtTAE there was an average         increase in the presence of DOX Figure a and for the         lines tested with         rtTAM an average  increase in        the presence of DOX Figure b consistent with previous        results that DOX itself has little to no effect on life        span However several lines were identified where there        was a significantly greater than average increase in life        span in the presence of DOX To confirm these results        these lines were assayed one or more additional times        Table  As a control OregonR wildtype flies were        repeatedly crossed to the         rtTA strains and assayed for life        span in parallel The OregonR controls exhibited changes        in life span from  to  with an average change        of  In contrast six         PdL lines were found to yield        significant and reproducible increases in life span in the        presence of DOX ranging from  to         Line         PdLE was associated with the        largest increase in life span average  Table  The         PdL insert in this line was located        in the large first intron of the         encore gene   with the promoter        oriented in the sense direction Figure a         PdL caused the expression of a pair        of approximately  kb transcripts that contain a  amino        acid ORF identified by the         Drosophila genome project as         CG  as determined by northern        blot with a         CG probe These transcripts were        not detected in the absence of DOX in the adult males and        this putative gene was named         Red herring          Rdh  Northern analysis using a        probe from         encore exon  indicated that levels        of the normal sized         encore transcript were not detectably        altered by DOX as indicated by the arrowhead Figure a        However DOX appeared to induce expression of both larger        and smaller RNAs containing         encore codingregion sequences        resulting in a smear of hybridization in the upper part of        the lane as indicated by the asterisk Representative        survival curves are presented Figure a        Line         PdLG contains an insert at the         end of the         VhaSFD gene encoding the vacuolar        proton pump ATPase H ATPase SFD subunit   DOX        caused an approximately fourfold overexpression of the         VhaSFD transcript and an average         increase in life span Figure b Representative survival        curves for the         PdLG line are presented Figure        b Line         PdLC contains an insert at the         end of a gene with homology to a maltose permease from         Bacillus stearothermophilus          which was named         Sugar baby Figure c DOX caused an        approximately fold overexpression of the         Sugar baby transcript and was        associated with an average  increase in life span        Three genes with previously characterized mutant        phenotypes were also identified by         PdL insertions Line         PdLS contained an insert at the         end of the         filamin gene A transcript Figure        d Filamin is an actinbinding protein involved in        cytokinesis and ring canal formation            filamin A was overexpressed        approximately fivefold in the presence of DOX and        associated with an average  increase in life span        Expression of the         filamin B transcript was not        detectably altered Line         PdLS contained an insert at the         end of the B transcript of the         four wheel drive          fwd  gene Figure e         fwd encodes a phosphatidylinositol        kinase PI kinase that regulates actin organization        and ring canal formation during germline cytokinesis                  fwd B was overexpressed approximately        fold and associated with an average  increase in life        span Finally line         PdLR had an insert at the         end of the         CTPphosphocholine cytidylyltransferase                  Cct  gene Figure f         Cct encodes a homolog of the        ratelimiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis                  Cct was overexpressed approximately        fold and was associated with an average  increase in        life span                    Discussion        The genetic screen described here had several unusual        aspects and the potential to identify a novel set of genes        involved in lifespan regulation First the screen was        designed to identify positive regulators of life span that        is genes that will increase life span when overexpressed        Most genetic screens for lifespan regulators in         Drosophila and other organisms such        as         C elegans  have involved        lossoffunction mutations and therefore have identified        negative regulators of life span      Second        mutants were identified on the basis of the phenotype of        increased life span under normal conditions as opposed to        some surrogate phenotype expected to correlate with life        span such as increased stress resistance Because the         PdL mutations generated here were        screened directly for extended life span under normal        conditions the screen had the potential to identify genes        and pathways not previously suspected to have a role in        aging and lifespan regulation        Results were reported recently for a screen for positive        regulators of life span using a different Pelementbased        gene overexpression strategy   In that study a        heatstress inducible system was used and lines were        screened for life span at the moderate heat stress        condition of C Several genes were identified that        increased survival when overexpressed including genes        involved in heat stress and oxidative stress responses It        is interesting to note that there is no overlap with the        genes identified here with         PdL at C This may be due to the        small fraction of the genome that has been tested so far        or it may indicate that different mechanisms limit life        span under normal and moderate heatstress conditions        It is difficult to estimate the number of genes that        were tested in the         PdL screen but it is certain to have        been only a tiny fraction of the genome In previous        experiments approximately  of         PdL insertions were found to cause        lethal and visible phenotypes when the         PdL promoter was activated during        larval and pupal development   Seven percent is        certainly a large underestimate of the frequency at which        genes are overexpressed as embryogenesis was not tested        and not all genes will be lethal or have an obvious visible        phenotype when overexpressed The original          PdL insertions generated here went        through an initial enrichment step of unknown efficiency        to yield the  lines that were tested in large cohorts        Lines in which a gene was overexpressed that had a positive        effect on life span should have been enriched in the final         lines whereas ones with a significant negative effect        should have been eliminated The enrichment step appears to        have been at least partially successful as the largest        negative effect on life span observed among the  lines        tested was  and         PdL is known to be able to create        mutations with negative effects of up to    The        molecular characterization of the mutations suggests a low        frequency of false positives If the six         PdL insertion strains were a random        set then         PdL would be expected to sometimes be        in the wrong orientation andor downstream of the ATG        translation start However all six lines were found to        have         PdL insertions at the  end of a        gene and oriented in the sense direction and in all six        lines a transcript was overexpressed that was expected to        contain a complete ORF        The magnitude of lifespan increases caused by the         PdL mutations was generally small        ranging from  to  This is in contrast to        overexpression of SOD genes or certain single gene        mutations such as         mth  where lifespan increases range        from  to       There are at least two        possible reasons for the relatively small life span        increases observed here First as only a fraction of the        genome has been tested it may be that genes with larger        effects exist but have not yet been identified Second the        teton system is sometimes leaky meaning that at certain        genomic locations there can be significant expression of        the teton promoter in the absence of DOX   It is        possible that in some of the lines the increase in life        span between DOX and DOX is reduced because there is        already some gene overexpression and lifespan extension in        the DOX flies Such a line might be expected to have an        unusually high DOX life span relative to the other lines        and it is notable that this appears to be the case for the        lines bearing mutations in the         VhaSFD and         Sugar baby genes When this        difference is included in the calculations the life span        increases for         VhaSFD and         Sugar baby are approximately  and         respectively        The largest average increase in life span caused by DOX         was obtained for the         PdLE insertion in the large        first intron of the         encore gene A pair of approximately         kb transcripts was expressed containing a  amino acid        ORF with no detectable homologies While there are a number        of         Drosophila genes encoding functional        ORFs of this size it is also possible that these        transcripts do not encode a functional protein but rather        function at the RNA level to affect life span There are no        cDNAs in the databases containing these intronic sequences        and we were unable to detect these transcripts in wildtype        adult males using northern blots The data suggest that        these transcripts are not expressed under normal        conditions or are expressed at very low levels Further        experiments will be required to determine the mechanism of        lifespan extension in this line and the elusive nature of        the intronic gene suggested the name         Red herring  The northern analyses        also indicated induction of a small amount of a large        transcript containing the         encore coding region Therefore it is        also possible that the life span extension in this line is        caused by an increase in the expression of         encore  encore is a member of a        novel family of proteins with multiple functions during         Drosophila oogenesis          Two of the genes identified appear to be involved in        membrane transport The         VhaSFD gene encodes the         Drosophila homolog of the vacuolar H        ATPase SFD subunit The vacuolar ATPase is an ATPdriven        proton pump found in the endomembranes of eukaryotic cells             It is composed of a cytoplasmic ATPase        domain called V          that contains VhaSFD and other        subunits and a multisubunit membranechannel component        called V           The vacuolar ATPase is involved in        the acidification and energization of organelles such as        Golgiderived vesicles clathrincoated vesicles synaptic        vesicles and lysosomes The proton pumping is required for        processes such as protein trafficking receptormediated        endocytosis neurotransmitter release and intracellular pH        regulation and waste management The free membrane V          domain has also been implicated in        membrane fusion events In higher organisms the vacuolar H        ATPase is also found in the plasma membrane of        specialized epithelial cells where it functions in bulk        transport In         Drosophila this is the Malpighian or        renal tubule The VhaSFD subunit is required for the        ATPase activity and assembly of the vacuolar H ATPase and        may function as a dissociable regulatory subunit        Therefore overexpression of         VhaSFD may affect life span by        increasing activity of the vacuolar H ATPase        The         Sugar baby gene is related to a        maltose permease from         Bacillus stearothermophilus          suggesting that it may function in transport of maltose or        other sugars across a membrane Recently lossoffunction        mutations in another putative membrane transporter         Indy  have been found to increase        life span   It is possible that overexpression of the        putative transporter encoded by         Sugar baby could increase life span        by increasing uptake of a particular sugar and altering        energy metabolism pathways        Filamin is an actinbinding protein with a homolog in        humans called actinbinding protein  ABP           Filamin binds to several cellmembrane proteins and        intercellular ligands involved in signal transduction and        appears to act as a downstream effector in remodeling of        the actin cytoskeleton During         Drosophila oogenesis filamin        localizes to the ring canals which are membraneassociated        actin cytoskeletal structures that create intercellular        bridges between germline cells Lossoffunction mutations        of         filamin disrupt the normal function        of these actin cytoskeletal structures Filamin has several        additional interactions with potential relevance to aging        studies Presenilins are membrane proteins found in both        humans and         Drosophila  and mutations in human        presenilins are associated with early onset familial        Alzheimers disease FAD           Drosophila filamin binds to both         Drosophila and human presenilins and                filamin interacts genetically with         presenilin in         Drosophila   Dominant adult        phenotypes produced in         Drosophila by overexpression of         presenilin can be suppressed by        overexpression of         filamin  Filamin also interacts        specifically with         Drosophila Toll and Tube proteins          Toll and Tube are members of a signal transduction        pathway that activates the Rel transcription factor Dorsal        and is involved in developmental patterning and in the        adult immune response Several of the immuneresponse genes        regulated by Rel transcription factors are dramatically        induced during         Drosophila aging GL J Carrick        and JT unpublished data                fwd encodes a phosphatidylinositol        kinase PI kinase that converts phosphatidylinositol        PI to phosphatidylinositol phosphate PIP   This        is the first step in the synthesis of the key regulatory        membrane phospholipid PIP which is generated from PIP by        a PI kinase PIP interacts directly with a number of        proteins regulating both their subcellular localization        and their activity Data from yeast and mammalian systems        implicates homologous PI kinases and PIP in regulation        of secretion and membrane vesicle trafficking    In                Drosophila fwd gene function is        required for the formation of ring canals and cytoplasmic        bridges during cytokinesis in male meiosis PIP is also        the precursor to the important second messengers PIP and        diacylglycerol PIP is involved in the insulinlike        signaling pathway that affects life span in         Drosophila and         C elegans   and it will be of        interest to determine if         fwd overexpression is somehow        affecting this pathway        CTPphosphocholine cytidylyltransferase Cct catalyzes        the conversion of phosphocholine to CDPcholine and is the        ratelimiting enzyme in the phosphatidylcholine        biosynthetic pathway   Phosphatidylcholine is a major        membrane phospholipid and is a precursor to second        messengers involved in signal transduction at the membrane        including the PIP PIP and PIP discussed above There are        two genes encoding Cct in         Drosophila          Cct and         Cct  and mutations in the         Cct gene disrupt patterning during        oogenesis T Gupta and T Schupbach personal        communication Overexpression of         Cct might affect life span by        increasing synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and altering        membrane structure andor phospholipid signaling        pathways        It is striking that most of the genes identified in this        screen as positive regulators of         Drosophila life span are implicated        in functions at the membrane including regulation of        transport phospholipid metabolism signal transduction and        actin cytoskeleton organization It is tempting to        speculate that some of these genes may be acting in the        same pathways for lifespan regulation For example both                filamin and         fwd are involved in the function of        ring canals which are membraneassociated actin        cytoskeletal structures that create intercellular bridges        between germline cells during early mitotic divisions                    encore is also required for normal        early mitotic division of the germline cells   In         C elegans  germline cells have        recently been shown to send signals that regulate life span        of the adult organism     and it will be of        interest to determine if any of the genes identified here        increase life span through effects on the germline Both         fwd and         Cct are involved in phospholipid        metabolism and phospholipid signaling pathways are        implicated in lifespan regulation in         Drosophila and other organisms          The conserved insulinlike lifespan regulatory pathway        includes a PI kinase that converts PIP into PIP The        enzymes encoded by         fwd and         Cct are both in the biosynthetic        pathway for PIP and therefore might affect the        insulinlike pathway by altering the availability of this        substrate Further experiments will be required to confirm        the role of these genes in lifespan regulation and to        determine their interactions with each other and in known        or novel lifespan regulatory pathways

OregonR control          strain were crossed to an           rtTA stock and cultured at C in          urine specimen bottles Prior to eclosion of the majority          of pupae bottles were cleared of adults and newly          eclosed flies were allowed to emerge over the next  h          The majority of the males will have mated during this          time The males only were then removed and were          designated  day old and were maintained at C at           per vial in culture vials with food At  days of age the          males were split into control and experimental groups of           males each with experimentals DOX placed on          culture media supplemented with  gml DOX Dead flies          were counted at each passage and the number of vials was          progressively reduced to maintain approximately  flies          per vial To calculate mean life spans for the          experimental DOX and control DOX cohorts each          flys life span was tabulated and their life spans were          averaged and the standard error of the mean SEM          calculated Statistical significance of differences in          mean life span was calculated for each experiment using
