                                 The Dell Factor            When Michael Dell the CEOand founder of Dell Computer laid his head on his pillow the night of Feb he must have been one tired chief executive In the previous seven days he hadmade  million enough to exhaust anyone in the best way of course            Dell wasnot however the most tired CEO in the land that evening And in fact hisincome for the previous week was not even onefourth that earned by Microsoftsown Bill Gates who was billion richer when he fell asleep on the th than he had been a week before It has to be difficultresisting those impulse purchases of new Porsches when youre able to say toyourself What the hell I made  billion last week I can probably splurge alittle Still  million is no shabby performance and Dell certainlyslept the sleep of the innocentor at least of the successfulthat night            Of course neither Dell nor Gates actually saw any of thesehundreds of millions of dollars since their gains were reaped entirely onpaper in the form of sharp increases in the stock prices of both Dell andMicrosoft Weve grown accustomed in recent years to CEOs being worthbillions of dollars But actually this is a relatively recent development inAmerican business and while the financial success of Michael Dell is a fineexpression of the American dream the lessons the business world has drawn fromthat success are less salutary            The curious phenomenon thatDells and Gates enormous wealth points to is a resurgence in Americanbusiness of whats often called proprietary capitalisma system in which thepeople who run corporations are also the people who own them The traditionalstory of industrial capitalisms development in the United States is that ithad its roots in familyowned enterprises but that it quickly evolved into asystem where the people who owned companies delegated the responsibility forrunning them to managers The genius of American business in fact lay in thisembrace of managerialism of the idea that you didnt actually have to ownstock in a company to do an excellent job managing it Alfred Sloan of GeneralMotors who never made  million in his life owned only a tiny sliver ofGM but he still managed it as if it were his            There werealways exceptions to this reign of the managers to be sure including Fordwhere the Ford family kept tight control at least through the end of World WarII IBM which was run by founder Thomas Watson and his son for most of thecentury and DuPont But even these corporations saw the authority of thefounders dissipate as the enterprises grew larger and more ambitious in theirappetite for capital The more money you borrow and the more shares of stockyou issue the more people you give a share in your business As a resultexcept for the media business where many large companies are still owned byindividuals or families most powerful US corporations have fit a particularmodel The ownership of stock has been diffuse and the management of thecompany has been professional in the sense that it has had no substantialpersonal stake in the corporation            Whats striking then about Michael Dell andBill Gates is that they and their enormous personal fortunes hearken back toan older model where a personal stake in a company was a guarantee of onesdevotion to it Dell owns almost  percent of Dell Computer while Gates owns percent of Microsoft Larry Ellison Gates nemesis at Oracle has a sizableminority stake in his company And Steven Jobs having learned his lesson atApple where he was forced out by professional manager John Sculley owns percent of his new company Pixar makers of Toy Story  therebyensuring that no one will ever push him around again In the financialservicesindustry Fidelity Investments is still run by the Johnson family whileCharles Schwab is the largest shareholder in the company that bears his nameThe Walton family owns a sizable chunk of WalMart while Phil Knight founderof Nike owns onethird of that company Of course that means Knight lost million on Feb  but such are the perils of ownership            The oldermanagerial model is certainly still alive and well as proved by theextraordinary number of new CEOs who have been hired from outside corporationsin the last three years But the return to the ownermanager model is real Inpart this is a function of the enormous entrepreneurial boom in the computerindustry over the last two and a half decades The key word in Silicon Valleyhas always been equity and the best company leaders have clung to as much ofit as they could In fact with the notable exception of Compaqthere isshockingly no family with the last name Compaqthe best technology companieshave been those in which the people who started the company have continued torun it and to own much of it Not coincidentally these are the companies thathave made people into billionaires            But the return to the ownermanager model is also connectedto an important transformation in the way American business understandsincentives During the glory days of the postWorld War II boom it was assumedthat a high salary and meaningful responsibility were enough to motivateexecutives to do the best they could In the wake of the nearcollapse of manyUS corporations in the s though people began to think that the realproblem was that managers needed to be more like owners That helps explain theexplosion in the use of stock options since the s Give managers a stake intheir companies the thinking went and theyll perform better After all lookat Dell and Microsoft            Insofar asit assumed that people already being paid millions of dollars will workextrahard only if given still more financial incentives the options boom wasa glorious product of the Reagan era The idea of linking an executives pay toperformance is on its own terms obviously a good one But too often stockoptions are just gravy tossed in on top of a huge base salary to satisfy thedemands of executive privilege Piles of options by themselves do not make CEOsact like ownersthough they can make them ridiculously wealthy            Theres a dramatic difference between someonelike Michael Dell and someone like Al Dunlap Dells financial health iscompletely wrapped up with the company he started and still owns Dunlap forhis efforts in wreckingthat is restructuringcorporations is rewarded withhuge chunks of options that he immediately exercises so he can pocket the cashnot so he can invest in the future of the company More than that the lessonof Dells success has been misunderstood Since Michael Dell has been a greatmanager and has made billions of dollars corporations have imagined that hesbeen a great manager because hes made billions of dollars But itsmore likely that Dell has been a great manager because hes been running acompany that is in some important sense his Not that hes walking away fromthe billions of dollars of course            True the ownermanagermodel successful as it has been is not the only possible model for successBut in Dells case its clearly the ownership not the accompanying financialreward that has really mattered Most corporations with their skyrocketingpay to CEOs seem to have turned that formula on its head believing that theycan compete successfully only by duplicating the enormous financial gainssomeone like Dell has reaped In confusing stock options with ownershipcorporations confuse trappings with substance Unfortunately these aretrappings that come with billiondollar price tags attached
