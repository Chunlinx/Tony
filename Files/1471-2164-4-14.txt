                    Background        The history of the         T locus began with the discovery in         of a semidominant mutation in mice named         Brachyury  or         T for tail that affects both        embryonic viability in homozygotes and tail development in        heterozygotes     This original         T allele represents a deletion        spanning  kb reviewed in     the developmental        effects of which have been well characterized                 Homozygous mutant embryos show a developmental failure        of the notochord and posterior mesoderm and die at        midgestation Heterozygous mutant mice are born with        shortened tails and malformed vertebrae In  another        spontaneous         Brachyury mutation called         T         Wis  was reported     The         T         Wis homozygous and heterozygous        mutant phenotypes are more severe than those of the         T deletion suggesting that the         T         Wis allele acts as a dominant        negative Homozygous mutants have no somites at all and        heterozygotes have no tail rather than a shortened tail        reviewed in            The         T gene was cloned in             and its expression pattern was found to correlate with the        tissue types affected in         T mutants     Subsequently T        protein was shown to bind specifically to DNA and its        preferred         in vitro target sequence was        identified     It was further shown that         T encodes a transcription factor        capable of regulating expression of a reporter via the        identified target sequence     In their report        describing the initial cloning of the         T gene Herrmann et al    also        demonstrated that the         T         Wis allele of         T results from the insertion of an        endogenous retroviruslike early transposon ETn element        into the splice donor site of exon  of the  exon         T locus They showed that the splice        site at the  end of exon  was mutated from         TAG GTATGT to         TAG         GTGTTG where underlined sequence is        the  end of exon  and ETn insertion sequence is in bold        and predicted that this site would be nonfunctional        thereby abolishing splicing of exon  to exon  They        proposed that the         T         Wis allele would produce a transcript        comprised of exons  through  followed by readthrough        transcription of the ETn element resulting in a modified        Cterminal end or alternatively that upstream splice        donor sites would be used shortening the transcript and        protein product In later whole mount         in situ analysis Herrmann           confirmed expression of a         T locusderived transcript in         T         Wis          T         Wis embryos but did not examine its        exact nature The position of the ETn insertion see Figure        A is compatible with the idea that a modified protein        could still bind DNA but might compete with the wild type        protein or form an inactive complex with it thus leading        to a dominant negative effect        The aim of this study was to characterize the sequence        and structure of the         T         Wis allele transcripts with an eye        towards understanding the specific molecular consequences        of disruption of the exon  splice donor site by the        inserted ETn element Using an RTPCRbased approach we        have shown that at least  different transcripts are        produced from the         T         Wis allele of         T  In addition to the mutant        transcript predicted by Herrmann et al             transcripts composed solely of         T exonic sequences and  transcripts        containing ETn sequences spliced between         T exonic sequences were identified        All         T         Wis transcripts bypass the mutated        exon  splice donor site such that wild type         T transcripts cannot be produced from        the         T         Wis allele                    Results and Discussion                  Identity of the T WisETn element          As a first step in characterizing the molecular nature          of the           T           Wis allele of           T  the exact identity of the ETn          element inserted into the locus was determined The          primer ETn was designed to a region of conservation          across related but different ETn PCR was performed on          yolk sac lysates from e           T           Wis            T           Wis mutant embryos using the primer          set F  ETn Figure A Sequence analysis of the           bp PCR product amplified from           T           Wis            T           Wis DNA in two independent          reactions showed that the ETn element of the           T           Wis allele is identical to the           bp ETn sequence Genbank accession Y with the           T           Wis ETn element inserted in reverse          orientation relative to the direction of transcription of          the           T locus data not shown                          Transcripts produced from the T Wisallele of          T          The next step in characterizing the molecular nature          of the           T           Wis allele was to identify the          aberrant transcripts produced from this allele RTPCR          was performed on RNA from           T            T           Wis  and           T           Wis            T           Wis embryos using forward and          reverse primers located in different exons of the           T locus as well as a reverse          primer specific to the ETn element of the           T           Wis insertion Table and Figure          B The RTPCR products were excised purified and          sequenced twice on each strand with the primers used to          generate them The FR products were additionally          sequenced one time each with primers F and R          The FR and FR primer pair products FRa and          FRa amplified from a           T  embryo represented the          expected wild type           T RNA species  and           Figure B Table  and Figure B while those          amplified from a           T           Wis            T           Wis embryo together comprised           aberrant transcripts Figure B Table  and Figure          C Transcripts representing an exon  to exon  splice           an exon  to exon  splice  and an exon           to exon  splice  were all identified in           T           Wis            T           Wis embryos An additional mutant          transcript resulted from an aberrant splicing event from          exon  to exon  such that  nucleotides nt of the           end of exon  were deleted  and           Another mutant transcript included an aberrant miniexon          of  nt of ETn derivedsequences inserted between the           deleted exon  to exon  splice ETn and          ETn          As expected the FBGH primer set failed to          amplify from           T  embryo RNA Figure B In          the           T           Wis            T           Wis embryo this primer set          detected a mutant transcript representing readthrough          transcription from exon  into the immediately  ETn          insertion Etn Figure B Table  Figure C          In this preliminary analysis no wild type           T transcript was identified in           T           Wis            T           Wis RNA using any of the primer          sets These results suggest that no           T           Wis transcripts maintain normal          exon  to exon  splicing as postulated by Herrman et          al     To further clarify this issue the splicing          of exon  to exon  was specifically examined using the          forward primer F This primer is located within the last           bp of exon  and therefore is deleted in all of the          exon containing mutant transcripts already described          see Table  Table  and Figure  RTPCR analysis          with this primer confirmed that while the FBGH          transcript is only produced off the           T           Wis allele the FR transcript is          only produced off of the wild type           T allele Figure           In some cases a prominent band larger than the          expected wild type size was amplified by the FR          primers from           T           Wis            T           Wis embryo RNA Figure  Sequence          analysis showed that this larger           T           Wis            T           Wis specific band represented two          additional aberrant transcripts Table and Figure C          Notably these two products were never observed in           T           Wis  RNA Figure  A shorter          variant contained the intact  end of exon  and  nt          of readthrough transcription into the ETn element          spliced to exon  ETn Given that the BGH          primer is contained within the  nt of ETn readthrough          this species is not necessarily distinct from the ETn          transcript amplified by FBGH as both could be          amplified from the same hypothetical RNA ETn The          longer variant contained the intact  end of exon  and           nt of readthrough into the ETn element spliced to a           nt miniexon of ETn sequence then spliced to exon           ETnETn The  nt ETn miniexon was the same          sequence found in the ETn and          ETn products described above This species is          also not necessarily distinct from the ETn transcript          amplified by FBGH as both could be amplified from          the same hypothetical RNA ETnETn          Alternatively the ETn product might have amplified          from an RNA ETn where an unknown amount of the ETn          insertion was transcribed and the transcript terminated          in ETn sequence without being spliced to exon  Overall          wild type exon  to exon  splicing was never identified          in transcripts produced from the           T           Wis allele of           T           The characterization of           T           Wis allele transcripts presented          here confirms that the intron  donor splice site is          indeed nonfunctional such that wild type           T mRNA is never produced          Furthermore the exon ETn transcript predicted by          Herrmann et al    was identified However at least           other           T           Wis mutant transcripts are also          produced Figure C All of these transcripts serve to          bypass the mutated splice donor site either by splicing          over exon  activating a cryptic splice site within exon           or transcribing through exon  into the adjacent ETn          sequences The cryptic exon  splice site used           CCT GTGAGT is a strong match to          the           CAAG GTAGAGT splice donor          consensus It is important to note that in addition to          the exon  to  exon  to  and exon  to  splicing          events detected here the potential remains that          transcripts resulting from exon  to  exon  to           andor exon  to  splicing events are produced but were          not discovered          Genetically the           T           Wis allele acts as a dominant          negative in that           T           Wis            T           Wis embryos have a more severe          phenotype than the null           TT embryos However the          biochemical nature of this dominant negative effect is          not known This study confirms previous work             showing the existence of a transcript that would result          in a truncated protein if translated Because the          DNAbinding Tdomain would be intact this hypothetical          protein could compete with the wild type protein          producing a dominant negative effect Alternatively the          presence of heterologous Etn element sequences in           T           Wis transcripts may stimulate          posttranscriptional gene silencing by an RNAinduced          silencing complex RISCbased RNAi degradation pathway          which could target degradation of wild type transcripts                                         Conclusions        We have shown that disruption of a single splice donor        site within a multiexon locus can lead to a dramatic        misregulation of RNA splicing A straightforward prediction        suggests that in         T         Wis transcripts splicing out of        exon  would simply fail and result in a transcript        terminating with the ETn element In reality the effect is        much more complex cautioning against the use of        straightforward assumptions in predicting the molecular        consequences of genetic alterations                    Methods                  T Wismice and embryo collection          The           T           Wis allele was
