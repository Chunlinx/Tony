                                 Viacoms Acquisition of Mel Karmazin                        If theres anything odd about the justannounced merger between Viacom andCBS its that it seems utterly quaint to worry about whether the concentrationof so many cable radio network TV and Internet assets in one company is thebest thing for the free flow of information in a democracy FCC regulations mayrequire the new Viacom to sell a few of its TV stationsbecause theres a rulesaying one company cant own stations that serve more than  percent of theUnited Statesand to either spin off or fold in the stillstruggling UPN Butfor all intents and purposes the  billion deal is done            When you think about whether it should have been done you end upconfronting again a central paradox of the media business today The morefragmented audiences and consumer markets become the more important scaleappears to be Thats true both because the larger you are the easier it isfor you to repurpose content across many different platforms hows that for ajargonladen clause and the easier it is for you to promote that content inmany different places In the end the ability to distribute content andadvertising is probably as important as the ability to produce content andeven though in the age of the Internet and channel cable systems youd thinkanyone can get a message out there successful distribution is still basicallyall about aggregating lots of people In the old days CBS could do that justby broadcasting All in the Family  Today it has to use its radiostations its billboards its TV stations and its broadcasts But the factthat it can use all those different outlets is essential            Now you could think of this as synergy And certainly Sumner Redstone CEOof Viacom likes that idea as evidenced by things like Simon  Schustersselling MTV books Paramounts releasing The Rugrats movie and so onBut in a way Redstones content is king refrain seems a bit oldschool nextto the distribution is king refrain of Mel Karmazin who is head of CBS andwill be the operational head of the new Viacom Redstone has done an excellentjob of managing Viacom in the past couple of years selling off assets payingdown debt and generally focusing the company on its core operations But itsKarmazin who will be president and chief operating officer of the new companywhos really essential to Viacoms future because its Karmazin who recognizesthat no matter what you make if people dont see it or hear it it doesntmatter            Karmazins relentless focus on shareholder value and his essential frugalityas an executive have long distinguished him from the media mogulslikeRedstonewho spent much of the s and early s borrowing huge sums ofmoney to make questionable acquisitions and engage in hostile takeover battlesKarmazin came to CBS from radio chain Infinity Broadcasting which CBS stillowns and brought to CBS a measure of economic rigor that for a long time washard to find in the media business When you listen to Karmazin you get thefeeling youre listening to someone who thinks that media companies should bejudged by the same economic and business standards as other companies asopposed to someone who thinks that media companies should be valued by thegrandiosity of their dreams Needless to say this is a good thing            The irony though is that while Karmazin is the newmodel media execmogul being a word that doesnt fit one of his greatest strengths is hisability to recognize the value of the seemingly mundane Radio and outdooradvertising for instance are incredibly unglamorous But theyre alsofastgrowing markets unlike for example television or even the movies andKarmazin has ensured that CBS has reaped great benefits from them Local TVstations are similarly boring but while they are not the cash cows they oncewere theyre still very profitable and Karmazin has agitated successfullyfor a relaxation of federal regulations to allow CBS to own more than onestation in a given market Cable is not a booming businessthough it may be inthe future once we all go to digital cablebut it is a profitable one andthis deal gives Karmazin a host of cable networks to play with All mergersshould given the historical record be greeted with skepticism But inacquiring the rights to Karmazins services and CBSs assets Sumner Redstonemay have made the best decision of his business career
