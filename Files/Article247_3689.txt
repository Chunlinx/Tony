                                 The Meritocratic Revolution                        Dear David            I too was very impressed with the first part of The Big Test  Ialso thought better of the second part which starts with Clark Kerrs role inthe creation of the threelevel California highereducation system and endswith Lemanns detailed account of the political battle over the CaliforniaCivil Rights Initiative than you did but Ill get to that later            I will confess I began the book with the weary expectation that the SAT andthe Educational Testing Service ETS would be attacked again as they havebeen so often in the pastby Banesh Hoffman because of the ambiguity builtinto shortanswer tests by Ralph Nader and Allen Nairn because ETS tries tokeep its test questions private and by many because of the common charge thatall the tests do is to confirm the advantages of those from good schools andwith educated parents The book is after all subtitled The secret history ofthe American meritocracy which arouses the suspicion that there is somethingdisreputable that has been kept secret and will now be revealed But of coursethe large outline of this history of how academic qualifications became the keyconsideration for college and university admissions isnt very secret atallits been told by Christopher Jencks and David Riesman in The AcademicRevolution  more than  years ago and in other studies of American highereducation and part of the story is also told in The Bell Curve               as you suggest            But the detailed story of the SAT and the ETS that Lemann has constructed onthe basis of really impressive research in the ETS archives is indeed new Inview of earlier attacks on the ETS I would have been interested in knowing ifLemann had any problems in gaining such full access to ETS archives            There is no question that the shift to meritocracy in college admissionscombined with the growing significance of college as the entry point to keyprofessions and occupations does amount to a revolution If college hadremained less importantit once was Andrew Carnegie for example wasdismissive of college graduatesit would have mattered less just what thestandards for admission were            I do think a few nuances in this welltold story have been neglected byLemann James Bryant Conant and Henry Chauncey play key roles and clearly theeffect of the shift to an exam like the SAT is to make it possible for thosewith fewer social advantages and who have not attended highstatus prep schoolsto successfully compete for places like Harvard if they are academically ableConant and Chauncey truly wanted to create an elite based on merit and indoing so were reducing the opportunities of people of their own class andbackground But when this story begins in the early s as Conant becomespresident of Harvard and is thinking of ways of selecting able students fromthe Midwest and elsewhere outside of Harvards traditional recruiting areaHarvard and similar institutions were still to some degree discriminatingagainst Jewish students Indeed one reason Harvard was extending its reachbeyond the Boston and New York metropolitan area from which most of itsstudents came was in order to reduce the number of Jewish students Goingnational had its own good reasons but were Jews being overly suspicious inthinking that one reason which they did not think was so good was to recruitfrom areas in which fewer Jews lived I would have been interested in knowingwhether Lemann on the basis of his research believes this factor was at workin trying to recruit a more nationally representative student body            I would also note that the meritocratic process was not only selfinitiatedby colleges and universities There was also pressure from the Jewishcommunity resulting in a New York state law banning discrimination on thebasis of religion just after World War II and this law was fought by Columbiaand other private universities One effect of the law was to forbid collegesand universities to ask for pictures of applicants Other states followed NewYork state in passing such laws Colleges and universities had good reason forpreserving their right to make their own decisions in admissions but was onereason the effort to reduce the number of Jewish students who would havequalified on academic merit alone            This is prehistory but not entirely irrelevant One reason Jewishorganizations were opposed to affirmative action in admissions in the s wasbecause it had not been so long since they had been fighting discriminationagainst Jews Indeed even in the early s Jews were not all convinced thatthis was only history I recall that a group of Harvard faculty members metwith the director of admissions at Harvard because some of them wonderedwhether any vestiges of these practices remained The director of admissionsdid at one point say there was a problem of an oversupply of good students fromthe suburbs of Boston and New York the doughnut as he called it and it wasHenry Rosovsky I recall who commented that to some of those present that itwas not a doughnut but a bagel But it was not long before Rosovsky himselfascended to the second most important position at Harvard and Jews becamepresidents of the leading Ivy League universities            At the time to replace nonacademic criteria of any kind with academiccriteriaand the SAT is an academic criterion Doing well on it means that onewill do well at the things one does in collegeseemed a gain for justice andequality and there was no one ready to attack this development But thenalmost immediately the question came up It might be justice but was itequality And we began to struggle and we still struggle with the fact thatblacks do not do well in these tests At one point Lemann uncovers an earlyeffort in the s to create an adjusted score on the SAT that takes intoaccount the socioeconomic background of the testtaker It stands to reasonthat if test results are correlated with income or other measures of socialbackground that students who do better than expected on the basis of theirsocioeconomic background may be stronger than their test results indicateThe adjusted score would be called the MAT measure of academic talent This issurprisingly similar to recent efforts in ETS research to create a striversscore But neither the MAT which did not take account of race or the newstrivers  score which may would have solved the problem created for ameritocratic system by low black achievement on the SAT because that is notaccounted for by the lower economic and educational background of blacktesttakers            That problem was there at the beginning when meritocracy appeared to havetriumphed whether at the University of California or Yale and it is stillwith us So it made sense for Lemann to move from the history of ETS to thehistory of affirmative action as it affected higher education admissions Hetells this story in a rather different way from the history of ETS with anemphasis on the role of some activists lawyers and others who entered collegeand university at a time when meritocratic considerations were not yet affectedin a major way by racial considerations and when a number of young Japaneseand ChineseAmericans had opportunities to attend elite schools they wouldprobably have not been able to in the premeritocratic age Some of them becameleaders in the effort to maintain affirmative action in California Themselvesthe beneficiaries of meritocracy they were now ready to reduce its weight forthose who did not do well in the tests created to serve meritocracy This partof the story is based more on interview and less on research in archives but Ithink it is told well I think David you are being too prickly in respondingto it It is true it is told from the point of view primarily of those whotried to save preference and one may be able to take issue with some of thejournalistic flourishes as you do but aside from characterization of theparticipants I dont detect bias            But I agree with you that when it comes to the upshot of the whole storythose scanty last few pages on what it all means Lemann just throws up hishands and leaves a lot dangling If not these tests which None Aiming atwhat kinds of characteristics How do we discover them Are there really anyalternatives            But this letter is long enough possibly too long for the format so I willleave discussion of Lemanns attempt to sum up to the next letter I would beinterested in knowing more of what you make of this last chapter and hisposition He seems to be struggling between some distaste for the role of theSAT and an inability to formulate an alternative            YoursNat Glazer
