A Brief HistoryThe southern part of Spain is at a geographical crossroads It is the gateway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic and the crossing point between Africa and Europe The strategic importance of its location has given rise to a long and turbulent historyThe earliest evidence of human occupation is provided by the Paleolithic cave paintings some  years old in the Cueva de la Pileta Neolithic peoples arrived on the scene in the fourth millennium bc leaving behind signs of early attempts at agriculture and fragments of their pottery Tribes of Iberians from North Africa crossed over into Spain around  bc and initiated Spains first experiments in architecture Spains oldest structure stands near Antequera a dolmen burial chamber known as the Cueva de Romeral After  bc wandering bands of Celts entered the peninsula from northern Europe and brought to the area their knowledge of bronze and iron work As they moved farther south the Celts merged with the Iberians and began to build walled villages along the coastTraders and ColonizersAbout the same time this was taking place the Phoenicians were already venturing across the Mediterranean from their homeland in presentday Lebanon They reached Spain by about  bc founding many trading settlements in the land they called Span or Spania The first was Gades modern Cdiz followed by Malaka now Mlaga and Abdera Adra on the Costa del Sol Contact with the sophisticated Phoenicians introduced the CeltIberians to the concept of currencyAfter about  bc Greek traders entered the competition to exploit Spains rich mineral deposits and fertile land Their influence was shortlived although the olive and the grape both Greek legacies soon became important welltended cropsThe Carthaginians a North African people related to the Phoenicians subsequently took over much of southern Spain beginning with Cdiz in precisely  bc They extended their influence along the River Guadalquivir to Sevilla then to Crdoba On the coast they founded the city of Carteya overlooking the Bay of Algeciras  bc Carthage challenged by Rome in the First Punic War  bc lost most of its Spanish possessions to Iberian attacks But its fortunes changed with an initial victory in the Second Punic War  bcEmboldened the Carthaginian general Hannibal decided to advance on Rome He led one of historys great military marches from Spain into Italy crossing the Pyrenees and the Alps on the way The Romans invaded Spain to cut off Hannibals supply routeand stayed there for some  yearsRoman RuleIt took the Romans two centuries to subdue the Iberians but in the end most of the peninsula was incorporated into their new colony of Hispania The south formed part of the province of Baetica virtually identical to todays Andaluca with Crdoba its capitalThe Roman presence had a farreaching influence on the country A road network was constructed the Via Augusta ran the length of the south coast on its way to Rome and bridges aqueducts villas and public buildings were added to the list of their achievements The introduction of the Latin language from which modern Spanish developed Roman law the basis of Spains legal system and eventually Christianity brought about stability and a degree of unityEventually the Roman Empire began to crumble The Romans withdrew from Spain This left the country to be overrun by various barbarian tribes especially the Vandals The Visigoths who for some  years controlled much of southern Spain eventually dominated these tribes Ultimately the Visigothic kingdom proved unstable The monarchy was elective rather than hereditary which led to disputes over succession to the crown and in one of these the disaffected party looked to North Africa for an allyMoors and ChristiansIn ad  some  Berber troops landed at Gibraltar beginning a period of Moorish rule that was not broken by the Christians until nearly  years later Following their victory at the Battle of Guadalete the Moors the name given to the Muslims in Spain carried all before them They pushed the Visigoths into the northern mountains and within ten years most of the country had fallen to Islam To this day Almucar Tarifa Algeciras Benalmdena and several other southern towns are known by their Arabic names So is Andaluca for that matter originally the Moorish kingdom of Al AndalusThe Moors chose Crdoba as their seat of government and from the th to the very early th centuries it ranked as one of the great cities of the world The city was capital of the independent caliphate of Crdoba founded by AbderRahman III in  Under the caliphs southern Spain knew prosperity and peace for the Moors were relatively tolerant rulers and taxed nonbelievers rather than trying to convert them Intellectual life flourished and great advances were made in science and medicineWith the introduction of a sophisticated irrigation system crops such as rice cotton and sugar cane were cultivated for the first time on Spanish soil as well as oranges peaches and pomegranates The manufacture of paper and glass was another Moorish innovation Skilled engineers and architects the Moors built numerous palaces and fortifications As superb craftsmen they excelled in the production of ceramics and tooled leather as well as delicate silverwareThe ensuing fall of Crdoba was as remarkable as its rise In  the caliphate splintered into a number of small kingdoms called taifas which were constantly at war The Christians in the north seeing the enemy weakened and divided captured the taifa of Toledo Under threat of attack the other taifas sought help from the Almoravids fanatical Berber warriors The Berbers marched against the Christians in  and went on to reduce Moorish Spain to a province of their own North African EmpireFor a time therefore the affairs of Muslim Spain were administered from the Almoravid headquarters in Granada until they lost their grip on the peninsula softened by their life of ease in Andaluca The pattern repeated itself a century later when the Moors invoked the aid of the Almohads in  These primitive tribesmen who came from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco soon made themselves the masters of southern Spain They constructed major fortifications such as Sevillas Alczar endowing the Moors with sufficient strength to resist the Christian forces a while longerThe fortunes of the Moors and Christians swayed back and forth until  when the Christians gained their first decisive victory at Las Navas de Tolosa in northern Andaluca The Christians gradually captured and annexed the former bastions of Moorish rule in  Crdoba fell to James the Conqueror followed by Sevilla in  The Moors were in retreat retrenching along the coast and withdrawing to the security of their strongholds in Ronda and GranadaIn military disarray and political decline Moorish Spain nevertheless saw another two centuries of brilliance under the Nasrid dynasty founded in Granada by Mohammed I in  Refugees from Crdoba and Sevilla flooded into the city bringing with them their many talents and skills and adding to the citys brilliance The magnificent palace of the Alhambra provided the setting for a luxurious court life dedicated to the pursuit of literature music and the artsYet the Moorish fortresses along the coast soon came under attack Sancho IV took Gibraltar in  but the Christians later relinquished their prize and the Moors held on to it until  In the s the Christians launched a new offensive Ronda capitulated to the sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella in  followed by Mlaga in  and Almera in  And all Christendom gave thanks when Granada was finally conquered in The Golden AgeWith the triumph of Christianity the country was united under the Catholic Monarchs Los Reyes Catlicos a title conferred by Pope Alexander VI on Ferdinand II of Aragn and Isabella I of Castile Also in  Cristobal Coln Christopher Columbus discovered the New World in the name of the Spanish crown Fanatical in their religious zeal the king and queen expelled all Jews who refused to convert to Christianity in the same year and the Moors followed in  The rulers thus reneged on the promise of religious freedom they had given when Granada surrendered With the Jews who left Spain went many of the countrys bankers and merchants and with the Moors a good number of its agriculturists and laborers The converted Jews conversos and Moors Moriscos who remained in Spain were viewed with suspicion by the Inquisition which had been established by the Catholic Monarchs to stamp out heresy Many were condemned to death and still more fled the country to escape persecutionThe th century was glorious for Spain with the conquest of the New World bringing much prestige and wealth In  the Casa de Contratacin in Sevilla was awarded a monopoly on trade with Spains territories in the Americas For more than two centuries Sevilla was the richest city in SpainBy comparison the coastal settlements languished and were subject to frequent raids by Barbary pirates Under constant threat for more than  years the population drifted inland taking refuge in fortified towns and villages hidden in the foothills of the SierrasAs Emperor Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire the first Habsburg Spanish king turned his attention to events in Europe Between  and  he went to war with France four times squandering the riches of the Americas on endless military campaigns Charles also had a weakness for such costly projects as his vast Renaissance palace on the grounds of the Alhambra which he commissioned in  Taxes imposed on the Moors served to finance the building works which eventually had to be abandoned for lack of funds when the Moriscos revolted  years into the reign of Philip II  The king dispatched his halfbrother Don Juan of Austria to quell the rebellion which ended in  with the defeat of the Moriscos and their eventual dispersal In  Philip II prepared to invade England only to be repulsed when the English navy destroyed Spains previously invincible ArmadaThe defeat marked the start of a long decline Philips military forays and his expensive taste left Spain encumbered with debts Participation in the Thirty Years War under Philip III led to further financial difficulties and to another debacle in  when Spanish troops were defeated by the French at Rocroi in Flanders never to regain their prestigeFrench AscendancySpains internal affairs became the concern of the other great powers after Charles II died without an heir The Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria challenged Frances Philip of Bourbon in the ensuing War of the Spanish Succession Gibraltar was the scene of some fierce fighting in  when Great Britain captured the Rock on behalf of Austria Under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht which also confirmed Philips right to the Spanish throne Spain was finally forced to relinquish its claims to Gibraltar in Nearly a hundred years later during the Napoleonic Wars Spanish ships fought alongside the French fleet against Lord Nelson at Cape Trafalgar see page  But as the wars continued Napoleon distrustful of his ally forced the Spanish king Ferdinand VII to abdicate in  and imposed his brother Joseph as king He then sent thousands of troops across the Pyrenees to subjugate the Spanish who promptly revoltedAided by British troops who were subsequently commanded by the Duke of Wellington the Spanish drove the French out of the Iberian Peninsula At Tarifa the enemy was defeated literally overnight in an offensive of  What the world now knows as the Peninsular War   is in fact referred to in Spain as the War of Independence During this troubled period Spains first shortlived constitution was drafted and their colonies of South America won their independenceTroubled TimesFerdinands return to the throne in  destroyed any hopes left for a constitutional monarchy while tension between liberals and conservatives led to a century of conflict marked by the upheavals of the three Carlist wars and the abortive First Republic which was proclaimed in On the Andalucan coast the th century was a time of tentative expansion With piracy at an end a number of towns and villages grew up along the shoreline and the extension of the railway line to Almera in  promoted the early development of the eastern regionAlfonso XIII just  years old assumed the crown in  Prosperity and stability continued to elude the country which remained neutral during World War I Against a murky background of violence strikes and regional strife the king accepted the dictatorship of General Miguel Primo de Rivera in  Seven years later the opposition of radical forces toppled Primo de Rivera from power Alfonso XIII went into exile following antiroyalist election results in  and another republic was foundedParliamentary elections in  resulted in a swing to the right and public opinion became polarized When the left came out on top in the elections of  the situation deteriorated at an alarming rate It came as no surprise when six months later General Francisco Franco led a large section of the army against the socialist government Support for the Francoled nationalist uprising came from monarchists conservatives and the rightwing Falangist organization as well as the Roman Catholic Church while liberals socialists Communists and anarchists sided with the governmentThe bloodshed lasted no less than three years and cost hundreds of thousands of lives General Franco emerged as the leader of a shattered Spain Many Republicans went into exile others simply disappeared The Republican mayor of Mijas caused a sensation when he finally surfaced in the s after three decades in hidingin his own home Franco kept Spain out of World War II despite Hitlers entreaties to the contrary The Spanish nation gradually healed its wounds though conditions in the country were difficult and life was far from easyChanging FortunesAll that was to change virtually overnight as Spains tourist potential began to be exploited in the s Credit was made available for the development of hotel complexes and apartment blocks and former fishing villages like Torremolinos and Marbella began to change forever Spains admission to the United Nations in  followed by the advent of jet travel and package holidays in the s subsequently opened up the coast to mass tourismWith the death of General Franco in  Spain returned to democracy In accordance with Francos wishes the monarchy was restored in the person of King Juan Carlos the grandson of Alfonso XIII see page  More than just a figurehead the king helped to thwart a military coup in  keeping Spain firmly on a democratic courseA process of decentralization was started with more powers being devolved although not equally to  semiautonomous regions As a consequence on  February  Andaluca was proclaimed an autonomous state Also that year the socialist government of Felipe Gonzlez was elected and committed itself to Spains successful integration into the European Community EC now known as the European Union or EU As a precondition of admission the border with Gibraltar was reopened in February  after a year hiatus and Spain was finally admitted to the EC in  Despite high unemployment figures and separatist rumblings the countrys economy has remained one of the fastest growing in Western Europe
