                                 In Praise of Cluelessness            According to a study in the December issue of the Journal ofPersonality and Social Psychology not available online but the NewYork Times  Erica Goode deftly summarized it on Jan  a fundamentalcharacteristic of incompetent people is their inability to recognize that theyare incompetent The study begins with the following slapstick anecdote                                             In  McArthur Wheeler walked into two Pittsburgh banks and robbedthem in broad daylight with no visible attempt at disguise He was arrestedlater that night less than an hour after videotapes of him taken fromsurveillance cameras were broadcast on the  oclock news When police latershowed him the surveillance tapes Mr Wheeler stared in incredulity But Iwore the juice he mumbled Apparently Mr Wheeler was under the impressionthat rubbing ones face with lemon juice rendered it invisible to videotapecameras                                       To test the principle of which the endearingly clueless Wheelers story isan extreme example the studys authors Justin Kruger and David Dunning ofCornell took a bunch of Cornell students and had them perform four tasks andthen estimate how well theyd done at each In the first they were asked toassess how funny they found a series of jokes of markedly varied funniness asgraded by a team of eight professional comedians In the second they wereasked to take a logicalreasoning test In the third they were asked to take agrammar test In the fourth they were given another logicalreasoning testbut this time some of those tested were subsequently given about  minutesworth of training in logical reasoning and then asked to reestimate how welltheyd done on the test In every instance but the last the worst scorersguessed that theyd done better than average Participants in the fourth studywere able to assess their abilities more realistically but only by becomingless incompetent            Kruger and Dunning compare peoples inability to recognize theirincompetence to a neurological disability called anosognosia Sufferers of anosognosia are paralyzed on the leftside of their body but dont seem to understand that fact when asked to picksomething up with their left hand they will decline by saying theyre tootired or didnt hear the question or dont want to Kruger and Dunningsfinding also calls to mind the quotation from Soren Kierkegaards The Sickness Unto Death that serves as the epigraphto Walker Percys novel The Moviegoer  The specific character of despairis precisely this it is unaware of being despair Substitute the worddepression for despair and you have a cornerstone of modernpsychotherapy            What the studys authors dont examine is whether cluelessness while quiteoften a bad thing for the individual is a good thing for society Kruger andDunning are careful to point out that in certain circumstances its impossiblefor all but the clinically deluded to ignore evidence about ones relativecompetence We doubt whether many of our readers would dare take on MichaelJordan in a game of oneonone challenge Eric Clapton with a session ofdueling guitars or enter into a friendly wager on the golf course with TigerWoods These individuals superior skill regularly demonstrated in public issimply too great to ignore And as their study showed when incompetent peopleare given a chance to wise up a bit they do acquire someretrospective understanding of their limitations            The benefits of cluelessness come from living in a society wherepeople take an optimistic view of life Political speechifyers are alwaysmarveling about the bounteous opportunity of American life What rarely getsdiscussed frankly is how much the economy depends on people perceivingthat opportunity to be somewhat greater than it really is Here is Chatterboxs former US News boss James Fallows in his book More Like Us                                              Overoptimism is in fact the common theme in many of the most purelyAmerican phenomena the myth that anybody can grow up to be president thatimmigrants children can be doctors and lawyers that you can turn yourfranchise into a fortune that salesman can make it on a smile and ahandshake David McClelland author of The Achieving Society  said that the famousselfconfidence of businessmenreally their refusal to face discouragingfactswas an important tool for economic development One of the best exampleswas the completion of Americas transcontinental railroads in the nineteenthcentury When they were built they could hardly be justified in economicterms McClelland said They would never have been economically justified ifthe country had not been swarming  with thousands of small entrepreneurswho repeatedly overestimated their chances of success but who collectivelymanaged to settle and develop the West while many of them individually werefailing                                       The Internet economy is a more contemporary example of this phenomenonSurely most people trying to strike it rich in this gold rush will fail butright now their buoyant optimism is keeping the stock market high and makingAmerica wealthier Long live cluelessness
