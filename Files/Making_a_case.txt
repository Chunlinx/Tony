attorney in solo practice inFlagstaff began to tell attendees how to do it focusing first oncareful planningPrior Planning Prevents Poor Performance said Adams citingwhat he called the Five PsAnd poor performance isnt afforded much leniency According toAdams Arizona law says that those representing themselves are heldto the same standards as an attorney with respect to knowledge ofboth the law and legal proceduresFridlundHorne suggested starting by researching the specificlegal issue at stake at a law library DNAPeoples Legal Servicesmakes one available to the public at its office at  E BirchAvenue The librarians there can offer limited assistance infinding the needed informationOnce a person has a general idea what area of the law is atissue he or she should consult with an attorney taking advantageof the free consultations that many offer FridlundHorne suggestedstarting with the Yellow Pages to find the right attorneyBut like a mechanic she said the best way to find anattorney would be by word of mouthThe attorney can give basic advice about what will need to bedone to file a lawsuit or to defend against one But after thatyoure on your ownLibrary research and consultation

simple rule for behavior while representingyourself Mean what you say say what you mean and dont do it ina mean way he said And of course he said demonstrate thefacts with cold hard evidenceWhat the judge really wants are the facts  he wants to make agood decision he saidProper organization and presentation of those facts then isessential to representing yourself successfully Adams recommendedfocusing on the basics who what where when and how Theseshould be the core of someones opening and closing statementsFor the actual presentation of the facts Adams suggested simplestorytelling his method of choice as an attorney communicating thefacts of a case to a jury and judgeYoure trying to create a painting using words he saidThat is the art of advocacyThe story however must be backed with evidence Bearing inmind then that the stories told in court will almost certainlydiverge from one another the panel emphasized that a person shoulddo whatever possible to obtain objective evidence to confirm his orher story That evidence can include corroborative witnesses  andeven a layperson representing himself has the power of subpoena torequire testimonyFridlundHorne cautioned particularly against trying too hard todisprove the opposition instead of presenting positive evidence toprove ones own caseFocus on proving your side she saidBut above all she said show respect to the judge to theopposition and to the witnesses in dress in speech and in generalbearingJudges certainly appreciate it And often according to Adamsthey will return the favorI admire you for trying to do this on your own he said Youhave the right  and I think judges respect thatFor smaller cases the judge suggested trying alternativedispute resolution a service
