                                 Strange Webfellows            Ira Magaziner is best knownas the chief structural engineer of the Clinton administrations biggestbooboo its firstterm attempt to pass comprehensive healthcare reformThough he stayed on at the White House after that debacle Magaziner hasntbeen much heard from since and his actual responsibilities have been somethingof a mystery Well Magaziner has been foundmaking policy for the InternetWebheads already angry at Clinton for the Communications Decency Act mightregard Magaziners latest assignment as insult added to injury But in factthe story of the Clinton administration and the Internetand especially of howthe White House came to support the unconstitutional unpopular law known asthe CDAis more complicated and interesting than that            Magazinerhas spent the last eight months in charge of an interagency task force that istrying to figure out how to expand international opportunities for onlinebusiness I hold in my hands a few days in advance of its release the taskforces draft report It contains one remarkable passage Along with theirworries about intellectualproperty protections tariffs and technicalstandards Magaziner and company write that they are concerned that manycountries including the United States are considering or have adopted laws torestrict access to certain types of content through the Internet  Thesemultiple interests may result in barriers for US providers attempting to entercertain national markets The report proposes a statement of US policy oncontent restrictions Promote the use of industry  selfregulation andrating systems and technical solutions to empower parents and other users toresolve contentious access issues eg childrens access pornography andviolence The latest version removes the word pornography from thissequence            This white paper is notable for two reasons The first isthat the chief author who is known fairly or otherwise for his fondness forheavy regulation seems to be leaning in a more libertarian directionCongratulations Ira But the more significant point is that the reportcompletely contradicts what has heretofore been the Clinton administrationsposition on the Communications Decency Act which was signed by the presidentin February The CDA as most people reading this probably know attempts toregulate content through criminal penalties for those who violate standards ofdecency standards drawn so broadly that they might prohibit for instanceDavidSedaris Diary from last week with any comment request suggestionproposal image or other communication that in context depicts or describesin terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary standards sexual orexcretory activities or organs            The Clinton administrationssupport of the CDAwhich it is now defending before the Supreme Courthasbeen a bit of a mystery It turns out to have been a bit of an accident Lastyear when the CDA was first proposed by James Exon the Democratic senatorfrom Nebraska the Clinton Justice Department frowned In May  thenactingAssistant Attorney General Kent Markus wrote to Sen Patrick Leahy that amongother problems the proposal was an attempt to impose criminal sanctions onthe transmission of constitutionally protected speech Inside the White Houseaccording to Clinton sources Vice President Al Gore and members of his staffwho have general responsibility for Internetrelated issues tried to steer theadministration away from supporting the act            As thebill headed toward overwhelming passage in the Senate however politicalreality began to assert itself With an election coming up the last thing theClintonites wanted was to get on the wrong side of a potentially explosiveissue dealing with children and pornography No way are you going to getyourself in a position where the president isnt willing to go as far as aDemocratic senator in restricting child pornography on the Internet onesenior administration official explained Child pornography and obscenity areillegal anyway but that was a fine point the administration wasnt willing torisk elucidating on the verge of a campaign            So part of the explanation is cowardice in theface of potential demagoguery Another part is that the CDA was folded into thetelecommunications bill an acre of legislation that reorganizes oneseventh ofthe nations economy It was a bill in which the administration had manyintereststhe vchip competition among local telephone companies and so onThe White House could not afford to antagonize Exon by opposing his petprovision Those inside the administration who were troubled by theconstitutional implications of the CDA rationalized their cop out by sayingthat the law was sure to be overturned anywayas indeed it was in a decision that gave three Philadelphia judges a welcome opportunity to soundlike Oliver Wendell Holmes            Clintonites say the decision to appeal that ruling is essentially proforma  the solicitor general rarely chooses not to not defend theconstitutionality of a law the president has signed The CDA was almost one ofthose rare occasions In its Court of Appeals brief the Justice Departmentstipulated that the socalled Comstock provision in the law which restrictsthe dissemination of information about abortion was unconstitutional and wouldnot be enforced Gore in particular wanted to avoid an appeal by finding away to settle with the various plaintiffs in the suit According toClintoncampaign scholar Dick Morris the administrations decision to takethe bill to the Supreme Court was over Gores objections Morris says he hadtwo discussions with Gore about whether there might be an alternative way tostop children from gaining access to inappropriate material on the InternetWe couldnt really find a technical way of doing it Morris says Others inthe White House believe it was Morris himself who prevailed against Gore andgot the administration behind the act            In any case political logic prevailed Officially thedecision was made by Clintons first solicitor general Drew Days III He hadhis own reasons for pursuing the case In the early days of the administrationDays made a legally sound but politically disastrous decision to appeal thechildpornography conviction of a graduate student for having videotapes thatshowed teenage models with their clothes on The Supreme Court agreed with thebrief Days filed in that case Knox vs US  but the Senate voted to condemn his intervention and Clinton promptly disavowed his own solicitorgeneral in public Days who previously was thought to have a good shot at aseat on the Supreme Court fell off the Clinton shortlist Soon after decidingto appeal the CDA he returned to Yale Law School            Days successor WalterDellinger will argue the case before the court in March Friends seem certainthat the former constitutionallaw professor at Duke personally opposes theCDA But Dellinger who is still acting solicitor general pending officialnomination and confirmation by the Senate wasnt about to risk prematuretermination of his career He wouldnt comment But privately he may believewhat many in the administration offer in defense of their indefensibleposition that a resounding Supreme Court decision against them will do more toadvance the cause of free expression than would leaving the Court of Appealsopinion unchallenged            If that is theadministrations strategy it is foolhardy The Supreme Court might notcooperate in rejecting the administrations public position and embracing itssecret desire Furthermore its preposterous that a president reelected onrhetoric about building a bridge to the  st century hasnt botheredto work out a minimally consistent position on the Internet The basic problemas Ive argued before is Clintons lack of respect for civil libertiesexacerbated in this instance by a lack of understanding beyond the vicepresidents office of what is at stake in the development of the Internet Buta simple solution might be at hand It can be expressed in four words I thoughtId never utter Listen to Ira Magaziner
