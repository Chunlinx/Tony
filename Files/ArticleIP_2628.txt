                                 Is There Anything US Investors Wont Buy                                        Wonder whats happenedto the people and companies covered in previous Motley Fool articles inSlate  Click to get the update                        Consider it a case ofexquisitely bad timing Just as stock markets around the world were diving inresponse to currency troubles in Hong Kong and general unease about the futureof Asian economies China Telecomthat countrys largest provider ofcellularphone servicewent public When the initial public offering was firstannounced Hong Kong investors acted as if tickets to a Beatles reunion hadgone on sale lining up before dawn outside bank branches to procure theapplication forms needed to buy shares By the time China Telecom actually madeit to market though those same investors had other things on their mindyouknow minor things like whether the entire Hong Kong realestate market wasabout to fall to pieces            The samewas true to a lesser extent of investors in the United States to whom ChinaTelecom must suddenly have looked less like a savvy investment in an infinitelyexpandable market and more like an overvalued investment in a region plagued bydubious financing practices and even more dubious accounting The result waspredictable Where most IPOs this year have been strikingly successfulAMFBowling of all things being just the latest company to see its share pricejumpChina Telecoms shares fell by  percent in the first three days oftrading            Of course even with the bad timing China Telecom didraise  billion including  million in the United States alone in theIPO And the investment banks that underwrote the offering took home close to million So itd be hard to call the deal a failure especially when youconsider that the companys shares rebounded sharply when the US marketrallied In fact from a certain angle and especially given the turmoil inAsia China Telecoms IPO looks like a real triumph the kind of triumph infact that makes you wonder What wont investors buy            Thatquestion is especially pertinent here in the United States because thecombination of a booming stock market at home and the privatization ofstateowned enterprises abroad has meant a dramatic upsurge in the number offoreign companies whose shares are listed on US exchanges Through the end ofAugust  foreign corporations have gone public here this year raising atotal of  billion in capital Since then France Telecom Bell Canada andChina Telecom all have been added to the list France Telecom did it in stylebringing cancan girls onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for thefirst day of trading By the end of the year the number of foreign IPOsshould surpass last years record  offerings            Foreign companies of course want their shareslisted in the United States for the same reason that Willie Sutton robbedbanks The US capital market is the worlds largest All the money thatcontinues to pour into mutual funds has to go somewhere and the rhetoricaldrumbeat of globalization has made investors more comfortable with companieslike Spains Telefnica de Espaa and Brazils Telebras let alone companieslike Toyota and Sony The US capital market is also exceptionally liquid andpriceearnings multiples are high Foreign companies believe that US listingsboth increase trading in their shares and improve valuations An IPO thenbecomes a lucrative and relatively painless way of raising capital            Itsespecially painless because the vast majority of the shares of foreigncompanies trade in the United States in the form of something called AmericanDepositary Receipts The ADR was inventedas was so much elseby JP Morganin  when he created the device so that US investors could trade sharesof a British department store called Selfridges Essentially an ADR is asecurity issued by a bankthe depositarythat represents a share in aforeign corporation In most cases the owner of the ADR does not have votingrights In selling shares in the United States then foreign corporations canraise loads of money without suffering a dilution of the control they exerciseover their own affairs            So what you might justifiably ask Afterall the overwhelming majority of US investors never bother with their votingrights in US companies and the decline in the practice of paying outdividends means that most American stockholders care about only one thing theprice of their shares And you can care about the price of an ADR just aseasily as you can about the price of a bona fide share If China Telecomsshare price is going to double over the next year why shouldnt you buyit            If it isgoing to double then you should buy There wasnt that easy The problemthough is that the ADR phenomenon has created a situation where US investorsare pouring billions of dollars into companies whose standards of financialdisclosure and corporate governance are dramatically different from our own andwhich are in some cases nonexistent That means in turn that its hard tofigure out whether a company will be profitable next year let alone whetherits stock price is going to double And without full voting rights theresnothing that investorseven institutional investorscan do if things gohaywire            Take Tsingtao Beer for instance It wentpublic in  and its shares were quickly snapped up Instead of using themoney it raised from the IPO to expand though it lent the  million toother Chinese state enterprises and then watched many of those loans go southNeedless to say these plans had not been in the prospectus Similarly ChinaTelecom has said that it will explore opportunities for strategic investmentsin Chinas telecommunications industry But its not clear whether thisreally means strategic investments or whether it means investments to propup companies run by aging members of the CP Of course its possible that thepressure from China Telecoms chief competitor may keep it on track Thatcompetitor incidentally is a joint venture run by the Peoples LiberationArmy which brings new meaning to the words price war            The point is not thatinvesting in foreign companies is necessarily a mistake US investment infact is likely to improve standards of disclosure and accounting in manyforeign corporations And foreign investment is often crucial to a companysdevelopment The US railroads for instance would not have been builtwithout British capital But foreign investment takes place in a realm eventoday where the rules that govern US markets do not always apply It hasbeen most demoralizing a British emissary to a US company wrote his bossesin the late s Even one of our own Directors in New York when asked togive us some information as to what had become of the English capital sentoutwhat do you think he said He told us Well really Sir that is what Iam always asking but which I can never get to know  Its not that hard toimagine a similar message being sent home by someone investigating whathappened to Tsingtao            What the fad for foreignIPOs ignores is the massive uncertainty still attached to foreign markets evenas it has led US investors to overlook everything they take for granted athome regular reports corporate accountability open books the Securities andExchange Commission After all transparent and efficient markets are notnatural but rather manmade And what the triumph of capitalism in the lastdecade has hidden is the reality that in most places those markets have notyet been built Caveat emptor indeed
