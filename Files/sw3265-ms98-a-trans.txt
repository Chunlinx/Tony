        well ive been real um thinking id love to buy a new car right now if i could afford it but we have two cars right now and were still paying on but i would love to have one of these new minivans         ive got two little ones and i think that would be just the perfect family car   i right now my car is terminally ill so i am really looking at uh facing the purchase of a car   oh   and uh what i would like to have is so totally impractical for me that i wont do it  uh well i would like for one time in my life to have a convertible   well what is it oh   and uh you know i dont even like the wind blowing on me so i dont know why i think i want one but i do       uh i will probably stay with a foreign make ive had real good luck with them   yeah we have um we have we went out to buy an American car so we bought um a Chevy Nova about three years ago and then we opened up the the hood and it said Toyota made in Japan right across the front of all the engine parts   is that right   umhum Toyota uh well the Chevy Nova is the same car as the Toyota Camry uh at that time was the same car so they just put different names on them depending on who theyre being shipped to i thought that was pretty insensitive   oh well i didnt realize it i knew that one of the that Nissan which is Toyota had uh joined with had a plant over here and and i didnt know if it was General Motors or who       but i i never thought of   yeah   i dont know uh you think of Chevrolet and the good old USA   umhum umhum thats why we were so surprised to see Toyota written i mean imprinted on the engine it was real interesting   huh   but uh i with so many options now available you know where where cars are concerned it just seems like there is theres almost too much of a choice anymore you know that theres so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever i think that if i were really serious about looking for another car i would take into consideration the price naturally but um you know i would really want something that i would want for that much money for ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever   uh well yeah and thats minimum   oh yeah definitely   it you know its its a major purchase now what we used to pay for homes is now what a car can cost   i cannot imagine that you know somebody i heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollars car about oh oh it would how exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase and i thought i dont think id find that exciting id be wondering you know here i am buying this expensive of a car and my house isnt worth that much money     if they held their value that would be one thing but when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot theyre immediately two thousand dollars depreciated   thats true yeah   and you know that i dont know that ill go with ive bought a new car the last three that ive bought and i dont know that ill buy a brand new one again     yeah well we got a pretty we bought our Chevrolet brand new and then we bought a used car   just a minute ill change your diaper  the we bought our our next car used       and uh we had better luck with our used car and i like it more it cost us less money and we got more features and airconditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money   well im im seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car   if you can find one thats reliable uh you know reliable if you can get someone that you trust to buy one from or you know make sure that you can have it checked out well enough   well some people you know some people have to have a new car every year   uh i wouldnt   or it you know at the most every two years and they dont drive them that much       especially your foreign cars yeah like a Honda or uh a Toyota fifty thousand is just getting broken in for them   yeah   and if i can find one or a repossession   thats we bought one like that   and with the banks being in such financial you know problems now that people you can find the banks willing to sell you a car   uhhuh we bought one car that way and had we bought it real reasonably and it was in real nice condition so because apparently whatever the bank get
