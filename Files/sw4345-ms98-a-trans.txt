              i uh get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to All Things Considered on National Public Radio uh that is one of my big sources for current events information i i really like that coverage my wife uh on the other hand is home most of the day and she watches a lot of the cable news network have you seen uh have have you uh ever heard of All Things Considered   no we dont have the uh national public radio in in my area i can hear it at the um   umhum   uh oh the college town nearby when im in Stillwater which is about an hour away but the FM signal doesnt reach this far   umhum   uh i listen to shortwave quite a bit it gives you a whole different perspective on the news uh when you hear it from say a European point of view or from the country of origin   umhum   uh i agree with you too on the um uh the cable channel CNN and Headline News um im not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh which is why i rely on shortwave and and then the cable CNN   umhum   im uh interested in the in the shortwave aspect of it uh how do you find that the the coverage from other places in the world uh compares with the American coverage of how do you think that uh the viewpoints differ   i think a lot of it is just um the fact that in the US youre so far removed uh in a lot of cases from say conflicts or or its not happening in your backyard so its its more of a   umhum   its not as a personal uh the news isnt as personal in what we receive domestically than than whats on the shortwave its BBC is um oh i dont know the right word is is almost um they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it   umhum   and it just they seem to give more just the facts than opinions   do you think then that uh the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts   uh very much so very much so and i i think a lot of it is um especially TV news they dont really have the time and a lot of them dont have the education and the background to um       oh to really decipher the news and to really explain it i mean i you know i think its important to interpret it but a lot of times the person doesnt have the experience to to do the interpreting   umhum which uh which approach do you find to be um more useful the the interpretive approach or the straight reporting   oh i like the straight reporting um and then i i hope to be able to form my own opinion of it its its nice to hear someones interpretation of it   umhum   um i always think its humorous when when the President gives the State of the Union and uh for thirty minutes and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard       and a lot of times i dont hear exactly what they what they write into it   umhum   so i overall i think i would rather hear just straight reporting   one of the things that i found interesting last year during the uh the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against uh Peter Arnett who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting uh some of the things that were available uh there was a there was uh a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely uh a hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory and while he was being severely uh censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that this you know this isnt a baby milk factory how could he say it was uh and i think that that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them   yeah i i think people are people have that opinion they they wanna sit down in front of the TV and um or at a read a magazine or USA Today and read in four paragraphs uh and and find out every
