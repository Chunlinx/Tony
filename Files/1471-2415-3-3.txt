                    Background        AlphaCrystallin is comprised of two polypeptides        alphaAcrystallin alphaA and alphaBcrystallin alphaB        which share  amino acid sequence homology     They        are the most abundant proteins in lens fiber cells            and exist as heteroaggregates of approximately  kDa that        can undergo interaggregate subunit exchange     The        expression of these two proteins in the lens epithelium        however is not uniform throughout different regions of the        anterior epithelium AlphaB expression is detected in        central epithelium and increases from the central to        elongation zones where epithelial cells differentiate into        fiber cells AlphaA however is not detected in the        central epithelium The relative proportion of alphaA and        alphaB changes from a molar ratio of  in the pericentral        and germative zones to a molar ratio of  in the        elongation zone and fiber cells      These differences        in the relative proportions of alphaA and alphaB within the        lens suggest different functions for the two subunits in        the developing lens        Prior to the s alphacrystallin was thought to be        a structural protein whose major cellular function was to        produce a dense solution necessary for the refraction of        light in the lens During the early s        alphacrystallin was shown to act as a molecular chaperone        binding to partially denatured proteins both         in vitro    and probably         in vivo     to inhibit further        denaturation and aggregation of lens proteins AlphaA and        alphaB were also shown to have sequence homology with        several other proteins that are members of the small heat        shock protein hsp family     Moreover expression of        alphacrystallin particularly alphaB was shown to not be        restricted to the lens AlphaB was found to be expressed at        significant levels in a variety of nonlenticular tissues        while alphaA has only been detected in small amounts in a        few other tissues such as retina spleen and thymus                Collectively these findings have challenged        the dogma that alphacrystallin is purely a structural        protein necessary for light refraction and have led to the        realization that alphacrystallin may have a variety of        biological functions in the lens        A much broader scope of cellular functions of        alphacrystallin in lens is inferred from         in vitro observations Both alphaA        and alphaB can bind specifically to actin         in vitro    and         in vivo     Although actin        filament formation has been shown to be necessary for        differentiation of lens epithelial cells     the        significance of alphacrystallins interaction with actin        in differentiation is not known In the lens        alphacrystallin also associates with type III intermediate        filament proteins and the beaded filament proteins CP and        CP and correct beaded filament assembly has been shown        depend on the presence of alphacrystallin     Beaded        filament mRNA levels are greatly increased in        differentiating lens epithelium and have been suggested as        a panspecific marker for lens fiber development            Alphacrystallin has also been shown to interact directly        with DNA     In transfected CHO cells alphaB has also        been shown to ectopically localize to interphase nuclei        suggesting a role for this protein in the nucleus            A nuclear role for alphaB in the lens was supported by the        findings that a subset of lens epithelial cells derived        from alphaB knockout mice demonstrated hyperproliferation        and genomic instability     In addition the        administration of exogenous alphacrystallin to primary        bovine lens epithelial cell cultures resulted in the        formation of lentoid bodies consistent with a role for        these proteins in lens differentiation     These        findings indicate that alphacrystallin may have a        multitude of         in vivo functions        One approach to resolving some of the         in vivo functions of alphacrystallin        is to generate animal models where one or both of the        alphacrystallin gene products have been eliminated Brady        et al    demonstrated by targeted disruption of the        mouse alphaA gene that this protein was essential for the        maintenance of lens transparency possibly by maintaining        the solubility of alphaB or associated proteins in the        lens These lenses were also reported to be smaller in        equatorial and light axial dimensions than age matched wild        type lens It was not possible using the techniques        employed in the study to determine if the smaller lenses        were due to reduced volume or number of fiber cells        Targeted disruption of the mouse alphaB gene resulted in        lenses similar in size to agedmatched wild type lens        Moreover no cataract formation was observed in the alphaB        knockout lenses These animals have muscle cell        abnormalities severe postural anomalies selective muscle        degeneration and shorter life spans compared to normal        controls            In the single alphacrystallin knockout mice the        remaining alphacrystallin may fully or partially        compensate for some of the functions of the missing        protein especially in the lens where both alphaA and        alphaB are normally expressed at high levels The        objectives of the current report were to characterize gross        morphology of young  wk and old  wk mouse lenses        with targeted disruption of both the alphaA and alphaB        genes in comparison to age matched wild type lenses using        scanning electron microscopy SEM and confocal microscopy        to elucidate the possible functions of alphacrystallin in        the lens The results indicate that alphacrystallin is        necessary for proper fiber cell formation and resulting        lens transparency                    Methods                  Lenses          The wild type mouse strain used in this study was the          SvEvTac mouse Lenses examined were from

cellular material        capped the anterior region of the embryonicfetal nucleus        and a distinctive indentation of the lens mass at the        equatorial region was apparent in midaxial sections as        well as whole lenses In alphaABKO lenses the        embryonicfetal nucleus primary lens fibers had migrated        posteriorly and appeared to be in contact with the

was centrally located not in        contact with the posterior capsule        At higher magnification examination of sections stained        with DiI and SYTOX green revealed ultrastructural

     lenses large irregularly shaped cells were observed        interspersed among regions of high membrane staining        density per unit area These large objects were not        vacuoles because examination of the interior of these        structures by transmitted and reflected light microscopy        showed that the membranes encompassed cellular material        data not shown In addition nucleic acid staining was        observed Figure Fand I within many of these cells        exhibiting large crosssectional profiles In the wild type        lenses typical crosssectional patterns of

were observed in fiber cells of        the embryonic and fetal nucleus In  wk alphaABKO lenses        Figure C a greater variation in cross sectional        diameter was observed with cell diameters ranging from        less than  microns up to approximately  microns        compared to the  wk and  wk wild type lenses whose        diameters ranged from less than  microns up to        approximately  microns Figure Mand R At  wk these        cells in the alphaABKO lenses were larger in cross        sectional diameter than wild type and exhibited a much        greater variation in the cross

Posterior sutures were readily found in        vibratome sections of wild type lenses Figure O arrow        Fiber cells attached to the posterior capsule and extending        anteriorly were observed in  wk Figure O  wk Figure        T and  wk data not shown wild type lenses        SEM confirmed many of the observations made by confocal        microscopy In the equatorialbow region a disorganized        array of relatively small irregular shaped cells were        observed in  wk Figure A and  wk Figure D        alphaABKO lenses while elongated fiber cells organized        into radial columns

observed        in the posterior subcapsular region in  wk Figure I         wk Figure L and  wk data not shown wild type lenses        and fiber cells in contact with the posterior capsule could        be traced back to the equatorial bow region and anterior        epithelium                    Discussion        One approach to resolving some of the         in vivo functions of alphacrystallin        is to generate animal models where one or both of the        alphacrystallin gene products have been eliminated Brady        et al    demonstrated by targeted disruption of the        mouse alphaA gene that this protein was essential for the        maintenance of lens transparency possibly by maintaining        the solubility of alphaB or associated proteins in the        lens These lenses were also reported to be smaller in        equatorial and axial dimensions than age matched wild type        lens which was very similar to that which was observed        with the double knockout lens Targeted disruption of the        mouse alphaB gene however resulted in lenses similar in        size to agedmatched wild type lens with no cataracts        reported     This indicates that alphaA may play a        greater role in maintaining the transparency of the lens        then alphaB In the single alphacrystallin knockout mice        the remaining alphacrystallin may fully or partially        compensate for some of the functions of the missing        protein especially in the lens where both alphaA and        alphaB are normally expressed at high levels This was        supported by the morphological observation made in this        study of no posterior sutures or fiber cells extending to        the posterior capsule of the lens ectopically staining        nucleic acids in the posterior subcapsular region of  wk        and anterior subcapsular cortex of  wk gross        morphological differences in the equatorialbow posterior        and anterior regions of lenses from alphaABKO mice as        compared to wild mice None of these morphological        differences have been reported in the single alphaA or        alphaB knockout mice It must be noted however that the        alphaABKO mice also lack the HSPB gene product    and        the contribution of this protein to normal lens morphology        and functions should not be overlooked Future studies        should address the possible functions of HSPB in normal        lens        The results of the current study support the hypothesis        that alphacrystallin plays an active role in the        differentiation and growth of lens fiber cells Normal        differentiation of lens fiber cells consists of a        progression from a simple cuboidal epithelial cell        containing a nucleus and a minimal numbers of organelles        to a stratified layer of elongated fiberlike cells devoid        of nuclei and organelles Differentiation of epithelial        cells occurs in the equatorialbow region of the lens        where epithelial cells begin to elongate and differentiate        into fiber cells of uniform cellular shape arranged in        radial columns of cells extending from the anterior        epithelium to the posterior capsule This process did not        appear to have proceeded normally in lenses lacking alphaA        and alphaB The morphological observations presented in        this study demonstrate that fiber cells in lenses lacking        alphaA and alphaB fail to elongate symmetrically from the        bow region and therefore do not establish the typical        onion skin conformation in which cells extend from the        anterior epithelium to the posterior capsule Additionally        in lenses from  wk alphaABKO lenses there was a        persistence of cell nuclei in deeper cortical regions and        ectopic cell nuclei were present in large numbers in the        anterior central cortex At  wks of age cell nuclei were        present adjacent to the posterior capsule These        morphological observations are consistent with a defect in        the normal differentiation pathway of lens epithelial cells        into fiber cells        It is unlikely that these alterations in alphaABKO        mouse lenses result from increased susceptibility of these        lenses to lightinduced damage in the absence of the        molecular chaperone protection afforded by alphaA and        alphaB in normal lenses With the normal time of eye        opening at approximately  days after birth the  wk old        mice had their eyes open and lenses exposed to light for        only about  weeks prior to morphological analysis        Moreover these animals had been exposed to only animal        facility fluorescent lighting and were protected from UV        light by plastic cages If lack of protection from        lightinduced damage was the major factor affecting the        changes in these lenses then the bulk of the damage should        have resided along the visual axis particularly in the        central anterior epithelium and subcapsular cortex in the         wk lenses but this was not the case In these lenses        gross morphological changes were apparent in the equatorial        and posterior subcapsular regions These changes included        posterior subcapsular nucleic acid staining absence of        posterior sutures and small irregularly shaped cells not        arranged in any discernable pattern in the equatorialbow        region Systemic stress factors crossing the bloodaqueous        barrier might explain some morphological changes at the        equatorial region but this would not explain nucleic acid        staining in the posterior subcapsular region In the  wk        alphaABKO lenses nucleic acid staining in the posterior        subcapsular region is consistent with either anterior        epithelial cells migrating aberrantly to the posterior        pole or primary fiber cells failing to fully differentiate        by  wks of age These two possibilities could not be        differentiated in the methods employed and were beyond the        objectives of the current study Future studies are being        designed to address which of these two processes might        explain nucleic acid staining in the posterior subcapsular        region Staining in this region was not observed in older        alphaABKO lenses suggesting that this pattern was        transient The fate of the nucleic acidcontaining cells in        the posterior capsular region of younger lenses is not        known at this time nor is the morphology of earlier stage        lenses Future studies with defined objectives to address        the development and progression of morphological changes        seen in this study are being designed The morphological        differences in alphaABKO lenses compared to age matched        wild type lenses were consistent with the hypothesis that        alphacrystallin plays an active role in the        differentiation and growth of lens fiber cells In        addition it was clearly evident that alphacrystallin is        necessary for lens transparency        The final biological event in a lens epithelial cells        life is the transformation from an epithelial cell into a        fiber cell which occurs at the equatorialbow region of        the lens The newly forming fiber cell continues to        differentiate in the cortex until a mature fiber cell        devoid of organelles with suture formation at the ends of        the cell is formed This entire process from epithelial        cell to mature fiber cell is defined as lens        differentiation The precise spatial and temporal        expression of the crystallin proteins in the developing        lens may not be simply a consequence of the differentiation        process but instead may play an important if not        essential role in the differentiation process itself The        results of the current study support this hypothesis        The exact         in vivo molecular mechanisms by        which alphacrystallin might influence lens epithelial cell        differentiation and maintenance of lens transparency        remain to be determined AlphaA and alphaB are members of        the shsp family     Previous studies have shown that        the alphacrystallin possesses molecular chaperone        activity binding to partially denatured proteins both         in vitro    and probably         in vivo     to inhibit further        denaturation Although this property may be a major        contributor to the maintenance of lens clarity the early        changes in the alphaABKO lenses indicate a much broader        cellular function for alphacrystallin Stress proteins        have been shown to be expressed in nonstressed cells        during development and differentiation     Hsps were        shown to be expressed during the differentiation of        mammalian osteoblasts and promelocytic leukemia cells            In addition hsp expression has been shown to accompany        growth arrest in human B lymphocytes    and macrophage        differentiation of HL  cells     During myogenic        differentiation mRNA for alphaB increases in conjunction        with the induction of mRNA for myogenin the earliest known        event in myogenesis     The addition of exogenous        alphacrystallin to primary bovine lens epithelium was        shown to induce rapid changes in cell shape leading to the        formation of lentoid bodies     These studies strongly        suggest that the hsp family of proteins has other functions        in addition to protecting proteins and cells during        stress        Alphacrystallin may play a functional role in the cell        nucleus and may have a role in regulating the cell cycle        Several heat shock proteins have been found in cell nuclei        in the absence of stress     and alphacrystallin has        been shown to interact directly with DNA     AlphaB        expressed in transfected CHO cells has been shown to        ectopically localize to interphase nuclei suggesting a        regulatory role for this protein in the nucleus     A        subset of immortalized lens epithelial cells from alphaBKO        mice have been shown to hyperproliferate    suggesting        that alphaB may be important in maintaining genomic        stability In lens epithelium derived from alphaAKO lenses        cell growth rates were reported to be  lower compared to        wild type     suggesting a role for alphaA in        regulating the cell cycle All of these findings raise many        questions as to the possible roles of alphacrystallin in        the nucleus and in cell cycle regulation during        differentiation In the current study the observation of a        disorganized pattern of nuclei localized to the equatorial        bow region of alphaABKO lenses and nucleic acid staining        of structures throughout the anterior cortex of  wk        alphaABKO lenses is consistent with a role for        alphacrystallin in the nucleus        There is extensive evidence from previous studies        demonstrating that alphacrystallin plays a role in the        cytoskeletal organization Both alphaA and alphaB can bind        specifically to actin both         in vitro    and         in vivo     Actin filament        formation has been shown to be necessary for the        differentiation of lens epithelial cells     however        the significance of alphacrystallin interaction with actin        in differentiation is not known In the lens        alphacrystallin also forms a complex with type III        intermediate filament proteins and the lensspecific beaded        filament proteins CP and CP which may be critical for        proper filament assembly     Beaded filament mRNA        levels increase greatly in differentiating lens epithelial        cells and have been suggested as a panspecific marker for        lens fiber cells     It is therefore possible that        increased synthesis of alphacrystallin in epithelial cells        early in the differentiation process may have profound        effects upon the cytoskeleton which in turn may profoundly        affect cell shape and migration The lack of cellar        organization and uniform cell shape at the equatorial        region observed in alphaABKO lenses supports this        hypothesis Studies are currently underway to characterize        cytoskeletal organization in the alphaABKO lens                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        DLB conceived and
