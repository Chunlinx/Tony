                                 The Absurdity of Family Love            Dont get me wrong Kids aregreat I have some and I adore them Every Christmas I become a slave to mycamcorder Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow and so on But now that theradiance of the yuletide season is fading its time to confront a soberingscientific truth The more you think about the biology of parental love themore absurd it seems The same goes for love of kin generallybrotherssisters nephews etc            Readersfamiliar with my obsessions may fear that this column is just another attemptto spoil everyones fun to replace the beautiful mystery of life with uglyDarwinian clarity Actually what I hope to dispel isnt preDarwinian mysterybut a kind of postDarwinian mysticism a confused exaltation of geneticaffinity You see the confusion when biological parents invoke blood ties toreclaim a child from adoptive parents You see it when opponents ofcrossethnic adoption argueas in a New York Times oped piece a fewmonths agothat we must respect the strength of the biological and culturalties that Indian tribes can offer their own children In a sense you see itevery year around Christmas when people pay lip service to the idea ofuniversal brotherhood but believe in their hearts that its ridiculous thattruly loving people to whom you arent related violates some law of nature            Thanks to the biologist William Hamilton it is now clearwhy people feel brotherly love in the literal senseand sisterly lovematernal love and paternal love Its all due to the operation of kinselection during evolution A greatly oversimplified textbook example Twomillion years ago two hominids Loveless Bob and Loving Bob stand on twodifferent riverbanks in identical situations Each is watching his fullsibling Bill drown Loving Bob has a gene inclining him to love his brother andthus jump in the raging river even though his risk of dying is  percentLoveless Bob has no such gene and thus stands on the bank wondering whetherhis brothers corpse will attract any large edible fish Which Bobs geneswill survive the Darwinian reapergenes for love or for cold indifference            Love triumphs True theresa onein chance that the love gene will sink along with Loving Bob Butconsider the upside Theres a oneintwo chance that Bobs full sibling Billhas the same gene and thus that a successful rescue mission will pluck anotherwise doomed copy of the gene from the dustbin of history Do the math andyoull see that over time Loving Bobs send more genes to posterity thanLoveless Bobs As love genes spread at the expense of indifference genesLoveless Bobs slowly become extinct Die selfish scum Genes for sibling lovecome to permeate our speciesas in fact they now do So do genes formaternal love and paternal love All brought to you by kin selection            As modernDarwinism gets popularized the basic idea of kin selection is approaching thestatus of conventional wisdom So are some attendant misconceptions            Misconception No  Genes are smart People often assume that kinselected altruism is foolproof that a gene canmagically sense copies of itself in other organismsor at least can somehowascertain with perfect accuracy which organisms are close relatives of its ownhost organism and thus may carry copies of itself In truth genes arentomniscient or even sentient If kinselected genes are going to induce love ofkin theyll have to determine who qualifies as kin in some pedestrian andprobably fallible way            Forexample Back when Loving Bob was  years old if his mother was nursing someinfant named Bill and sleeping by its side every night theres a very goodchance that Bill was Bobs sibling So a gene disposing Bob to love childrenwhom he sees his mother nurturing could spread through the population untileveryone obeys the same rule But this rule would misfire now and then when amother is for some reason nurturing a nonoffspring Its just that themisfiring wouldnt happen often enough to greatly dilute the genetic mathfavoring the genes proliferation            Little is known about which rules for identifyingkinkinrecognition mechanismsdo operate in our species But clearly theyare fallible Even mothers who youd think would have a damn good idea of whotheir offspring are can in principle be fooled When hospital staffers forsome reason handed hoursold Kimberly Mays to a mother who was not hers themothers kinrecognition mechanismsa k a bonding processeskicked in Thiswoman wound up loving Kimberly like a daughter though the mother died twoyears later so that Kimberly was reared mostly by a stepmother MeanwhileKimberlys genetic mother having missed years of bonding can never loveKimberly quite like her own child even though Kimberly is her ownchild Because genetic relationship per se doesnt matter            Thisirrelevance of genes is why surrogate motherhood is so messy Even when thanksto in vitro fertilization the birth mother is unrelated to the fetus shecarries she will upon giving birth fall in love with the child Duringevolution after all having a baby come out of your womb was reasonably strongevidence of kinship The power of the hormones that govern this bonding isfamiliar to anyone who has watched a woman clutch her justborn child and turninto a lovedrunk cuddlebunny When my wife went through this magic moment Ibriefly considered snatching the baby and replacing it with an by glossyof myself This hormonal power was also observed by researchers studyingoxytocin a hormone thats present in human and other mammalian mothers atbirth The researchers put it in a syringe and used it to shatter all previousrecords for cuddling among laboratory rats By the way the synthetic versionof oxytocin Pitocin is what doctors use to induce labor            Misconception No  People are smartorat least they are smart Darwinian robots  Darwinian theory does posit thathomo sapiens were designed to get their genes into the next generation butnot that they were designed to do so consciously and rationally As surrogatemothers have proved knowing that youve given no genes to an infant needntstop the bonding process Thus kin recognition mechanism is a doublymisleading termfirst because as weve seen the mechanism doesnt positivelyidentify kin but just identifies factors correlated with kinship and secondbecause people arent really aware of doing the identifying We dontthink Theres strong evidence that shes my daughter so I adore her Morelike God but my daughters adorable            It isgood news for adoptive parents that neither genetic relationship nor consciousawareness of genetic relationship is a prerequisite for love Still it is badnews that maternal bonding begins with hormones at birth It is also bad newsthat breastfeeding which adoptive mothers usually cant do releases thebonding hormone oxytocin Then again there is no reason in principle thatadoptive parents couldnt take Pitocin once a day for synthetic bondingsessions Oxytocin seems to be part of the bonding formula in men tooBesides some genetic mothers arent conscious at birth and many dontbreastfeed yet they all nonetheless wind up loving their kids As the manysuccessful adoptive parents know lots of the magic moments that add up todurabonding have nothing to do with birthing or breastfeeding Tiny totswith their eyes all aglow              Anyway the main point is that when genetic parents give upa child for adoption and have second thoughts weeks months or even yearslater their appeals to blood ties should count for zilch Their love of theirchild and their childs love of them depends not on genetic math but on along and complex chain of bonding much of which they have already voluntarilymissed out on            Similarlythe idea that Native American babies or black babies or whatever have somemystical genetic affinity with their own kind is silly Obviouslycrossethnic adoption is dicey It draws sidelong glances and playgroundtaunts and it may give the adopted child an identity crisis But it wont dothis because of some ancestral memory in the genes As attitudes changecrossethnic adoption will get easier and as crossethnic adoption gets morecommon attitudes will change There are other popgenetics arguments againstcrossethnic adoption and against adoption in general One is that genesinfluence personality so powerfully that mixing unrelated siblings is likemixing oil and water This idea is             Misconception No  Our genes thoughperhaps not real smart arent downright stupid  Here we come at last tothe true absurdity of familial love As weve seen the genes that sponsor itflourished by encouraging an altruism that was in fact selfserving at thegenetic level the inexorable triumph of Loving Bobs genes As weve alsoseen these genes can be fooled into encouraging altruism toward nonkinaltruism that presumably is not selfserving at the genetic levelStill you might argue in defense of your genes they usually directfamilial love toward genuine kin and thus usually succeed in being efficientlyselfish Wrong When genes confine altruism to kin and deny it to needynonkin they are in fact failing spectacularly to be efficiently selfishBecause nowadays copies of these genes do reside in nonkinin yournextdoor neighbor and for that matter your worst enemy After all theDarwinian logic behind love of kin was so relentless that these genes permeatedour entire species Loveless Bob is extinct remember            You canbe forgiven for doubting my logic People like me in writing about kinselection often talk about full siblings sharing half their genes implyingthat nonrelatives share none But in truth you share virtually all your geneswith any randomly selected homo sapien on any continent What people like mereally mean is that full siblings share half of any genes that are newlymintedgenes that have recently arisen and on which natural selection is juststarting to pass judgment Genes that natural selection fully endorsed longagothe basic genes for hunger for lust for familial loveare in everyoneSo genes that originally flourished by bestowing love with discerningselfishnessby discriminating against people not containing copies ofthemselvesnow having spread through the species discriminate against peoplewho do contain copies You may doubt that natural selection a processthat supposedly maximizes genetic selfishness could fail so abjectly to do soBut its true             So this past holiday season as you rushed to buy presentsfor your kids or your siblings or your nieces or nephews impelled byselfishly altruistic genes you were operating under flawed Darwinian logicThese selfish genes could do just as much for themselves by encouraging youto instead spend your money on the beggar outside the department store Infact they could do more since the beggar is closer to perishing than yourrelatives are Also the beggar might buy something useful such as food asopposed to a haireating Cabbage Patch doll But our genes are too stupid toso deftly serve their own welfare            Not that I attach much weightto what is and isnt good from the standpoint of genetic selfinterest Asvirtually all ethical philosophers who have pondered the matter agree itdoesnt make sense to model our moral values on the logic of nature anyway toinfer ought from is to commit the naturalistic fallacyonlyleads to moral confusion For example you might after observing the naturalbehavior of praying mantises be tempted to conclude that it is morally goodfor females to eat males after sexand this I submit would be a repugnantand wrongheaded doctrine Though slightly less repugnant than the idea ofeating males before the sex            Most people implicitlyrecognize the naturalistic fallacy in some contexts They sense that theressomething visceral about say malice yet theyll tell you when not in itsthrall that they disapprove of it Its obvious they believe that thenatural strength of hatred is not a good thing Theyre right What is equallyright but a bit less obvious is that the natural limits of love arentnecessarily good either And on close inspection these limits turn out not tobe all that rigorously natural anyway
