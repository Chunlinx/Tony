                                 The CPI and the Rat Race            Lets talk about inflationindexing and the meaning of life            Early this month a panel ofeconomists led by Stanfords Michael Boskin made semiofficial what mostexperts have been saying for some time The Consumer Price Index overstatesinflation Nobody really knows by how much but Boskin and company made aguesstimate of  percent annually Compounded over decades this is a hugeerror            Thisconclusion is controversial Some people are upset because any reduction ofinflation estimates will reduce Social Security benefits which are indexed tothe CPI Others are upset because a revision of recent price history would meanabandoning a worldview on which they have staked their reputations Quite a fewpeople have committed themselves to the story line that productivity is up butreal wages are down If inflation has been lower than was previously assumedthat means the real value of wages may have gone up after all And someeconomists with no particular ax to grind simply have doubts about themethodology            Boskin may be right or wrong but one argument by hiscritics is clearly wrong They say Suppose its true that inflation has beenless than the official increase in the CPI over the past few decades If youassume a lower inflation rate and recalculate real incomes back tosayyou reach what seems to be a crazy conclusion that in the early sthe era of postwar affluence most Americans were living below what we nowregard as the poverty line Some critics of the Boskin report regard this as adecisive blow to its credibility            The ideathat most Americans were poor in  is indeed absurd but not because ofBoskins numbers After all even if you use an unadjusted CPI the standard ofliving of the median family  th percentile in  Americaappears startlingly low by current standards In that year medianfamilyincome in  dollars was only about  Thats about the  thpercentile today Families at the  th percentilethat is poorerthan  percent of the populationmay not be legally poor only about percent of families are officially below the poverty line but they are likelyto regard themselves as very disadvantaged and unsuccessful So even using theold numbers most families in  had a material standard of living no betterthan that of todays poor or nearpoor            We can confirm this with more direct measuresof the way people lived In  some  percent of dwellings lacked fullindoor plumbing Many families still did not have telephones or cars And ofcourse very few people had televisions A modern American family at the th percentile that is right at the poverty line surely has aflushing toilet a working shower and a telephone with directdiallongdistance service probably has a color television and may well even havea car Take into account improvements in the quality of many other productsand it does not seem at all absurd to say that the material standard of livingof that povertylevel family in  is as good as or better than that of themedian family in             What dowe mean by this We mean that if you could choose between the two materialstandards of living other things being the same  you might well preferthe  th percentile standard of  to the  thpercentile standard of  But does that mean that most people were poor in Nobecause man does not live by bread cars televisions or evenplumbing alone            Imagine that a mad scientist went back to  and offeredto transport the median family to the wondrous world of the s and to placethem at say the  th percentile level The  thpercentile of  is a clear material improvement over the median of Would they accept his offer Almost surely notbecause in  they weremiddle class while in  they would be poor even if they lived better inmaterial terms People dont just care about their absolute materiallevelthey care about their level compared with others            I knowquite a few academics who have nice houses two cars and enviable workingconditions yet are disappointed and bitter menbecause they have neverreceived an offer from Harvard and will probably not get a Nobel Prize Theylive very well in material terms but they judge themselves relative to theirreference group and so they feel deprived And on the other hand it is anopen secret that the chief payoff from being really rich is as Tom Wolfe onceput it the pleasure of seeing em jump Privilege is not merely a means toother ends it is an end in itself            My fellow Slate columnist Robert Wright wouldundoubtedly emphasize that our concern over status exists for good evolutionaryreasons In the ancestral environment a man would be likely to have moreoffspring if he got his pick of the most fertileseeming women That in turnwould depend on his status not his absolute standard of living So males witha predisposition to statusseeking left more offspring than those without andthe end result is Bill GggI mean Ronald Perelman            Is my license as apracticing economist about to be revoked Arent we supposed to believe inEconomic Man And doesnt admitting that people care about fuzzy things likestatus undermine the whole economic method Not really Homo economicusis not a central pillar of my faithhe is merely a working assumption albeitone that is extremely useful in many circumstances            Butadmitting that peoples happiness depends on their relative economic level aswell as their absolute economic resources has some subversive implications Forexample Many conservatives have seized on the Boskin report as a club withwhich to beat all those liberals who have been whining about declining incomesand increasing poverty in America It was all they insist a statistical hoaxBut you could very well make the opposite argument America in the s was amiddleclass society in a way that America in the s is not That is it hada much flatter income distribution so that people had much more sense ofsharing a common national lifestyle And people in that relatively equalAmerica felt good about their lives even though by modern standards they werepoorpoorer if Boskin is correct than we previously thought Doesnt thismean then that having a more or less equal distribution of income makes for ahappier society even if it does not raise anyones material standard ofliving  That is you can use the fact that people did not feel poor in thes as an argument for a more radical egalitarianism than even most leftistswould be willing to espouse            You could even argue that American society in the s isan engine that maximizes consumption yet minimizes satisfaction In a societywith a very flat distribution of income and status nobody feels left out In asociety with rigid ranks people do not expect to rise above their station andtherefore do not feel that they have failed if they do not rise Aristocratsare not part of the peasants reference group Modern America however is ahugely unequal society in which anyone can achieve awesome success but notmany actually do The result is that manyperhaps even mostpeople feel thatthey have failed to make the cut no matter how comfortable their lives In aland where anyone can become president anyone who doesnt becomepresident is a failure My European friends always marvel at how hardAmericans work even those who already have plenty of money Why dont we takemore time to enjoy what we have The answer of course is that we work so hardbecause we are determined to get aheadan effort that for Americans as asociety is doomed to failure because competition for status is a zerosumgame We cant all get ahead No matter how fast we all run someone must bebehind            If one follows this line ofthought one might well be led to some extremely radical ideas about economicpolicy ideas that are completely at odds with all current orthodoxiesBut I wont try to come to grips with such ideas in this column Frankly Idont have the time I have to get back to my researchotherwise somebodyelse might get that Nobel
