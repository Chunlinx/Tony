        what type of lawn and garden work do you do     well i do it all  uh yes i i try to grow uh uh a vegetable garden and   i see do you have a garden we do the same thing its i just have a small plot its like ten feet by five feet   yeah i have two plots ones ten by ten and ones like fifteen by four its a long skinny one and   i see yeah you do a lot more area than i do ive all the rest of my yard backyard is uh you know pool and decking its all the dirt i have left in my backyard   oh i see yeah i see   well i enjoy i enjoy fiddling around its cheap entertainment   right right yeah its nice to get out in the open air and especially when the weathers not too hot or not raining or whatever but uh   it is uhhuh thats right yeah i enjoy excuse me go ahead   sometimes i i said i sometimes i wish i had more space you know i grow a lot of things a lot of food and   uhhuh uhhuh   sometimes i i want to plant something theres not enough room to plant it some of those things like uh you know the things that vine like uh cucumbers or uh   thats right thats right uhhuh   squash or something like that  plant one of those and it takes up your whole space   uhhuh takes a lot of room it sure does i made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe my goodness what a mistake that was   oh yeah that yeah they they just run all over the place dont they   they do well it was very good it just takes up you know like you say a lot of your garden area   right right see i   its the first and only time ive done that we dont do anything exotic we just do oh tomatoes bell peppers radishes and turnips i mean not turnips carrots beets and things like that   the basics uh right uhhuh yeah thats what we do too   my wife used to plant a few snow peas i dont really care for snow peas well she just plants a few for herself   right peas i i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago the first one they started them indoors this time i read it and so i   yeah did you really oh i see okay we dont start anything indoors we just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground   yeah i uh i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that   probably so yeah you can get a head start on it   but uh sure is a heck of a lot of work because you got to watch them every day and keep them watered and i i dont think ill do it again   i guess it it might would yeah umhum yeah well it will make it will make them taste better im sure   oh yeah yeah i enjoy it i come home from work and and i usually say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and   sure you got to inspect it yeah   inspect it and the kids want to swing and i push them on swing   sure sure   and i walk i mow my own lawn and i do i dont have a sprinkler system i i dont enjoy watering especially   yeah no i this is the first home weve lived in weve had a sprinkler system and boy it is really nice it sure beats dragging hoses around   oh how oh yeah you can have it come on just early in the morning and and off by the you know by the time youre up and about yeah i i usually get it started for my wife and i and she moves it around ever other day   thats right uhhum thats right its really nice uhhuh yeah ill have to admit i dont i do my own yard i i really dont enjoy doing that i enjoy having a nice looking yard i just dont enjoy the work that it takes to get it done   uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah   i had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months you know until i retired now i ive lost my excuse for that so i have to  for the last couple of years ive done it myself   uhhuh   yeah sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of the loop but um   uhhuh yeah uhhuh uhhuh   but uh they want too much money yeah   it is kind of expensive it is of course the chemicals themselves when you buy them theyre expensive too   right right but its still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself   thats right If i have a problem discipline you know i think now boy i really need to get out you know and apply something you know and i screw around and dont do it or wait too long or something thats right   right and the weed come up and all of a sudden youve got to do something else yeah   thats right im im kind of bad about that i enjoyed having a lawn service but now i have the time and i really cant i really dont you know dont want to spend the money for it yeah thats true uhhuh   yeah well if you enjoy it too you know you you can get out in the morning when before it gets hot and do it   thats right   and stuff when you only have to   im not limited to just mowing it on Saturday morning you know i can do it on most any day of the week   right when the days start getting a little longer you know you can i can start doing it in the evening after work   uhhuh uhhuh thats right   when they when they switch to switch when we get an hour more when they rollback an hour   yeah yeah thats coming up here pretty soon is it this weekend   i dont know i really dont know it just seems like i here it on the news the day before and uh i i think its coming up here soon   its pretty soon yeah yeah uhhuh i believe it is too   yeah yeah are you having any trouble with bugs in in your garden   we uh not a whole lot uh i i dont use i i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust you know i dont really like to put a lot chemicals on it but then again i dont want the bugs eating it upping either   uhhuh right right i i it seems like they come in spurts one year i didnt put anything on and i didnt have any problems   uhhuh uhhuh   next year i was planting some broccoli and and some of those they are called cabbage loppers or whatever they were just covered with them i mean i went up i didnt go out there for about three days you know because i   uhhuh right uhhuh yeah uhhuh   and went up there one day and the plant was nothing but a stem they devoured it that quickly   thats right absolutely they really go through it they really do   and they they have a you a good appetite  and they would you know i i picked off like twenty of them and i go   yeah you know cut worms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too boy theyll strip   yeah so i got that uh what is that safer soap uh B T spray this year and ive been watching them every day and ive and i havent seen any signs yet so if i see any signs im going to spray them and uh   uhhuh yes uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah i did something a little bit different this year that i havent done before ive got my garden is shaped that i can its kind like this uh box shape so i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box and put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure and you know various other things raised it up   right well the good stuff right   and im hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i wont have oh ill have less of a bug problem anyway at least they theyll have a hard time crawling up the thing   right yeah my backyard is uh is sloping so i built a box up you know had to build the one the low side up and uh i had sandy loam hauled in i had a dump truck come and dump it   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   on my driveway i guess thats what they do and then i had to wheel barrow it in but uh you know you can improve your own soil there but the Texas soil isnt the greatest gardening soil   yeah right uhhuh thats right yeah you you have to work on you really do   right then you know and you know if i i didnt wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know   uhhuh thats right when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden so i had i had a lot of loam out there to start with i just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with it     uhhuh do you have do you have a rotor tiller small enough you have a just do it by hand yeah yeah   no i dont i did it by hand uhhuh it wasnt too much of a job really like i say its just   yeah id like to get one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines   uhhuh uhhuh It would be handy   and it weighs twenty pounds or something like that my neighbor across the street has one he always uses it to dethatch his lawn i see him out there and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it yeah yeah   uhhuh yeah uhhuh yeah it might be handy yeah theyre pretty neat little ive never seen one   i have a friend who has one and and he lets me you know no problem borrowing if its just a hassle when you know to go up and its a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van and bring it home and   uhhuh oh yeah yeah uhhuh right   check it back and just grab it you know if i just go to my garage and grab it   uhhuh yeah that would be neat sure would weve had a garden gosh for years and years and years of some size you know i cant remember a year when we didnt have one of some kind   that would be nice uhhuh what have you got growing right now   uh got you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom and uh ive got carrots i mean yes ive got a few carrots up and ive got some radishes up and as a matter of fact ive already done a second row of radishes and uh the green onions are coming along   uhhuh hm uhhuh yeah okay what kind what kind of onions do you grow do you grow those those ten fifteen Y   snow excuse me yes ive for the first time we planted them this year yeah we tried to find them last year we screwed around and waited too long and i couldnt find a nursery that had any of them left but weve got some this year   oh they they are the best uhhuh uhhuh uh those   snow peas are up and uh my wife does uh a small herb garden on the side and uh theyre up and doing fine   i see yeah i uh those onions i think we we planted like twice as much this year because you know we got onions onions and they lasted from you know about when you harvest them about a month from now or so or six weeks from now until until like October and uh   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just cant compare   yeah yeah thats kind of a let down   she made these onion rings that were so good and and and uh you dont realize how many dishes you put onions in that its an ingredient and and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better   oh i bet they were thats right we use a lot  we sure do yeah one nice thing with onions and and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have you know too many   right right we froze a lot of peppers we let some turn red   yeah uhhuh we did that too   and some we do green and then my wife puts them on pizzas and and chops them up in recipes and things like that   uhhuh sure makes uh makes a colorful salad too   oh yeah put them in salad yeah youre youre making me hungry here   uhhuh we planted some uh yellow peppers this year weve tried it before and nope we havent had much luck with it were going to try it again this year   oh yellow peppers huh   they have some little buds on them hopefully theyll do something   yeah sounds like you have a real good garden   yeah we enjoy fooling around with it   just let me see what i got i got the peas and ive got some broccoli uh onions some some radishes and uh uh beets   beets yeah weve got some beets uhhuh   uh and i planted potatoes too   ive never done potato we used to do it at home when i was a kid we had a huge garden   oh the potato they were theyre delicious but they you dont get seem to get that much for the space they they do   uhhuh it takes a yeah it does take some space   some beet uh potatoes and ive got some tomatoes still growing in in containers i got to wait for a place to to to free up   yeah uhhuh i see uhhuh   uh our our kids love pickles and we all love pickles so were going to try to grow our own pickles this year weve got some good um um Hybrid Burpee uh uh pickler cucumbers and were going to try to see if we can pickle our own and   uhhuh that will be neat yeah uhhuh uhhuh that will be neat yeah   so because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store i know it i said why are they so expensive theyre just a bunch of little cucumbers you know   absolutely theyre expensive i dont know unless it labor intensive or something i really dont know   i guess but were going to try that and see how that works an experiment id like to try you know just try something new every year that i havent tried before and   that will be interesting yeah sure yeah thats interesting   well   well ill let you go its
