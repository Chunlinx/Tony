                                 Allergies            Doctors predict that thanksto El Nio the next two years will be the most allergyridden in history afitting end to what doctors call the worst century for allergies ever Thepercentage of the population suffering from allergies has more than doubledover the last  years according to one study Meanwhile as part of adizzying parade of allergy remedies the Food and Drug Administration hasrecently approved the overthecounter sale of cromolyn sodium a nasal spraytrumpeted as the most effective nonprescription allergy combatant                           Whatare allergies Who gets them Is there any way to conquer them Are theyreally more prevalent than they used to be Why hasnt natural selectionconsigned this miserable condition to the dustbin of evolutionary history            Allergies share the same etiology The immune               system                overreacts to the presence of harmless proteins normallynot found in the body During the first few encounters with a foreign proteinor allergen the immune system catalogs its characteristics and tailors anantibody called immunoglobulin to purge it Thereafter when the allergen entersthe body the immunoglobulins send signals to trigger the release of a set ofnasty chemicals most notably histamines that destroy it Side effects ofhistamines include the tightening of airways constriction of nasal passagesrelease of mucus and redness of eyes Nobody knows how much of an allergen ittakes to set off this process            Sometypological                distinctions  Allergies are technically differentfrom adverse reactions to poison ivy chemicals and lactose none of whichinvolves the immune system Allergies are also distinguishable from coldsduring which the immune system combats viruses that can actually do harm            The most prevalent allergy is hay               fever  The Centers for Disease Controls estimate Twentysix millionAmericans suffer from the condition Here the immune system reacts to proteinscontained in pollen tiny airborne particles released as part of thereproductive cycle of trees weeds and grasses Hay fever comes down fromearly  th century British farmers who misplaced blame for theirragweed allergies on the hay reaped during the fall harvest Other commonallergies include reactions to the proteins found in food  theexcrement                of                mites  and the saliva                of               some warmblooded mammals cats dogs horses Click for a sidebar onthe myth of the nonallergenic dog Reactions to food afflict relatively fewand except for shellfish and peanut allergies are most common among smallchildren            Theconsequences of allergies are usually no greater than sneezing a stuffy noseand itchy eyes But if you suffer from asthma allergies can cause an attackAnd in rare cases allergic attacks can turn into anaphylaxis  wheretoxic levels of histamines and other chemicals are released causingasphyxiation vomiting and death More common are infections triggered bystuffy noses The scenario Allergies inflame and clog a nose precluding itfrom draining mucus and fluids from sinuses and ears The fluids become abreeding ground for bacteria An estimated  percent of ear infections stemfrom allergies            Allergies are genetically                linked  Researchershave correlated them with a single mutant gene inherited from the mother Butstatistics also point to the importance of other genes that come via thefather Eighty percent of the children of two allergysuffering parents arealso allergic With one afflicted parent there is a  percent chance ofinheritance and when neither parent is an allergy sufferer theres still a percent chance            Allergiesare spread evenly across ethnicity and gender Individuals however tend toexperience their effects in roughly  year cycles  The worst periodusually occurs from birth through adolescence and then recurs in the midsfor another decade But allergies can start at any time And nobody has a clueas to why they wax and wane            Pollen has its own patterns In the early partof the year March to May trees emit pollen from June to August grass is themain source from September to November weeds are Theres no escapingpollen Allergists say some cities Los Angeles and Denver are better thanothers Atlanta and Washington DC But all are bad for at least a chunk ofthe year Even cities such as Las Vegas and Tucson once famed for their puredesert air are now corrupted by trees and grass imported as part of socalledcivic improvement projects The lowest counts occur in coastal areas andmountains where wind tends to blow pollen away although pollen has beendetected as far as  miles out to sea and two miles up Other useful pollentips During the summer pollen counts tend to be lower before  am afterdark and following rain            Every allergy season seemsto be touted by the media as being the worst one on the books Click for asampling of alarmist headlines from the Los Angeles Times  And there ismuch dispute over whether El                Nio will cause as much trouble assome allergists predict The claim is that El Nio rains and mild temperatureswill cause plants to be more fecund and produce more pollen Also lack ofwinter freezes means that mites normally killed off by the cold willsurvive            Allergytreatment is a burgeoning sector of the economy Annually  billion isspent on medication and doctor visits  There is plenty of room forgrowthonly an estimated  percent of hay fever sufferers seek medicaltreatment New drugs debut almost every year Recently there has been a rushto fill the vacuum left by the antihistamine Seldane which was yanked from themarket after eight people died when Seldane reacted adversely with otherdrugs None of the three major prescription antihistamines Allegra ClaritinZyrtec seems to be consistently more effective than the others All relievesymptoms in a vast majority of patients Unlike the pills immunotherapy shotsattack the underlying problem not just the symptoms Each week patients areinjected with a small dose of allergens to build their immunity Studies showthe shots cure  percent of patients after several years of treatment Butthey are a huge hassle and costlynearly  a year            Why hasnt natural                selection corrected theimmune systems misguided response Why do allergies afflict an increasingnumber of victims if they serve no useful purpose A few theories                           TheVictorious Immune System Evolutionary biologists speculate that ahypersensitive immune system was needed back when parasites were ubiquitous anddeadly Hay fever was the small cost of survival And since allergies rarelyshorten life spans or discourage mates it is unlikely natural selection willever weed them out                           Theoryof the Leisure System Modern medicine and hygiene have licked most of themajor problems that used to preoccupy our immune system Now with nothing toregularly contend with this theory argues the system is set off by the mostharmless foreign particle                           WesternStyle Living Here blame goes to the advent of poorlyventilated densely populated living spacesallergy trapsand the increasedpopularity of domestic pets In addition there is the onset of pollutionwhich carries mites                           Hypochondria Morepeople are allergic today because more people are diagnosed as allergic ratherthan as suffering from colds The cynical spin is that pharmaceutical companieshave duped the public into believing that they have allergies and need drugs tofix them
