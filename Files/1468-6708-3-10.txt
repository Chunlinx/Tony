                            The Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to        Prevent Heart Attack Trial ALLHAT is a randomized        twocomponent clinical trial sponsored by the National        Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI A doubleblind        activecontrolled hypertension component is designed to        compare the rate of fatal coronary heart disease CHD or        nonfatal myocardial infarction MI the primary endpoint        in highrisk hypertensive participants aged  years or        older between those randomized to treatment initiated with        a diuretic chlorthalidone and treatment initiated with        each of three alternative antihypertensive drugs a        calciumchannel blocker amlodipine an        angiotensinconverting enzyme ACEinhibitor lisinopril        or an alphaadrenergic blocker doxazosin An openlabel        lipidlowering component is designed to determine if        lowering LDL cholesterol with pravastatin compared to        usual care reduces allcause mortality in a subset of        moderately hypercholesterolemic patients Randomization to        the hypertension component began in February  and        continued through January  with  participants        recruited at  clinical centers in the United States        Canada Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands        Randomization of  participants into the lipid trial        ended May   Followup on all participants continued        through March             Following independent reviews by the Data and Safety        Monitoring Board DSMB on January   and by an Ad        Hoc Committee on January   the Director of the        National Heart Lung and Blood Institute accepted a        recommendation to discontinue the doxazosin treatment arm        of the antihypertensive trial This recommendation was        based on the low probability of doxazosin showing benefit        over chlorthalidone for the primary endpoint as well as        the significantly increased occurrence of the secondary        endpoint combined cardiovascular disease CVD        encompassing CHD deaths nonfatal MI stroke coronary        revascularization procedures coronary artery

hospitalized and treated but nonhospitalized        RR   CI          P   When only fatal and        hospitalized HF were analyzed the large difference        remained RR   CI          P   The findings and        operational aspects of stopping the doxazosin arm of the        study have been previously described              The observed increase in HF in the doxazosin group as        compared to the chlorthalidone group led to several        additional analyses aimed toward validation of the        diagnoses with a focus on hospitalized and fatal HF The        purposes of these analyses were  to evaluate the reality        of HF cases ie whether diagnosis management and        clinical course were what might be expected and  to        compare these features between the two treatment        groups                    Methods                  Study Design          The rationale and design of ALLHAT are described in          detail elsewhere     Briefly those eligible for          randomization had systolic blood pressure SBP of at          least  mm Hg andor diastolic blood pressure of at          least  mm Hg or took medication for hypertension and          had at least one other risk factor for CHD events Risk          factors included previous MI or stroke left ventricular          hypertrophy by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram          history of type  diabetes current cigarette smoking          and low highdensity lipoprotein HDL level          The primary endpoint of the blood pressure BP trial          is the composite of nonfatal MI and fatal CHD The four          protocoldefined secondary clinical outcomes are          allcause mortality combined CHD including CHD death          nonfatal MI coronary revascularization procedures and          hospitalized angina stroke and combined CVD including          CHD death nonfatal MI stroke coronary          revascularization procedures angina treated in the          hospital or as an outpatient lower extremity peripheral          arterial disease treated in the hospital or with          outpatient revascularization and HF fatal or treated in          the hospital or as an outpatient          The validation of HF diagnosis entailed answering          several questions           Did HF cases meet ALLHAT diagnostic criteria           Were baseline characteristics and medical          management for HF cases as expected and similar across          the drug groups           Were prevalence and severity of systolic          dysfunction as expected and similar across drug          groups           Were casefatality rates as expected and similar          across drug groups          Unless otherwise specified all data for these          analyses were collected as of December                           Heart Failure Diagnosis          At each followup clinic visit the occurrence of study          clinical events was assessed and if identified by the          clinical investigator reported on an endpoint form For          each event involving hospitalization a hospital          discharge summary or expiration summary was to be          submitted and for each death a death certificate was          required Endpoint forms and supporting documentation          were reviewed at the ALLHAT Clinical Trials Center CTC          for accuracy and appropriateness When a discrepancy or          ambiguity was found the CTC sent a written query to the          Principal Investigator who retained the final word          concerning the diagnosis or cause of death A random           sample of strokes nonfatal MIs and CHD deaths was          selected for blinded quality control evaluation by the          ALLHAT Endpoints Subcommittee for these cases additional          documentation was requested          No such routine Endpoints Subcommittee quality control          was initially planned for reported HF However the          Subcommittee was subsequently called upon to evaluate a          random sample of reported fatal and hospitalized nonfatal          HF events As this occurred prior to the termination of          the doxazosin arm neither the chair nor the members of          the Subcommittee was informed of the major reason for          this review namely the trend toward a higher HF event          rate in the doxazosin group compared to the          chlorthalidone group The Subcommittee was told that the          review was undertaken at the request of the DSMB to          address the reliability and validity of reported HF          events This evaluation consisted of fifty events evenly          distributed across the four treatment groups reported as          fatal or hospitalized nonfatal HF and with          protocolrequired documentation discharge summary for          hospitalized events death certificates for deaths          Additional material was not requested since this would          have posed an undue burden on the clinical site staff and          would have risked raising questions about emerging          differences among treatment groups          The ALLHAT definition of HF used previously in the          Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program SHEP              includes patients with clearcut signs or symptoms of          left or right ventricular dysfunction that cannot be          attributed to other causes The diagnosis of HF must          include at least one of four stated symptoms paroxysmal          nocturnal dyspnea dyspnea at rest New York Heart          Classification functional class III for definition see          Additional Information Item  or orthopnea and one          of seven stated signs rales  or greater ankle edema          tachycardia of  beatsminute or more after five          minutes at rest cardiomegaly by chest xray chest xray          characteristic of HF S            gallop or jugular venous          distention Since lower extremity edema or exertional          dyspnea may be due to noncardiac causes the presence of          either of these alone without other indications of heart          failure is not sufficient for a diagnosis of HF Study

compared These analyses were          stratified by HF outcome  fatal and hospitalized HF           treated nonhospitalized HF and  no HF          PostHF event medical management may provide          additional evidence of the physicians confidence in the          HF diagnosis The postevent use of openlabel diuretics          ACEinhibitors and betablockers ie accepted          treatments for HF        was compared between          doxazosin and chlorthalidone groups as was the          proportion in each group of those who remained on          assigned blinded medication after the event For

    the randomization visit More doxazosin participants had          LVH by ECG  vs  of chlorthalidone          participants slightly more chlorthalidone than          doxazosin participants had LVH

among doxazosin          participants Over half of the deaths in each group           in the chlorthalidone group  in the          doxazosin group were due to cardiovascular events          Fifteen percent  of deaths in the chlorthalidone          group were attributed to cancer compared to   in          the doxazosin group Table           Casefatality for participants with hospitalized HF

previously hospitalized for          HF   subsequently died compared to            of those in the chlorthalidone group Table           As previously reported allcause mortality did not          significantly differ in the two treatment groups RR            CI            P                                  Discussion        The finding of significantly increased HF events in the        doxazosin group compared with the chlorthalidone group        created a dilemma for ALLHAT Since the trial was not        designed to focus on HF a component of a secondary        endpoint the validity of reported HF events became an        issue In this paper we have described several analyses to        address this concern        As previously reported losttofollowup and event        documentation were similar in the two treatment groups            Steps employed to validate the HF outcome in these        treatment groups confirmed the consistency of HF event        reporting Participants in the two drug groups had similar        baseline characteristics when stratified by HF status The        differences in eligibility risk factors between those        participants with HF and those without is not surprising        larger percentages of those with HF had a history of MI        stroke CABG angioplasty other atherosclerotic        cardiovascular disease ASCVD diabetes low HDL levels        and ECG abnormalities Nonetheless these eligibility        factors were not substantially different between        chlorthalidone and doxazosin participants with HF        Postdiagnosis pharmacologic management of patients is        one measure of the strength of physicians confidence in        the HF diagnoses Openlabel diuretics ACEinhibitors and        betablockers all recognized treatments for HF were        prescribed similarly for the chlorthalidone and doxazosin        groups suggesting similar assessment of these events in        the two treatment groups        ALLHAT criteria for HF were equivalently met in the two        groups While the sample n   of hospitalized or fatal        HF reports reviewed by the ALLHAT Endpoints Subcommittee        was limited in number and in adequacy of corroborating        documentation the review nonetheless showed adherence to        study criteria for the majority  of the event reports        The sometimesdiscrepant results between reviewers        pertained more often to incomplete data than to rejection        of a HF diagnosis        Clinical use of more objective measures including        noninvasive andor invasive tools for the measurement of        left ventricular function offers a means of establishing        and quantifying systolic failure in cases clinically        suggestive of HF      Among the ejection fractions        reported in the ALLHAT events that were reviewed the        majority fell at or below  indicating some degree of        systolic dysfunction However HF is a clinical diagnosis        that does not necessarily exclude those with intact left        ventricular systolic function     Hypertension is a        major risk factor for diastolic HF as many as  of        asymptomatic hypertensives with left ventricular        hypertrophy have diastolic dysfunction Additionally         of patients with coronary artery disease may have some        degree of diastolic dysfunction            The twofold increased relative risk of HF in the        doxazosin group compared to the chlorthalidone group        changed little when confined to hospitalized and fatal        events Further HF patients in both the doxazosin and        chlorthalidone treatment groups showed a rather high         casefatality rate over two years as expected in HF        patients       further supporting the validity of        the diagnoses in the two groups Among participants        hospitalized for HF who subsequently died over half of the        deaths in each drug group were attributed to cardiovascular        causes        Treatment group differences in mortality attributed to        HF may take time to be recognized Patients with HF are at        risk for other competing causes of death Accordingly it        may be too early to determine if a higher rate of HF in the        doxazosin group translates into a higher overall mortality        rate A  year casefatality rate with a  difference        in HF incidence rate translates into a  potential        difference in total mortality without any competing causes        of death With competing causes the difference would be        smaller and difficult to detect even in a trial of ALLHATs        size        The diagnosis of HF is generally made on the basis of        signs and symptoms that may overlap with those of other        cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies Moreover the        clinical picture may be further complicated for patients        taking doxazosin side effects of which edema dyspnea        and tachycardia    may be misinterpreted as        manifestations of HF        The capture of events in a large and simple trial such        as ALLHAT has potential limitations Built into a structure        composed largely of communitybased physicians is the        assumption that their characterization of clinical events        reflects diagnostic standards of the medical community        and as such meets study criteria However with its large        number of endpoints resources available to ALLHAT        precluded more than modest confirmatory event        documentation Resources were allocated for additional        documentation for quality control validation only for a        sample of the primary endpoint MIs and fatal CHD and for        strokes While all reported events are reviewed at the CTC        the sometimes incomplete supporting details in        documentation may not allow for validation of all events        according to ALLHAT criteria Some discharge summaries and        death certificates may lack sufficient descriptive        information needed to confirm the clinical diagnoses        Clinic staff are unable to provide corroborating        documentation for  of ALLHAT event reports        Efforts to authenticate the HF events in the doxazosin        and chlorthalidone treatment groups represented a desirable        step in the examination of the increased rate of HR in the        doxazosin group All methods employed provided confirmatory        evidence that both the HF diagnosis and the difference in        HF

prescription of openlabel medicines of the same class as        the blinded medications when a compelling indication        exists such that the total dose of the added openlabel        drug should not exceed  of the maximum dose as        recommended in the Sixth Report of the Joint National        Committee on Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High        Blood Pressure JNC VI If a
