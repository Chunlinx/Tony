                                 The Other Bear Market            Surely it cannot havesurprised anyone to learn that Russia is run by crooks The question has alwaysbeen What kind of crooks are they Are they serious kleptocrats in it for thelong haul or are they looters out to take the money and run The essence ofthe financial crisis that has rocked the world in the last few weeks is thisInvestors which means anyone with money at stake appear to have decided onceand for all that the men who run Russia are not only corrupt butshortsightedly sothat they are looters rather than kleptocrats            Ofcourse to get at this essence you have to dig a little On the surfaceRussias troubles seem like the sort of thing that happens even to respectablecountries Even basically wellgoverned nations are subject to currencycrisesremember George Soros became a household word with his  attack onthe British pound Nor are banking problems necessarily confined to places withunstable or corrupt governments the case of the Texas thrifts comes to mindand even squeaky clean Sweden had a banking debacle in the s So you mightthink that Russias woes are simply a soupedup version of the kind offinancial crises many countries have experienced Indeed if you read theofficial reports of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank thatsthe way they portray things            But these surface similarities deceive Britain wasvulnerable to speculators in  because there was a sound if notuniversally accepted economic case for devaluation The countrys overvaluedcurrency was contributing to its high unemployment rate Hong Kong isvulnerable to speculators right now for the same reason Russia today bycontrast is a largely demonetized economy in which many perhaps mosttransactions take place through barter As far as most of the economy isconcerned the value and even the existence of the ruble have become more orless irrelevant Nor are the Russian banks that have just crashed really banksin the Western sense of the word By and large they have few depositors Mainlythey are in the business of borrowing money from foreigners and using it tospeculate in Russian markets above all in the market for government debtEssentially instead of borrowing money directly from foreigners the Russiangovernment has relied on a layer of politically connected middlemen to act asconveyors of foreign funds            Thiswouldnt matter so much except that that government borrowing has spiraled outof control The reason is not excessive spendingon the contrary thegovernment has let many basic services lapse and has become erratic at bestabout paying its own employees notably and frighteningly the militaryInstead the problem is an inability to collect taxes            You might be tempted to attribute thisinability to raise taxes to administrative incompetence in a countryunaccustomed to dealing with free markets But with its industrial baseshriveled and the dollar value of gross domestic product stunningly low evenbefore the recent collapselast years dollar GDP was about the same as thatof MexicoRussias economy is now dominated by the producers of a handful ofexportable resources such as oil gas diamonds and gold These sorts oftraditional homogeneous commodities are the kinds of thing that even primitiveadministrative systems normally are able to tax What is more theinsiderdriven process of privatizationin which state assets were in effectdistributed to political supporters much as a medieval king might assigndukedoms to his lieutenantshas led to highly concentrated ownership of theseresources It has been suggested in fact that seven men control about half ofthe countrys marketable wealth In Russia property really is theftpure and simple So in a sense all the Russian government needs to pay itsbills is for those seven men plus a fringe of smallerscale oligarchs whowould surely follow their lead to pay the necessary taxes            But theoligarchs own more than gas fields and banks They also own politicians Andthey decline to pay            Asimplified account of the crisis would then run asfollows For several years now the Russian government covered its deficitsthrough indirect foreign borrowingthat is foreign lenders have providedmoney to banks which in turn have lent that money to the government Thewillingness of foreigners to provide this money was based on the belief thateventually the oligarchs would be willing to pay their due and if they did thecountrys huge natural resources would make it possible to honor itscommitments However in the last few months this confidence has evaporatedForeign lenders have been willing to provide money only at very high interestrates recently nearly triple world market ratesand fears that thegovernment would try to inflate away its debt or simply default on it led tointerest rates on that rubledenominated debt of as high as  percent Thispessimism about the governments solvency then became selffulfilling Giventhe need to pay such high rates on its debt the government needed to borroweven more further weakening confidence and pushing the rates still higher            Thedevaluation of the ruble was a desperate attempt to buy a bit more time Byreducing the dollar value of the governments debts while hoping to raise theruble value of its receipts it could narrow the financing gap But instead thedevaluation convinced everyone that the game was up and that the ruble wasabout to become more or less worthless and that was that            The most striking thing about this story is howselfdestructive the behavior of the oligarchs seems to have been It is verymuch in their collective interest to have the current regime survive so thatthey can continue to profit from their illgotten empires Why couldnt theyget together and agree to pay enough taxes to keep their rackets going            Oneanswer is that there is no honor among thievesthat the oligarchs are caughtin a classic prisoners dilemma in which it is in the collective interest ofthe group that everyone pay some taxes but in the individual interest of eacholigarch to freeride on the others Indeed far from being a cohesive groupthe oligarchs have engaged in bitter business and political struggles whichin Russia are the same thing It may be hard for them to cooperate even whenit is a matter of saving the regime that made them rich            Another answer which may interact with the first is thatthe oligarchs are not in this for the long run anywaythat at some level theyall expect the game to end fairly soon and they are simply trying to grab asmuch as they can Certainly there has been massive flight of capital into Swissbank accounts and other hidden overseas assets Many Russian firms maintainsubsidiaries in Cyprus the Nassau of Europe They are presumably not there toenjoy the weather or for that matter to do anything productive Russia ashas been pointed out in this column before The East Is in the Redhas generally run huge trade surpluses Think of those surpluses as the way anoligarchs gas or oil gets converted into a billion dollar nest egg someplaceoutside the reach of the resurgent Communists or Gen Lebed or whoeveremerges from the wreckage            One thing that is clear isthat the Westthe IMF the Western governments who provided the funds for thelast doomed rescue packagehave come out looking like chumps There is apossible defense for their actions They may have believed that the men whorule Russia were finally beginning to see the light that in their ownselfinterest they would agree to cough up the money the country needed toavoid disaster but they needed a little time In that case the big loansorganized a few months ago could have made the difference But in fact themoney quickly disappeared as speculatorscertainly including the oligarchsthemselvesconverted rubles into dollars as fast as the dollars becameavailable In effect we gave a lot of aid to some future residents ofGstaad            Needless to say in hisrecent visit to Moscow Bill Clinton repeated the old pieties suggesting theWest was ready to offer further assistance if Russia stays with the path ofreforms And he sounded sincere
