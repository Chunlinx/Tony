        kind of younger still and we do a lot of activities with them how about your kids     my children are in their late twenties and both are married and we do things as a family all together and when they were younger we were very involved in Little League and Scouts and band and football and things you know i have two sons things that you do together   are are your sons are your sons still live in the area   yes one lives in Plano and the other lives in Lewisville   well   with their wives   ive got one son and one daughter and i think the activities havent changed because my son is in Scouts       and the orchestra and the choir and ballet and church activities and uh soccer and basketball and baseball and my daughter is on the swim team is in ballet uh takes piano lessons is in the Girl Scouts so tends to be very busy   right well i my husband and i always felt that if you want to keep them off the street so to speak that if theyre involved in a smaller group type things that um  it really is wonderful as far as socializing and learning and just keeping out of trouble i work at a high school and i see a lot of kids who because its a large school youre just sort are a little teeny fish in a big pond here and if you belong to you know a smaller group you you just have a better class of friends and and stuff and i think its wonderful i i admire you its a lot of time out Saturdays Sundays and nights but it it definitely is worth the the time to get your kids involved in in various things   well gives gives them the opportunity to uh you know to relate to other people and not only to learn a specific skill and how to apply it but but more importantly how to you know work within the uh larger context   oh yeah right the social life  socialization is is worth whatever it is theyre learning and it  you know my kids never were on the championship teams they were both in the band they happened to have graduated from the school where i work and and um all those things were or have served them and still are you know in their adult years and in college uh you know that they just they remember lots of good times and um wed still hear frequently from former teammates or band members or you know people who stop by and say hi to my husband and i and uh so are you active with i mean do you coach any of these things or   oh yes i coached this year ive coached soccer ive coached baseball im a uh assistant scout master in the Scouts ive actually       appeared on stage with them in their ballet performances and then a feel of things so its a   oh   its uh its its pretty active and my wife teaches piano and shes active with the Girl Scouts so   well id it   takes a tremendous amount of time   it does and and um but as i say i i really feel to keep them away from the bad element at school or just at the mall or wherever uh every every hour pays off in the long run as far as uh keeping the kids from out of trouble and and uh and i see frequently see that here just because its a high school and and uh you know kids kids get in trouble theres no   well the ones in trouble the ones that are bored thats their biggest problem is boredom if they     thats right thats right theyre also you know have parents that either cant or dont care about their activities and dont support them and and uh over the years my kids have had friends like in the band that in in in three years of high school band their parents never saw a football game to watch them i think i i we never miss a game we still go and the last one graduated in nineteen eighty two so but we still you know go to watch these things and and uh   well sure like last night we went to hear my son play in the uh orchestra then last week we heard him sing in the choir twice so you know were     and uh its a lot of hours for a parents but as they   a lot of hours either it be helping to run things or to just sit there and listen to things   right right right but it it uh i recall my own parents being active in in my endeavors and uh you know i think you you you just cant spend enough time with kids in in quality time as i like to call it and and uh you know its worth every every hour every so you have two children a boy and a girl how old are they   well my sons eleven my daughters ten   okay well see mine are twenty seven and thirty so   well ive got ive got a long way to go   well start saving your money for college
