        so i get most of my news i i am sorry to say from CNN Headline News         so im not sure how remarkably well informed i am by their like three second sound bytes about everything but uh im a college student at this point and uh when i come in when i turn that on for half an hour i see whats going on and then i turn it off and so how do you get your news   uh to tell you the truth i get most of my stuff uh news from printed media um news magazines like Time uh newspapers   hm   ill watch television at in the evening for local news but uh you know for national things i i tend to go more for printed media uh media because they they dont give you the three sound bytes the three seconds uh gee he looks good in a in a camera you know uh although i have to admit im dissatisfied with the   right     quality that you get in the newspapers its unfortunate but   which newspapers in particular like USA Today   thats been well uh well lets see uh no no actually were LA Times we also get the New York Times out here um   oh umhum   and then of course there are lots of specialized publications for you know i work in engineering so you get engineering uh stuff uh what i found is that uh   right   uh you know you are subjected to censorship uh even though thats a bad word uh what happens is an editor has to decide what will fit in the newspaper and what gets dropped on the floor and thats censorship   umhum well that i think that comes about from the fact that that the the news gathering business is is just that a business   thats right   so theyre going to tell you what sells and also although i dont believe this is really that rampant at now uh you know sponsors or or advertisers could have some influence as well over over what uh eventually gets printed   i uh i i agree with that ive seen that in several uh computer magazines where you know if the guy buys six pages of of color ads then he gets a pretty good review in when they review products   yeah and also i think youll also notice if you ever do watch CNN Headline News that anytime Ted Turner does anything  he shows up on there   uh  gets a favorable light cast on it   yeah you you know what though uh i kind of wish that i would uh watch more local news because i end up uh sometimes missing things and hearing them secondhand just because i never do sit down to watch the real news   well you know theres a big problem with the the local news is something weve noticed i mean out here in LA we get gang shootings you know   yeah   and so what you can do is you turn on the local news and if its a bad weekend the first fifteen minutes on a on a Sunday night or a Monday night will be how many people got shot and killed   i think thats the way it usually is they they work from the you know the headline stories you know those ones basically people being killed and murdered and and suffering then they go into like   right   you know sports and weather then they end up on the really nice stuff so that youre not depressed by the time youre done watching the broadcast   right a lot of a lot of times though there there isnt the really nice stuff   oh really   oh yeah the uh in in at least the the news stations that we watch here in LA and i mean you know its its uh uh maybe its just because theyre stuck with  more bad news than good news   um its a possiblity   uh but uh you know its its its unfortunate but even even now i mean i used to live in Europe and we still get uh we lived in Germany and so we still get some German language magazines some   where in Europe umhum i get the      okay we get   umhum   and uh the thing is that you know that of course is slanted   right   from a German point of view and uh you know what you notice are the glaring differences between how America perceives some monumentous event in the world versus how the Germans perceive that same event   right   and i mean its uh you know the the difficulty is that okay theyre its a business over there like it is here theyre slanting it toward their uh public and were slanting it toward our public and you know the question is whats the real truth   umhum well i think thats uh its kind of related to like who writes history because obviously the the news eventually does become history its just always going to be someones the prevailing opinion   yeah   well unless you have a particularly strong   the winners   disparity and there are two you know two competing views exist   well its also again um you know the the uh the the people who write the history its their view and from wherever they happen to be i mean what weve noticed is that um   umhum   uh the the way the uh the Americans are handling Russia the Germans view that as a critical new market and the Americans are well you know the   right apart from McDonalds   well yeah yeah and the uh the thing is that the Americans are well we dont really dont want to get involved with that we dont want to help them theyve got to learn to help themselves you know free market economy     right
