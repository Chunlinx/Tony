portion of the analysis describes the steps theCommission took in attempting to determine the number of smallentities affected by the rule based onGAOOGCvarious criteria databases and Census Bureau information Thiswas necessary because of the inadequacy of the Small BusinessAdministrations definition for television broadcasting stationsthe annual receipt data collected by the Commission and theclassification of stations with network affiliation Under variousanalyses the worst case scenario would be the application of therule to a low of  commercial stations  percent of allstations to a high of  commercial and noncommercial stations percent of all stations The Commission believes that theseestimates greatly overstate the number of small entities affectedand reserves the right to
