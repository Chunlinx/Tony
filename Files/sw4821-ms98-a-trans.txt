        okay um let me see  ive been sitting here awhile i almost forgot the topic but uh it seems like i get most of my news from television       im we only get the paper on the weekends and so im not much of a of a paper reader or but i i and im dont rarely listen to the um radio so it i get most of my news like from documentaries like Forty Eight Hours Twenty Twenty you know it the news at night   umhum   news news in the afternoon and that kind of thing   uhhuh well i i get a weekend paper as well and uh in addition to that i get a local weekly i i live in suburb of Milwaukee and they get they   uhhuh   have community newspapers around here so the local their extremely local  stuff uh is in the local paper that comes out once a week and then i get the Sunday   uhhuh   uh Milwaukee Journal because i dont have time to read a paper uh mostly thats my difficulty i uh i get my news pretty much from the same source as you do although i do listen to NPR   right   which has very good and thats National Public Radio which has very good uh coverage of the national and international news i feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well usually   huh um are you in the car quite a bit or   no im not actually uh but i can run my radio in my office i i i teach at the university and when im not   oh oh   teaching if i choose to have the radio on i can listen to that station so   uhhuh oh i see um   how how are you are you satisfied with the Twenty Twenty and Forty Eight Hours and the things that you do watch   yeah i i i pretty much am and i watch the news at least twice a day   uhhuh   so uh if ive missed something and and and ive just recently decided to home with my children and so it seems as if i catch the news rise right as it happens happens you know there was   umhum   uh the explosions and that kind of thing my husband will say howd you know about that and i said yes it happened at such and such time and thats so that thats different for me so i usually find out when exactly when it happens and that kind of thing   is that the aspect of the news that youre most interested in is is the timely you noting noting of the events as they happen is that what you feel good about in the news coverage   uh no it just seems like since ive recently stayed home that that is whats happened you know its just that uh i now that ive stayed home im im usually aware of when when these things have occurred and it happened and   uhhuh well i i myself uh the the reason why i listen to NPR and the reason why i watch MacNeil Lehrer rather than the than the network shows news shows at night although i do often watch a local ten oclock in the evening news which shows shows you know carries over a lot of the national news stories uh is that   right right   quite often it seems to me that  the national doesnt do a very good job of analysis the local doesnt either but i feel that MacNeil Lehrer get a little more deeply into some some of the issues that are really current   uhhuh   and perhaps newspapers do that but as i said i dont have time to sit down and read a newspaper and frankly when i have read a newspaper i havent noticed that kind of analysis either   umhum hum   so um theres there is some danger to that of course too because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then you know how good is it but uh i like a little more indepth coverage and i think thats what youre maybe appealing to you too on something like Twenty Twenty or Forty Eight Hours   right right it kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story that kind of thing   umhum yeah   so um   im more interested in trying to understand whats going on in the world rather than simply being aware that   yeah   you know there that an event has occurred   yeah   i i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture maybe because im easily confused by detail i dont know   uhhuh yeah i know what youre saying     so   yeah but i try and catch most of those programs  on Wednesdays and Fridays and if i miss them i try and you know i try and and uh tape them if im out or that kind of thing i try and tape them and so i can sit back and watch it and its pretty interesting um   when you have young children right   umhum   so those evening shows are probably also at a time when youre at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the TV set for awhile without interruption   yeah well yeah plus i find i have to video tape quite a bit of things if i dont want any interruptions yeah that kind of thing   oh you do uhhuh uhhuh when is your good watching time   um it seems like ten oclock at night   uhhuh yes yeah thats what what   unfortunately but thats thats what it seems like ten oclock at night   i have older children and getting dinner on the table i come from the east coast and i was   uhhuh   it amazed me when i got out here to the midwest and found out that even though theyre an hour earlier in time they still watch the news when New York
