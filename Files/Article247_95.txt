                                 Washingtons  Million Man            Chatterbox was shocked upon reading Lloyd Groves recent WashingtonPost profile of James Johnson Johnson is the former Mondale aide who runsFannie Mae the government sponsored enterprise that buys mortgages packagesthem into large blocks and resells them as mortgagebacked securities Whatwas so shocking Chatterbox already knew Fannie Mae was one of the last greatWashington racketsa place where ordinary competent wellconnected politicosand lawyers get to earn astronomical Gordon Gekkolike sums Johnson made anestimated  million in  while working to preserve the government favorsthat help this ostensibly private forprofit enterprise earn  billion or soa year If somebody had to win the Fannie Mae jackpot it might as well beJohnson whoChatterboxs friends attestis a decent man            No what startled were Johnsons other jobs in addition to runningFannie Mae he is also chairman of the Kennedy Center Washingtons Big Culturebox and the Brookings Institution Washingtons leadingliberalcentrist think tank Suddenly this bland bespectacledNorwegianAmerican has emerged in the words of excolleague Harold Ickes asthe chairman of the universe OK that may be overstatement Ickes is alsothe man who calls Kenneth Starrs judiciallysupervised subpoenas Gestapopolice state tactics But Johnson is Washingtons equivalent ofMichael Eisner a selfpromoting powernerd who protects his insidiouslysynergistic empire by buying off potential critics with wellpublicized goodworks            Groves profile wasnt that nasty after its publication Johnson sent anappreciative dontworryImnotmad note to Post matriarch KatharineGraham But the piece contained the essential antiJohnson chargethat hewields his considerable clout mainly to protect and defend Fannie Maescongressionally mandated business advantages What advantages First FannieMae pays no state or local taxes depriving the needy District of Columbia ofperhaps hundreds of millions of dollars Second various federal laws implythat Fannie Maes securities are backed by the US government This letsFannie Mae raise money at interest rates lower than its private competitorsmust pay The Congressional Budget Office estimates the value of these specialbreaks at  billion a year of which about a third goes to Fannie Maeshareholders and executives See Matthew Coopers                   Slate               analysis which Johnson appreciatively called unbelievabletrash            If Johnson can keep Congress from ending this  billion perk hes morethan earned his fantastic paycheck Mainly he uses traditional methodsmaking campaign contributions opening Fannie Mae offices in key districtsTheres also the Fannie Mae Foundation which curries favor by handing outchecks to neighborhood groups Chatterbox himself once managed to cadge aspeaking fee arranged by this wonderful organization Johnsons Kennedy Centerchairmanship is another weapon in his PR arsenal Its pathetically easy toplay on Washingtons cultural pretensionsWere a sophisticated city like NewYork arent we Arent wesomething lawyerlobbyist Abe Fortas discoveredwhen he managed to distract attention from his corruption by playing classicalviolin in public By cosponsoring free Kennedy Center concerts with theWashington Post Fannie Mae purchases the goodwill of an insecure cityand simultaneously cozies up to a journalistic institution that could do it alot of damage Can you imagine the Post sponsoring a concert serieswith a less respectable subsidyhound like Archer Daniels Midlands DwayneAndreas Chatterbox cant            But its Johnsons Brookings connection that really rankles For decadesBrookings has been the liberal institution you could count on to defendgovernment enterprises when they need to be defended and criticize subsidieswhen theyre unjustified In essence Brookings scholars exist to exposerackets like Fannie Mae But now the head of Fannie Mae is the most prominentpublic face of Brookings Yesterday Chatterbox drove by the Brookings buildingand picked up the latest issue of the Brookings Review  There on page is a large smiling photo of James Johnson impeccably tailored offering abanal Eisnerlike introduction to the issue            To test the chilling effect of Johnsons stewardship and to generally maketrouble Chatterbox called up six Brookings scholars several of whom have beenquite courageous in the past and asked them what they thought of Fannie Maesspecial deal Of the six four chickened out Two did not Economist BarryBosworth said that while Fannie Mae was a good hardcharging corporation itshould be fullytaxed and an equalization tax should be levied on itsborrowing to offset the effect of the implicit federal guarantee EconomistHenry Aaron said I dont see any reason why a corporation traded on the NewYork Stock Exchange  should be given advantages by state and localgovernments who have to collect more in taxes from Plain Joes to compensate forthe concession Spoken like true Brookings scholars The Chatterbox Medal forcourage in policy analysis to you both                           Memo to Jim Johnson These Brookings wonks want to take away your billion meal ticket Obviously they fail to understand Fannie Maes role as acatalyst for community development Dont you want to squash them like bugsOr better yet get back at them in some quiet vicious Minnesotalike way            PS Isnt your new Eisnerlike profile a potential liability Fannie Maehas always preserved its lucrative privileges in part because its a prettyobscure agency Now you present a big juicy public target What if someRepublican presidential candidate looking for an issueJohn Kasichsayportrayed you the  Million Man as the embodiment of everything wrongwith Washington Just a thought
