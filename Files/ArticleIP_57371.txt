                                 The Sweet Spot            There are a lot of amazingactors in the world but with Sean Penn each performance is amazing in adifferent way As Emmet Ray the fictional s jazz guitarist in WoodyAllens unexpectedly delectable                   Sweet and Lowdown                helifts his voice about an octave and wears a small waxed mustache as if it werea fancy hood ornament Only the mention of Django Reinhardtthe great gypsyguitaristpops his bubble of selfworship sending him into sweats and insome cases unconsciousness The rest of the time hes a preening cock fond ofquoting without irony a rapturous critic Im meee raculous Whenhe plays he folds himself intimately over his guitar and silently moves hislips as if whispering sweet nothings to it Penns expression of stewedsoulfulness parodies this twerpy egotist and exalts him at the same timeActually its the music that exalts him Penn does the intricate fingerworkhimself while on the soundtrack Howard Alden gives the solos a Reinhardtlikemix of limpidness and bite The idea of a jazz guitarist whos also a textbookFreudian hystericloose and yet focused when hes onstage an anxious buffoonwhen hes offhas comic poetry built into it and Penn has radar for both thecomedy and the poetry Its the way he blends them though that is uncannyHes like a great jazz artist            Emmet Ray is theprotagonist of Woody Allens dreams a narcissistic shit whos also an artistictitan The conceit works better here than in Deconstructing Harry where the heroa cross between Allen and Phillip Rothscrewed up hisown and other peoples lives but was let off the hook because he brought somuch meaning into the world through his books Frankly its not Allens placeto forgive himself for all the bad things he has doneor for that matter toassess his own talents With Sweet and Lowdown  he has made the tensionbetween an artists work and life more archetypaland more funny Inmockdocumentary fashion the story of Emmet is relayed by jazz historians andcriticsamong them Ben Duncan Nat Hentoff and Allen himselfwho set thescene for hilarious anecdotes about the guitarists unreliability profligacyand terror of encountering Django Reinhardt Emmet has an infantileindifference to everyone and everything except his own needs To women who fallfor him he spews such unprocessed bilge as I gotta be free Im an artistBut just when you think youve had enough of Emmets whiningselfaggrandizement and emotional cowardice Allen plays a trump card thatbeautiful music            Maybe its wishful thinking on my part but Sweet andLowdown feels like penance for Barbara Kopples bleak documentary WildMan Blues  which chronicled Allens European tour with his NewOrleansstyle jazz band When he watched himself perform in those vast tonytheaters did Allen think what the rest of us were thinkingthat this isnthow jazz is meant to be heard The way he shoots the music here is tender anduninsistent the camera floats past the tables of listeners until it comes toEmmet and his wonderfully pickled look of concentration The note of satire inPenns performance is a hedge against the reverence that dampened such jazzsagas as Bertrand Taverniers Round Midnight  while thegorgeousness of the playing is a hedge against the satire            The story takes amoralistic turn Emmet pays both an artistic and a personal price for notrisking more of himself emotionally But the film doesnt bog down in loathingself or otherwise the way Allens last work Celebrity  didHe adores this milieu too muchhe probably wishes hed been born into it Andhes in the buoyant talltale mode of The Purple Rose of Cairo With cinematographer Zhao Fei production designer Santo Loquasto and costumedesigner Laura Cunningham Bauer Allen recreates the world of urban supperclubs where gangsters mingle with jazz artists and highsociety vamps and wherethe music itself seems to smooth over class distinctions Early on Emmet picksup the tab for a table of tuxedoclad AfricanAmerican musicians then goeshome with them to drink and jam He stumbles back to his hotel via the dumpwhere he shoots the breeze with hobos and indulges in his favorite form ofrecreation picking off rats with his  Allen has never made a movie wherethe jokes seemed so offhand yet so preciseso beatperfect He must havewanted to freshen his approach this time out Why else would this famouslysettled director pick both a mainland Chinese cinematographer who reportedlycame with a team of translators and a different kind of lead actorone whowouldnt mimic Allens diction like Mia Farrow in Purple Rose andKenneth Branagh in Celebrity             Of course there are aspects of Sweet and Lowdownthat dont seem so fresh when youre out from under its spell The conceptionof women for instance Allen still thinks along the same lines as inManhattan  where the open and inarticulate teenager MarielHemingway stood for purity a mans hope of salvation while such overeducatedolder types as Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep the lesbian exwife were likesucking swamps of neurosis and infidelity The purity here is embodied byHattie Samantha Morton a mute laundress whom Emmet picks up on a New Jerseyboardwalk The other extreme is represented by Blanche Uma Thurman a sleekand edgy sophisticate who has affairs with lowlifes as research for novelsAllen is clearly letting Emmet have a taste of his own medicineBlanchedoesnt say Ive gotta be free Im an artist but thats the implicationThe problem is that he cant bring himself to give Blanche any soul And what astroke making the feminine ideal a mute who does laundryalways a bigplus            Allen struck gold when he cast Morton however AnEnglish actress known for her BBC Jane Eyre  and an incendiaryturn in the littleseen Under the Skin  she has a dimpledhalfsmile a slightly bobbing walk and the manner of a pixilated silent movieragamuffin The part is all muggingpulling Harpolike facesbut Morton turnsit into a delicious tease always seeming on the verge of speech ofsaying something naughty or funny or caustic She appears not to talk becauseshe just thinks better of it As Hattie gazes serenely on Emmet after theirfirst coupling he keeps up both ends of the conversationDid ya like thatI knew you would  I was  when I first had sex  She worships him and seesright through him and a part that might have seemed a sentimental contrivancebecomes the source of comic bliss                           Sweet and Lowdownis a small comedyits monaural not stereo and purposefully distant Butit has a touch of magic At one point Allen gives you several versions of thesame climactic scene it varies according to the historian and the effect ofall those farcical possibilities is elating a Rashomon like sequencewhere you dont give a damn what actually happened Each variation is moreentertainingly outlandish and in the last when Emmet finally sees DjangoReinhardt Penn caps it with one of the great movie swoons Everything he doeshits the sweet spot            The best of many good reasons to see                  Tumbleweeds                is Janet McTeer who plays a hopeful ish mom whobounces from boyfriend to boyfriendand state to statewith her cynicaladolescent daughter Kimberly J Brown in tow McTeer an English actress whowon a  Tony award for her Nora in A Dolls House  gives aperformance that is so gorgeously modulated youll think she has been in moviesall her life It helps that her character Mary Jo is a ham Fixing breakfastshe dances around the kitchen and sticks her tongue out at her lover as ifrazzing her own domesticity The actress uses her whole slinky framelots ofleg and lots of cleavageto show how this bustingout babe is too alive forthe bluecollar hemen she takes up with Its no wonder that her daughterAvawho has the heavy spirit of a child forced to be more farsighted than herparentgravitates to theater where ones exhibitionism can be harnessed

conquest and he also directed the movie and cowrote thescreenplay with Angela Shelton The story is based on Sheltons childhoodmemoirs Beat by dramatic beat these are some of the most nuanced scenes ina film all year OConnor is a fabulous actors director Maybe too fabulousThe actors appear to be entertaining themselves so much that some of thetension dissipates and the ease with which the movie goes down ends up workingagainst it Tumbleweeds could use some dissonances Im a little fuzzyfor instance on this familys finances They dont want for food or a roofover their heads and they end upwith no visible means of supporton a nicelittle block in San Diego which isnt the cheapest housing in the country Imiss the rawness that Gillian Armstrong brought to another motherdaughterstory High Tide  The foundations here are just a little toosturdy Tumbleweeds seems on the brink of tumbling into a TV series
