                 okay uh  let me see ive got two children one is uh both preschoolers one is two and one is um four   uhhuh   so and um  this is my first year off and ive always worked uh the time that they were little and so i decided to hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and  spend some more time with them which i hadnt been doing   well i think thats wonderful my children are in college   so oh   but i teach school and i teach uh middle school age children   oh okay   and so i see a lot of uh variation in what happens when kids are at home   yeah   i have taught school ever since my children were little but the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your childrens and your holidays are too so teaching i think is a   uhhuh yeah   a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids   umhum yeah  well thats what i was doing before i was teaching for a Richardson School District and um it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little and it was really hard   uhhuh right well with them being as young it was much much harder when mine were young   yeah yeah   and uh i really didnt have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his uh college work   yeah   and his Masters degree and so forth and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a fulltime job   yeah thats right thats right and thats what was kind of what what where we were when you know we  i really didnt have to work but i felt like i really wanted to work   umhum   and i felt i awful i felt like boy i was sure was missing a lot and they were growing so fast and you know its like do i really need to work you know  and i and it that choice was there i really didnt have to and   umhum   you know  so i did have that advantage there but  its different staying at home too you know its an adjustment to make also   yes it certainly is we well i think that um we need to spend more family time together with with children today uh we made a point to spend a lot of quality time and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were   uhhuh   involved in you know like uh through scouting or you know anything like that we participated and uh we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now   yeah wow thats great   when yeah  when uh the kids were in high school it was harder to always have supper together but we did always have breakfast together   uhhuh   so we we had supper together as much as possible but when it wasnt feasible you know we kind of kept a master calendar   umhum   and when it wasnt feasible well that was understandable but uh weve always tried to spend time to talk and uh   yeah   have some time together time and we sat around the table we didnt sit in front of a TV or   ah thats great because thats   that kind of thing so i think thats been important because we do have a close family and even though the kids are basically uh grown uh   uhhuh   they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when theyre here and uh  have spoken before of they want that kind of situation   umhum   you know situation for them when you know and their children when they marry and have children   yeah kind of grows on and   umhum   they do what they see and you know   thats right they model and the with the dysfunctional families today im sure you with a as a schoolteacher also you see what happens to these kids   umhum yeah   when these families never communicate or theyre dysfunctional as far as the between uh oh second families or uh one parent families or all those kinds of problems that they have and then you see them magnified magnified in the children   uhhuh yeah yeah yeah plus you teach middle school so im sure that   oh boy yes   you are really you really boy oh boy i taught early childhood so i had the little ones   umhum yes   and um you know i saw it there too and you you know you just oh its it kind of an eyeopener you know so   it is it is and most i think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children and i think we make a point to do that   umhum yeah i think youre right   because we see we see all the time the outcome of not doing that and i think if we werent so interested in in children in childfaring we wouldnt be teaching anyway   yeah right right   so uh i wish we could reach more of the rest of the world   okay yeah yeah   because i think uh the major problems in education are not whats happening in the schools its whats happening in the families and uh they expect us to   i agree yeah   you know have create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers and you get to a point where its completely impossible   uh yeah yeah i agree i i know exactly what youre saying   and you just get more and more frustrated and yet you feel for the the kids you do the best you can but
