                have you ever done this   yes i have   what did you do   unfortunately     unfortunately  uh oh  this will be interesting     it yeah it its its really hard to please everybody and it it takes a lot of planning a lot more a lot more effort  you know you have to decided what youre going to do have you ever done one   well actually id i sort of do this uh anytime my family comes to town   uhhuh   i mean we have a very immediate family its not really extended     umhum   uh i was an only child my mother is an only child so we dont have like tons and tons of relatives so its really my parents and i have five children three are married and they have little kids   umhum   and so you know its basically us and so when every body comes it is very hectic       and i guess thats as close to what we have as a reunion and we do this at Christmas and we just did this last week and so um its hard to get everyone to be able to come at the same time   umhum   thats the hard part is was my son was missing last week because hes a teacher and he had things he had to do and he couldnt just leave but uh its really hard to get everyone together but we dont have lots of aunts and uncles and things like that to consider   yeah our um uh the ones i was involved in was with my wifes family and its very extended there are aunts and greataunts and cousins and cousins children   yeah that would be so much harder   and theres oh  over the last fourteen years depending on where we went and what we did theres anywhere from and thirty or forty to fifty sixty and sometimes more than that you know during different phases of what were trying to do   uh so how often do you try to all get together   um they try every year   oh no are you all from the same place pretty much or   were kind of in the same area most everybody is from uh Idaho and Utah   uhhuh   and there are some from there well theres a couple back east and they travel theyve come a few times theres some from California   uhhuh   and i think theres some from Washington   where do you have these things i mean how long do they   usually weve been having them in Idaho thats where   its at someones house or i mean   um no weve had them out in uh kind of wilderness uh areas before we go camping   so you go camping do you i see well thats kind of good   and weve had them at resorts uh you know smaller resort places uh   uhhuh   you know kind of like camp ground things   but that way no one has all the work i mean once its planned nobody has to worry about fixing food for everybody and that kind of thing right   well we we do uh we we have some traditional things and the first nights usually like a potluck everybody just brings whatever they want and   uhhuh   and we have those kind of foods and and then usually the first morning breakfast is just that each body does their own and then have games all day   so there is a lot of planning though for things like that i guess anyway huh   umhum yeah there there is we we do uh uh you know  we have we have quite a few we have a sing along one of the uncles plays the guitar and sings and then everybody puts on a talent show each familys supposed to   thats so neat though thats great   do talent show things and we have an an auction everybody brings in made goods or things that they do and we have an auction and then that goes into the family fund   oh and who has the family fund   and well they elect officers every year   youre kidding i have never heard of this   uh they have uh yeah they have a they have a a president usually they try to elect the family and inside that family therell be the president and or the chairman or whatever and then each person has an assignment to to you know carry out one part of the thing like one one one person will have um the games and one will have the food and one will have the auction and onell have the program   oh boy thats a big job for one family   whatever it is so it well well when im talking family its its like my motherinlaw my motherinlaws children so thatd my wife and her her sisters and brothers   uhhuh i see so its separated really yeah   right so its um it uh you know its extended its extended family what it is is my mother my motherinlaw and her sisters and brothers     right   and their oh i dont know theres twelve of them or fourteen of them or something like that not all of them are living still but theres probably eight or nine that still are   hum   and then all of their kids and their kids kids and   yeah i see   so its
