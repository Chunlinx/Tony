                hello   hello there   did i reach the Dallas area   i beg your pardon   did i reach the Dallas area   nope youve reached Dayton Ohio   Dayton Ohio im from North Carolina   oh youre from North Carolina where in North Carolina   in Raleigh   Raleigh great my names Mary   yeah so my name is Fernando   Fernando glad to know you   so um do you work howd you find out about this   uh i was visiting my son down in Dallas   oh okay he works for TI   and uh no no but his wife has a contract with TI and thats how we learned about it umhum   oh okay because im down at NC State   yeah umhum   and so i took a class and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes   right   so are you ready   im ready   okay lets get started   all right okay     okay so uh what do you think uh that uh what what what what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America   oh if i knew that id be a very wealthy person   yeah but what what what are the steps     well you have to see i a as the way i look at it you have to think first of all why or has has crime increased and if so why has crime increased   well see the problem is is that um what happens is as that youre uh you know as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people   umhum right   and so as as and the people in the country dont want as much as the people in the city   umhum   now what happens is all those that dont have any money in the country move to the cities and they wish to get the same thing they say why cant we have the same things that these other people have and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs and what we have to do is we have to go there get some stuff steal it and then you know  resell it   its easy you said the magic word there drugs   which one yeah   and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased   thats uh thats uh the main reason i think uh everywhere because uh you have deaths i mean i mean you have murders and you have you know people stealing other peoples stuff and thats a lot of it has to do with drugs   oh yes   it doesnt have to do i mean the thing is is that you know its like you might be standing somewhere right and like lets say youre you you go you know youre driving out and youre driving back home and its late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints   yeah   and uh somebody walks in there with a gun i mean theyre going to want the money and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs i mean they dont want the money so uh so they can do something else with it   now they dont want the money for food thats for sure     right right and so   well but you know the the strange thing uh perhaps not strange but something that many people dont realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty one and fifty two and find that there were drug dealers   umhum   at that time trying to influence the high school kids because uh im a retired educator   okay   and uh in fifty one and fifty two the police came to the high school where i was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started and so on and so on   yeah   so its a problem thats been around for over forty years and were just really uh uh now trying to uh figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge   yeah theres a theres a a song that i know which says you know that its like in uh nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine the local state and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America   hm   and uh i their figures i think are true so i mean its like compared to you know compared to weapons and stuff like that i mean youre spending nothing on on crime in the country itself what youre doing is you you know its like you have other things you know its like you have the AIDS were going to solve try to solve the AIDS problem while while you know some people are getting killed here and there and then   uhhuh you know the uh another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers the big dealers in drugs may be may be part of the power structure thats keeping us from spending the money in that direction   uhhuh but those people never get caught the people that   thats right theyll never get caught   that that i see their theory is that if im surrounded and im going to be caught im going to try to pry my way through and theyre not going to take me alive   umhum   but i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me   thats right but theyll   you know its like of course i mean i might be you know the the leading drug dealer here but you wont find me dealing in drugs i mean theres no connection between me and the people that you caught you know   thats right thats right then one person doesnt know the other person down the line   right   but the guy at the very top the one whos whos really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure uh the uh and had the political uh pull to keep things from uh keep the interest or the uh emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing because it sure is monstrous in this country   yeah yeah i was i was at a at a party on Saturday and this guy comes up he goes hey how you doing whatever and then he started talking to me and this guy was from Jamaica right and hes got his little brother selling drugs   umhum umhum   you know and he goes yeah i just came up here to work and i go oh you did i bet you make uh very good money up here he goes yeah i make a lot a lot of money he goes you know and uh in the movie Good Fellas   yeah right   did you see it   nope i only heard about it   okay in one part the guy goes out of jail and within uh two months he had all his house payments done everything paid and you know and he had enough money to you know its like   umhum   those guys at one point you know they had so much money that they didnt know what to do with it   yeah well you know even in our prison systems theyre finding that theyre theyre having drugs smuggled into them   yeah yeah thats that that was also in the movie yeah   right     so hello Mary   its been nice talking   weve been talking for five minutes it was   i beg your  weve been talking for a little bit i appreciate the call i enjoyed talking with you   all right okay same here byebye   uhhuh byebye
