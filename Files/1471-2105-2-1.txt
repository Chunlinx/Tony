                    Background                  Antigenic drift and the generation of viral          quasispecies          Some RNA viruses form a quasispeciesa set of related          viral variants that coexist in field populations and even          within single infected individuals reviewed in                The emergence of immunologically distinct          members of a viral quasispecies through mutation and          subsequent immune selection is called antigenic drift          Antigenic drift is thought to be important in human          immunodeficiency virus HIV infection and the continuing          seasonal influenza epidemics because immunity generated          against one viral quasispecies member selects for escape          variants Attributed in part to antigenic drift are the          moderately high failure rate and the shortlived efficacy          of influenza vaccines   the failure of synthetic          footandmouth disease virus vaccines   and the          inability of recombinant HIV vaccines to provide complete          protection against field strains of the virus            The hemagglutinin HA envelope surface          glycoproteinthe major neutralizing determinant of          influenza Ais a classic example of an antigenically          drifting protein   Walter Gerhard and colleagues          demonstrated that the immune pressure exerted by          monoclonal antibodies Abs selects for HA escape mutants          in model systems    Later Dimmock and colleagues          showed that polyclonal antisera also select for escape          mutants    Similarly much of the observed          variability of glycoprotein  gp the principal          surface antigen of HIV is thought to reflect antigenic          drift      The correlation of intrapatient          viral diversity with immune response strength has been          cited as evidence that the immune response is a selective          factor in HIV antigenic drift                Phylogenetic analyses describe divergence within a          viral population and these methods have been used to          infer the selective advantages of viral variation                        A more          direct indication of the selective advantage gained          through variation is an observed overabundance of          replacement mutations relative to silent mutations in          viral proteins   Such analyses of gp and its V          regions indicate that replacement mutations are generally          overrepresented in this protein and thus appear to          confer selective advantage to HIV                       In more detailed analyses          several groups tested individual codons for replacement          mutations that are as an aggregate overabundant               However none of these methods determine          which replacement mutations are actually positively          selected Also when replacement mutations of varying          fitness are lumped together positively selected          mutations may remain undetected among negatively selected          mutations          To overcome these limitations we have developed a          selection mapping algorithm The cornerstone of          selection mapping is the testing of each observed          replacement mutation at each codon to identify those          particular replacement mutations that are overabundant          relative to silent mutations at that codon Such          replacement mutations are determined to be positively          selected Negatively selected variants are recognized as          noise and are thereafter ignored Here we use the          selection mapping method to identify the positively          selected variants of influenza A HA H serotype HIV          reverse transcriptase RT and HIV gp                            Results and Discussion                  Selection map of influenza A H          hemagglutinin          QUASI identifies  HA codons where one or more          replacement mutations are positively selected in the          influenza A H virus Fig  From our neutral drift          testing of QUASI we expect a maximum of about  false          positives see Materials and Methods The distribution          of these positively selected codons is of particular          interest Without exception the codons where variants          are positively selected are on the HA surface Fig           left The parsimonious explanation of this result is          that HA variants are primarily selected for escape from          Bcell immunity If Tcell immunity is instead the          primary selective force affecting HA variation then          either all Tcell immunity escape variants are          coincidentally solventexposed or HA Tcell epitopes are          determined by Ab protection   These  codons          include  outside those identified as positively          selected by Walter Fitch and colleagues   We          attribute our new findings primarily to sites where many          variants are negatively selected but where at least one          variant is positively selected The Fitch group also          identifies  additional codons as positively selected We          believe that these are false positives caused by the          Fitch groups assumption that HA is on average          neutrally drifting these six codons may be less          negatively selected than average but they nevertheless          appear to be negatively selected Additionally our data          while largely the same as those analyzed by the Fitch          group do have some differences          Wiley           et al  proposed four antigenic          sites where field and laboratory mutations could be          grouped on the HA surface   These putative antigenic          sites are indicated in Figure and the right side of          Figure  Positively selected variants are correlated          Fishers exact test with antigenic site A p               antigenic site B p      and          antigenic site C p      In contrast          antigenic site D is not particularly correlated with          positively selected variants We believe the lack of          positively selected variants spanning antigenic site D          may explain a decadesold puzzle In the fully assembled          HA protein site D is buried in the trimer interface and          therefore is not generally accessible to Ab    At          the time that the antigenic sites were proposed residues          in and around the trimer interface were variable and          found on the monomer surface so they were grouped and          labeled as antigenic site D even though it was unclear          how site D was recognized by Ab   In fact the only          two positively selected variants QUASI identifies in site          D are solventexposed at the extreme edge of the HA          trimer Fig  Based on QUASIs selection map of HA we          now conclude that those mutations found in the          trimerburied portion of HA do not confer significant          advantage on influenza A That is while the          trimerburied portion of antigenic site D includes the          sound and fury of variability it signifies nothing          While QUASI finds that antigenic sites AC are          significantly associated with positively selected          variation this association may be a simple consequence          of the sites surface exposure As can be seen in the          lefthand side of Figure  positively selected variants          are scattered across the entire exposed surface of HA          There are positively selected variants outside the          antigenic sites and there are subregions of the          antigenic sites where variation is negatively selected          Thus it may be more appropriate to view antigenic sites          as more positional than functional Indeed more recent          demarcations of antigenic sites enlarge antigenic sites          AD and add an additional antigenic site site E and          these sites are now considered primarily positional          rather than functional                             Selection map of HIV gp          At  codons QUASIs selection map of gp          indicates that one or more nonconsensus amino acids are          positively selected in HIV Fig  Most positively          selected variants appear to be on the gp surface not          shown but in contrast to HA gp includes several          monomerburied positively selected variants at sites          I V N H I T I and L          Additionally some of the positively selected variants          that appear to be solventexposed may normally be buried          some loops are absent from the core protein crystal          structure   The burial of positively selected          variants in the gp monomer confirms that gp          quasispeciation is not selected solely for escape from          Bcell immunity          Two competitiongroup epitopes have been identified          for broadly neutralizing antigp Abs the CDbinding          site CDBS and the CDinduced CDi epitopes          references in   Each epitope includes only a          single nonconsensus positively selected variant Fig           Thus broadly neutralizing Abs appear to be those          that engage few protein positions where variation is          positively selected Based on this observation we          propose that the neutralizing spectra of Abs may be          predicted if the epitopes are known For example we          would predict that the antiCDBS Abs will have          particular trouble recognizing gp molecules carrying          the positively selected variant of the CDBS epitope DN          at codon  This prediction is fulfilled in that the          e antiCDBS monoclonal Ab fails to react to gp from          HIV strain RF a strain that carries this DN mutation            We also predict that gp molecules carrying the          positively selected IF mutation at codon  will be          poorly recognized by the antiCDi Abs          It is worth commenting on the GPGRAF motif gp          residues  that is sometimes though increasingly          rarely referred to as highly conserved Because QUASI          identifies nonconsensus variants at two codons of this          motif as positively selected Fig  it may be          inappropriate to refer to the GPGRAF motif as highly          conserved Instead five positively selected variants          appear to exist at this region in addition to GPGRAF          GPGKAF GPGRTF GPGKTF GPGRVF and GPGKVF          Kwong           et al roughly divide the gp          threedimensional structure into outer  and           and inner N  and C domains joined          by a bridging sheet    and    As          indicated by Kwong           et al  all three domains include          variable regions as QUASI shows diversity in all three          regions is positively selected Fig  The selective          advantage we find rendered by diversity in some of these          regions            eg  the silent face has been          attributed to neutral drift    thus QUASIs          results run counter to previous interpretations That is          QUASI finds that diversity in regions proposed to be          inaccessible to the immune system nevertheless confers          selective advantage on HIV QUASIs findings may be          consistent with the existence of gaps in the carbohydrate          groups thought to mask the silent face from gp from          immune surveillance Interestingly in          carbohydratebuilding models of gp these gaps          correspond to codons where we find variation is          positively selected P Kwong pers commun          A nonneutralizing face has been identified where          binding Abs generally do not neutralize HIV when gp is          oligomerized    these data were interpreted as          indicating that the nonneutralizing face is occluded in          the trimer and that binding Abs are raised against shed          gp monomers However QUASI finds numerous positively          selected variants on the nonneutralizing face of the          inner domain Assuming the nonneutralizing appellation          is appropriate how do mutations on this face provide          selective advantage to the virus The obvious answer is          that mutations provide escape not from direct Bcell          immunity but from other levels of immunity such as          Tcell immunity including major histocompatibility          complex MHC presentation or indirect Ab immunity via          Abdependent cellular cytotoxicity where gp molecules          found on infected cell surfaces are monomers          To determine if HIV viral sequences retain evidence          that Tcell immunity is a significant selective force          affecting HIV quasispeciation we used QUASI to generate          a selection map of HIV RT Fig  Because RT is not a          surfaceexpressed protein it is not plausible that the          positively selected variants of RT have been selected by          direct Bcell immunity           A priori  RT quasispeciation could          have been the result of neutral drift but because QUASI          finds that replacement mutations confer selective          advantage on the virus we reject the neutral drift          hypothesis at the  RT codons If Tcell immunity          including MHC presentation is a selective pressure          shaping RT quasispeciation positively selected variants          should be associated with Tcell epitopes When known          Tcell epitopes   are plotted on the RT selection          map the positively selected variants are found to          localize significantly Fishers exact test both with          helper Tcell epitopes p      and CTL          epitopes p      We conclude that Tcell          immunity is a significant selection pressure shaping the          quasispeciation of RT and presumably is a significant          factor in the quasispeciation of other HIV proteins          Thus because positively selected gp variants found          throughout gp may be selected by Tcell immunity          QUASIs finding that the nonneutralizing face includes          positively selected variants is not at odds with models          where the nonneutralizing face forms the gp trimer          interface Nor are QUASIs results incompatible with the          silent face being silent to Bcell immunity QUASIs          finding that positively selected variants may be buried          in the gp monomer is consistent with escape from          Tcell immunity          In addition to the selection pressure exerted by          Tcell immunity azidodeoxythymidine AZT may          also have provided selection pressure for RT          quasispeciation in the sequences selection mapped by          QUASI    Indeed QUASI identifies six of the          eight mutations known to be associated with AZT          resistance   as positively selected N R W          Y and F or possibly positively selected L to          HIV Fig  The exceptions two mutations of codon           are informative Whereas mutations at other codons          are necessary for high resistance to AZT mutations at          codon  are not and codon  mutations arise late in          infection after earlier mutations have already rendered          RT resistant to AZT   We conclude that the          additional AZT resistance conferred by codon           mutations did not provide significant selective advantage          to the profiled HIV viruses possibly because HIV had          already acquired the maximum effective AZT resistance          selectable           in vivo  when mutations arose at          this codon Alternatively the lysine at codon  may be          important for proper           in vivo RT function such that the          advantage conferred by increased AZT resistance does not          adequately compensate for impaired RT function The RT          sequences we analyze were taken from patients who either          had no antiRT treatment or were treated mainly with AZT          though some patients who were treated with AZT were also          treated with dideoxyinosine              Therefore we would predict that mutations associated          with resistance to other antiRT drugs should not be          positively selected in the sequences QUASI analyzed As          predicted QUASI identifies none of the  RT mutation          associated with resistance to other drugs as positively          selected compare Figure to the Los Alamos database                                       Conclusion        We have developed an algorithm for using sequence data        to map the positively selected mutations of viral        quasispecies We have used this method to map the        positively selected variants of influenza A HA HIV RT        and HIV gp Other obvious targets for selection        mapping are the hepatitis C and footandmouth disease        viruses We believe that potentially the most illuminating        use of selection mapping may be the comparison of viral        subpopulations to determine which variants are advantageous        under different selective pressures For example selection        mapping of HIV isolates with different cellular tropisms        will allow the determination of mutations that are        positively selected depending on the host cell type Also        we may use selection mapping to analyze HIV breakthrough        infections to determine if vaccines prevented the HIV        quasispecies from inhabiting normally advantageous regions        of the quasispecies sequence space Finally we propose        that the positively selected viral variants as opposed to        all viral variants should be included in future highly        multivalent vaccines designed to compensate for        Bcellselected antigenic drift                    Materials and Methods                  QUASIthe selection mapping algorithm          An executable version of the QUASI software

     For a set of viral nucleotide sequences we determine          the variants that confer selective advantage by measuring          the empirical replacement to silent mutation ratio RS          of each possible amino acid replacement and then          comparing this observed ratio to that which would be          expected if mutation were unselected An RS that is          found to be higher than expected indicates that the          replacement mutation tested is positively selected while          a lowerthanexpected observed RS indicates that the          tested replacement mutation is negatively selected          Testing for an overabundance of replacements across a          protein as a whole is a reasonable approach when only a          few nucleotide sequences are available but because a          large number of mutated viral sequences are currently          available such aggregation is unnecessarily crude          Better are approaches that test for an overabundance of          replacement mutations at individual codons               However these methods lump together replacement          mutations and thus allow negatively selected mutations to          conceal positively selected mutations and           vice versa            eg  replacement mutations at a          codon may be negatively selected as a group despite the          fact that one or more particular replacement mutations          are positively selected          To overcome these limitations the QUASI algorithm          does not test the overall RS of the entire protein as an          aggregate nor does QUASI test the RS of a codon to all          its replacement mutations taken as a whole Rather QUASI          tests the RS of each particular replacement mutation at          each codon That is QUASI measures the RS of the          mutations from a consensus codon towards each individual          replacement amino For example if the consensus codon at          a protein position were ttt Phe QUASI would test the          RSs of all point mutations from ttt One of these          mutations is ttttat Tyr QUASI calculates the expected          RS for ttttat under the null hypothesis of neutral          drift The expected S is one because only one mutation          ttc is silent and the expected R is also one because          only one point mutation of ttt tat codes for Tyr so          the expected RS is one in this case If QUASI rejects          the JukesCantor neutral drift null hypothesis because          the observed RS is significantly higher than one then          QUASI classifies this replacement mutation Tyr as          positively selected Conversely if QUASI rejects the          null hypothesis because the observed RS is significantly          lower than one then QUASI determines that this          replacement mutation is negatively selected QUASI          performs this procedure for all replacement point          mutations            eg  in the example case Tyr          tat Ile att Leu tta ttg and ctt Val gtt Ser          tct and Cys tgt          In this paper selection mapping is carried out          independent of the underlying phylogeny QUASI uses RS          to reject the null hypothesis that the mutational space          surrounding the consensus codon is distributed randomly          among all nine possible R or S point mutations except          stop codons which are considered to be disallowed This          allows RS calculations to be applied to viral sequences          whose ancestral sequence is unclear or unknown This is a          both an advantage and a disadvantage over analyses that          rely on phylogeny Phylogeny is difficult to determine          accurately and uniquely and relying on phylogeny ignores          the persistence of positively selected replacement          mutations the major effect of selection On a practical          level using phylogeny to reconstruct viruses mutational          histories and then using intuited mutations leaves one          with insufficient data to determine positivelyselected          codons   unless as some have done one assumes          observed drift is neutral and then tests for codons where          selection is more positive than average    The          significance problem can be compounded when one is          looking for independent occurrences of particular          mutations often there simply has not been enough          sequence evolution in HIV or influenza to map positively          selected variants if the retention of positively selected          mutations is ignored The drawback of ignoring phylogeny          is a potentially high false positive rate see          below          Empirical RS is compared to neutral RS by means of a          twosided test of the binomial distribution For each          codon we test the null hypothesis that all nine point          mutants are equally probable The quotient           p  RRS is the probability of a          replacement mutation at this codon if each nucleotide is          equally mutable and each of the three mutational targets          at that codon are equally likely The numerator R is          the number of point mutations that lead from the          consensus codon to the target amino acid The chance of          observing           r replacement mutations is given by          the binomial distribution  where           n is the number of codons providing          data for this position To form a twosided test we sum          all terms           b            kn            p  such that           b            kn            p  is not greater than           b            rn            p  where           k is in the set            n  and           r is the number of observed          replacement mutations In other words we sum the chances          of all events that are no more likely than that of the          observation If this sum  is small            eg  not greater than  we          reject the null hypothesis at the  level of          significance                          Working example          We analyze the following

mutations          given as  in this example Table  column  we also          know the expected RS for each replacement mutation          Table  column  That is if selection is neutral for          any particular replacement mutation we can calculate the          incidence of each replacement mutation we expect to          observe by looking at a table of the genetic code          Using the given frequency of each mutation observed          we also know what the observed RS is in each case Table           column           Now we use a twotailed test of the binomial          distribution to determine if each observed RS is          significantly different from the corresponding expected          RS Table  column  In some cases the differences          are significant in which case the appropriate          replacement mutation is assigned positive or negative          selection positive if the observed RS is larger than          expected and negative if the observed RS is lower than          expected Otherwise the selection is assigned to be          neutral drift          The QUASI algorithm thus indicates at this exemplary          codon that both tyrosine and serine are positively          selected isoleucine leucine and cystine are negatively          selected and the selective advantage or disadvantage of          valine is indistinguishable from neutral drift Any other          ttt codon will have its own selective pressures assessed          in a similar but independent testing procedure                          Minimum sequences          For each possible replacement mutation a minimum          number of mutations will need to be observed for a          selective event to be detected This minimum number          differs depending on the consensus codon and the level of          significance We have calculated the minimum number of          mutations needed to achieve the  significance level At          the lower bound of this range only  replacement          mutations will be required to detect positive selection          for any replacement mutation from cta or ctg Any          replacement mutation from cta or ctg has an expected RS          of  and thus an observed RS of  will be          sufficient to reject neutral drift in favor of positive          selection Conversely detecting negative selection at a          cta or ctg codon is difficult At the upper bound of the          range a minimum of  observed mutations are required to          detect negative selection at such a codon  is          significantly lower than  For the mosttypical          codon the expected RS is  For these modal codons          at least  mutations must be observed to detect positive          selection            ie  if observed RS   At          the same mosttypical codon  mutations are required          at a minimum to detect negative selection            ie  if observed RS            Because identification of positive selection is generally          the goal the QUASI algorithm appears to have a practical          advantage over extant selection detectors which require          either many more mutations or a biased expectation of          neutral drift in order to detect positive selection                          Falsepositive testing          False positives are likeliest when drift is completely          neutral            eg  as was found by Suzuki and          Gojobori   One may estimate the maximum frequency          of false positives by testing simulated sequences          generated under neutral drift parameters We used the          EVOLVER program of the PAML package   to generate          sequences drifting under neutral JukesCantor evolution          For each simulation we generated  related sequences          of length  and with average branch lengths varying in           length intervals from  to  each parameter set          was used to generate  sets of  sequences False          positive percentages Fig  false positive percentage           false positives  false positives  neutral drift          variants were extremely low   for relatively long          branch lengths  Extremely high false positive          rates up to  were found for extremely short branch          lengths maximum at  As accurate branch lengths          are calculated using maximum likelihood phylogeny these          branch lengths may be used to find the appropriate          falsepositive percentage For instance if the branch          length were  as appears appropriate for HA          unpublished observation then the maximum false          positive rate would be estimated at  We then use the          calculated neutral drift frequency from QUASI as an          estimator for the maximum false positives If as we          report HA is found to have  neutral drift variants          then we would expect a maximum of           falsepositives                          Selection mapping          QUASI presents its results in the following          format           The consensus amino acids are written in capital          letters           Beneath each consensus amino acid are written in          capital letters all variants determined to be positively          selected in descending order of frequency           The negatively selected variants are not shown           In lowercase letters and interspersed according to          their frequencies among the positively selected variants          are variants where the neutral drift null hypothesis          cannot be rejected with the given sequence data As a          reasonable but arbitrary cutoff we include apparently          unselected variants if they are among the  Hmost          frequent variants where           H is the Shannon information          content of the site and  is the standard error of its          estimation   is the           i th fraction of amino acids at the          site the alignment gap is counted as a st amino acid          For the Shannon calculation alignment gaps are          considered distinct from no data gaps artifacts of          indeterminate sequencing or sequence fragment overlaps          such data absences are excluded from calculation                          Sequences          Nucleotide sequences were downloaded from GenBank at          the NIH Sequences were included only if they were
