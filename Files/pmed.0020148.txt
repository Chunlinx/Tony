                            Cardiovascular diseases CVDs are responsible for more than  million deaths        worldwide about  of total global deaths Many of these deaths could be prevented by        tackling major risk factors such as overweight and obesity as a result of unhealthy diet        and physical inactivity and smoking Traditionally CVDs have been considered a Western        disease or a disease of affluence and not a pressing public health concern for lowincome        populations However within uppermiddleincome and highincome countries CVDs and their        associated risk factors are increasingly concentrated among the lowest socioeconomic        groups and globally  of all CVD deaths are in lowincome and middleincome        countries        In this months         PLoS Medicine  Majid Ezzati and colleagues conclude that a large        proportion of the worlds population living in lowincome and middleincome countries        should indeed be the focus of attention for CVD risk factors This attention is needed        because the aging populations of the currently lowincome and middleincome countries are        expected to be those among whom major cardiovascular risk factors will increasingly be        concentrated        The patterns of risks in relation to one another and to economic variables such as        income are not fully established at the population level but need to be understood if        better longterm policies and interventions are to be deployed Ezzati and colleagues        examined when interventions should be started by looking at the relationship between        nutritional cardiovascular risk factorsoverweight and obesity and elevated blood pressure        and cholesteroland three economic indicators using data for more than  countries        Their analysis uncovered economicepidemiological patterns more complex than the Western        or affluence labels would suggest They found that body mass index BMI and cholesterol        increased rapidly in relation to national income then flattened and eventually declined        BMI increased most rapidly until an income of about I international dollars and        peaked at about I for women and I for men Cholesterol showed a similar        pattern but with some delay The authors also found an inverse relationship between        BMIcholesterol and the share of household expenditure put towards food and a positive        relationship with proportion of population in urban centers which may be due to changes in        patterns of diet and physical activity with city life For blood pressure and cholesterol        possible contributors to the decline at higher levels of income include dietary changes and        use of pharmacological interventions        As more interventions for blood pressure and cholesterol are adopted in highincome        societies the three risk factors will become a feature of lowincome and middleincome        nations the authors say Demographic and technological changes are increasingly modifying        the income patterns of cardiovascular risk factors and shifting their burden to the        developing world as a result lowincome and middleincome countries will simultaneously        face the burden of infectious disease and cardiovascular risk factors Unless better        interventions are pursued we will face a world in which all major diseases are the        diseases of the poor the authors warn See also the Perspective by Thomas Novotny DOI        journalpmed
