        all right now then we should be ready to go with our conversation     all right   what are your preferences   i think i tend to prefer ethnic restaurants rather than steak houses or uh simply American food or or even the southwest food uh frequently we enjoy trying a a new kind of a place and to try to see what their style of food is and what kind of spices and things they use in it so thats what me we mostly do what do you prefer when you go out   oh ive decided theres so many places in Dallas i will not make too many repeats and i thoroughly enjoy the ethnic foods   oh you do   yes certainly course i perhaps would enjoy TexMex and thats uh a good TexMex is awfully hard to beat do you prefer do you care for that flavor   oh yes really very much um i think that the TexMex food has become a kind of a a standard enjoyed food in our home and ive even learned to make a a few things at home myself and thats why i said sometimes when we go out i would       not because i dont like it but because we we tend to like it and even have it at home id rather try something else umhum yeah uhhuh   i i i understand that uh but you dont care for the steaks   im not a big steak or rib or um roast beef eater although to be honest with you at holiday time at Christmas i always buy a a standing prime rib and make some Yorkshire pudding and gravy and totally enjoy it and then can table that for six months to eight months to another year so     uh   yeah   uh and you know were trying not to eat those those big meats also with all of that health consciousness uh believe me were not fanatics in that line but uh if we enjoy other things then well well tend to go that way a nice Chinese once in a while is is very tasty and um we recently went to an Ethiopian restaurant and uh sampled that kind of food rather different but uh have you been to any place lately that you enjoyed   yes i found a little place over in uh Preston Center tonight its uh called oh i dont have the matches now but its a its a   umhum   Cafe au France and they had the its a small place but most delightful i had not been there before   oh oh my   and then i found with a neighbor oh couple a about a month ago this uh Salvadorian   oh   and that is on Six Thirty Five in a i dont think it was Days Inn Motel but this womans son had been there two or three times and their food is excellent   umhum is that right   except for their fried banana now i do not care for that   oh oh my uhhuh   but uh the the other things the seasonings were so appealing     umhum       umhum   oh wait i have a call just a second   okay go ahead     im sorry  i didnt know id have that one come in but anyway   that okay   that was it was very good and very very reasonable   oh good   good service and the things that i look forward to i mean i want to be waited on i dont want to go cafeteria style   right umhum   id rather have them cater to me when im when im patronizing them and   umhum when you go out i umhum i dont blame you i i think thats an important part of relaxing that you dont have to do the work yourself umhum   the only time that i would go against that is would be the Sunday brunches that so many of the places have   oh do you have a preference to a place for Sunday brunch   one that i have enjoyed and had the privilege of eating there New Years Eve night was the Marriott on Six Thirty Five at Coit   oh yes im familiar with that umhum   have you been there to eat   well i have not really been there to have the brunch umhum   well they had a buffet dinner which was very similar
