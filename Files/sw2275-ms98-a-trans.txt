          okay well i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows   okay   and they kind of are in different spectrums i think um one of thems Quantum Leap and the other one is Night Court and i think i think theyre real different i mean i dont think they have anything in common uh Quantum Leap has i mean Quantum Leap is kind of   okay     a comedy in its own way i guess but uh mostly its its kind of science fiction and its um adventure and things like that um and then Night Court is just pure you know weird fun you know just   umhum   its its nothing serious about it at all so i dont know why the two of them happen to be my two favorite shows but they thats the way it is so     its funny that those are my two husbands my husbands two favorite shows too and i enjoy both watching both of them but i used to didnt like Night Court     umhum   and i and the only reason i think i like it now is because ive seen it so much now im involved with the characters but   yeah   i used to think um Dan Fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me  and and i told my husband thats the whole point but  i i just its   he is yeah thats right i mean   i find him degrading at times and i guess that is the point but sometimes it just   well they they really have changed him though if if youve watched it this season um hes becoming i mean he still is in his own way degrading and everything but uh hes involved in that charity and uh its taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has in fact there was one show that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff   oh   and he you know was too depressed you know to so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever but   umhum i i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character i havent watched um   which of course he needed   i think uh yeah i think so  which in Quantum Leap you get even though the the person is involved in so many other peoples lives you still see a a real person in those situations he gets um hes doing amazing things but hes doing them within the bounds of what of normal person would do and i think thats i like that   umhum right right thats thats good point so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows though   um i think my favorite show is Hunter and i i like the old series series better when um   okay Deedee   Deedee was in there yes   yeah i agree   and um so uh and then the the blonde that they took out the one that got killed   yeah i cant remember what her name is but uh   yeah i didnt enjoy her i i she was too much of a opposite of Deedee and i think thats what they try to do but i think we wanted to see Deedee there or somebody like her   umhum well but see i read an article about uh in TV Guide about uh about Hunter and about his latest you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them   uhhuh   and they say that uh that there was absolutely that there was like a a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use i mean you know uh   the second lady uhhuh yeah   yeah the second one the blonde uh you know if you think about it they didnt really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners   they didnt yeah she would go her way and he would do his and i think thats what i didnt like   yeah and uh and and even even at the beginning Deedee and and Hunter   and   would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would do would go this but uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations   umhum   you know like like Hunter was the boss and and this other girl was not and you know you kind of youre wondering you know well when did this happen you know   right   so yeah i i i kind of agree with that   and i like the new lady better but id just as soon that they didnt have the romance there id just as soon have the the police story without all the romance   well im afraid thats what they they really wanted to do um   yeah i think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it and now theyre starting to go back to it and maybe thats what the public wants i dont know but i just   umhum   i like the the cut and dry solve the mystery and thats what i always enjoyed about it   yeah well see there was that spark between Deedee and Hunter for a while but they they like started it and then theyd pull it back and theyd start it and pull it back and that really made it a very interesting   yeah   uh show to where you never really knew which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where theyre going to be real close or whether theyre just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good but um   umhum   you know its it i guess you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they dont you know get together or whatever and so i guess thats what they decide to do   yeah just go ahead and quit the wondering and and   yeah but its its always been a formula uh for TV that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married that the show ends up well you know dying   yeah   a a good example of this and uh you know this is uh probably well maybe its not a good example ive been watching Nickelodeon all last week uh because they had uh what they called Maximum Smart they had Get Smart for uh ten hours a day from seven oclock at night until six or until five oclock the next morning   uhhuh oh   all the Get Smart episodes you could ever see well the the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married and that was i mean that was the killer the series died right after that because well go ahead   umhum yeah i didnt i was going to say i didnt ever watch Moonlighting but i heard thats what killed it that that uh interplay died when they got married and so the show died   umhum the same thing yeah the it it it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know the minute they get married everythings supposed to be cut and dried and   umhum right   and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the characters uh uh personalities um um well especially after they get married um   halfway through yeah yeah   couple of examples would be um well like i said this one about uh Max or Get Well Smart uh the female character uh Barbara Feldon   umhum   she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who everyone always solved the things and and figured out and kept Max from getting real messed up well toward whenever they got married she got dingy   oh   you know why would they do that   yeah   it it made no sense   i im guess its going falling back into our traditional stereotypes which a lot of shows   yeah unfortunately thats probably true   yeah which kind of like in the big soap opera shows which i dont enjoy because of that   umhum   but   well do you watch um what is that show uh Whos the Boss its uh thats on Tuesday nights i think   ive seen it before but i dont watch it regularly usually Tuesday nights im out so   yeah the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it but uh as as ive seen it theyve theyve done sort of the same thing to where theyve they started to let them get together and then they pulled them apart   umhum   and i think theyre thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them uh get together then you lose part of what the shows all about so i always thought that was kind of weird   umhum yeah its funny how we uh we we romanticize people uh like well for instance when i was a teenager you know you romance   umhum   romanticize a rock star but when he gets married then you dont care anymore or something like that and i think its the same with your characters on TV   hum right well do you think thats why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages a secret or at least they keep it quiet   probably yeah i know it affected me when i was younger im not into rock stars too much lately but   yeah i mean yeah now like Madonna and Sean Penn now i dont particularly like either one of them but um   umhum   uh their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together   yeah   uh or at least thats the way i look at it   umhum   so i dont know   it would have been hard wouldnt it   yeah i would think so   i i just the the publicity in and of itself much less the i mean when you get married youve got relationship to develop in the first place so   umhum   having twenty million people watch you do that   yeah its it wouldnt be easy   yeah   so hum well thats kind of interesting   yeah   so um well i guess i guess thats about all we need to do isnt it   yeah i think weve covered our time its been good talking to you   yeah it has Becky i really appreciate it     oh youre the first man ive talked to everybody else has been a female so this is a change   well i think ive um youre the second female ive talked to   youve had a little bit of variety huh  okay  well thanks so much byebye   yeah its its kind of nice so uhhuh byebye
