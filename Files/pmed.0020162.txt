                    Introduction        Twins have long provided a unique opportunity to study how health is shaped from        conception to death by biological and social factors  At issue are        the contributions singly and combined of genetic inheritance in utero postzygotic events        before and after twinning and familial plus societal contexts including the ways in which        twins are treated by family members each other and society at large                To explore these issues one major trend in twin research has focused on comparing        health status of twins raised separately since birth or early childhood         Far fewer studies have investigated how twins raised together        but who differ in their postadolescent socioeconomic position compare on adult health        status  Yet such research could potentially inform current debates over the        contribution of lifecourse socioeconomic conditions to adult health         given twins shared genetic inheritance and early life        socioeconomic plus biological exposures Twins afford an important opportunity to examine        the additional impact of adult experiences on adult health in a population matched on early        life experiences        In particular one important unresolved issue in the burgeoning literature on lifecourse        analysis of health concerns how well early life social circumstances are measured since        this these data are essential for distinguishing between the influence of early life and        adult conditions on adult health status  At issue are the often limited data on        childhood socioeconomic conditions  plus the possibility of systematic error by        adult socioeconomic position when adults recollect their early childhood circumstances         Limited data recall bias and poor measurement together hinder        obtaining accurate effect estimates due to confounding by unmeasured factors This concern        is especially salient for studies investigating the social patterning of health precisely        because living and working conditions influence health through myriad discrete yet        entangled pathways         Further complicating analysis of the impact of childhood and adult socioeconomic        position on health are choices regarding the socioeconomic measures employed         As discussed in several comprehensive review articles         considerable evidence exists demonstrating that different        socioeconomic measureseg education occupation income wealth        housing tenure etcare not simply        exchangeable with each other and instead often yield        different estimates of the magnitude of the socioeconomic gradient and affect health by        independent as well as correlated pathways For example while education has often been        valued as a socioeconomic measure precisely because once achieved it is not subject to        reverse causation eg poorer health leading to lower income it also has been shown to        be insensitive to subsequent changes in adult socioeconomic position eg income        dynamics that also can affect adult health status  An important        implication is that studies concerned with the joint impact of childhood and adult        socioeconomic position on health must take into account how their choice of socioeconomic        measures may influence their results        Of note studies of adult twins and especially monozygotic twins can usefully address        problems of capturing early life circumstances and assessing the contribution of childhood        and adult conditions on adult health This is because monozygotic twins raised together        through childhood a are tightly matched on both genetic endowment and the socioeconomic        circumstances characterizing their gestation and early life and childhood household        resources  and b are the same biological sex so they are likely        to be accorded the same gender expectations and not have differential treatment or access        to household resources because of their gender  Thus even without any measurement        of childhood conditions a comparison of adult monozygotic twins who are concordant versus        those who are discordant on adult socioeconomic position allows ascertainment of the extent        to which socioeconomic position after childhood affects adult health above and beyond the        impact of childhood socioeconomic position Twin analyses employing diverse socioeconomic        measures capturing circumstances earlier versus later in adult life could also potentially        yield insight into the impact of cumulative socioeconomic position on health with        interpretation of results for monozygotic twins including patterns of withinpair        variability aided by comparison to results to samesex dizygotic twins        Thus our objective framed by ecosocial theory and its concern with the lifelong        embodiment of social conditions  was to compare health status among a cohort of        monozygotic and dizygotic women twins with shared upbringing at least until age  and        concordant versus discordant adult socioeconomic position Outcomes included biological        markers anthropometric and health outcomes and health behaviors We employed data on both        adult occupational class and educational level hypothesizing that the former might capture        relevant aspects of socioeconomic position occurring after completion of educational        attainment                    Methods                  Study Population          The study twin pairs were members of the Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study          Examination II conducted in  in Oakland California United          States  The Examination I cohort included  twin pairs recruited in           from a twin registry established in  at the Northern          California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program All participants resided in the San          Francisco Bay Area at the time of Examination I and were born in or prior to  mean          age  y range  y Zygosity for each pair was determined by          analysis of  polymorphic loci such that the probability of misclassification as          monozygous was less than            For Examination II  original cohort members were sent a          selfadministered questionnaire on their health and sociodemographic characteristics plus          an invitation to return for a physical exam  Cohort retention was high Only           women  did not respond of whom  were deceased Among the  respondents only            did not return for a physical exam After additionally excluding five women          whose twin was a nonrespondent the Examination II cohort included  twin pairs           monozygotic and  dizygotic representing  of the original cohort Enrollment and          study of the twins in both cohorts was approved by the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care          Program Northern California Region Institutional Review board analyses for this          investigation were additionally approved by the Harvard School of Public Health Human          Subjects Committee                          Socioeconomic Data          Childhood and adult socioeconomic position were measured at Examination II using a          selfadministered questionnaire We employed a modified version of Erik Olin Wrights          occupational class schema  analogous to the United          Kingdoms newly established National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification system          NSSEC  Distinctions in order of dominance were between persons classified as          nonworking class NWC own a business and employ others          selfemployed or supervisory employees working class          WC nonsupervisory employees or not in the paid labor force                    We defined childhood household social class as the          occupational class position of the person identified as the headofhousehold when the          respondent was age  we also ascertained the proportion of twins who lived together          until at least age  We measured adult household social class using a validated          genderappropriate approach equal to the most dominant class position taking into          account the usual individual class position of the respondent and her partner or other          headofhousehold if any  Using a genderneutral approach to measuring          household class is increasingly recognized as a more valid means of assessing household          socioeconomic position than one which automatically assigns it to either a the          respondent whether a woman or man or b the occupation of the adult man in the          household if one is present given the rise of dual wageearner households           For example the new UK NSSEC          measure explicitly rejects the prior conventional practice of males          taking precedence over females when selecting the          household reference person for assignment of household          class and instead chooses based upon the person responsible for          owning or renting or who is otherwise responsible for the accommodation          regardless of gender  We also obtained data on the educational level attained by          each twin and their father No data were available however on childhood or adult          household income wealth or debt or on the educational level of the mother          Because the twin pairs were matched by definition on socioeconomic position in utero          through age  we categorized twin pairs in relation to adult socioeconomic position          For adult household social class three types of pairs were possible two concordant          both WCWC or NWCNWC and one discordant WCNWC For education the pairs were          defined in relation to being concordant or discordant for fewer than  y versus  y or          more of college                          Health Outcome Data          The selected health outcomes were chosen because of their welldocumented associations          with socioeconomic position and because risk could plausibly be affected by both early          life and adult circumstances  Selfreport data were analyzed for selfrated          health dichotomized as excellentgood versus fairpoor and medication use A validated          intervieweradministered questionnaire was used to obtain data on physical activity kcal          per kg per y this instrument assessed the typical amount of time spent in activities of          varying intensity at home at work and during recreation           Data on anthropometric and biological characteristics were obtained by physical          examination and laboratory analysis  Height was recorded to the nearest  cm          weight was measured to the nearest  kg and these data were used to calculate body          mass index BMI in kgm            Participants minimum waist girth was measured using a steel tape          at the natural indentation or at a level midway between the iliac crests and the lower          edge of the rib cage if no natural indentation was present hip girth was measured at the          level of the greatest protrusion of the buttocks These measurements were recorded to the          nearest  cm and the averages of two measures different by no more than  cm were          used to calculate the waisttohip ratio WHR After participants rested for  min a          mercury sphygmomanometer was used to take two measures each of systolic and diastolic          blood pressure seated right arm averages of these two measures were used for data          analysis High blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure  mm Hg or higher          or diastolic blood pressure  mm Hg or higher or taking antihypertensive          medication          Blood for lipid and lipoprotein measurement was obtained after participants had fasted          overnight It was collected into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA          Total highdensity lipoprotein HDL and lowdensity lipoprotein LDL cholesterol were          measured by standard methods  Glucose level mgdl amount             mmoll measured  h postload was determined using the glucose oxidase method           analyses using data on glucose levels excluded the five twin pairs for whom one or both          twins had values  mgdl or higher                          Data Analysis          First to establish the analytic cohort we identified twin pairs for whom we could          determine both that they had lived together until at least age  and their joint          socioeconomic trajectory           n   pairs This analytic cohort excluded  twin pairs  missing          data on duration lived together one reporting separation prior to age  two where one          twin said below age  and the other age  or above plus  pairs for whom the joint          data on adult household class was either missing inconsistent or not in the labor          force Second we ascertained the retained twins sociodemographic and health          characteristics Third for continuous outcomes we calculated a the mean matched          difference for twin pairs discordant on adult socioeconomic position setting the twin          with the most socioeconomic resources as the baseline so as to determine both the          magnitude and direction of differences in the outcomes among these pairs and b the          mean matched absolute difference for twin pairs in each socioeconomic stratum to          ascertain the variability of outcomes among the twin pairs both discordant and concordant          on adult socioeconomic position Additionally for the categorical outcomes we          calculated the kappa statistic and associated  CI  We do not report data on the           WCWC twin pairs because small numbers rendered the parameter estimates          uninterpretable All analyses were done in SAS                             Results        As shown in Tables  and  the sociodemographic and health characteristics of the full        cohort         n   pairs and the analytic cohort         n   pairs were quite similar with about  having grown up in        working class households and  in households in which the father had less than a y        college education At Examination II  of the twin pairs in the analytic cohort were        discordant for adult household occupational class and  were discordant for individual        college attainment        Results pertain to both the direction and magnitude of the difference in health status        among the twin pairs in relation to both different measures of adult socioeconomic        position and zygosity First regarding the magnitude of health disparities among        monozygotic twins discordant on adult socioeconomic position for the analyses using data        on adult occupational class Tables  and  the WC twin had significantly higher systolic        blood pressure mean matched difference   mm Hg  CI         diastolic blood pressure mean matched difference   mm        Hg  CI  and LDL cholesterol than her NWC twin mean        matched difference   mgdl amount    mmoll  CI         Additionally among the monozygotic twin pairs a greater        proportion of twin pairs discordant on occupational class were discordant for selfreported        health compared to twin pairs concordant on occupational class  versus          p   Poorer health was also more likely to be reported by the        working class twin among the  monozygotic pairs discordant on class the proportion of        pairs in which the WC twin reported fair or poor health while her NWC twin reported        excellent or good health  was almost twice that of the converse  ie pairs        in which the WC twin reported good or excellent health and the NWC twin reported fair or        poor health        By contrast corresponding analyses using data on educational level Tables  and         revealed little difference in patterns of health among monozygotic twin pairs discordant on        educational attainment Dizgyotic twins discordant on adult socioeconomic position whether        categorized by occupational class or educational level likewise did not notably differ on        their adult health status Tables         Second regarding the variability in health outcomes among twin pairs in relation to        their adult socioeconomic position the mean matched absolute difference was similar among        both monozygotic twins who were discordant and concordant on occupational class and also        was similar among dizygotic twins discordant and concordant on occupational class Tables         and  Within occupational class strata however for all the continuous outcomes other        than diastolic blood pressure the magnitude of variability typically was greater for the        dizygotic than the monozygotic twin pairs Tables  and  Similar results were obtained        for analyses based on educational level Tables  and  with some important exceptions        Specifically for several outcomes among the monozygotic twins especially average systolic        and diastolic blood pressure postload glucose and physical exercise variability was        greatest among twin pairs in which both had fewer than  y of college intermediate among        discordant pairs and least among those where both had  y of college or more                    Discussion        Our study provides novel evidence suggesting that correlations in health outcomes among        adult women twin pairs who lived together through childhood vary by their subsequent        socioeconomic position with results sensitive to choice of socioeconomic measure Although        small numbers limit precision of estimates cardiovascular factors differed more among        twins who were discordant on adult occupation class than twin pairs concordant on being        professionals and within twin pairs discordant on occupational class the workingclass        twin typically fared worse than the professional twin These patterns were much weaker or        not evident for analyses using data on educational attainment Together these results        combined with our prior research showing that the twins who experienced cumulative        deprivation had the worst health  lend additional support to the hypothesis that        cumulative experiences across the lifecourse including those after adolescence and after        completion of educational attainment and not just early life experiences shape adult        health         Additionally the greater magnitude of variability in outcomes among dizygotic compared        to monozygotic twins within the same socioeconomic strata is what would be expected given        the tighter matching on genetic endowment among the monozygotic twins         However the suggestive finding of greater magnitude of        variability within both the monozygotic and dizygotic twins among pairs with the least        education compared to the most education especially for the cardiovascularrelated        results has not to our knowledge previously been reported Given that low educational        attainment is highly correlated with low socioeconomic resources during childhood         our results lend tentative support to the hypothesis that        increased variability of physiological traits such as blood pressure may be positively        associated with greater earlylife and cumulative exposure to economic deprivation  A        related body of research suggests that chronic exposure to social stressors associated with        socioeconomic deprivation may result in repeated activationand        ultimately harmful dysregulationof physiological systems that respond        to stress thereby increasing risk of elevated blood pressure insulin resistance and        visceral fat deposition and thus risk of cardiovascular disease obesity and diabetes                Study limitations include a the relatively small number of twin pairs albeit similar        to other twin studies  b lack of data on detailed occupational class position        over time and on age at obtaining a college degree plus prior or current data on income        poverty wealth and debt c lack of data on gestational age birth weight birth order        and whether the twins had shared or separate chorions and amniotic sacs  d        lack of data on differences in the twins childhood experiences and exposures eg        differential treatment accorded to first versus secondborn twins and to monozygotic        versus dizygotic twins  and e lack of data on male twins in addition the small        number of women twins who were concordant on adult working class position limits        generalizability but not internal validity of results Most studies assessing the impact        of childhood socioeconomic position on health however have relied on occupational and        sometimes educational data  reflecting difficulties in        obtaining income data across the lifecourse         By contrast strengths of our study include a biological confirmation of zygosity        b identical gestational age c identical biological sex relevant to gender        expectations and gendered exposures more similar for same versus oppositesex twins         d data on age until which the twins lived together e use of a validated and        genderappropriate household occupational class measure plus data on education and f        measurement of anthropometric and physiologic characteristics not just selfreported        health Moreover by focusing on postadolescence divergence of socioeconomic position the        study avoided concerns affecting comparisons of twins raised separately versus together        eg difficulties in assessing similarities versus differences of the family of origin        versus adoptive family  A recent analysis of United Kingdom twins        earnings in relation to educational level additionally underscores the utility of using        twin analyses to gauge the impact of childhood and adult socioeconomic conditions at the        individual and the household level on adult economic and healthrelated outcomes eg        smoking         Overall results of this study are in accord with other research suggesting that        cumulative exposures related to socioeconomic position not only genetic inheritance and        early life experiences shape adult health         As with our findings these        studies typically have documented the strongest joint impacts for outcomes pertaining to        cardiovascular health  Unlike        prior research however the present study newly employed a samegender twin design        affording comparatively tight matching on life circumstances through early adolescence        with monozygotic twins additionally matched on genetic inheritance thereby circumventing        important concerns raised about likely unmeasured confounders affecting results of prior        studies dependent upon adult recall ofand limited data        onchildhood socioeconomic position Even so generalizability of        results to nontwins could be hampered if twins differ systematically from nontwins on        factors influencing associations between socioeconomic position and adult health as        perhaps related to maternal and zygotic characteristics relevant to risk of monozygotic or        dizygotic twinning or to exposures contingent upon being a twin in utero eg        downregulation of growth         In summary creative use of social and biological twin data concerning both social and        biological aspects of twinship  has the potential to inform        current debates about the impact of lifecourse socioeconomic position on health Suggesting        such investigations could have public health import prior research has estimated that a        reduction of  mm Hg in the average diastolic blood pressure in the United        Statesie about half the difference we observed in the comparison of        working class to nonworking class monozygotic twinswould translate to a         decrease in hypertension a  reduction in coronary heart disease and a  reduction        in risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks  Given the longstanding fascination        with twins  if additional and larger twin studies of        economically diverse women and men twins confirmed the relevance of cumulative and        intergenerational lifetime socioeconomic resources for health and were also able to        include a wider array of socioeconomic measures eg income wealth debt and mothers        education and data on gestational age and birth weight the evidence would likely have        high policy salience plus importantly enhance understanding of how embodiment of societal        conditions shapes population patterns of health disease and wellbeing
