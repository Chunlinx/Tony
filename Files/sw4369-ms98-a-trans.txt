        youre uh can you tell me what you think of capital punishment   yeah um im against capital punishment um   umhum   i i guess theres a cliche that um for every thousand criminals let free if one innocent person is uh killed that thats a terrible thing for the state to be doing and i agree i remember watching a a documentary film a couple of years ago   umhum umhum   ive forgotten the name of it now but it was about a killing in Texas where somebody was sentenced i think it may have been just to life imprisonment but in any event it may have been capital punishment but uh   umhum umhum   this documentarian documentarian or whatever you wanna say um he uh interviewed all the parties involved and basically got another person to admit that he had been the one who had committed the murder i dont know   was that the rape murder of that sixteen year old girl in a school   um no i dont think so it was a i dont remember the circumstances actually i i just remember   there was something like something like that on Sixty Minutes about two years ago   no no this was documentary um it was a a you know in released in theaters i saw it on PBS finally i guess um but any event it was it was very interesting and it   umhum hm hm   you know i guess  they say that you look for views in the media that support your own and  maybe maybe thats the bias here   i dont find very many  that support mine   well whats your um perspective on capital punishment   well actually i mean not not with regard to capital punishment i mean just in general the media um   umhum   uh they take the the the the the average person in the media is far more liberal than the average person in the rest of the country and so uh views that are more conservative just dont get adequately represented in the mainstream media thats been documented by a number of studies but on capital punishment look thats an exception im not conservative on that im sort of middle of the road i i lean against capital punishment but i i wouldnt be an activist on it cause theres so many more important things i think i mean i admit that some innocent people get killed and i believe youre correct that has been documented it happens occasionally and its very that that thats thats quite unfortunate   and theres also the factor that that theres obviously racism in terms of even though certain minorities might commit a higher percentage of crimes than they are represented in the overall population they are also convicted convicted of capital crimes and sentenced to capital punishment at a higher percentage than theyre represented even among criminals so thats   hm well that last caller actually i i  this is the first time ive ever spoken about a topic for the second time but the last caller that i discussed it with didnt   oh really   didnt say you know even that even the the fraction that would be represented among criminals are convicted more often and in fact i just asked him the question is it is it true that isnt it true that minorities you know from people in general people from lower socioeconomic groups tend to commit more violent crime and so wouldnt you expect them to be committed to to be convicted more often   umhum   now i do think i recall seeing some statistics to to the effect that that you that you mentioned um i dont know that you know maybe it was a report a news report i heard or something where i couldnt check it out very carefully where i couldnt i i always tend to read over these things you know especially if you have an interest group that comes up with a study that supports their own position if they did the work i always tend to be a little suspicious of it and that mightve been the Southern Poverty Law Project or something that did that   umhum right i think i dont know   and so i dont know whether i necessarily  whether i wanna give credence to that without looking into it but i do remember hearing that yeah   umhum i think some bar associations um a lot of bar associations are against capital punishment and um this is one area where perhaps theyve done some of the work im not sure   umhum umhum umhum yeah well im i mean i i i agree i think that that the problem with capital punishment is that its irrevocable if you find out you put somebody in jail wrongly you can just let them out if you find out that you you killed somebody wrongly theres nothing you can do to bring them back to life so so thats definitely a problem and um you know  well  were supposed to talk about our state i guess according to the synopsis at the beginning so North Carolina has capital punishment well   right   if if North Carolina didnt have capital punishment i wouldnt try and institute it it it does have capital punishment i dont see that it does any good   umhum   they might convict somebody wrongly sometime thats unfortunate but um  you know farther the fortunate thing really is that that it occurs so rarely uh i think we have about uh maybe one execution or a little bit less a year in North Carolina now i   is that so   i know therere some states like i think Texas is probably the leader in the country im not sure of that but i think it may be is that right   im not sure i think that sounds right offhand but im not positive i i have only recently moved to Kentucky so im not even sure what Kentuckys law is my guess is its probably legal but probably similar to Carolina that its not used very frequently   umhum hm yeah i think that that you know most southern states tend to have capital punishment more than northern states and a state like Minnesota for example i dont know but id be almost sure that they dont have capital punishments Wisconsin Wisconsin the same way   right right right i was living in Illinois before here and im virtually certain that they didnt have it or if they did have it it was never used   hm umhum
