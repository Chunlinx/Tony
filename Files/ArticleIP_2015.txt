                                 Shadow Boxing            The good news for SkyDayton yearold chairman of one of the fastestgrowing companies in theworld is that the Internet is a place where a smart young man can become atycoon overnight The bad news for Sky Dayton is that the Internet is a placewhere anyone with a home computer a modem and some animus can make your lifemiserable and perhaps do real damage to your business The bad news for therest of us is the larger moral of Daytons story The famously egalitarianproperties of the Net have a creepy and oppressive flip side            In Dayton founded an Internet access provider called EarthLink not to be confusedwith The Earthling the name of this column In less than two yearsEarthLinks staff has grown from two to  its annual revenue to more than million and its customer base to  If you research Internet accessproviders youll discover why No company that matches EarthLinks network ofnationwide access points beats its price But if you do your research on theWorld Wide Web youll probably discover something else too a Web pageominously titled earthlinknet and Scientology The Links Subtitle SkyDaytons Scientology Training            With EarthLink preparing for its first public stockoffering this is not good publicity On the Net the Church of Scientology isthe antichrist It slaps lawsuits on church critics who post quotes fromcopyrighted church documents sometimes getting federal marshals to searchhomes and seize computer disks Theres no evidence that the church currentlyuses extralegal weapons against online criticspries into their email sayStill among the desirable qualities of an Internet access providerthecompany whose computers all your email and cyberwanderings passthroughChurch of Scientology affiliated does not rank high                           Is EarthLink Church ofScientology affiliated Apparently not but well get to that later Firstnote that this isnt just another case of accusations speeding across the Nethopping from newsgroup to newsgroup eg last years rumor that Mrs Fieldshad supplied free cookies for OJ Simpsons acquittal party Theres asubtler dynamic at work here a property not of the Net at large but of the Webin particular This dynamic will affect more of us as the Web grows and morepeoples reputations are mediated there On the Web anyone can construct akind of shadow identity for anyone elsenot just an unkind characterizationbut an unkind characterization that sticks to your cyberidentity likeglue            Supposefor example that some business heavyweight is pondering a business deal withSky Daytonor is just curious about him having met him at a cocktail partyShe revs up a Web search enginesay Alta Vistaand types in Sky Dayton andEarthLink And there it is on the first page of listings earthlinknet andScientology The Links As long as this shadow page contains key words thatare in Daytons home page and EarthLinks home page it will be seen by almosteveryone who finds either of those pages through a search engine This is thecyberspace equivalent of hanging a sign around someones neck sayingScientologistor child molester bedwetter whatever Except that in thephysical world the victim can remove the sign Shadow pages in contrast areindelible            Sky Dayton is victim of an oftapplauded trendAs copying and transmitting data get cheaper the distribution of power growsmore equal After publishing technology evolved from its scribblingmonks phaseto its Gutenberg phase a form of power once dominated by popes and other bigshots was diffused and the Reformation happened Now the power overreputations is passing from magazines radio stations and so on towell toeverybody            It can be fun watching theDavids take on the Goliathsthe Kmart sucks web page for example authoredby the guy who ran Kmarts own web page until Kmart fired him Mistake Butremember Kmart could be you You may doubt that someday youll have a Webpage but you may also have doubted two years ago that someday youd needemail Your cybertormentor could be a nutcase former client an enviousformer colleague an aggrieved exspouse or exlover Their technologicalempowerment may take some of the thrill out of your own empowerment On theWeb every man can be presidentand every woman Gennifer Flowers Note togender police You know what I mean            Of courseyou can always shadow your shadow identity with a rebuttal so that people whosee the charges against you also see your reply When I mentioned this to alegalscholar friend he joyously declared cyberspace a perfectly efficientinformation market His apparent assumptionthat bringing all relevantinformation to bear on an issue fixes Truth in the minds of observersreflectsa touchingly prepostmodern view of human objectivity Alas the news fromevolutionary psychology is less touching Natural selection did not in factdesign our brains to apprehend Truth Our moral evaluations of people are oftensubordinate by design to our social agendas and as a result our wholemachinery for appraising other people is gunked up with unconscious bias            Anyway Sky Dayton faces something more elusive than liesIts true that hes a Scientologist like John Travolta Chick Corea etc Ipractice my personal right to choose my own beliefs he says Some of theshadow pages other specific claims also are true But theres no evidencethat as the shadow page intimates EarthLink is an arm of the church Thecompanys CEO is Southern Baptist and its chief financial officer is RomanCatholic Scientology is a large religion says Dayton If I were to ask youif because you were a Jew your company was owned by the state of Israeleverybody would laugh at me            In a way truthful shadowpages are the scariest of all As many have noted these days much of yourprivate life is vulnerable to intrusion Email is less secure than snailmail or a phone call Most financial transactions dont involve cash and arethus recorded Your wanderings on the Web leave more footprints than you mayrealize            Much of this vulnerabilitymay eventually be neutralized by encryption and other tricks But until thentechnology will in some ways be pushing us backward in time The Net thoughcelebrated as a libertarian institution can also be the opposite It can be abit like a claustrophobic small town where your private life is part of thepublic dialogue Winesburg Ohio like cyberspace was a perfectly efficientinformation market
