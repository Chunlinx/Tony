        one of the hardest things in finding child care is deciding to let go what do you think     now what do you mean by letting go   well like going back to work and uh it seems like parents have a very difficult time especially mothers have a very difficult time in uh finding someone well first off in going back to work they uh with the little babies and then then finding someone that satisfies them   umhum right right well um gosh my kids are older now so i feel like that that my uh choices are are different now when i first   umhum yes   when i first went back to work uh youre right i i wanted to have somebody who came into the house and who performed you know certain functions and that closeness and i noticed that as the older they got   umhum   you know the less and less picky i got about that um uh that criteria   umhum   uh but you know now uh you know i wish there was somebody not so much to babysit the kids but tutor them in homework  really really so but   oh yeah and help help with the housework a little bit the the best one i ever had was uh when i had only one child and uh was an infant and it was an older woman and she came to the house and uh she had noon meal cooked and my husband and i came home and ate and everything   umhum oh see that wouldve been wonderful   well of course it was extra special for us because he was a student and i had to work so uh that really helped   umhum uhhuh uhhuh oh yeah yeah yeah those uh those people who can uh stay you know home and and take care of the kids and uh you know do that i think are really special people   umhum   um so you just dont find that anymore um even now the the day cares though are so expensive   oh yes   that um i dont know how parents afford them uh   i dont either well a lot of mothers have had to quit work because of that   right right   you get one or two children one child and could be fifty to seventy five dollars a week   oh yeah i   and then you get two and it just multiplies   umhum yeah i i think its gone up to like a hundred dollars a week and depending on on what age they are   oh yeah   and uh you know if you want quality day care to where they have uh not only just their meals taken care of those basic necessities but also uh their education too   thats true study time and uh if they watch television its educational only or you know monitor that dont just turn them loose on it   umhum because umhum oh yeah oh yeah so its a i i think its changed over the years um but you know i found uh like i said they at least when my kids were growing up that uh it was harder especially companies didnt have programs to where they would help you find babysitters yeah   oh no huhuh you found someone in the neighborhood if you were lucky yeah   umhum  thats right thats right and  umhum   it have you had any experience with people who have chosen nannies     no no but you know ive read um you know some stories uh about that and uh so now now i dont do you know of anybody   umhum well im i do the kind kind of work we we do medical checkups on some who are going to be nannies and the criteria theyre using are they want they they require them to have certain blood tests and   umhum umhum   as well as their educational requirements and   umhum   the one nannies ive talked to who bring the children in are very very uh oh enthusiastic about what theyre doing with them and   umhum umhum   um they present themselves well but thats as as close as ive come to them   yeah yeah no i had just you know read in a uh oh i dont know the the want columns um but i guess when i had thought about it since ive been a single parent for so long that uh you know i wished i had the money for something like that   umhum umhum oh yes   because of the special um oh i dont know the um the special closeness that bond thats formed versus taking them to a day care where they just theyre one of many children   right   yeah so thats a thats to me its extra special   well the only i think the one good thing about day care of course im in the grandchildren age and one of my grandchildren needed the day care because he needed to the other   umhum   uh other uh younger children he needed to learn to share   sure sure   he was uh his mother couldnt get two feet from him   right right   and uh theyre hoping that that helps on that course that may be just the age   yeah it it could be age but you know i i can never regwet regret uh the children uh going through that day care experience because they learned so many things uh such as responsibility independence   umhum umhum   uh you know that sharing i mean there are a lot of good things i i know theres a lot of drawbacks to women going back to to work   umhum   but um i think there was so many positives that that i saw   yes   um that i i really didnt have that much guilt about it   well good good course what really helps is when you know you have to right   yeah that made it real easy  but i i
