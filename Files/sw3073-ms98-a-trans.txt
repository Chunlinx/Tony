        okay im back on     okay     um you say you watch evenings mostly   i watch evenings because i work all day i used to watch daytimes um mainly like All My Children that kind of thing     umhum oh so   and then sometimes Oprah and sometimes Donahue but now its mainly evenings   do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when youre not going to be there   yes   which ones   i tape Thirty Something and L A Law those are the two i like the best   oh thats a oh two theyre going to change well one theyre taking off i dont know whats going to happen yeah we like L A Law we dont watch Thirty Something but thats kind of young for us my husband and i are grandparents so we dont watch uh   i know its going to be history i know uhhuh oh well well   that type of show but we like L A Law we like that were just im sorry theyre breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there   uhhuh i know im amazed   im not sure i like the new ones too much   huhuh im surprised that i was surprised at the ending of you know with all the funny things happening and different things   i just wonder if if uh they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show since its gone on for so long it looks like it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things   uhhuh uhhuh   where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show of course i guess thats not bad Alan Alda did it on MASH and   i know i know isnt that funny   it hasnt hurt him at all so do you do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour   oh i dont usually like stuff that continues thats why im surprised i like those two shows because usually i like you know stuff that just ends sort of that you just you dont have to have watched you know   in one hour like Quantum Leap  thats one of our favorites   yeah i mean you dont have to yeah you dont have to have watched it last week in order to follow so   right which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention   you know i usually dont like that uhhuh   yeah thats always a bummer too sometimes its better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one   i know uhhuh   we we do that sometimes i i guess im im not into real heavy stuff L A Law is about the heaviest thing i watch i ill mostly im into it for relaxation   yeah yeah   so i like things like Golden Girls or Cheers or uh Monday night is real good with me you know Major Dad and and uh uh Northern Exposure and and uh oh whats that one with Burt Reynolds that type of show is what we what uh we watch we generally just stay on one channel all for all of Monday night just to watch those   uhhuh   just uh some of the times theyre continued but mostly theyre just little vignettes a new one we found we really like is that Dinosaurs have you seen that that is its its really funny they use   huh   like animated its not like a cartoon but its like dummies and things that are used and uh its really um and robots probably but uh theres always a a moral to each story   uhhuh and what night is it on   well you we watched it the times weve seen it its been like on Saturday or excuse me Friday night uh but its weve only seen it a couple of times but it its real the first one we saw um uh they were uh it it involved a tradition of when a person person reaches seventy five uh and i cant remember what day they call it but but uh the soninlaws get to throw the motherinlaws when theyre seventy five over a cliff  anyway   oh great   anyway it it goes on you know and the soninlaw and motherinlaw are sniping at each other and all and then when it comes time for him to throw her over well the the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her   oh   and she said no you cant do you know he ran her out was running to hide in a wheelchair to hide her and she said you cant do that uh this is   huh   tradition this is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the the cliff and uh he said i dont understand its its real funny that they give the teenagers the as the one that questions um the whats going on and uh in the end of uh the soninlaw when he did get the motherinlaw up to the cliff uh   uhhuh   the the son the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says no you cant do it and then and then uh oh well weve got to do it its tradition and the son was you know why and so in in the end he doesnt throw her over and of course the town thinks hes just terrible   uhhuh oh he doesnt   because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and hes broken it and then we saw one where this there was a teenage when a boy teenage boy comes into his manhood they call it the night of the howling or something like that and they all go out and howl you know   umhum     and and the son refused to do it he he did he thought it was not no he wouldnt go howl so all the all the people that worked with the father ostracized him   so he didnt go howl oh how funny   it is it it its its real interesting to watch the show and and what the relationship between the family is is really now the motherinlaw   huh   now the motherinlaw lives in the house with them so its our our grandson our oldest grandson is the one that that got us to watching it but it really is       it moves real fast its a real short and theres always like i say a moral to it and right half hour that thats all there is to it and and uh they   its just a half hour or is it hour oh theres not many half hour shows it seems like that much   yeah its it they theyre trying to liken the the father in there of the teenage son to like Jackie Gleason Show uh   uhhuh   the way he talks to his motherinlaw and so forth and i guess maybe there are some parts of that but i didnt really see that in there but what ive read about it they talk about that but anyway weve weve enjoyed that and and uh i guess mostly i i like the news shows too and the news magazines like Sixty seconds Minutes or Twenty Twenty or   yeah no i watch those if i around   Prime Time Live or something like that you know all all of those shows if i if i can do it but my husband likes to watch uh old movies especially war movies or or uh sports which im not   oh see i like sports   no i dont well i i do i like ice skating and i like uh gymnastics   umhum   and some track and field but i i and ill watch snippets of baseball games and i i just dont have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing   uhhuh   and i dont ever no matter whats on i dont ever just sit and watch TV im usually either doing dishes or i may be sewing or you know i always have or letter writing or i may be working around in the room somehow but i dont   i know   i dont ever just sit and i thats something that comes from your old age you know idle hands are the devils workshop no its its uh   no i dont sit i know who has time i dont have time to sit i know thats why i dont get to watch that much i mean i watch nine oclock i do okay because the kids are all in bed but before that i really theres not much time or like at six thirty ill watch Wheel of Fortune or something like that   right right right well our yeah if our grandchildren if our grandchildren are with us thats they have to watch that we dont watch it unless theyre here  but they uh   uhhuh no i like that no ill watch game show kind of stuff but   its its um oh and you know the the kids will get you started on stuff like Americas Funniest Home Videos  weve wound up sending in one thats something i didnt think that wed ever do   yeah did you send one   yeah our oldest grandson pulling his tooth hes hes he wouldnt let us pull it and i mean it it got to the point he was eating a pear here and he bit into it and it was just hanging by a thread   how funny   and i and id tell him you know its getting ready to fall out and he walked around the house with his face face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldnt let anybody pull it   uh     and he wound  he wound up pull
