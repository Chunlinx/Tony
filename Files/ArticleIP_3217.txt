                                 My Panel Discussion With Andre            Who is Wallace Shawnexactly Hes been around for years yet its still hard to know In artycircles hes famous as the highbrow exhibitionist who wrote and starred inMy Dinner With Andre  but theres more to Shawn than grandiose nerdangst Millions of small children around the country could pick him out in alineup Theyd know him as the dotty character actor from massappeal filmslike The Princess Bride and Clueless a guy who unlike theearnest playwright Shawn appears to have stopped taking anything in lifeseriously least of all himself On the contrary he hams up his resemblance toa clown and wheezes for laughs and presumably a paycheck            Shawndoesnt appear in this film based on his latest play but his schizoid spirithaunts it all the same The Designated Mourner is one of those soberingallegories set in the notsodistant future in a country not unlike our ownThe actors deliver lots of brooding speeches and the plot is a downer On theother hand the star is Mike Nichols in his firstever film appearance andwith a sneering comic timing that has somehow improved in the odd yearssince he stopped performing with Elaine May            Nichols plays Jack a shrewd middleaged pragmatist Yearsago in college Jack impulsively married smart but prissy Judy MirandaRichardson unaware that by doing so he was entering a stifling ivory towerAt the time Judys father Howard David de Keyser was one of the countrysleading intellectuals He was a great man but also a jerk he surroundedhimself with suckups and expected his daughter to wait on him hand and footFor a while Jack admired Howards strong convictions and his abilityapparently rare in this bleak hypothetical future to understand the poetry ofJohn Donne But one day Jack admitted to himself that he didnt give a damnabout art or poetry that Howard got on his nerves and that anyway hed fallenout of love with Judy Relieved he left her and her clique behind            DirectorDavid Hare has preserved the nofrills setup of the stage production he oversawin London It makes sense that the London production was more successful thanthe American one and that the director and two of these three actors in thefilm are English Since when in America have we really obsessed over the fateof intellectuals The play unfolds in monologues with Jack making a wittycase for his desertion of Judy then Judy speaking then Howard then back toJack and so on the three of them sit at a long table and talk into thecamera occasionally pouring themselves glasses of water as panelists at aconference do The drama comes from the way Shawn craftily shifts your sympathyback and forth among characters Just when Jack has you convinced that Judy isa pretentious albatross Richardsons very British cluckingtongue routinehelps here Judys stock rises as she stoically describes how the intolerantnew government had begun to crack down on her and her father Then slowly itbecomes clear that the government is going to do worse than harass theintellectuals And you realizeor youre supposed to realizethat howeverarrogant and annoying you find Judy and Howard some bottomline human decencywill be violated if they are harmed            The writing is ostentatiously literary and Iexpect that although a hardcore band of fans will praise The DesignatedMourner for condemning the vulgarian times we live in a larger group willthink its just more intolerable hooey from that highbrow exhibitionist Itsactually better than hooey but its also a hopelessly conflicted piece ofwork The whole conception of the intellectual life feels dated The film isset in the future but its grasp of malefemale relations harks back to thes or earlier Judy starts off as a virgin then becomes a servant to betraded back and forth by the men Later when Jack casts off the brainylifestyle he becomes a porn addict In the Shawnian scheme of things being ornot being an intellectual would appear to be an issue only for men as if theonly thing that kept them from humping everything like craven dogs was afondness for sonnets Then theres the problem of whats killing theintellectuals off They are themselves partly to blame because theyre suchinsular snobs But the big villain is a powermad government whose only agendaseems to be hunting down and killing smart people Shawn has been vocal abouthis belief that theater should be more political but this government ofphilistine meanies seems more like a cheap device designed to give his playsome tension All hes really telling us is Beware of people with badtaste            Besidesbeing anachronisms the intellectuals are underwritten and deliberatelyunattractive Its Jack who hogs all the energy as if Shawn the highbrowsketched out a play and Shawn the clown took over the writing And Nichols whospecializes in proof irony is the clowns ideal front man With hisflushed and blotchy skin his narrow feminine nose his gaptoothed grin andhis eyebrows that rise to meet each other like sides of a triangle Nicholslooks like a scary blend of Hugh Hefner and Alfred E Neumann Hes charismaticand monstrous In what must be one of the greatest nasal performances of alltime he rasps and chuckles and seduces us into thinking that hes a detachedbut basically trustworthy guyour friendly narrator Then out of the blue hecalls Judy a stupid bitch and we realize hes missing a soul            And yet before he turns completely sour Jack makes apretty unbeatable case for leaving the cloister Once he gets away from Howardand Judy and their overserious isolated friends he discovers a kind ofpeace He realizes how noisy and restless his mind has always been an endlesstinkling of reportage and commentary He sees how hes always trying tosqueeze everything into conceptsthis is Beautiful that isntinstead oftaking in life as it is He experiences silence for the first time and findsout that its all right Sounds a little like Buddhism But still the segmentof the movie in which Jack begins testing what it would be like to live in thepresent is funny and original Up to this point the audience has been watchingwith the spacedout slightly bored respect one feels when confronted by amedieval Flemish altar piece But when Jack starts making fun of all theirrelevant thoughts that clog his brainI like poetry I like Rembrandt murmur murmur murmur murmurwe wake up recognizing the sound of our owninner babble            For a moment Shawn climbsoff his high horse and the movie breathes Then the moment passes and itbecomes clear that all he wants to do is wag his finger at the knownothingsThe last intellectuals die off and Jack heads directly for the gutter Towardthe end Shawn has him place a volume of John Donne in the bathtub and pee andshit on it Were supposed to mourn for Howard for Judy for Jacks soul andeven for poor harmless John Donne But its tempting to say goodriddance
