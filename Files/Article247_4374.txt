                                 Big Is Beautiful            When AOL and Time Warner announced their merger the nations mediareporters autodialed the usual critics of media conglomeration Richard AMcChesney Tom Rosenstiel Ben Bagdikian and Mark Crispin Miller Theircollective complaint known to every reader of The Nation  was duly recordedMedia conglomeration is bad for journalism and society            Its a business thing McChesney said in the New York Times  Goodjournalism is bad business and bad journalism is regrettably at times goodbusiness In the Miami Herald  Bagdikian fretted that AOL Time Warnersdevotion to the bottom line would injure democracy Rosenstiel warned theWashington Post of the conflicts of interest posed by the purchaseMiller told NPR that the new conglomerate would stuff Warner Bros movies downour throats via AOL            The McChesneyite critique of big media misses the longterm trend thatstarted with Gutenberg and is accelerating with the Internet As informationprocessing becomes cheaper so does pluralism and decentralization which comesat the expense of entrenched powersgovernment the church the guildnobility and the magazines and TV stations that Big Media God Henry Lucefounded Do McChesney and company think we were better off in  when therewere three TV news networks than we are today when there are six or eightBetter off before the New York Times and Wall Street Journalbecome national newspapers Before FM radio and cable Evidentially soMcChesney obsesses about the nine global media companies but as this Columbia Journalism Review page shows there arethree dozen big media companies in the United States alone            Critics of big media suffer from the Fallacy of the Golden Era They thinkthings were better in the past but they never specify the status quo to whichthey want us to ante Was small really small enough to be beautiful in when William Randolph Hearst ran the headline How Do You Like theJournal s War How about  when the White House press corpsignored the presidents infirmities and poor health Or the s when ScottyReston carried official Washingtons water            From my vantage point this is journalisms golden agewe just have a hardtime detecting its luster because golden ages always shine more brightly from adistance Another thing that tarnishes modern journalism is the recentproliferation of media critics who bring brisk scrutiny to every ethicallapse Editors and reporters of  years ago got a free ride compared withtodays journalists            As for McChesneys good journalism is bad business formula I can onlyoffer a horse laugh Only a fool would say that the New York Times  theWall Street Journal  the Los Angeles Times  and the WashingtonPost havent paired editorial quality with financial success Nor doesMcChesney acknowledge that as USA Today has become a better paper ithas become more viable as a business Truth be told the anticonglomerateconglomerate seems less vexed by conglomerate meddling in journalismtheLos Angeles Times  Staples Center scandal Time s decision to putPokmon a Warner Bros release on its cover and Rupert Murdochscapitulation to the Chinese who wanted the BBC off his satellitethan by theultraevil the media conglomerates might do in the future            Essentially the McChesneyites have four beefs  Consolidation reduces thenumber of voices Thats true only if you rig the tally as McChesneydoes  Global consolidation promotes cultural imperialism Culturalimperialism isnt always bad and new technology makes it easier for smallcultures to export their voices  The more the press acts like abusiness the less attention it pays to its civic functions See theprevious note on golden ages   Big media treats its audience likeconsumers not citizens Like WTO critics the McChesneyites hate anythingthat doesnt conform to their idea of democracy                        The critique of big media invariably romanticizes small independentnewspapers But for every Emporia Gazette edited by a William AllenWhite theres a Manchester Union Leader piloted by a William Loeb As areader I care more about the newspaper I read than who owns it Most oftodays independents are familyoperated companies blighted by the biologicallaw of regression to the mean which dictates that heirs are rarely as brightor motivated as founders look at the San Francisco Chronicle  So letsnot reflexively mourn the gobbling of small media by big media            Small independently owned papers routinely pull punches when covering localcar dealers real estate and industry to whom they are in deep hock Thechains that buy up the Podunk Banner s dont necessarily do a betterjournalistic job look at Gannett but theyre not as beholden to the localpowers that be as the independents are Whats more if the ownersindependent or corporate of the Podunk Banner flinch from a storyabout contaminated groundwater or police brutality the big media New YorkTimes or  Minutes can parachute in and do the story without fearor favor Hurrah for big media            Whatever its shortcomingsand they are manyonly big media possesses themeans to consistently hold big business and big government accountable In thes Exxons brass visited the Wall Street Journal s top editors tocomplain about the papers coverage According to a reporter who was presentExxon suggested that it might have to pull the companys advertising from theJournal in protest At that point Executive Editor Fred Taylorresponded I didnt know advertising was one of Exxons philanthropicactivities The Exxon threat proved hollow As big as it was it couldnt hurtthe Journal  How would the Podunk Banner have fared against asimilar threat from the area Chevrolet dealer            If you dont believe big media has a leg up in making government behave trythis Call Attorney General Janet Renos office Say that youre from thePodunk Banner and that you want to talk to her about some new policyThen make a similar call posing as a reporter from the Washington Post I neednt ask which call would get returned            Fundamentally the McChesney brigade worries more about AOL Time Warnerspulling journalistic punches than about any lost independence Rememberthey werent Time Warner fans prior to the AOL deal But theyexaggerate the propaganda power of Time Warner media Not even a cover rave inTime for Eyes Wide Shut a Warner Bros releasecould turn thatplodding movie into a hit By the way I believe the rave was genuine and notginned up to sell tickets Any sustained effortconscious or unconsciousbya media conglomerate to slant the news in favor of its holdings will onlydamage the longterm value of its journalistic properties Bad press is bad foranybody but bad press is worse when its directed at the press as Disneylearned when it killed a story by its ABC News subsidiary that criticizedsafety at Disney theme parks Disney would have been better off letting thenegative story run            Some would have big media erect Fifth Columns within their walls butnavelgazing doesnt automatically impress as the TimesMirror flagship LosAngeles Times learned after publishing a word selfexamination onthe Staples Center scandal One prominent critic called the story awhitewash What damaged the Los Angeles Times most after the initialrevelations seeped out from an alternative weekly that didnt exist  yearsago its worth noting was the beating it took from other big media Big mediastrives to be ethical for the same reason big government and big business doNew technology prevents it from controlling information the way it used to andbeing exposed by others hurts too much            Media conglomeration runs in cycles so the fish currently progressingthrough the bellies of the media kings may not stay there for long In the media hysterics prophesied the end of literature when conglomerates boughtthe familyowned book publishers for their synergy RCA snared Random HouseITT took BobbsMerrill CBS bought Holt Rinehart Winston and other houses Afew years later RCA ITT and CBS abandoned their synergy plans and soldtheir book divisions Good publishing survived RCA Good journalism willsurvive AOL                           Full disclosure I draw my paycheck from Microsoft which coowns MSNBCwith General Electric
