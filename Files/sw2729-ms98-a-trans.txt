              okay what kind of puppy you got   well uh i think shes mostly German Shepherd uh she was uh uh a person lives across the street from me uh brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep somebody somebody abandoned her and shes only about oh six between six and eight six to eight weeks old   uh umhum oh   and uh uh i cant understand why anyone would abandon this dog though shes almost i mean shes that this young and shes almost housebroken   wow   i mean she actually asks to go out and uh yeah i was   thats great   amazed       really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality i dont know i cant imagine what uh would have been wrong with this dog so   yeah well i i have a dog that God gave us too   uhhuh   yeah she just appeared   oh really   yeah my husband calls her street dog but weve had her now for about three years and i just you get so attached to them   uhhuh oh yeah i had a uh last year i had another i had another German Shepherd now this one was purebred and uh he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on deaths door but uh managed to get him to a veterinarian in time and uh and on huge doses of antibiotics and   umhum um   he actually got over it with huh seven hundred dollars in vet bills   wow   um but he had actually was able to get him over that and then   umhum   and then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy and uh he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a Cadillac   oh no   so i couldnt believe it that was that was really hard but   oh gee   and that was even harder for i was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street so they just felt absolutely awful   umhum oh i bet   and i felt felt probably worse for them than than for me because oh gosh they the uh this fellows wife who was uh watching the dog probably she i think she loved that dog more than i did and uh   oh gosh   she was just really attached to it but uh its its unfortunate but now ive got another one so   yeah yeah how long has it been since the first one   um see he it it was just over a year uh it was in March of last year   uh yeah   so um yeah itd been didnt didnt have one for a whole year   yeah well i had i had a German Shepherd before this one and when she died it just it just i absolutely destroyed me i mean i was just  you know i couldnt even talk about it for months and so i decided well thats it im not going to do this anymore   yeah right   and then God gave me this dog so   my dads like that he uh he had a beagle that he loved and uh when that Beagle passed away uh he didnt want he wasnt going to have another dog theres no way no how and then uh the   umhum   he the Beagle died in i guess about October and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him uh or i  Humane Society and got uh got another one a stray and   yeah   she she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing but   okay yeah well you just do you cant help its like its like a kid   mom went and yeah yeah it is well hopefully this one here Cocoa will live a full life   yeah well when uh my my doggy uh that we have now uh shes shes mostly Golden Retriever   uhhuh   the vet called her uh a golden mix  like who knows you know but shes uh shes that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color you know   yeah right oh   and uh and her nose is that pink   umhum   you know she doesnt have a brown nose and her eyes shes sort of unicolor you know eyes are the same color and everything so   yeah   i named her Rosebud   huh   and uh a friend of mine said she that she grew this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had uh a pet cow named Rosebud and she said theres a lot of longevity in that name said my cow lived seventeen years     thats not too bad  the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too theyre kind of like get that permanent smile to them   yeah right   theyre always always happy i dont think ive ever seen them not look happy   and shes so easy going and so sociable   yeah   you know she loves everybody little kids can just you know maul all over her and she just you know   right this   thinks its great   this this friend of mine has the well its the same guy that was watching uh my German Shepherd when he got hit but uh went fishing with him on Friday and took hes got a full a pure bred Golden Retriever and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing and this they just they had a ball romping around and you know you cant get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in   uhhuh getting in yeah   and uh this Golden Retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh   oh no   well no actually he had no trouble at all he first jumped in and i hes hes just about a year old himself and never had really i dont think hed swum before but he jumped in in the the river   really did puppy go to   well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the i was careful to keep her away from the   oh thats good yeah   the fast moving water because if she fell in then id of been had to go in after her       and up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now   ewe ewe   and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but uh this dog Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as hes floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh       actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he       he jumped in again and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon he loved it   yeah   Cocoa didnt think too much of it though she jumped in and then started screaming and uh made me pull her back out       i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad and   yeah   so but she got over it so   well the German Shepherd that i had before we we had a little pool   uhhuh   and uh she was she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to to get in the pool on the first step shed just get on the first step and lay down   uhhuh   you know in the summertime when its really really hot   yeah   and shed just lay there on that step and just you know cool off   yeah ive i live right across the street from a a big lake here um its on Oneida lake and im wondering if uh if shell want to go out there and go swimming next year i mean ive got the yards all fenced in so she doesnt run loose but uh   umhum yeah   she could go in sometime when if im watching her something   yeah   but uh   well the one that we had just didnt want any part of that   oh really   yeah and she oh baths oh gee she hated baths worse than anything it was it was just really a fight to you know get her clean   yeah   have you seen uh Canine   no no   the movie oh youve got to see it especially since you have a German it is so cute   oh really   yeah and uh an part of the the movie is where hes trying to clean this dog up and its its just hysterical   oh okay my my dog last German Shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too and that was the thing i couldnt figure out because he would go in the lake it wasnt like he didnt ah   umhum   normally i mean he didnt seem to have a problem with getting wet but if you wanted to get him wet forget it   yeah well thats how Cleo was you know shed lay on her step   yeah   but that was that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didnt want you getting her wet   right right obstinate obstinate   yeah but you really need to see that movie i i we we bought the movie and i dont i dont know how many times ive seen it and it came on TV the other night and i was watching it
