                                 Mails of the Species            Id like to have been onthe set of Sleepless in Seattle  when Nora Ephron directed thescene in which a mistyeyed Meg Ryan spies on Tom Hanks as he frolics on abeach with his little son It felt as if Ephron were standing offcamera with amegaphone shouting OK Tom frolic More frolic Nowromp OK gambol Inlife Ephron is evidently incisive but she doesnt have a good directorsinsight into the minutiae of human interaction Shes the opposite of a detailperson Almost all the scenes she writes and stages are blandly generalizedahomogeneity that seems part commercial cunning her movies go down easy likeMuzak and part the result of being rich and snobbishly insulated on the UpperWest Side of New York City that magic kingdom where people parade theirliberalism but the word Brooklyn is always good for a laugh and ashudder                           Youve Got Mailwhich she cowrote with her sister Delia is based on Ernst Lubitsch andSamson Raphaelsons The Shop Around The Corner  one of the mostenchanting comedies ever made Its a classic setup Two people work side byside and cant stand each other butunbeknownst to eitherare pen pals DearFriend who pour out their hearts in prose When I went online in the earlys the first thing I thought and posted in a chat group was Oh nowsomeone will remake The                Shop Around the Corner withemailwhich I mention to spotlight not my prescience but the obviousness ofthe idea It came to me while watching a pretty young woman in a San Franciscocybercafe who seemed to have a wonderful funny flirtatious personality onlineI was in a position to read some of what she was typing but who logged offand buttoned up her coat without looking left or right and hurried into thestreet as if afraid that someone might actually speak to her            The story works better when set in a society with a cleargulf between public behavior and private feelingsa society rather unlike ourown in which the two are increasingly interchangeable Ephron has diluted thedrama even more by making her cyberchums Hanks and Ryan friendlydowntoearth and adorable not at all the sorts whod save their true selvesfor their electronic epistles There is conflict but its surface Hanks JoeFox is the heir to the vast Fox Books read Barnes  Noble whichrelishes the process of opening superstores

America Online actually which has beenflacking this picture for months they are Shopgirl and NY and areconstantly shoring each other up Joe even gives Katherine tips on how to lockhorns with her unnamed adversary            One of the best thingsabout Lubitschs original is that its AustroHungarian kitschladen universeNikolaus Laszlos original play was set in a Budapest perfumery barelyconceals real economic desperation and there are serious consequences when thetwo lovers clash and one of them gets fired In the world of Youve GotMail  the heroine might lose her shop but she gets to keep her Upper WestSide apartment and to continue to frequent Zabars and Starbucks and heremployees are happily hired by the competition The movie without seeming torealize it turns into a romantic parable about the joys of being absorbed by aconglomerate Why its lovers never even get a busy signal when they dialAOL            Y ouve Got Mail gets better as it gets morerelaxed and the famous cafe scenein which the man discovers in horror whohis correspondent really isremains surefire Ephron does well at evoking theways in which email and snail mail diverge the former being so much moreimpulsive and exhibitionist And I loved how Ryan flinched when the screendisplayed an instant message from NY Hes actually there in real time Tooclose But where The Shop Around the Corner had a matrix ofrelationships Ephron reduces Youve Got Mail to its two leads Joe andKatherine have featherweight significant others Parker Posey Greg Kinnearwho can be discarded at the narratives convenience without muss or fuss Theother characters are just friends to be talked at You dont even get a sensethat the rest of the world uses email            The director clearlyadores Ryan but shes the actresss worst enemy goading her into ever moresickening reaches of chinwagging cutenesssuch as her fatuous look ofenchantment on the subway or the furtive little hiphops to her laptop afterher Luddite boyfriend has left for the office Hanks does better Its nice tosee him playing a selfserving wisenheimer in a light comedy He lookscarewornAIDS Vietnam malfunctioning space capsules and Omaha Beach will dothat to youbut his timing is still amazing His wisecracks sound as if hesnervously thinking them up on the spot and hes better than anyone at sayingsomething he doesnt mean and then wincing in horror as if longing to hit theDelete key            Martin Cahill Brendan Gleeson the protagonist of JohnBoormans marvelous almostcomedy The General  is a gangster in theflamboyant movie tradition of movie mobsters who smile at the bullets that endtheir lives They arent heroes but they have a bullying magnetism that Boormancalls pagan The reallife Cahill who thrived in Dublin in the s and wasgunned down in  was the most legendary criminal in modern Irish historyHe was a whaddya got rebelsomeone who could have justified his thieving onall sorts of grounds from contempt for the repressive hypocritical policeforce to contempt for the repressive hypocritical church He might even havefancied himself a Robin Hood although Boorman who also wrote the screenplayis careful to show that if Cahill stole from the rich he gave to no one buthimself and his family and that his thieving put a lot of poor people out ofwork Call him a roguish tribal chieftain or an ornery sociopath he is what heis And for much of the movie I had no moral reaction to his sometimes brutalexploits I just watched How radical There are different kinds of artisticneutrality the nihilist kind that signals Nothing matters so who caresLets just get off on the spectacle and Boormans kind which signals Thissubject is too big to reduce to a thesis Lets lay it out and study it            Gleeson gives yousomething to study Purposefully inexpressive the real Cahill would only bephotographed with his hand blocking his face he has a thick neck and eyesthat while small suggest watchful calculation The General begins withhis murder and the cheers that go up when word reaches the police station thenflashes back As a boy he steals pastries which he gallantly shares with hisfuture wife Frances Maria Doyle Kennedy But even his gallantry is suffusedwith mulishness Refusing to budge from a condemned housing project the adultCahill doesnt bother to reason he just sitspast the point where thebuilding is razed and the trailer he has moved to the spot has been firebombedWhen a city delegation marches on his tent and offers to set his family up in anew house the inveterate burglar asks for a place in a wealthier neighborhoodso that hell be closer to work His capers range from casual breakins toarmed holdups to intricate jewel heiststhe latter capped with an impudentvisit to the police station to establish an alibi            W hat works against Cahill is his own runaway success Tomonitor his movements the authorities appoint an inspector an amusingly soberJon Voight reunited with Boorman for the first time since the Deliverance  who soon has the resources to post cops on Cahills backfence and on the street in front of his house and to follow him and his gangwherever they go Using only the simplest cinematic means Boorman achieveswhat Martin Scorsese needed whippans and zoom lenses and a cacophonous soundmix to do at the climax of GoodFellas  He gives you the jitteryand suffocating sense of the universe closing in Hunted by both the cops andthe Irish Republican Army the snorting overweight diabetic Cahill does theopposite of lie low            Boorman pays a price forhis neutrality The General isnt an emotional grabber But on its ownterms its nearly perfect All I missed was something more than winks and hintsabout the nature of the triangle among Cahill his wife and her sister thelush Angeline Ball with whom he fathered several children Apparently itwas a happy arrangement for all Some have argued that Boorman the directorof Excalibur  and Hope and Glory  doesnt employ hisextravagant visual gifts in The General  which is in black and white andisnt ostentatious in its mythic resonances But Boorman pickled since youthin Arthurian legends has become nearly unemployable thanks to the mythicresonances in such epic turkeys as Zardoz  Exorcist II TheHeretic  Where the Heart Is  and the worthy dudBeyond Rangoon  Its agreeable to find him grounded in the

music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartzwhose work has become less tuneful and more pretentious since the heady days ofGodspell and Pippin  Schwartzs rhymes are all of the moonJunevariety and the big inspirational number in which hope is conceded sometimesto fly away like silver birds asks Who knows what miracles you canachieve When you believe The miracle here is the animation and

distinctly Spielbergian in itsfluidity Everything we love about biblicalmovie kitsch is here onlyconcentrated and heightened Best of all is a sequence in which Moses fallsasleep against the wall of a temple and in his dream the twodimensionalhieroglyphs of familiar Egyptian painting begin to move enacting the story ofthe Exodus in stiff horizontal processions The dream exalts the primitive artthat is the movies visual inspiration in a way that seems truly religious
