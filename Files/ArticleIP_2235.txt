itself we allege Why have we bundled anumbrella with a subscription to                   Slate                Many peoplesome of themwielding subpoenashave asked us this question The answer is simple We donot see the umbrella and the subscription to                   Slate                onlinemagazine as two separate products The umbrella is fully integrated into                  Slate                Or possibly                   Slate                is integrated into theumbrella One or the other To bar us as some have suggested from includingthe umbrella with                   Slate                would effectively mean that anyone whochooses to read                   Slate                outdoors would risk serious water damage tohis or her computer            It is charged by kneejerk                   Slate                haters andpaid apologists for our rivals that by including a free umbrella with eachsubscription to                   Slate                we are attempting to extend our currentdominant position in online poetryreadaloud into the market for umbrellasthereby stifling innovation in this crucial field Simple mathematics disposesof this canard If the umbrella is worth  which we say it isandStephen Glass does not work here and if a subscription to                   Slate               with a fully integrated umbrella is also  then it is obviously                  Slate                not the umbrella that is being given away free Andnobody in his right mind would put at risk a monopoly as lucrative as the onewe have on                   Slate               logo umbrellas by trying to extend it into thechallenging market for online magazines            To borrowan image from our corporate parent Microsoft we reserve the right tointegrate a ham sandwich into a subscription to                   Slate                if we wishAs a matter of fact a ham sandwich goes very well with some of                  Slate               s features What could be nicer than sitting under anumbrella munching a ham sandwich and reading Michael Lewis latestMillionerds column or one of Emily Yoffes dispatches from the world of thetabloids To forbid                   Slate                to innovate by incorporating useful newfeatures in our product would put us at an unfair disadvantage visvis otherWebzines Salon  for example is already full of baloney Oh

include Netscape Navigator in every copy of Windows  is just awarmup The governments real goal he revealed is to level the playingfield by forcing us to include Time and Newsweek in everyedition of                   Slate                Our chairman Bill Gates has said that thiskind of suggestion is like requiring Coke to include three cans of Pepsi inevery sixpack That analogy has stirred much discussion about its validityOur own view if youre wondering is that the analogy is brilliantly acute andtotally disposes of the issue in the minds of all honest and clearthinkingpeople But the uncomfortable truth is that                   Slate                alreadyincorporates Time and Newsweek in our department calledIn OtherMagazines The result as the Justice Department would have predicted isa robustly competitive magazine market in which Time and Newsweekactually in some ways surpass                   Slate                Circulation revenue adpages and profitability are a
