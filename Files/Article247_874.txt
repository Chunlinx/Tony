                                 Oral History                           USAToday  the Washington Post and Los AngelesTimes lead with yesterdays Supreme Court decision saying schools mustprovide whatever nursing care is required to enable students with physicalspecial needssuch as those in wheelchairs or on ventilatorsto attendmainstream classes The  law governing the educational access rights of thedisabled states that schools dont have to pay for medical services but theCourt ruled that only applies to services provided by physicians The New York Times which also fronts the Courts disability decision leads instead with the NYCschool chancellors threat to quit if the city goes ahead with a plannedtaxfunded private school voucher program but the papers top nonlocal storyis the US imposition as promised last December of  percent tariffs oncertain European luxury goods The LAT also fronts the story differingfrom the NYT and the Wall Street Journal in stating that the new tariffs willnot be imposed before midMarch            The coverage of the Courts call for classroom nursing support notes that itmeans fresh mainstream classroom access for many handicapped children andbillions in unexpected costs for public schools and hence for taxpayersUSAT says that in the particular case that went to the Court in which aboy a high school sophomore was rendered quadriplegic by a childhoodaccident the cost to the school system of his attending classes was as much as per year compared to the nationwide average of  for regularstudents Regular is the papers word better would have beenablebodied The LAT says that nationwide the additional care couldcost  million per year            There is one area that all the stories on this decision gloss over Theyeach mention that the plaintiffs child in the case was injured in a childhoodaccident All but the NYT note that it was a motorcycle accident whenthe boy was four years old But everybody leaves it at that Which leavesTodays Papers nose twitching Did one of the parents drive a motorcyclearound with a fouryearold on the back Or let somebody else do so Without ahelmet If the answer to either question is yes then here we have a case ofthe cost of parental irresponsibility being doled out to everybody else aphenomenon the papers should be more curious about            The NYT explains that the  percent tariff imposed on the likes of Louis Vuitton handbagsParma ham pecorino cheese and Scottish cashmere sweaters is a response toEuropes recent establishment of import limits on bananas grown by Americancompanies in Central America The story also reports that on Wednesday theHouse of Representatives passed a threat to keep the Concorde from landing inthe US in retaliation for a European ruling designed to promote Europeanaviation equipment sales that would ban many older US planes from EuropeThe story does not explain when or under what circumstances the House threatbecomes a reality The Times notes that the US moves are largelysymbolic in that the goods involved and the Concorde flights are a very smallpart of EuropeanUS commerce Although they probably disproportionatelyaffect Times readers            The LAT  WP  and USAT front washups from the MonicaLewinsky interview with Barbara Walters last night and her new book out todayThe NYT fronts a picture of Lewinsky from the interview but stuffs herwords inside The USAT headline focuses on Lewinskys claim in her bookthat President Clinton is a selfish man who lies all the time The LATlikens her story to a romance novel heavy on grief despair and passion Andrecords her reaction to being presidentially dumped All I did was cry and eatpizzas and sweets The WP passes along her claim that when stung by KenStarr she considered killing herself by jumping out the hotel window and thetidbit that to keep potential evidence out of investigators hands her fatherburned her White House souvenirs on the family barbecue            The WP reports that a US expert on biowarfare walked throughCapitol security yesterday carrying  grams of powdered anthrax in a plastic bottleand then proceeded to a House hearing where he displayed his deadly sample Theman then testified that in addition he has done likewise through all the majorairports and the security systems of the State Department the Pentagon eventhe CIA and nobody has stopped me            The WSJ reports that thanks to the raging bull market just last yearsix colleges and universitiesGrinnell  Brown Purdue MinnesotaRochester and Caltechjoined the ranks of schools with billion dollarendowments And then the Journal asks the very natural question that theschools themselves never raise Why in light of this investment success dontthe schools use more of their own resources to help students Why in otherwords the higher and higher tuitions and the proposed  billion in federalstudent aid To drive the point home the paper quotes a Harvard economistscalculations that it would only take a  percent return on its endowment forHarvard to provide all its undergrads with a free education            Know like thyself The WP reports that in her book MonicaLewinsky derides Linda Tripps accent and her lumpy figure
