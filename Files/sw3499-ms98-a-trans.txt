                 this is a real easy topic for me to spend at least thirty minutes or an hour on i vacation   i dont think theyll let us talk that long   yeah i know it i know it you say vacation i just say where i love to go ive and ive been lucky enough ive traveled quite a bit Canada Mexico   oh my   been to Rio uh Europe   ooh youve been to Europe   uhhuh   thats wonderful im envious   yeah i was i was lucky enough uh when i was uh twenty years old back when the the dollar was really strong i mean it was you know still the keen currency i convinced my parents to let me take off a month and go backpacking in Europe   uh   and uh   thats memories youll never ever have again probably   it oh not never and uh you know and ive just i went everywhere and its you know   humum what was your favorite country   uh well jeez if i had to pick one country i guess i would have to say Italy   Italy huh   uhhuh i think so because uh it was just the the history was just so staggering whenever you know you walked into the coliseum and uh you realized how many thousands of years old it was you know and you could just imagine the uh the gladiators and the lions and it was you know pretty pretty staggering to think of and then of course then the Roman forum thats even older than that thats just ruins and uh but the food was good the people were nice and there was just so much to see and do   well that was probably before we were the ugly Americans too   well actually back then like i said it was this is in nineteen seventy two and uh  uh you know i did the whole trip uh airfare uh everything for less than a thousand dollars   oh  not even sure you could get airfare   yeah right and i and i stayed gone a month   golly   yeah now of course that was back when uh Arthur for uh this uh the writer Arthur Arthur Frommer had a book out it was called Europe on five dollars a day   yeah   and so we budgeted and we said well well be extravagant we budgeted ten dollars a day   i love it     and and we stuck kept in that budget and had just really perfect   wow whod you go with   i went with a friend of mine uh that id been in high school with actually he and i we were in college at the time and we were talking about going to Colorado taking a little trip uh up to Colorado that summer after school got out and we started adding up you know totaling how much it was going to cost and i said hell we could go to Europe for that he said well why dont we and i said you know we did im im really happy that that we did do that   why dont we wow ive always wanted to go like to England   well and ive ive ive been to England several times since then um and that is i could go back anytime   um   anytime   well i teach literature and at the high school level and consequently i teach all about these wonderful places in Europe and in England especially and Canterbury Cathedral and you know all of these places and   umhum umhum yeah yeah   and never seen them somehow now that doesnt seem fair   well well i um uh had a job for several years that i traveled just an awful lot and uh as a matter of fact i stayed gone more than i stayed at home yeah for about four years and i built up an awful lot of mileage so ive made three trips to London just using airfare you know airline mileage and so thats how ive been able to make make those trips   um gee of all the places you visited then what is your one spot for a vacation that you would love to go back to   i i would go back to uh if i could go back anywhere right now i think i would go back to Edinburgh   um why is that   and well because uh we i didnt go any farther north in Scotland than Edinburgh and uh my brother was over there a couple of years ago and he uh uh went to on a driving tour all up through the Scottish highlands and just came back just raving about how wonderful it was very very scenic very   umhum   beautiful and its its a part of the uh the country thats a little bit off the beaten path therere not as many tourists that go out there and i enjoyed uh   right   Scotland so much but i could go back listen i could go back into London any day of the week and the beautiful thing about that is you could take a train out of London and head any direction it doesnt make any difference and take these fabulous day trips and anywhere you go is interesting and uh the last time we went we found this really uh small kind of quaint hotel actually we found it over there on the trip before but stayed in it the last time that was reasonable reasonable and uh just used that as a base and then took day trips on the trains the train system is wonderful which makes me wonder when well ever get our act together here in the US and have a and have a decent um uh transportation system but wed just take day trips and that was that was a nice way to do it   isnt that the truth did you go to Germany   i have been yeah we went the first time i went over there i went to Germany and went to Munich and stayed right across the street from one of the original medieval beer halls   oh my goodness   and uh
