              okay   okay okay okay im uh well i do work for a large company uh large meaning about twelve twelve thousand people   thats big   and uh it use to be twice as big couldve been uh couldve been better ill put it this way when i came to work here it was twenty five thousand and now its twelve thousand and dropping   uhhuh   but uh the advantages of a  how how big is the company you work for   uh less then a hundred people   okay less then a hundred        some of the same thing still applies ive work for companys uh your size before and some of the same thing still applies though uh one of the things is like i know a guy that gone to work for his self and and uh after a while he became isolated   uhhuh   yeah he was he craved uh  yeah   interaction yeah      and uh thats one of the nice thing a about a company uh interaction with other people access to internet uh do you have internet how did you get hook up to this   uh well i have an internet uh through another i have another internet connection through another network but were in the process of establishing our own internet feed internet feed um   so thing like that the internet uh access internet access to a library   yeah   um gee how do i say it uh   well i think the diversity of a large company is a strong thing for it um the the fact that there are so many different ways that uh working for a company could take you a a large company um granted if your skill your skill were like nuclear physics so you pretty much narrow to to uh   your choices are narrowed but i can see someone with on doing what i do going into many different sort of venue i guess youd call them in a larger company um im a system engineer and i basically design networks um   uhhuh   so for our end user and our customer im you know uh im pretty much limited to that thats what thats what i do   the one of the advantage of uh of a uh larger company and the hundred is uh could be consider a larger company is is access to other people that do the same thing   umhum   if youre the only computer programmer in your company then its its it is kind of isolated and uh so that one of the advantages of theres a lot of disadvantage of course but uh   yeah i think one of the disadvantages is the bureaucracy that props up as a you know necessity for almost anything getting anything done at all you have to uh many layers to go through   yes and one other thing that that uh tends to happen        in in a larger company is uh oh how do i say it uh lack of access to uh to people they they tend to departmentalize and and uh move away where as in a company your size uh let see a hundred or so it i in the pass had access to people who had access to just anything anything anything and everything was uh was available   uhhuh   where as in a company like this its very fragmented       and im i might be   umhum and you have the typical pyramid structure of organization many work group one man on top or woman um and middle management and the whole nine yards right     yeah and so well i can be ten feet away from somebody that is doing the same thing     uhhuh we are structure in the uh in uh in uh bubble       uh structure we are many different work group however we work together um thats by design weve had the same structure for basically for twenty years and uh it allows us to do many interesting thing we have many facet to our organization uh and we are able to mix and match and bring different facet into play as theyre need so we we basically cover the whole spectrum of computing uh for our for our customers and uh   i i have one fear here i i dont know if i push the one button long enough   i think you did   do you think you can hear that huh okay because i   yeah   i havent they havent said that were out of space yet maybe they deleted their temp directory     well in the past theyve it they seem to shut us off fairly quickly so i i was wondering about that let me try it once more here   yeah well um you know we can talk as long as we like or until they tell us ive usually hit the marker to um we are not suppose to be talking about this anyway uh       so were  were in a were in a bubble diagram and uh     okay   thats thats a really effective and i think that is a very nineties kind of thing like i say weve had it for twenty something years and so we are really good at it but uh
