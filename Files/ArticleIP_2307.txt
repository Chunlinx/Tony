                                 Betty and Monica            Jeff Danzigers cartoonoriginally in the Los Angeles Times and reprinted in the Sunday NewYork Times  shows Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie sitting at a booth in afern bar Lewinsky slathered in makeup and dressed in what presumably isintended to represent a designer outfit clutches a frilly cocktail and gabsaway in Valley speak So Im like yuh and hes like duh and Im likethinking about a new car Currie wears a raincoat and stares uncomprehendinglyat her companion over a cup of coffee Thats nice she says The caption isNow we are asked to believe that Betty Currie tried to get Monica Lewinsky ajob because they were actually great friends            Danzigerwas probably borrowing his joke from a column by Maureen Dowd who also findsthe idea of a friendship between Currie and Lewinsky laughable Mr Clintonsaid it was Betty who became friends with Monica Dowd wrote in the March New York Times  It makes sense that the yearold secretary knownfor her dignity and discretion would have enjoyed the dithering visits of ashopaholic who thought she was having a high school romance with the Presidentlike of the United States The general belief seems to be that Clinton or hisminions have essentially concocted the notion of a bond between Currie andLewinsky in order to explain Lewinskys many visits to the White House and thehighlevel help she received in searching for a job in New York            We may be at the stage in the scandal where any assertionby Bill Clinton or his partisans has everyone not only doubting it but alsoimmediately assuming the opposite And often for good reason In this casehowever it turns out that Currie and Lewinsky were friends Theoriginal link was apparently Walter Kaye the New York advertising mogulDemocratic donor and friend of Lewinskys mothers who sponsored Monica for aninternship at the White House The Kayes and the Curries are friends who havesocialized together in New York City It is not surprising or intrinsicallysuspicious then that Currie who has a reputation for looking out for WhiteHouse interns with whom she has no personal connection would have been helpfuland friendly to Monica            Becausenone of the principals is talking its hard to discover much about how close arelationship Lewinsky and Currie developed But the two do seem to have beenfriends Interesting detail Mourners who attended the funeral of BettyCurries brotherTheodore Williams Jr who died in a car accident lastDecemberrecall seeing Lewinsky there Lest anyone assume that Monica showedup at the Metropolitan Baptist Church that day to ogle the president a sourcewho asked not to be named says Lewinsky was spotted in the kitchen back at theCurrie home in Arlington She helped clean up and serve food to theoutoftowners In fact she brought a dish            This background casts a rather different lighton the plausibility of Clintons claim in his Paula Jones deposition thatCurrie helped Lewinsky find a job in New York Another fact that has beenlargely ignored according to friends of Curries is that she and VernonJordan have been friends for  years She also has a longstanding friendshipwith White House Deputy Chief of Staff John Podesta Like most everyone inpolitics she uses her connections on behalf of her friends Thus when Jordansays that Currie called him to ask him for help in finding Lewinsky a job inNew York there is every reason to think he is telling the truthand its atleast plausible that Currie was calling at her own behest not Clintons            None ofthis is to say that Clinton wasnt sexually involved with Lewinsky or that hewasnt also interested in Jordans efforts to find her a job But the automaticpresumption that a personal relationship between Currie and Lewinsky couldnthave existed says less about the presidents lack of credibility than about theassumptions of certain white people An older black secretary and a rich whiteairhead many reporters and pundits have glibly conjectured couldnt haveenough in common to be close This testifies to a failure of imagination Italso embodies a mentality that is not quite racist but smacks ofcondescension            The attitude is not limited to journalists and cartoonistsOne of the first Washington Post stories about Currie quoted ananonymous White House official She dresses nicely and she speaks well andshes neat the official said of Currie Her sweaters are probably stacked upnicely in her closet This was someone who worked with her sounding as ifCurrie was applying to be a domestic servant Who would ever assume that thepresidents executive assistant wouldnt be neat or use proper grammarYou cant imagine anyone describing a white presidential assistantEvelynLincoln or Rose Mary Woodsthis way            Another grating manifestationof this mindset is the way Currie is constantly referred to as dignifiedThis compliment threatens to become for black women what articulate is forblack men such as Vernon Jordan Though meant as praise it is in fact highlypatronizing A middleage white person would seldom be characterized asdignified or deeply religious unless he is some kind of religiousfanatic The clichs that have been employed to describe Currie embody anassumption that most AfricanAmerican women are not dignified            Lots of people writing aboutthis sex scandal want to make Betty Currie out to be the ultimate victim takencruel advantage of by a truthevading president who happened to be her bossWhat Currie has been put through is certainly unpleasant But lets rememberthat a lot of innocent bystanders have been subjected to swarming reporters andunexpected legal billsand perhaps faced with hard choices between loyalty andintegrity Currie who has had a long career in politics is no naif As oneold pal of hers told me There is a kind of worldlywise woman in therethishas been lost in all the saintly religious stuff She is very good to herfriends And those friends include Monica
