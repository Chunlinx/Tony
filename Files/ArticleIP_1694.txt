whether Congresswill actually pass a health insurance reform bill Issue  is the relatedquestion of whether this particular session is a donothing Congress Mostlythough the opinion mafia decides to spend time trading bons mots Withrelative stillness this week from the White House the Hill Kenneth Starrsoffice and the world of international diplomacy excepting Irelandunfortunately the commentariat must clown about to keep the crowdsattention From the standpoint of wit rather than substance it is a goodweek            Mostpundits agree that the Maryland prosecutors timinghe began his wiretappingprosecution just as Tripp began her testimony for Starris highly suspectSteve Roberts CNNs Late Edition  and Margaret Carlson CNNsCapital Gang  think it poetic that Tripp is caught up in a politicallymotivated Mickey Mouse charge since Starr is using her against MonicaLewinsky in the same way Sam Donaldson ABCs This Week  and Susan Page Late Edition  note that the main issue is still the presidentsbehavior            Amajority of the commentariat thinks that HMO reformstrikes a chord with voters in a way that tobacco and campaign finance reformdid not The big dispute between

McLaughlin Group  who suggests that the YK bug mighthave a silver lining because it puts computer programmers to work A majorityof economists believes that during a severe depressionwhich certainly doesntdescribe America right nowits important to pay people to do makeworkdigging ditches or restoring hiking trails will also do But Pundit Centraldoubts you could find a single economist who would classify a slew of COBOLprogrammers fixing antiquated mainframe systems as either a consumable good orservice Of course any sane person recognizes the importance of paying computerexperts to fix oncoming problems just as it is important that plumbers fixantiquated pipes but the use of their time is a cost not a benefit                           Wait and See But Wont the Producers BeAngry Said
