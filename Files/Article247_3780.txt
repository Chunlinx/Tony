                                 Is the MCISprint Merger AntiCompetitive                        The proposed merger between MCI WorldCom and Sprint obviously raisesimportant antitrust questions since the devouring of the countrysthirdlargest longdistance player by the secondlargest might very well not bein the best interests of consumers You dont hear people saying Why did theyever break up ATT much anymore and thats mainly because the fiercecompetition for longdistance customers has driven prices inexorably downEliminating a key player in that market could reduce the pressure for pricecuts            It could reduce the pressure but it probably wont Although the telecomindustry on the one hand is succumbing to mergermania on the other hand itsseeing new players spring up regularly and its now seeing wannabes such asRCN and Qwest becoming real contenders And in the simplest sense having twobig players in the market is not meaningfully different from having three Thedays when companies happily divided up market share like the Portuguese andSpanish divided up the world in the  th century are long gone ifthey ever existed If ATT raises my rates above the current  cents aminute Ill be happy to move            Still one effect of an MCI WorldComSprint merger would be to increase thepressure on regulators to allow the Regional Bell Operating Companies RBOCsto offer longdistance service For a Baby Bell to be able to offerlongdistance to its customers it first has to demonstrate that it has openedthe market for local service to competitors which means not only that it isntblowing up its competitors vans but that its giving its competitors reliableaccess to that last mile of copper wire that runs into our homes and that itisnt making customers jump through hoops when they want to change phonecompanies            Up to this point no Baby Bell has actually been able to demonstratethisrather than welcoming competition the RBOCs have tried to repel it atevery turn This is not surprising Everyone wants the markets theyre notallowed intolongdistance in this caseto be open and the markets theydominate to be closed But it has been a frustrating spectacle Changing localservice should be as easy as changing your longdistance carrier and asriskfree            In any case Bell Atlantic now has an application to provide longdistanceservice before the FCC and indications are that it has a good chance of beingapproved The company has undergone close scrutiny has performed a battery oftests to show that its being fair to its competitors and has lost enoughcustomersthough still a tiny fraction of the overall numberto itscompetitors to suggest that it doesnt have a complete monopoly And if BellAtlantic can start providing long distance that will put added competitivepressure on ATT and MCI WorldCom            Eventually then Bell Atlantic will be a fullservice phone company andthat will probably be a good thing in the long run But before the FCC saysyes Id like it to make Bell Atlantic answer one question Why does it cost memore to call Long Island from my home in Brooklyn than it costs me to callParis
