        the invasion of privacy is a topic that gets some people kind of mad i dont mind it too much uh its more of a bother sometimes than it is uh a real invasion to me in that uh some of the purchases that you make if you make them with a credit card in a given location for a given amount all that stuff goes into a big computer data base and tends to go to the marketing schemes and then they will hound you forever for a particular purchase like that uh one of the the uh cards little little card i answered in the mail that had a bunch of topics would you be interested in this be interested in that an it was kind of a little survey type deal and i checked off a few things and just out of curiosity once i decided to see what would happen if i if i checked off uh about some stock uh portfolio information as it were for the different investors and within about a month i would say i had ten fifteen calls from different brokers uh asking me questions all sorts of things about what i would be willing interested in investing in and how much i had to invest and and i was kind of curious and i guess i got my answer but it was uh a bit much and to this day it has continued considerably its i guess its going to be hard to get off of that little list now   yeah   uh  other little forms of of uh not really an invasion its public record its its not uh not even they never told you it would be considered private but whenever you buy a house uh the purchase price is there for everybody to see where its located is there and and uh companies that do this kind of research hire people to sit there at the at the records office and take down all this this information and put it into their format so that they can put it on to their computer and and know that a given   right   neighborhood is at a given age group they they know a lot about you for the on that one transaction and they know roughly what your income is if youre affording a house of that size so they want to send you literature for vacations to whatever because youre in that bracket   right   and marketing is uh seems to be the driving factor for most of these invasions of privacy as people call them so   right yeah i guess the telephone solicitation is the one that comes to my mind   yeah   to me thats uh its inexcusable if you want to come and want my money come and convince me dont call me on the phone   yeah thats true i i guess thats uh where the old answering machine comes into play just screen a hundred percent of your calls and you dont have that that problem   yeah i just keep my phone number listed under a separate name and when someone calls for that name i know that theyre soliciting and i just tell them no they got the wrong number     yeah thats the way to do it yeah   works pretty good   well the other some of the other problems of course are are uh invasions that are more along the lines of theft where people have allowed their carbon copies of their uh cards to get a way from them the credit cards purchases and people will uh take those and maybe steal some something off that number or just use that that information as uh you you purchased this then you know at that time because that information is not always open to the public yeah you cant always get out and find every transaction that a person makes on their MasterCard of Visa but uh a lot of of um credit references uh when you dial that in to find out well whats their latest rating uh that kind of information you dont always want everybody to know but uh its going across uh computer lines and people can pick up what they want so   right   and then theres the whole issue of of uh cellular telephones and and house portable phones uh people consider that an invasion of privacy to have uh someone listening in on their their phones and ironically the laws have has classified one of them as illegal to listen to and the other one not   right   so its kind of a strange deal do you have a phone that uh   no i dont have a cordless   people cordless that people can listen in on i dont either but uh i i happen to have a radio that will pick up that range  it its very seldom that you can get uh you just happen to be within a couple of houses of that person and you have to listen at the exact right time and its fairly staticky and on occasion youll get two to three of them at once because the radios usually dont have the control thats needed to   right right   screen them out and its not the worlds most interesting thing to listen to but uh it it can be done relatively cheaply and i guess some people for lack of anything else to do do that kind of thing   i guess a lot of the data thats being taken with you know the advent of the computer   a lot of the data thats being taken on everybody you know your social security number is tied to just everything about you and i think that   right   constitutes an invasion of privacy not so much the fact that the data is there but the way that its being compiled and   umhum   i think the government uses is quite a bit you know if they they want to do a check background check on you theyve got you everything on you from the time you got that social security card   right   and to me thats an invasion of my privacy   yeah its kind of sad when they   they know to where youve worked where youve been what youve done you know any any kind of   right     uh you know you name anything thats ever happened to you is going to be tied into either your social security number or your drivers license   its kind of sad that they choose that number to identify you  with because theres very few you know some people use it just because its easy and its unique and then some people use it to yeah you can now identify that person its not quite so private anymore and uh i dont know i very little of the information i give out really bothers me but as far as whether i care if anybody else had it but uh i guess the idea that if you ever let it become a an all right thing to do for the masses then youll never be able to get that privilege back  once gone its going to be gone forever   right   so well i think weve just about covered the topic im going to go ahead and let you go i got to get back to work here   okay all righty bye   talk to you later maybe bye
