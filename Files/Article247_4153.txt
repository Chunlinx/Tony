                                 Let Us Now Praise Famous Women                           Women  a collection of photographs by celebrity photographer AnnieLeibovitz with an introductory essay by Susan Sontag has already been soundly spanked by thecritics So why talk about it now Because while its detractors have rightlynoted that the books organizing principlewomen in all their diversityisbanal they have not responded to an implicit and probably unintended messageof the book As Culturebox sees it the real topic of Women isCelebrityspecifically how the world looks to a celebrity photographer             Lets start with thepicturesportraits of women most of them wellknown a few of them notLeibovitz photographed the famous women on assignment for highend magazines Vanity Fair Vogue The New Yorker  She probably took the pictures ofthe unknown women on her own There are no notes to tell us where thephotographs were originally published so its hard to say which pictures wereassignments and which ones Leibovitz was simply moved to take The famous aredepicted in ways designed to reinforce our warmest feelings about them HillaryClinton looks youthfully studious as she pores over papers on the White Housessunny balcony A bold and cheerful Ann Richards the former governor of Texashefts a rifle on a hunting expedition Performer Anna Deavere Smith holds upone hand and testifies seemingly lost inside one of her many magnificentevangelical characters Sigourney Weaver Nicole Kidman and Drew Barrymore areeach sexy in their own glamorous ways The athletes are each tough in their ownheroic ways As the image of one famous woman follows another we seem tounderstand why theyve made such names for themselves They are so singular soattractive so powerful the world just had to take notice of them             Itsharder to describe the nonfamous women since their portraits lend themselvesless well to personal characterization Unlike the celebrity portraits thesewere mostly taken without benefit of makeup props and lighting design as aresult faces tend to disappear into contexts The miners are grimy The sewingmachine operator sews The farmers farm The teenager is ripely innocent Thevictim of domestic abuse looks battered They are icons in short either oftheir pioneering professions or else of their stereotypically femininesituation The pathbreaking professionals tend to stare defiantly into thecamera Imagine telling Dorothy A Richman a rabbinical student wrapped inphylacteries and holding a Torah that she cant serve God The women trappedin servile roles on the other hand withdraw from Leibovitz Their faces areblank or frankly hostile You cant look for long at the picture of MariaEugenia Ponce a waitress at a Los Angeles diner so raw are the shame anddistrust in her eyes We still feel a certain warmth toward theseallbutanonymous womenLeibovitz specializes in warmbut its a much moreabstract emotion We feel proud of or sad for women in general not for anywoman in particular            In short individuality here becomes a function of fame The better knownyou are the more appealing a personality Leibovitz will grant you This is notto accuse her of lacking sympathy for the nonfamous But Leibovitz is acommercial photographer When shes told to shoot a celebrity she shows upwith a crew an expansive amount of time and the driving idea that this personis important and must be allowed to get her identity across Noncelebritieshave less claim on Leibovitz on her time money and curiosity and thereforea reduced impact on usalthough it must also be said that Leibovitz makesdistinctions between noncelebrities according an empathy and humanity toinspiring professionals that she cant seem to extend to the abjectlydowntrodden            To be fair to Leibovitz shes working under two other constraints One isformal Its hard to communicate roundness of character in a single photographwhich is perforce a limited slice of space and time How much easier it must beto photograph women whose identities are already publicly disseminated All youhave to do is gather up the strands of commonly told tales and give them visualrepresentationa gesture the color of the light a costume a chanceexpressionin order to produce an image that feels both knowing and right Thesecond constraint may be the more important one Leibovitz after all worksfor editors at glossy magazines who spend their days wrangling celebrities ontotheir pages Celebrities demand flattering representation as the price of theircooperation and no one is better at flattering in a sophisticated yet intimateway than Leibovitz Should she ever stop making her celebrity subjects lookgood her career would quickly come to an end            Nonetheless this troubling collusion of photography and social hierarchyfor fame is well on its way to replacing class as the determining factor ofstatus in America is exactly the sort of thing youd expect Susan Sontag tohold forth about with brilliance and insight And she does too just not inher introduction a disconnected series of meditations on what a collection ofphotographs of women might tell us in this day and age Very little she isfinally forced to admit Only in one clause does Sontag hint at the conditionsunderlying the booktodays hugely complex fashionandphotography systemshe calls itbut the topic at hand is something else and she veers awayLeibovitz after all is her very dear friend and this is a coffeetable booknot a work of criticism But consider what a younger sharpertongued Sontagmight have written This is her from On Photography  a collection ofessays published during the s The subject was August Sander a sphotographer who also set out to catalogue a large category of people in hiscase Germans but you could substitute Leibovitz for Sander and come out withan apt reading                           Sanders social sample is unusually conscientiously broad He includesbureaucrats and peasants servants and society ladies factory workers andindustrialists soldiers and gypsies actors and clerks But such variety doesnot rule out class condescension Sanders eclectic style gives him away Somephotographs are casual fluent naturalistic others are nave and awkward Unselfconsciously Sander adjusted his style to the social rank of the personhe was photographing Professionals and the rich tend to be photographedindoors without props They speak for themselves Laborers and derelicts areusually photographed in a setting often outdoors which locates them whichspeaks for themas if they could not be assumed to have the kinds of separateidentities normally achieved in the middle and upper classes  Sanderscomplicity with everybody also means a distance from everybody His complicitywith his subjects is not nave  but nihilistic                        Indeed                           Photographs are from Women by Annie Leibovitz and Susan Sontag HillaryRodham Clinton the White House
