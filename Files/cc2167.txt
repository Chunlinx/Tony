                    Introduction        Activated protein C an endogenous plasma serine        protease with antithrombotic profibrinolytic and        antiinflammatory properties       is an important        modulator of the host systemic response to severe infection            Recently recombinant human activated protein C        drotrecogin alfa activated was approved for the        treatment of adult patients with severe sepsis Regulatory        approvals were based on the results of a single pivotal        phase  study which demonstrated a statistically        significantly reduction in day allcause mortality        absolute risk reduction compared with placebo         relative risk reduction          P       with supporting        data from a single phase  study     Consistent with        its antithrombotic and profibrinolytic properties the        administration of drotrecogin alfa activated as compared        with placebo was associated with an increase in the        percentage of patients experiencing a serious bleeding        complication  versus          P   over  days in the phase         study     Bleeding complications were the most        important serious adverse events associated with the        administration of drotrecogin alfa activated            A total of  adult patients with severe sepsis were        enrolled in the randomized placebocontrolled trials        supporting the approval of drotrecogin alfa activated         patients received active treatment and  patients        received placebo Since completion of those controlled        trials further studies have been completed          n   or are ongoing          n   in which an additional         patients have received drotrecogin alfa activated        Furthermore up to  April   patients have        received drotrecogin alfa activated in commercial use        following approval in the USA        The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive        review of the safety of drotrecogin alfa activated for        all adult patients with severe sepsis enrolled in clinical        trials completed and ongoing since the start of phase         clinical development and up to  April  Trials were        grouped into three categories controlled trials        openlabel trials and compassionateuse studies In        addition safety data are presented for patients who        received drotrecogin alfa activated from spontaneous        reports in commercial use                    Patients and method                  Patient populations          Table lists the seven clinical studies that enrolled          adult patients with severe sepsis and that were completed          or ongoing as of  April  Studies were classified          as controlled if they included a blinded placebo          comparison with drotrecogin alfa activated Xigris           Eli Lilly and Company Indianapolis IN USA          openlabel if drotrecogin alfa activated was          administered in a single arm study conducted at          prospectively identified and trained investigative sites          or compassionateuse if drotrecogin alfa activated          was provided on emergent request to noninvestigator          clinicians treating patients with severe sepsis          All studies except FKMCEVAS utilized inclusion          and exclusion criteria similar to those in the phase           Study FKMCEVAD Recombinant Human Activated Protein C          Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis PROWESS              Severe sepsis was defined in all protocols as the          presence of known or suspected infection the presence of          a systemic response to infection as evidenced by          alterations in temperature heart rate respiratory rate          and white blood cell count and the presence of one or          more associated acute organ dysfunctions cardiovascular          respiratory renal hematologic or metabolic acidemia          Patients excluded from participation included those at          high risk for bleeding those with severe          thrombocytopenia platelet count  mm  those          taking a variety of antiplatelet agents and those          receiving systemic heparin anticoagulation Study          FKMCEVAS required only the clinical diagnosis of          purpura fulminans and did not have the presence of          thrombocytopenia as an exclusion criterion          Based on the approved recommendations for the USA          patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated in          commercial use would have been expected to have severe          sepsis and have been at high risk for death eg as          assessed using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health          Evaluation APACHE II     The number of patients          who received drotrecogin alfa activated in commercial          use was estimated from the total number of courses of          therapy sold in the USA using hospitalbased stores          information from  November  until  April                                    Drug administration          Table lists details of drug dose and durations of          infusion for each clinical trial Patients randomly          assigned to placebo in the controlled clinical trials          received either saline or  albumin in saline Based          on the approved recommendations for the USA              patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated in          commercial use would have been expected to receive an          infusion rate of  gkg per hour for a total duration          of  hours Specific details regarding actual dose and          duration of administration were not available for          patients treated in commercial use                          Estimates of day mortality rate          Mortality rates for completed clinical trials were          obtained from validated clinical trial databases          Estimates of day allcause mortality rates for ongoing          clinical studies were obtained from separate          trialspecific databases created using trialspecific          tracking tools Twentyeightday allcause mortality          ie  days after the start of infusion was assessed          for all studies except study FKMCEVBC in which day          mortality was assessed for a subset of patients nonUS          For this subset the number of additional deaths          occurring between days  and  was estimated using the          following method Of the  adults in study FKMCEVBC          day followup data were available for  patients           deaths and day follow up data were available for           patients  deaths It was determined from the result          of FKMCEVAD PROWESS that the day mortality rate          in day survivors receiving drotrecogin alfa activated          was  Therefore for the subset of day survivors          in study FKMCEVBC an additional nine deaths  of           were estimated to have occurred before study day           Thus total day mortality in study FKMCEVBC was          estimated at                 At present an estimate of the mortality rate for          patients who have received drotrecogin alfa activated          in commercial use is not available For the          placebocontrolled studies FKMCEVAA and FKMCEVAD          PROWESS the cause of death was adjudicated by Lilly          physicians in a blinded manner for all patients from          death summaries provided by the investigators                          Serious bleeding event rate estimates          Bleeding complications meeting the regulatory          definition of a serious adverse event were extracted from          a validated pharmacovigilance database which included          events reported in clinical trials and in commercial use          For all clinical trials in this report bleeding          complications included but were not limited to any of          the following any intracranial hemorrhage ICH any          lifethreatening bleeding event requirement for  units          or more of packed red blood cell transfusion per day for           consecutive days or meeting other criteria defining          serious adverse events For patients experiencing ICH          the following data were extracted from the serious          adverse event report type of ICH most recent platelet          count and presence of meningitis          The causal relationship of drotrecogin alfa          activated to serious bleeding events was assessed by          comparison with placebo event rates for controlled          trials For openlabel and compassionateuse studies          causal relationship was assessed using investigator          assignment of causality related or not related and by          comparing events that occurred during the infusion period          with events that occurred postinfusion The study drug          infusion period was defined as the actual duration of          infusion plus  calendar day study days  The          postinfusion period was defined as study days  All          serious bleeding events were assessed as          procedurerelated if associated with an invasive          procedure or nonprocedurerelated          Serious bleeding events were recorded for up to           days following the start of study drug administration for          all but one study FKMCEVBC In study FKMCEVBC          serious bleeding events were recorded for up to  days          except for a subset of patients            n   For this subset all          serious bleeding events were recorded for  days          following the start of infusion and study drugrelated          serious bleeding events were recorded for up to           days                          Statistical analysis          Because of the lack of final validated baseline data          for ongoing clinical trials comparisons between clinical          trial types were avoided Accordingly  confidence          intervals CIs using exact

associated with          invasive procedures during the day study period These          procedures typically involved the instrumentation of          large blood vessels or highly vascular organs The          incidence of nonprocedurerelated serious bleeding          events ie spontaneous bleeding events was similar          between active treatment and placebo groups in that          trial In all

       and   well after the infusion period          In commercial use   patients receiving          drotrecogin alfa activated were reported to have          experienced an ICH                          NonICH serious bleeding events associated with          fatal outcome          In controlled clinical trials four drotrecogin alfa          activated patients and one placebo patient experienced

receiving        drotrecogin alfa activated were consistent across        controlled openlabel and compassionateuse trials        ranging from  to  These results are similar to        and supportive of the observed mortality rate of         associated with drotrecogin alfa activated use reported        in the pivotal phase  trial FKMCEVAD PROWESS            These mortality rates are lower than recent mortality rate        estimates for severe sepsis which ranged between  and            and lower than the combined placebo rate from        controlled clinical trials of  The consistency of        treatment effects in drotrecogin alfa activated patients        might have been expected given that for the most part        inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar across        trials        The survival benefit associated with drotrecogin alfa        activated appears to be related to a reduction in the        number of deaths from refractory septic shock and        respiratory failure These observations are consistent with        the observed more rapid improvement in cardiovascular and        respiratory function for drotrecogin alfa activated        patients as compared with placebo patients in study        FKMCEVAD PROWESS            Consistent with its antithrombotic and profibrinolytic        properties drotrecogin alfa activated increased the risk        for serious bleeding The overall serious bleeding event        rate  includes compassionateuse trials in which        investigators had limited experience using drotrecogin alfa        activated The percentage of patients experiencing an        event probably related to drotrecogin alfa activated        appears to range between  and  as assessed by the        investigator or by whether the event occurred during the        infusion period respectively Approximately  of        placebo patients enrolled in controlled trials experienced        a serious bleeding event over the day period Neither        APACHE II score   or   nor concomitant heparin        use appear to alter serious bleeding event rates associated        with drotrecogin alfa activated substantially        Underreporting of baseline heparin exposure in the        openlabel and compassionateuse trials is likely given        that medication listings for the safety database were only        collected on the day of the event        Serious bleeding event rates for both active treatment        and placebo patients enrolled in clinical trials of        drotrecogin alfa activated probably underestimate the        bleeding risk for all patients with severe sepsis In these        trials patients at increased risk for bleeding eg some        patients with multiple trauma or patients with severe        thrombocytopenia ie platelet count  mm  were        excluded from participation Clinical trials of treatment        of severe sepsis with other novel therapeutics that have        antithrombotic properties also excluded a similar patient        population Estimates of serious bleeding complications in        these latter trials ranged between     and            for placebo treated patients Exclusion criteria        related to bleeding risk similar to those used in all of        these trials should be employed in developing guidelines        for the use of drotrecogin alfa activated        Severe thrombocytopenia is included as a warning in        the US Package Insert and as a contraindication in the        European Summary of Product Characteristics In the former        instance the recommendation is for physicians to weigh        potential benefit of drotrecogin alfa activated against a        potentially increased risk associated with its use In the        European Summary of Product Characteristics the        recommendation is that physicians not administer        drotrecogin alfa activated to patients with platelet        counts of mm or less Indeed serious bleeding        events in drotrecogin alfa activated patients appear to        be associated with severe thrombocytopenia suggesting that        this characteristic may be a risk factor for bleeding        complications Therefore maintaining a platelet count        above mm and discontinuing the drotrecogin alfa        activated infusion if the platelet count falls below this        level are reasonable recommendations to guide its use        A large percentage of bleeding events associated with        drotrecogin alfa activated were also related to        procedures performed either before or during the infusion        period The types of procedures associated with bleeding        complications were frequently those in which adequate        control of bleeding vessels could not be obtained In        controlled trials the percentage of patients experiencing        nonprocedurerelated bleeding complications was similar        between drotrecogin alfa activated and placebo patients        Therefore limiting invasive procedures before and during        infusion of drotrecogin alfa activated as well as        minimizing risks associated with procedures eg        instrumentation of blood vessels in which direct        compression might be expected to control bleeding could        improve the safety profile of the drug        Additionally approved product labels recommend stopping        the drotrecogin alfa activated infusion  hours before        invasive procedures and waiting  hours after major        surgical procedures to restart the infusion after ensuring        adequate hemostasis     The infusion may be restarted        immediately after uncomplicated less invasive procedures        after ensuring adequate hemostasis These recommendations        are based on the observation that the concentration of        drotrecogin alfa activated in plasma is below the assay        level of detection in a large majority of patients within         hours of discontinuing the infusion            The difference between ICH events occurring during the        infusion period  or considered related to drug and        the ICH event rate in all clinical trials combined         was similar to the background rate for ICH reported for        patients with severe sepsis In a recent large sepsis trial        of antithrombin III  of placebo treated patients        experienced ICH during the study     OppenheimEden         et al     also reported an ICH        event rate of  for all intensive care unit patients who        did not have an admitting diagnosis of stroke or stroke        syndrome However all patients experiencing ICH had a        diagnosis of severe sepsis and a platelet count of        mm or less suggesting that the event rate for the        severe sepsis population overall may exceed             In a recently completed phase  trial of platelet        activating factorase an ICH event rate of   was        reported in placebotreated sepsis patients Opal S        personal communication        Approximately  of drotrecogin alfa activated        patients experienced a serious bleeding event associated        with a fatal outcome that was considered related to its use        during the infusion period These events were most        frequently ICH events These data suggest that although        use of drotrecogin alfa activated reduces sepsisinduced        mortality its anticoagulant effects may increase the risk        for lifethreatening bleeding complications Patients that        appear to be at risk for such a complication are those with        severe coagulopathy ie low platelet counts high        international normalized ratio Risk for sepsisrelated        death in these patients may be greater than that in the        overall population of severe sepsis patients with no        coagulopathy        In controlled trials although drotrecogin alfa        activated treated patients experienced more        hemorrhagerelated deaths there were fewer deaths from        stroke in drotrecogin alfa activated patients than in        placebo patients two versus seven patients The composite        endpoint of any fatal ICH and any fatal stroke favored        drotrecogin alfa activated as compared with placebo four        versus eight patients The number of patients experiencing        any fatal bleeding event or any fatal stroke was similar        between the drotrecogin alfa activated and placebo groups        nine versus eight patients respectively These data        suggest that the day allcause mortality rates reported        for drotrecogin alfa activated represent a composite        endpoint of less sepsisinduced death potentially less        thromboticrelated deaths as well as any fatal        complications associated with the use of drotrecogin alfa        activated        The primary limitation of these analyses was the lack of        placebo treatment groups for five of the seven studies        reported and no comparison group for patients administered        drotrecogin alfa activated under commercial use        Additionally baseline data describing the patient        population was unavailable for patients enrolled in ongoing        trials or receiving drotrecogin alfa activated        commercially There were also notable differences in the        inclusion criteria used to enroll patients in the        compassionateuse study FKMCEVAS ie that study        enrolled only patients with purpura fulminans This        inclusion criterion may explain in part the higher        bleeding rates seen in compassionateuse trials                    Conclusion        Drotrecogin alfa activated significantly reduces        mortality in severe sepsis The treatment efficacy and        safety profiles of drotrecogin alfa activated have        remained consistent over multiple clinical trials The only        significant serious adverse event associated with        drotrecogin alfa activated treatment is bleeding        Additional clinical experience indicates that invasive        procedures are associated with a substantial percentage of        these serious bleeding events Severe thrombocytopenia for        all serious bleeding events and meningitis for ICH only        may be risk factors for serious bleeding Mitigating the        risk for serious bleeding by maintaining adequate platelets        eg mm  during drotrecogin alfa activated        infusion may reduce risk for both bleeding and ICH                    Key messages         Mortality rates in drotrecogin alfa        activatedtreated patients remained consistent across        trials         The most important serious adverse event associated        with drotrecogin alfa activated treatment is bleeding         Serious bleeding events are most frequent on day  of        therapy with drotrecogin alfa activated and rapidly        decline on subsequent days         Serious bleeding events were frequently
