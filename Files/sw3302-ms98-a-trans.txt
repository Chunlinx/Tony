        well Charlie what do you think should we spend more on AIDS research or stay the same     well i dont i dont think were uh spending enough so i i think we should i that i should i think we should spend more   why do you think we dont spend enough   uh lets see um you know to tell you the truth i i couldnt tell you exactly i couldnt tell you what were spending but from what i from what i hear um from most of the AIDS uh you know just reading about AIDS advocacy groups and oh people like that uh there have been a couple of deaths um lately uh like one lady that was on the Presidents AIDS committee um that were not i it just doesnt seem like were taking the disease as as seriously as we need to uh lot of lot of talk about it but were doesnt i dont know what do you think   well i agree with you i think we have a lot of talk but not dollars and you know we we situation  our situation where   yeah   were faced with people that you know choose a lifestyle that may cause AIDS  but then at the same token there are a lot of people like the children in Florida who didnt choose a lifestyle but there was not help for them   right   and i think one of the things we can do as far as the government goes is just to dispel some of the myths you know drinking from a water fountain will give you AIDS   umhum   using a restroom will give you AIDS   yeah     but at the same token i feel like heart disease cancer multiple sclerosis where do we put those in perspective to AIDS   umhum well i wonder what i dont know what the statistics are but i think uh its uh the numbers of of people infected do you know any have any idea what they are what theyre estimating now     no i dont and you know im like you i do not know   yeah well i you know what it   what the government is spending on AIDS   yeah what what i think is that is that somehow in in our most a lot of our minds its still a disease that affects primarily homosexuals and intravenous drug users but what were finding is that that that its its um also its affecting a lot more people than that that that theres a lot more um uh   yes     heterosexual transmission of the disease than than we probably thought   right   so and you know i mean as long its as long as its um limited to those two select you know two kind of narrow areas homosexuals and intravenous drug users it it its probably gonna get unfortunately sad to say a lot more lip service than it will actually actually dollars and uh it might be that  as it spreads among the general population more that that uh       you know and and in all these stories about these kids who had transfusions and these oh theres been a couple housewives lately that were you know national news that they had had transfusions transfusions uh transfusions and they you know and theyre theyre they died you know and left behind families and oh oh   yeah   yep   well im in Texas and we have a teacher that died from AIDS   oh you you all did in your uh in your school school district or something   yeah well not my school district but it was in the state of Texas and it was because of a transfusion and i think that got a lot more publicity because again it wasnt a minority group   yeah yeah   and you know were looking at a situation that hopefully can be controlled   yeah i know yeah i dont know kind of kind of scary actually   it is frightening you know because it could be you or i and then what what would we do wed want help   yeah what are what are you gonna do if youre in an auto accident and uh you had need a blood transfusion are you gonna have confidence in the blood supply i dont i dont i dont know that i would   thats true   or will   yeah well my mother had a blood transfusion about four years ago and i i was scared to even mention to her   umhum yeah   that there was an emergency situation we couldnt give she couldnt give her blood we couldnt go down to give her our blood for her   yeah   and you know theres always the possibility   yeah and and i think as long as its uh as long as its still people that are thinking that its mostly even people that that its almost like because theyre choosing to practice those lifestyles that theyre choosing you know thats their choice that they ran that risk i mean i you know thats probably i hate to say that that sounds cruel   no but the i agree with you   uh that sounds cold cold and cruel but thats probably as long as people perceive of it being that way i i mean that probably explains the lack of um lack of concrete money and being spent   yeah and i think its you know   yep
