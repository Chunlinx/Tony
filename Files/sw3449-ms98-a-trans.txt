                yes   uh i havent uh talked to anybody outside the Metroplex so i didnt even think of saying Arlington Texas this is a real first  are you at work     yes yes i am   i i ive been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening and i thought well im not having any luck ill try the middle of the afternoon   well im im happy we got through   i am too well do you uh have any uh opinion on the subject   well im im especially interested with what whats happening in the Soviet Union uh the the move to um uh the the the the Ukraines vote to uh basically to secede and set itself up independently   democracy hm   uh is quite a remarkable   oh   accomplishment is that is that reported in the Texas papers   oh sure well yeah we  we we hear a little of the news  uh God i have heard about that the last couple of days how how big is the Ukraine the area do you know   um as an area its not   or a population or anything im really uninformed   i im afraid i dont have the statistics in front of me it said   umhum   its not a tiny area um if i was looking at a US map i would say it was sort of reminds me of of a uh well its not as big as California proportionately maybe   umhum umhum   but but but its its more significant  in the sense of its a great agricultural region     oh i see oh i i didnt really know that i know a lot of their oh their countries that they had overtaken or wanted to be independent or several of them right and uh Estonia what about Estonia are they   yeah theyre theyre completely out now   right i thought they were   yeah the three the three Baltic uh republics got out as quickly as they could   but but the Ukraine Ukraine is especially significant because it of the agriculture   right its its very important for the economics of the whole of the Soviet Union   um so they would have a probably really fight to keep it in if they could   right right um except they cant fight  its done done democratically um   no they dont and Bush has already given his  opinion on it right didnt i read that   yes yes   so now uh not that they may that may matter i dont know anymore  i um fear for the Russians from what i read you know i wonder how theyre gonna get through the winter   um   foodwise or any wise sounds to me like theyll start rioting soon or not that that would do any good but i guess people do that when theyre desperate   that thats true uh hasnt happened here for a while but it um   well thats true since the Depression i guess when the veterans went to Washington and   umhum   and well you know with war riots of course lets lets hope we dont get to that point  things are not so good in Texas jobwise       no ive ive heard theyre i hear you have some problems   well we do we have lots and lots of uh layoffs here lot of companies folding lot of layoffs and its pretty scary   do you do you do you blame the the government in Washington for this   well i dont understand economics that well i dont know i i  i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we dont   yes   and so i assume that that has some effect   yeah   or a great effect and i do uh i mean they said during the Reagan Reagan Bush years the rich got richer the poor got poorer the statistics prove that   umhum umhum   so um  i i guess   so i mean you think its its you think its Reagan and Bush have done this or is it just coincidence it was during this period   well i really dont know i think maybe they uh  maybe they contributed to it maybe they should pay more attention to these trade  or you know to the more equalization of the trade   umhum   of course if somebody in in China China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions well i dont know whats gonna happen then   oh the Chinese use slave labor too thats thats one of the ways they get away with it   right and child labor right well i dont know what do you think has caused our horrible situation   yeah um i dont think theres any one one simple answer to the whole thing i mean its thats very complicated   one thing right well they say too that having a democratic congress and republican President is not good the i mean ive read that is a theory   so which one are we gonna throw out   well i hate to say it but i im tending to go stray back into my original democratic party  i i   uhhuh Texas Texas used to be a democratic state didnt it   oh i know it used to right well you dont run into too many democrats anymore for a while i kind of deserted the party but now it its looking better to me   i like your governor   oh do you oh im glad to hear that well i think so too i i just admire her her a lot   shes an impressive woman yeah   and uh i hope i really hope she does well but shes uh know  you know probably more popular out of the state than she is here although she did manage to win but look who she was running against you know     well yeah anybody could beat Claytie in Texas   he shot himself in the foot so many times oh how did you get on this TI thing     oh i i know some of the people
