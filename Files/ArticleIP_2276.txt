                                 Such a Deal            If you want to understandthe bitter debate over rent control that now dominates social interaction inNew York you have to begin by ignoring arguments about social justice marketeconomics and all appeals to principle Instead apply crude Marxist dogmaIts a battle of naked class interest The catch is that the classesglowering at each other across the barricades arent rich and poor Theyre theNew Yorkers with scandalously sweet deals vs all those who get screwed as aresult            Recentexperience has done much to reinforce my own class consciousness as a member ofthe latter group My wife and I were minding our own business in an unregulatedapartment in the rapidly gentrifying East Village when we returned from workone day to a letter informing us that our already to nonNew Yorkers alarmingrent of  was going up  Thats for a largish onebedroom in amarginal neighborhood This catapulted us into Manhattanrealestate hell aplace where rapacious brokers extract usurious commissions on glorified broomclosets renting for  a month We lucked out relatively speaking Thanksto a connection we fell into a nice  onebedroom in Chelsea withoutpaying a finders fee Absent the artificial shortage created by rentregulation we would either have a bigger place or pay much less for the oneweve got            The moral and economic arguments against rent control arepretty much unassailable Under the present system government intervenes inthe market to protect a class of people defined to some extent by longtermresidency but to an even larger extent by luck This massive intrusion in therealestate market which might be hard to justify even if it had purelybeneficial consequences has a number of obviously disastrous ones It detersyoung people and new immigrants from moving to New York City it encourageslandlords to neglect their buildings it makes them hate their tenants Buteven as a victim of this misbegotten system I hope Joseph Bruno theRepublican state Senate leader who has been threatening to let all the rulesexpire on June  cuts a deal to let rent control continue a little longerNew York City is a highly complex weirdly evolved organismkind of like apickled old codger living on gin and cigarettes He should have startedbehaving more sensibly a long time ago but forcing him to suddenly do it nowwould be an act of cruelty more likely to kill him than to make himhealthier            What wouldhappen if rent regulations were really abolished Its a pretty safe bet thatin most parts of Manhattan market rents would settle in somewhere between the a month I pay and the  that others pay for nearly identicalapartments in the same building Using the estimates promoted by the RentStabilization Association the newspeak name for the group representinglandlords who actually wish to end rent stabilization the typicalonebedroom in the Village or on the Upper West Side might go for  to after the shakeout A rent like that calls for a pretax income of atleast  Once you figure in New York City and state taxes a morerealistic figure would be  A twobedroom apartment suitable for raisinga child in might cost only a bit over  which would demand an income ofat least  These are conservative estimates I find it hard to imaginebargains like that being freely available even in a totally deregulatedmarket            The poor who are subsidized directly and arelikely to be exempted even in the case of radical decontrol would stay putWhat Manhattan would lose is what remains of its middle class those earningbetween  and say  This would mean a tremendous blow to thecitys social variety and cultural vitality Gone would be the usedbookstoreowner the publicschool teacher the family thats been in the same Upper WestSide building for  years the office manager a guy I actually know whoattends every performance of the Metropolitan Opera Without protection forthose marginal cosmopolitan souls who cling to it tenuously Manhattan wouldbecome much more the way people who dont live here imagine it a soullessplayground for yuppies with an alienated underclass underfoot The city wouldbecome more rational and less charmingmore like Tokyo less like Rome Theirony is that the yuppies who would benefit financially from the end of therentcontrol system would probably like living here much less without it            Decontrolwould also make New York uglier One of the big points made by opponents ofrent control is that the present system prevents the construction of newbuildings Because rent regulations say you cant evict people when theirleases are up if they even have leases one obstinate tenement dweller canblock the creation of a story highrise But who wants new buildings inManhattan What an apartment building looks likeon the outsideaffectseverybody not just the landlord and the tenant New Yorks old buildings aregracious and charming even those that are rundown Its new onesat leastthose of the residential varietyare generally horrible It is rent controlthat has preserved the aesthetic as well as the social fabric of the kind ofvariegated lowrise neighborhoods Jane Jacobs celebrated in The Death andLife of Great American Cities  which in many other places were knocked downto make way for highrise development Manhattan again like Rome should beregarded as largely finished            In all likelihood there will be a compromise on rentcontrol Lets hope its not like the luxury decontrol compromise in when everyone agreed to end controls for those with incomes over whose apartments rented for over  Both conditions apply which meansthat if you earn  million and your eightroom apartment on Central Park Westonly costs  you get away unmolested Rentcontrol defenders stick up forthe worst excesses of the system on Realpolitik grounds they want therich on their side in the fight to keep the whole shebang But given theoutrage such excesses generate advocates would be better off cutting the richloose and gaining a modicum of redistributive equity for their side of theargument Any sane person has to be against rent control after hearing aboutBernardAlexis Poisson de Menars a French marquis who a few years ago wasreported by Newsday to be paying  a month for a duplex on theUpper East Side that he didnt even live in When his landlord tried to lurehim into a smaller apartment in the same neighborhood he insisted that itwould not befit a man of his class and social station This time theluxury threshold will probably be scaled back while exempting anyone over regardless of income Surely there should be an exemption for middle andlowerincome elderly But why should Alistair Cooke get to keep hogging thoseeight rooms on Fifth Avenue for  If he wants all that space let him payfor it            The goal of a rentregulation compromise shouldbe to diminish unfairness and mitigate perverse side effects without giving ashock to the citys social system This argues for a fairly straightforwardmeans test for rent control say  a year There will be people some ofthem elderly who make more than  but still cant afford the rentstheir apartments could command on the free market They will have to move Howbig a tragedy is that            The other essential reformis vacancy decontrol which would allow landlords to charge market rent whenapartments empty Tenant groups argue that this gives landlords an incentiveto harass tenants But landlords have plenty of incentive to harass tenantsnow since theyre already allowed to raise the rent somewhat when an apartmentchanges hands The intergenerational handing down of rentcontrolledapartments which Gov George Pataki favors perhaps on the Republicanprinciple that no form of inherited wealth is bad should also disappear Thesereforms would mean that rent control would evanesce over the next  or years It would be Nicorette for New Yorks neighborhoods instead of coldturkey
