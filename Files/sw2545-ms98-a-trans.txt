                um so do you have a personal computer   uh well we do have one in in our home uh its on the fritz right now because the monitor isnt working properly but uh it has been uh used tremendously mostly by my children for uh playing games   oh   however um you know the bane of our existence these days uh but it does have a word processing program which all of us have used for reports reports and papers and that sort of thing   yeah thats what when this subject was mentioned to us i said well i went gee thats all i use mine for is a word processor and i havent used it since i got out of college and that was six years ago   oh wow   but it it was my sisters who my sister bought it   uhhuh   and uh my father had a small business and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business and he never did he always did everything out by hand he only had three employees so   oh oh yeah   you know it wasnt really worth it to him to do to do it   yeah actually it would be worth it if he were able to get a program that would do something that he normally had to do by hand   yeah like pay the payroll and yeah basically payroll   exactly and there are lots of them on the market   yeah   but you do have to research that find out what works for your system what kind do you have   um its an IBM i think its a Professional Three Hundred no thats thats the digital one its an uh IBM PC Junior i think   oh well thats a nice computer   yeah she she uh she uses it now uh my sister to actually she moved and my father wasnt using it she  took it with he   uhhuh so she took it with her yeah dont blame her     because she needed it to do she just finished up her Bachelors degree so i dont know if shes going to even use it anymore it its   uhhuh yeah oh well well encourage her to try other things because um i am uh i work in a school system and i teach writing and we use the computers a great deal for word processing uh you know because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer as you probably found out yourself   yeah   but um i also am sponsoring a literary magazine and were doing our entire layout on the computer uh because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have a publishing program   oh yeah thats thats neat thats a very good use   so it is wonderful once you get into some of the programs that are out now you can do so much with them   yeah   that you dont do until you really make yourself use them   well i know there theres got to be a lot of uses but its just you you have to have a need   you have to make yourself do it yeah   yeah but you have to have a need i really have no need for it at all um i work for Digital Equipment and we have a powerful computer down at work   yeah uhhuh oh  so you dont need a personal one   no and i i still really dont do that much as you say play games on it     yeah yeah yeah   theyre great for playing games my brother   right well my son is uh studying electronic technology and hes been able to do things on uh on the personal computer here that really have enhanced his um reports and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way   yeah   um and i guess it if youre doing that sort of thing its really useful but  um unless it is i guess its kind of a waste   i know some people who just they just went through a course uh and took the electronic grafting course   oh thats fascinating uhhuh   drafting not grafting  but drafting course the CAD   yeah i knew what you meant yeah   yeah and thats really neat i mean yeah you can do graphs graphs on it too but this is you know this is one step above it but its actual um drafting and i always   yeah yes you can do wonderful design it its really  well especially when anyone whos ever done any kind of drafting or engineering  uh drawing drawing um you have to be so precise   yeah and the computer does it all for you   yeah   so it was really neat i wanted to go to that course but my boss wouldnt pay for it im like ill get a job some day and my boss will pay for it ill be needed   oh well yeah   because um i i i didnt want to go do it myself because i didnt think i was really going to use it   uhhuh     i got this cough ive got a cold because it was eighty degrees up here and i went outside with no coat on   oh boy  what a change huh     yeah it was bad yes it was a big change   yeah   you couldnt really wear a coat because it was so hot and then again i picked up a cold   right      but im doing all right getting over it   well thats good   so i dont i dont even know how much um personal computers cost nowadays   well they vary tremendously um because you can get because youre theyre uh the ones that were made a few years ago  uh have come down in price significantly um you can get them ive seen them for five and six hundred dollars but theyre much less  um have much less memory and capable of much less   yeah they cant do your um your drafting and your graphs and all of that   no you cant do very much on them right right um well its just that you have to have uh you have to be able to get your program in and and many many of the programs are so big         uh they take up so much space that you dont have any place then to work you dont have any bytes left but um if you um   yeah   if if you want to go into one thats really useful youre going to have to go over a thousand dollars and even for a personal computer its probably smart to spend that much and and weve ours is not quite that powerful and so you know we are we are limited which may be one reason why   you do run into you do run into limitations on yours oh wow   oh yeah uhhuh some things we cant do but but then we havent needed to either you know um but weve been able to do what we can   yeah wow thats neat that you even you even reach the limits of yours i havent even begun to reach the limits of  it ive   no but i mine is not as good as a PC uh   yeah junior yeah   uh Junior yeah yeah ours is a Commodore    yeah   and it its not quite as um as useful not quite as powerful     yeah   so   they say that Commodore has made a good um PC for the price though   they did yeah thats very true thats very true they did   very competitive i dont even i dont even know much money my sister spent on hers but i i just thought i its its going to be a waste shes not going to do it not going to use it   sounds like he that you were right   oh well yeah well she likes it she gets to write her reports but like i say she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wan ted   yeah and she could have bought a typewriter also   yeah a typewriter with memory would would have been fine its all she ever uses it for     yeah yeah   um i think it might have a spelling editor on it im not sure um   yeah it yeah it probably if she if it doesnt she could easily put it on   yeah yeah thats one of the one great thing about it   yeah right right which program did you use did you use Word Perfect   um no i i really dont its it was six years ago she pretty much set it up she goes here this is you make your file and then you can uh edit it right   oh yeah     um i used the one the one at work a lot um matter of fact anything ive had to write from now on i had to  God forbid write a couple of resumes and i was just great and all you have to do is just put it in a uh the spelling check mode and  i dont even have to look my my words up anymore   uhhuh yeah theyre great youre right well i guess weve spent our time i need to go help my daughter do something so   oh okay good   this has been fun talking to you   okay yeah well bye   good luck uh byebye
