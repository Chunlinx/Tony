                    Background        Sucraseisomaltase SI EC  is an        enterocytespecific small intestine brushborder membrane        disaccharidase It is required for hydrolysis of dietary        sucrose and some starches Because absorption cannot take        place until monosaccharides are produced SI deficiency        leads to increased luminal disaccharides and consequent        osmotic diarrhea Although generally thought to have a        later presentation    than other primary intestinal        malabsorption syndromes recent reports of infants with SI        deficiency indicate the existence of an early onset form        presentation of diarrhea at  weeks that is        complicated by severe malnutrition     Starnes and        Walsh    observed renal calculi in two adults with        sucrase deficiency but neither patient had evidence of        hypercalcemia In contrast hypercalcemia frequently        complicates congenital lactase deficiency     The        present case illustrates the occurrence of hypercalcemia        and nephrocalcinosis as a clinically significant        complication of SI deficiency in an infant and suggests        that common mechanisms may lead to hypercalcemia in both SI        and congenital lactase deficiency                    Case Presentation        The patient was a  month old caucasian female infant        presenting with failure to thrive FTT metabolic        acidosis and hypercalcemia She was the product of a term        uncomplicated pregnancy in a yearold and delivered        without complications She had been growing well and        thriving until weaned from breast milk to formula at age         months when she began to have frequent stools and poor        weight gain Formula and diet changes were attempted        without improvement She was seen by a pediatric        gastroenterologist and underwent colonoscopy a biopsy from        which showed eosinophilic inflammation Upper GI tract        endoscopy was interrupted because of sedation problems She        was treated with glucocorticoids and her formula was        changed to Neocate  mg Ca mL with some initial        improvement The glucocorticoids were discontinued at age         months but she still gained weight poorly routine        chemistry analyses showed evolving hypercalcemia        outpatient calcium peak  mgdL Figure  and        persistent metabolic acidosis She was admitted to the        hospital for evaluation and treatment of hypercalcemia        FTT and metabolic acidosis        Other than skin changes consistent with wasting her        examination was benign There was no abnormal flatus or        bloating but there had been intermittent blood in the        stool with some mucous Laboratory studies are shown in        Table  The intact parathyroid hormone PTH was        appropriately suppressed to  pgmL with concomitant serum        calcium of  mgdL and ionized calcium Ca          mmolL normal  other pertinent laboratory        values included phosphorus  mgdL magnesium  mgdL        alkaline phosphatase  IUL PTHrelated peptide PTHrp        appropriately undetectable at  pmolL normal          hydroxy Vitamin D  ngmL reference lab normal        range for age  years   and dihydroxy        Vitamin D level  pgmL reference lab normal range for        age  years   The urine calcium was  mgdL        with urine creatinine   mgdL Renal ultrasound        demonstrated nephrocalcinosis The hemiskeletal bone age        was interpreted to be delayed to that of a  month old        Stools were positive for leukocytes and trace reducing        substances Normal karyotype and normal fluorescent insitu        hybridization FISH for the elastin gene locus on        chromosome   XX negative ELN q along with a        negative echocardiogram helped exclude Williams syndrome        She initially was treated with intravenous normal saline        followed by furosemide with only transient improvement        Recurrent hypercalcemia prompted a day course of        intravenous pamidronate  mgkg per dose leading to        sustained highnormal serum calcium Figure  She was        discharged home She was empirically treated with        Polycitra for the persistent metabolic acidosis but        ongoing FTT prompted reevaluation        At time of second admission the infant was taking        Neocate supplemented with  jars of baby food fruits per        day plus Polycitra Gross motor development was delayed        but other developmental axes were intact Family history        was significant for Hashimotos thyroiditis in the mother        maternal aunt and maternal grandfather The parents were        both of European ethnic origin and there was no        consanguinity Physical examination showed an alert        nondysmorphic infant with severe reduction in muscle mass        and subcutaneous fat Frequent loose watery stools were        noted A skeletal survey showed striking linear bone        density increase in the epiphyses in an area adjacent to        the growth plate Figure A Follow up admission        laboratory studies are shown in Table  Specifically the        calcitonin was  pgmL normal   and the Vitamin A        concentration was  gdL  The urine calcium was         mgdL and calciumcreatinine ratio of  EKG showed        a normal QTc Renal ultrasound confirmed nephrocalcinosis        Figure B Upper endoscopy with biopsy revealed areas of        mild focal chronic inflammatory cells in the stomach        Colonoscopy showed no bowel wall inflammation but copious        watery stool Stool sodium was  mmolL        The persistence of hypercalcemia with diarrhea prompted        a nuclear medicine scan with  mCi of indium        pentetreotide to pursue a possible paraneoplastic process           which showed uptake in the right orbital region A head        CT and MRI demonstrated an infiltrating lesion in the right        orbit along the inferior and lateral compartment of the        orbit involving the intra and extracoronal space There        was no obvious lytic change or periostosis however there        were flow voids consistent with a vascular malformation No        abnormalities in extraocular movements globe or retina        were observed These findings were interpreted as        consistent with a benign orbital hemangioma Serial follow        up studies confirm that the lesion is not growing indeed        there is evidence of fatty involution        Small bowel biopsies taken at the time of endoscopy        revealed lactase  Mming    abnormal less        than  sucrase  Mming    abnormal less        than  maltase  Mming    abnormal        less than  leading to the diagnosis of        sucraseisomaltase deficiency Sucrose free diet with        Sucraid enzyme replacement was prescribed followed by        changing feeds to A base formula with supplemental        anhydrous dextrose Ca  mg mL resulting in a prompt        cessation of diarrhea Urine calciumcreatinine ratio        decreased to  Her weight has steadily improved Figure         Residual muscle weakness in the lower extremities is        being treated with physical therapy                    Causes of hypercalcemia in infancy        An extensive evaluation of our patient failed to        identify any abnormality in calcium regulation It should        be emphasized that our patient demonstrated        nephrocalcinosis prior to alkalinization with Polycitra to        combat her metabolic acidosis Urine alkalinization is a        common strategy to treat urate and cysteine renal stones        Animal and preliminary human studies suggest acidphosphate        replacement vs neutralphosphate therapy is of equal        benefit and does not perturb calciumphosphorus metabolism        in children with phosphatewasting rickets     Infants        with hypercalcemia may have no obvious symptoms but        constitutional symptoms such as poor appetite        irritability vomiting FTT or occasionally seizures may        occur     Classically hypercalcemia leads to increased        urine output and diminished stool frequency Physical signs        may include hypotonia dehydration and bradycardia        Laboratory abnormalities can include short QTc and elevated        creatinine Increased urinary calcium is an expected        compensatory response with associated increased risk of        renal calculi The differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia        in infants includes hyperparathyroidism familial        hypocalciuric hypercalcemia hypervitaminosis        paraneoplastic processes and Williams syndrome        Hyperparathyroidism may be either sporadic or familial        arising from either adenoma or parathyroid hyperplasia        Familial hyperparathyroidism may be confined to parathyroid        adenoma HRPT  or may involve the broader        endocrine disturbances of multiple endocrine neoplasia        Types I  and IIA  MENI results from        mutations in menin a regulator of TGF signaling in a        variety of tissues     MENIIA results form mutations in        RET a cell surface growth factor receptor with intrinsic        tyrosine kinase activity     Familial hypocalciuric        hypercalcemia  generally autosomal dominant and        caused by mutations in the renal calcium sensing receptor             is excluded rather easily based on urinary        calcium levels of the patient and parents        Both hypervitaminoses D and A are potential causes of        hypercalcemia Prolonged feeding with over fortified milk        or vitamin preparations has been reported as sources of        excess intake of vitamin D Abnormal vitamin D metabolism        resulting from inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis or        tuberculosis or as seen in neonatal fat necrosis are        additional potential causes albeit highly unlikely in        young infants     The mechanism is thought to be due        to increased hydroxylase activity leading to increased        production of dihydroxy Vitamin D        While neoplasia with osseous metastasis is a potential        cause of hypercalcemia tumors may also secrete materials        such as PTHrp or other osteoclastactivating factors        cytokines or other growth factors that modulate bone        remodeling leading to calcium adsorption from bone Chronic        immobilization can also lead to enhanced bone        resorption        Williams syndrome is a well described birth defect        complex characterized by FTT branch pulmonary artery        stenosis supravalvular aortic stenosis dysmorphic facies        mental retardation and infantile hypercalcemia Williams        syndrome results from a constitutional deletion in        chromosome q     The cause of hypercalcemia        associated with Williams syndrome is not well understood        but has been postulated to be associated with enhanced        intestinal absorption of calcium The presence or absence        of significant hypercalcemia does not correlate with the        deletion size                        Sucraseisomaltase deficiency        Sucraseisomaltase deficiency is a rare autosomal        recessive disorder in which there is complete absence of        sucrase and most of the maltase digestive activity The        usual presentation generally is at weaning from breast milk        when infants are first exposed to the offending        carbohydrates       Upon ingestion of        disaccharides and oligosaccharides the failure to        breakdown sucrose into fructose and glucose results in an        osmoticfermentative diarrhea Occasional patients may come        to attention in late childhood or adulthood but careful        history often indicates that symptoms have appeared earlier             The mainstay of treatment is dietary        restriction of sucrosecontaining foods Effective enzyme        replacement with whole yeast cells has been reported            Purified yeast enzyme sacrosidase is a highly effective        adjunct to dietary restriction            The enzyme itself is composed of  amino acids        encoded by a  bp mRNA The gene locus has  exons        spanning  kB ProSI is anchored in the membrane by a         amino acid membranespanning segment This is followed        by a  amino acid stalk on which sit the  globular        catalytic domains The catalytic domains are similar to one        another  amino acid identity indicating that they have        arisen by duplication and divergence     One estimate        indicated a  mutant heterozygote frequency in European        Americans    but given the rarity of diagnosed SI        deficiency this seems high Sucrase deficiency may be        especially common in indigenous Greenlanders estimated         and is accompanied most often by lactase deficiency             Initial studies demonstrated that most SI mutations        result in lack of enzyme protein ie null mutation            Mutation may alter the posttranslational processing of        the enzyme only for the asparagineslinked highmannose        groups but not the mature oligosaccharides The resulting        enzyme is both mislocalized and unstable     Another        mutation QP was found to cause retention of SI in the        transport pathway between the endoplasmic reticulum and        Golgi apparatus     An unusual mutation QR that        alters the structure close to the Oglycosylated stalk        domain leads to random distribution of the enzyme to both        the apical and basolateral cell membranes     An        unusual human mutation that causes SI to be secreted rather        than retained in the plasma membrane demonstrates that the        enzyme is required to be at the enterocyte cell surface                               Disaccharidase deficiency and hypercalcemia        A single case report potentially relates SI deficiency        with disturbance of calcium metabolism In that study two        adults presented with renal calculi and nephrocalcinosis            Lactase deficiency may give rise to metabolic bone        disease     More pertinently Saarela et al described         of  infants with congenital lactase deficiency who had        hypercalcemia at the time of initial presentation            Five of these  infants had medullary nephrocalcinosis The        mechanism by which congenital lactase deficiency induces        hypercalcemia is uncertain There may be roles for chronic        metabolic acidosis and dehydration in promoting both        increased bone mobilization of calcium and thus increasing        the risk of renal deposition Nonhydrolyzed lactose may        also exert a direct enhancing effect on calcium absorption        in the ileum In other conditions with chronic diarrhea        such as inflammatory bowel disease renal stones have been        composed of calcium phosphate or oxalate            Alternatively it is possible that both SI and lactase are        connected mechanistically to intestinal calcium homeostasis        through molecular interactions with calcium transporters        In this regard SI lactase and the receptor for         OHVitD VDR share transcriptional regulation through the        homeodomain transcription factor CDX      The        possibility that SI or lactase deficiency could cause        secondary upregulation of VDR awaits exploration in cell        culture or animal models                    Conclusions        We conclude that SI deficiency should be added to the        list of disorders that can cause infantile hypercalcemia        and particularly may be considered when accompanied by FTT        and watery diarrhea In addition infants with SI        deficiency should have careful monitoring of serum calcium        Prolonged periods of diet noncompliance may increase the        risk of chronic renal disease secondary to        nephrocalcinosis Infants presenting with persistent        watery diarrhea should be evaluated for SI
