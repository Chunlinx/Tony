              uh you know i when i was much younger uh than i am now i i had wanted to go to the Peace Corps and uh seems like i it it was something that i i really wanted wanted to do   can you speak up please   seems like wanting to go to the Peace Corps was something that i had really wanted to do when i was young   yes   but uh i dont believe they accept you after you you know after youre married and you have uh kids and all that so i got into that and i wasnt able to   uh   to uh participate   but they will accept you later in life also   oh they will   yeah after your children are grown   oh i didnt know that   yes   then theres no age limit   no   your kidding   no im not some of the people that have been involved with Peace Corps among other things were retired teachers uh there was a retired plumber that went to uh uh Uruguay i think and helped them quite a bit with concepts in plumbing you know providing for a for better public hygiene   goodness im surprised i really had no idea   yeah but so do you think that people should be required to give a couple years for the good of the country   well i dont i dont really think that they should they should be it should be mandatory i mean   why   well i dont know i its that just might not be something that everybody wants to do i mean there are a lot of people who would like to do it and there are a lot of people who get into other things and they get all involved and they just you know dont want to or dont have the time   well i understand but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our seventeenth and uh twenty sixth birthday to give a year or two to the to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or the Peace Corps or something you know the military service or something wouldnt we have uh maybe a better class of Americans   i dont see how that can can make a better class of Americans to make everybody to make it mandatory for everybody to participate   a lot of these people a lot of our uh pardon the terminology but yuppies now are interested in one thing and one thing only and thats themselves   thats true well i dont i dont think that   and at least if you legislated giving for a couple years of their lives or or uh a actually purely giving but but some sort of equitable exchange then at least the country would have gotten two years from them where hum they would have given something to the country instead of take taking away all their lives   yeah are are you suggesting then that if if uh if i have to go and and do something for the country for two years that the country will compensate me in some way   uh   i i will be compensated for this im not just going to   give them your time give them your entire life for two years no   okay   it will be a job of sorts im sure that the Peace Corps pays it doesnt pay well its not top wages   umhum   but but it does pay   umhum   the military for young hiring in soldiers does pay it doesnt pay well   umhum   okay currently in our country especially in some regions theres an employment problem   that that thats true but in even in our region theres an employment problem  theres a lot of uh   youre aware of that im sure   people gotten laid off lately you know from  companies like General Dynamics and Texas Instruments   and Texas Instruments   thousands and thousands of people are out there looking for jobs   you know in in another time we had the WPA   no no   Works Progress Administration   im not familiar with that   during the great depression   oh i   though i cant see why it was great uh that gave people pay that was halfway between relief which was welfare   umhum   and the minimum wage   i see and that was that was some  some some program where people gave their time   in trade for   in trade for   money   some money okay   and and living they gave them food and uniforms and uh here in Colorado youll find a great many things public roads that were worked on by the WPA uh dams that were built by the WPA uh scenic overlooks parks   umhum   we are road our road systems falling apart our  our national road system system of highways   umhum   and roads is falling apart   well then i guess there are a lot of a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country   there theres a lot of work to be done   umhum i really i really dont see anything wrong with it i just dont think that it should be mandatory that every person have to do that   i i cant see the problem in it for a year the   well   what what im saying is that if it were mandatory that every person right after graduation from high school   uhhuh   that were able bodied   umhum   would give a year well or not give a year but but trade a year then they at least one not more than say three or four then it would definitely effect unemployment   all right i wonder if if they didnt make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering to to to do it that it you know that they would have enough   i dont know   i mean i i probably   well you know Texas New Mexico Colorado huge numbers of other western states have no real welfare system   umhum      theres Aid to Dependent Children and Aid to Mothers of Dependent Children but theres no real welfare system   uhhuh   but if we took these people off off the streets for a year there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else and who knows maybe some of our graduating high school seniors might would find out a little bit more the what the traditional American work ethic means you know we have had some problem with that in recent years   oh well yes we have with with uh recent generations i i know exactly what you are talking about i i mean i know several people who do not wish wish to work   uh they wish only for the paycheck   well they wish for the money and they they decide that theyre going to get the money anyway they can with you know without uh without without working in the the traditional American   really producing   job market   yeah be it selling drugs or whatever   right so what im saying they they get the money anyway they can   yeah yeah and maybe if we instilled the work ethic you know i enjoy the i enjoy working   yeah
