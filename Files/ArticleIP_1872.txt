                                 Master P            Master P a k a PercyMiller reigns as king of rap The yearold has two albums inBillboard s Top  Rappers on his No Limit record label have fourmore and he has just signed Snoop Dogg hiphops biggest star to a recordingcontract Master Ps new movie a blaxploitation comedy titled I Got theHookUp  which he wrote produced and stars in has already grossed million far more than the  million he spent to make it His No Limitempire has been valued at  million Hiphops leading magazinesVibe and the Source  have run adoring cover stories about himand even the New York Times has anointed him raps savviest mogul            TheMaster P phenomenon is an object lesson in how far rap hasnt come as an artand how far it has come as a business First how far it hasnt come The hypeabout Master P has overlooked the banality of his music He is unapologeticallyghetto He was a teenage hood in New Orleanshis terrible autobiographicalmovie Im Bout It  hints that he was a major crackhouse operatorandhe likes to say that his music is authentic Namely It celebrates the thuglife of drugs violence and general sociopathic idiocy            Every man is a nigga every woman a bitch and all andsundry are motherfuckas The title track of his  triple platinum albumGhetto D  is a recipe for making crack from cocaine Master P hits allthe clichs of gangster rap the elegy honoring murdered homeboys thechronicle of his rise through the drugdealing ranks the tribute to marijuanathe paean to his gun The rhymes are crude though the beats are potent as inthis clip of his trademark groan unghh The artists on his labelKane Abel Fiend Silkk the Shocker CMurder Mac Mia X etchew to the samegangster themes Master Ps marketing does too No Limit album covers are heavyon guns bikinied women gold jewelry wads of cash and No Limits logo agold and diamondencrusted tank            Master Pin short promotes and produces the same socially appalling if aurallyappealing kind of rap that had parents and William Bennett predicting the endof civilization five years ago Back then Master P would have sparked publicoutcry and condemnation Why doesnt he today Why is there no hue and cryabout this monster            Gangster rap was supposed to be a minorperversion a sick dead end It was supposed to have been killed by nowmurdered by public backlash or by the resurgence of R  B or by its ownfratricidal strife But instead of dying gangster rap has beeninstitutionalized thanks to Master P as well as Tupac Shakur and others Ithas become clich Familiarity has bred indifference No Limits music does notoutrage because it does not surprise            Master Pis and I mean this in the best possible way a hack He sticks to theconventions of the genre and produces derivative competent music Even hisadmirers admit he breaks no new ground and is essentially a skilled imitator ofmore innovative artists But hackdom I would argue may be the proof of agenres maturity Motown spawned zillions of copycat acts and grunge joinedthe mainstream when Nirvana ripoffs began winning gold records Master P toorepresents the mainstreaming of a onceoutrageous art            There is another reason why Master P doesnt prompt anyoutrage the glorification of the entrepreneur No one pays attention to whathe sells because everyone is so fascinated by how he sells it Rap has alwaysbeen a commercial affair and there is a long history of hiphopentrepreneursDef Jams Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin Death Rows SugeKnight Bad Boys Puff Daddy Master Ps chief rival to name a fewbut theremay not have been anyone with better business instincts than Master P            In sixyears he has turned a tiny California record store into a multimedia empireThe No  lesson of the Master P school of management ownership Musicianshave been getting ripped off by their record companies as long as there havebeen record companies Master P wouldnt permit that to happen to him He isthe most independent of the independent producers He started selling recordsout of his own car and he hasnt relinquished control of anything yet He ownshis master recordings his studio his label By paying the production costs ofI Got the HookUp out of his own pocket and retaining ownership of ithe stands to make at least twice as much as he would have if he had takenMiramaxs  million offer to buy it outright This is a business whereeveryone has a anhour attorney negotiating for them You have to admire Pfor doing all this on his own putting the records and movies out himself andturning it into a nine figure company says rap legend Bill Stephney CEO ofStepSun Music            The other guiding principles of the Master Poperation are volume and speed What Roger Corman is to movies he is to rapNo Limit CDs usually include  songsnearly twice as many as other hiphopCDs He sells double albums at single album prices He works fast producinghis latest straighttovideo movie Da Last Don  in  days and herecords albums in even less time Everything is branded and tied together AllNo Limit albums advertise coming albums by other No Limit artists He makesmovies in order to sell soundtracks The crossmarketing works No Limit CDsadvertised months in advance inside other No Limit CDs sell hundreds ofthousands of copies in their first week in record stores No single Master Pproduct is phenomenally successful but there are lots of them and all areprofitable It adds up He has taken his vast fortune and diversified He runsa sportsmanagement company a shoe store a gas station a clothing line anda phonesex firm            Thedoityourself bootstrapping ethos is admirable but Master P also representssomething more atavistic He sometimes refers to his enterprise as the NoLimit family If its a family its more like the Corleones than theCleavers Master P was a hood and a hustler and even as a corporate man hebehaves like a hood and a hustler He models No Limit on the mob not theFortune  He calls his artists No Limit Soldiers Some of them are namedafter mobsters Gambino Family Goodfellas Lil Gotti Master P values loyaltyand friendship above all Most of his performers are relatives or homeboys Thehiphop industry is concentrated in Los Angeles and New York but he and the NoLimit posse occupy a compound in Baton Rouge La They are well armed and wearbulletproof vests And they dont welcome outsiders            This may not be the best foundation for a durable businessempire Simmons probably raps greatest entrepreneur lives in New Yorkschmoozes bankers fashion designers and record executives and cuts dealswith conglomerates such as Time Warner He is sophisticated urbane wise tocapital flows and big business            Master P by contrast seemsto be following in the footsteps of Knight founder of Death Row Records Inthe early s Knight built Death Row into a phenomenally profitable raplabel even bigger than No Limit is now Suge too imitated mob style valuingloyalty and insularity over all surrounding himself with thuggish croniesDeath Row was run more like a criminal operation than a real business withhuge suspicious cash payments shoddy accounting and management byintimidation Eventually Death Row collapsed Star rapper Shakur was murderedand Knight went to jail            Master P has avoided suchchaos so far But can he forever If he abandons his mob pose and posse heabandons the image and the authenticity that made him a millionaire If hedoesnt he could end up like Knight For Master P neither is an appealingprospect
