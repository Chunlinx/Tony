          well ive been sort of out of it for a little while so i dont know really whats going on   well there theres been some interesting stuff going on locally but i suppose nationally the big thing is probably uh the reaction to the war in the Gulf   yeah all the Democrats trying to show that yeah oh oh gosh we really did support it i mean  just because we wanted to impeach him doesnt mean anything   trying to cover themselves yeah     yeah theres been uh same thing locally here a couple of uh we got a Senator who uh went on national TV and said that you know if Bush tried to do anything over there without Congressional approval they should impeach him and   yeah thats true there theres a lot of talk over there that i dont think anyone imagined that it could possibly be as as successful and and painless as it had been   then yeah yeah   so they figured a little bit of opposition was safe but it didnt turn out that way   sure no uh i dont know i i i usually dont talk politics with people especially strangers because its a good way to get into an argument but   well thats why thats why being strangers is safe we can   its its probably safer at least now cant get hit this way you know     thats true thats true   but uh i i dont know im ive been Republican for as long as i can remember and the Democrats are just so disorganized and they have been   thats true i ive been Democrat for since ive been voting which isnt that long but ill agree with you there that theres not much organization going on   yeah they uh yeah i i dont know it right around the turn of uh oh gosh  i should say the eighties now now its already the nineties i forgot i forget that too   umhum   they they just havent seemed to been able to hit anything uh on the head every every time they go one way the wind is always blowing the other which is   well thats true but i suppose its hard to judge from the eighties because um Reagan was just so overwhelming to them i think theyre seeing some of that unraveling these days but   yeah yeah no i dont i dont know how theyre going uh i i you know im looking im looking at the upcoming elections and im trying to think who are they going to put up   well theyve already got uh oh jeez theres theres theres already one candidate that i know of on the Democratic end and i keep thinking theres a second one uh Paul Tsongas   oh Tsongas   yeah uh out of Massachusetts i think   yeah i wouldnt mind him too much hes a pretty good guy hes been around and hes he keeps a low profile and doesnt go after the the headlines and stuff   umhum   uh   ive ive ive heard the name but that thats the extent of my my information about him   yeah yeah i i would be interested to see if Sam Nunn decides to go this time i i   umhum try to get the conservative candidate for once   yeah i mean if out out of all the Democrats that i could think to run i would he is one that i would i would definitely like to see   that that would be interesting i i must admit i havent been really enthusiastic about the Democratic entrants in the last couple of run throughs   well ill tell you if they if they do it like they did uh the last time around its not going to be very exciting       you know um i mean lets face Dukakis and Bentsen and Bentsen good grief surely they could have done better than that course they they had a they had themselves between a rock and a hard place they had on the one hand they had Jesse Jackson with all that support and on the other they knew very   but completely unelectable and   oh sure and and they could not give him the nomination   true its its probably their their their troubles probably stem from the fact that theyre such a diverse party   uh i yeah   and the nominating rules these days are so um pseudo democratic i guess   umhum   you cant have the people in the back rooms deciding well who could we really get elected instead theres so much   yeah i mean i mean they were really stuck because here they were everybody was expecting Jesse Jesse to get at least the VP nomination   umhum   uh certainly not presidential but but quite possibly VP and here they are they they know very well they cant do it because if they do its going to split the party and if they do it theyre going to alienate a whole bunch of others so i mean they were stuck one way or the other yeah it was an interesting thing i was laughing through the whole thing uh   true i suppose being on the other side of the aisle it probably made good comic theater   yeah i it it it was it was it was comical i i sat there and watched the just watched CNN and just giggle all night you know uh oh this is great George Bush is in     yeah thats true thats true   and i think Bush has turned out to be a lot better President than people gave him credit for   i i must admit im im still i i still find him a little uninspiring he he seems like a reasonably competent   yeah he is he yeah he he is   person to sort of do do some caretaking to um   yeah and and i i wonder the you know if if thats i mean that that really that really should be all we need in a president someone who is capable of managing   true   and thats all a president is anyway just a manager   sort of set the agenda and and let let people do the work its its unfortunate how how little domestic agenda he   uh and set the agenda and yeah well you know the Republicans Republicans have always been weak on on the domestic side theyre theyre very big on international stuff but domestically they they just say well itll take care of itself   he he worries about true but uh so many of his compi campaign promises were on the the domestic promises   but its yeah well you know same old you know take it with a grain of salt stuff you know he he   true that thats thats what just amazes me though is that that so many people do uh take the campaign promises seriously   yeah yeah and they still do  he   well the the one thing that just amazed me in in Texas here there were a series of um ads saying dont vote for Dukakis hes going to take away your right to own a gun hes going to close down defense plants hes going to do this hes going to do that   umhum umhum   half of which is coming true   yeah   and i just heres my chance to giggle boy its a good thing we didnt elect that Dukakis guy because i mean   yeah well you know the interesting thing about i dont know if youve been watching Massachusetts lately um   i know i know that the the Massachusetts miracle has has gone bust   oh its a disaster its a disaster and the thing was it was all quick fixes finger in the dike sort of thing to make him look good for the upcoming race   umhum oh i i guess i didnt hear that i didnt go over it really   well i mean that thats what you can infer from it because it its amazing that it started about two years before the the the run   true true i suppose   and then you know it took a few years to crap out but i mean it was dying last year i lived up in Boston   umhum   and i mean it was terrible it was absolutely terrible up prices are just unbelievable up there and the services are getting terrible everythings going down the tubes said he was going to clean up Boston Harbor and its dirtier than it ever was   yeah that really is disappointing its its sort of   never yeah and then on the other hand too while he was out busy running for the presidential thing the legislature was having their own way   umhum   and uh you know it was just it was a pure disaster because the way it was set up hes the one that that put it together and hes the only one who knew how it worked or supposedly worked and he wasnt there to run it   umhum   and so heres a bunch of legislatures with their own agenda uh legislators with their own agenda and of course the thing just fell apart fell to pieces and he couldnt do anything with it it was amazing they had a poll last year about i guess it was around July uh they showed the picture of Dukakis to people in Massachusetts only twenty three percent could recognize him as governor   thats incredible oh oh theres theres one thing ive got to ask you about the the dump Quayle movement i find that interesting   it it was   i wish they would   i i find him such an embarrassment and uh i mean the the the idea of Collin Powell well hes so powerful or hes so popular now   yeah i yeah   i i i dont know if hes the the right one to replace him hed probably be a perfectly competent replacement but   boy i tell you he ill tell you what you know when i was in the Air Force i met i met Collin Powell   really   yeah i was i had a pretty neat job i got to meet all the big wigs used to fly with the president and all that stuff um Collin Powell is one capable guy   i get i i i would probably find him an order of magnitude more capable than Quayle   he oh yes absolutely i i mean the   its its interesting to hear that Bush has       instead instead instead instead of just making bland uh pronouncements about having no plans to change the ticket has just really emphatically come out and said no way   i know i and i ill tell you you know it i i my my degree was in political science because i enjoyed it   umhum   and i had a good time during that during that election but it floored me when he came up with Quayle because there are so many other capable Republicans   well from from some of the things ive heard about Bush he he he didnt want a vice president that was any competition for him   i mean yeah and i mean certainly he wasnt going to take Bob Dole on and not that Bob Dole would even take the position i mean hed be giving up more than hed gain   umhum   but there are several people who are who are just super capable but to get this nobody with the kind of baggage that hes carrying     umhum   i uh it just astounded me i mean he must have been so sure of winning that it didnt make any difference     well it uh uh im i guess im the im cloudy on the timing but there there was quite a while when his certain victory wasnt certain at all   yeah i well   im im not sure how that timing related to the Quayle announcement but he was trailing at at times or or just just neck and neck i guess   yeah i yeah about that time i think it was neck and neck and i the only the only reason at the time that i could think of was that he was young and and sort of charismatic in uh in uh handsome sort of way   umhum   and hoping to bring in maybe a little bit of like Kennedy charisma or something but the guy is so uncharismatic       i mean i mean Bush talks about he doesnt like broccoli well thats how how i think of Dan Quayle as broccoli you know           oh that brings up another subject its the  the the       uh i dont know the
