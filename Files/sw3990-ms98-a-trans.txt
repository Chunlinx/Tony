                im Bridget   hello my names Dan   its nice to meet you are you ready for me to push one   nice to meet you i think so   okay   okay do you have any kids   uh no uh luckily i dont i just rent them   you do   yeah im a im an assistant scout master for a boy scout troop     oh thats good   yeah its its its its so much better to to rent   a little easier   yeah   well what would you think if they were going off to college   ooh thats uh lets see i i used to be able to do this quite well but that was when i was in college   uhhuh   yeah the college that ive got that that i went to was pretty good which was Cal Poly in Pomona   uhhuh   and uh  you know it was a regular it was a state university and it seemed to be pretty good   yeah because im in college right now i thought God this is a good question   oh really which one     i was like because i i know how my parents when i was looking at colleges   umhum   they didnt really say anything i mean they didnt say you know i want you to go here or you know they left it up to me   umhum   and uh i thought it was real interesting because i picked where i wanted to go and then afterwards my mom was like oh i really kind of wish you would have gone there and i didnt even know that shed even you know liked another place or anything   yeah uh   but i dont think parents could make that decision for you     well my my parents wanted me to go to uh community college   uhhuh   and uh i ended up  getting into the university and they never really said anything about it until uh my sisters went to college and they they went to the community college   uhhuh   and my parents my fathers going jeez it it it uh       costs a lot more or just as much to go to community college and you arent getting as much you know so   yeah definitely       because i know people i know some of my friends whose parents really wanted them to go somewhere so they did and they hate it you know   umhum oh yeah   or that they dont do good and they fail out and its like because i know one person   yeah   um his parents wanted him to go to SMU really bad   umhum   and he went and he doesnt like it i mean he wouldnt admit to you that he doesnt like it but it you know hes not doing good and he never is excited about it or anything and he wont tell his parents i was like well why dont you transfer you know     uh well because his parents gave him the car to go there  well you know   yeah i mean i really the car wouldnt get it because i just think thats sad i dont think parents can can make that decision for you i you know   umhum   if you if they let i think you should choose and you know work something out between yall God   uhhuh thats thats the way colleges are right now anyway is they they have a bunch of kids come down they say hey you wanna be here   yeah yeah oh i know   its its so its pointed towards you   yeah see   and if they sell you well enough there aint nothing thats going to change your mind   thats right thats right thats definitely true   were consumers in society   yeah sad as long as i just think as long as people are happy so many people will go some place and transfer or whatever   umhum yeah   its like you got to find where you fit in best   yeah you got to got to find the good classes and things like that   yeah really i know i have some hard classes now that im just like uh   i i well i can imagine that i i started off the the counselor at high school said oh you wanna do this well then go into aerospace aerospace   stuff like that uhhuh   i went and my first day of enrollment in college i walked around i go into the aerospace building they give me the curriculum and its like twenty one units to twenty four units a quarter   uh and youre like uh i dont think i want to do that   yeah and average is like you know its supposed to be like sixteen eighteen you know   yeah   you know this is like i dont want to be a doctor   yeah youre like i i really didnt want to do it i was just kidding you know i just  thought id come try it out   yeah  yeah i happened to be walking down the hall turned into some some other instructors office and said help me  and he sold me on his program   yeah really yeah you cant have someone cant choose that for you thats why i think people people i know that stay in school so long its because they cant figure out what they wanna do   yeah yeah   like what you know and they start with one major and they go through the certain you know classes you have to take for that major then they change their mind   yeah   and its like oh you got to start all over because you lose all the classes you just took  thats crazy thats like   umhum   they need to hire someone to help you and everyone should have to take like a test or something of what you might want to do because i think thats so sad because people     yeah well they there theres some tests like that now but theyre kind of strange some of them you know its like you you you should be a cement mixer or something like that you know   yeah there are yeah yeah i know yeah i know they have better ones yeah   you know and the guy walked in going yeah but i wanted to be a psychologist   yeah youre going you should be a farmer youre like a farmer what       yeah i know we took those in like high school those are stupid   yeah   they ought to tell you mine is psychology   whats whats your major
