                i i dont have a lot of things that invade my every everyday privacy probably the the one thing that i feel is a is a bother is uh soliciting over the phone from uh either for donations for different things or in the local area uh we have quite a bit of this i understand theres a a law now where some companies are unable to do this after the first of January but i havent i really dont know too much about that but i really other than that i dont really have anything that uh i feel invades my my privacy how about you   i feel that the mail is also its the telephones and the mails that get me i think the mails all these ads and things that they send and there should be a limit on that also   uhhuh yeah well thats thats good uh i dont think   not only financially but its costing me and us really in advertising were paying for all that junk that we throw in the   yes i you bet and once you order something it seems like you get on their list and they send everything   thats right and they have a and then you get your list there of privacy you know out of that comes the um and then then being able to use your name   uhhuh uhhuh   and thats invading your privacy to me now that is one of the biggest one another big one   thats uhhuh yeah   taking your name from lists   uh that thats true and i dont know how you you stop that if you order anything at all and then use your credit card or get anything from any mail order catalogs or anything then everybody starts sending the stuff   i know it is its outrageous how you get the piles of it and uh and then even it even even gets to the point where they um   yeah   oh they can mess up your credit bad with it you know as far as your with your um   uhhuh   when you get on all these lists and all they can invade that part of it   uhhuh right and i dont know what can be done about that but uh im sure that this is   and i know there is a number i think that or uh the post office you can send in a number and i dont have it myself in fact i thought of getting it my sister has it and said we shed give it to me and she lives in Ohio   uhhuh   and uh there is a number that you can send or a place that you can send to the post office and give them your address and tell them you dont want anymore of this and i just havent done in fact she was just telling me about it recently   well thats great thats good to hear ill   so i thought i might check with her on it and get that number and   uhhuh well i have a son and uh   and have a lot of that junk mail stopped because i really that   hm yes well that that would be great i mean you know   its a big irritant to me but   yes it is like you say were paying for it one way or the other   uhhuh we are   and the postage and uh  and   and doortodoor soliciting can be another   uhhuh we dont have a lot of that uh where i live uh very little but i would imagine that where you live in a larger area   dont you yeah its a its as much as a phone call you know invading your privacy and we do hear in a lot of it in Richardson theres quite a bit of it   uhhuh well it really would be and and then the that really invades it plus uh you you just trying to settle down to do something and then uh here they come and they   yeah i did have to laugh though they had the um they had the invasion of privacy law uh for weekends now here in Richardson they signed me to see uh on Saturdays and Sundays there is no soliciting allowed allowed   uhhuh   and they even stopped the little Brownies and Girl Scouts from selling their cookies and that really got us and we laughed about it because with one of the um editorials on it was   oh oh my goodness yeah   it was great the guy went on about how the little Brownie came or Girl Scout came to the door and the police arrested her for selling their cookies and it was kind of a cute   yes oh wow yeah   pun against that part of it but you know where do you stop its true   im sure we must have um well im im sure we have a law in uh in Brigham City on that because uh we very very seldom   really   uh have anyone coming around but once in a while somebody will come in and then uh the word gets out and then nobody in the neighborhood will answer the door but uh   oh really uhhuh oh well thats good   we dont have maybe oh two or three times a year so theres theres got to be something uh im sure that that   uhhuh   prohibits them from doing that   uhhuh uhhuh     but uh all of these are really irritants and things that we really dont need   now thats true and it is an invasion and each time its a breakdown of our system you know each one is a breakdown of our systems   uhhuh yes   of your privacy your own privacy   and uh   that can be very irritable   thats true and then some of the advertisements on television some of the things uh that you might want or records or something i dare sent uh i dare sent order any of that stuff because then
