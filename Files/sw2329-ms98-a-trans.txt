              okay uh are you in the market for a new car   uh ive only purchased one new car in my entire life   really   right and that was back in nineteen fifty nine       and it was a new Ford so the automobiles that that i have uh   uhhuh   first of all we have a source now we got a a friend whose a nun   uhhuh   and weve been purchasing her cars she buys a brand new car every three or four years   oh really   and then when she gets ready to trade it in she offers it to us and we buy it   well well thats great   so   if you if you can find a deal like that   yeah and uh weve got weve got a sixty seven Mustang that we bought brand new   oh   and we still have that   oh that that thats a classic car   so yeah its going to be uh lets see next year i guess it will be an antique   next year   yeah but the problem with it is up here around theres so much salt on the roads   oh really   that its hard to keep automobiles for any length of time because they all rust out and   huh i bet thats right i bet that i bet that is true for down well down here we dont have that problem of course   yeah uh every once in a while though uh ill read a blip where you guys get some       uh terrible ice storms   oh yes we get and then   but they dont put salt on the roads down there then   they sand the roads and it just turns into a big mess     ugh okay   so uh but really the when it when it gets uh nasty down here its like a big huge fender bender parking lot so i just try   nobody nobody goes anywhere no one will   nobody goes anywhere     okay so how about how about you how about purchasing an automobile   well uh a couple years ago we we purchased an uh well it wasnt new it wasnt new it was a a a an Astro van and   oh okay   we really like it because we got uh a two year old and another one on the way so uh   yeah   we  we had a Firebird and we had to trade we guess we got to get rid of this thing because theres no way we can haul kids and junk and  stuff with that  so we got rid of that and were really pleased with it   yeah so what do you buy what are you looking for you look for an automatic you know you look for something with all the   yes i cant drive a standard   you cant drive a standard   no i cant drive a standard   yeah no i used to when i was when i was uh younger   uhhuh   you know but ive its been long gone out of my system now i could just put it in home and let it go there and take me there and thats it i dont like any of that   yeah   but i do like comfort i like uh uh we have bigger automobiles now weve got Pontiacs   uhhuh   uh i like the comfort you know and and the mileage we get is depending on if its tuned up or not we get between eighteen and twenty two miles to the gallon uh   thats good we   you know its not really all that that doesnt its it isnt as good as some of the smaller ones you know that they get a zillion miles   uh oh yeah but yeah uh thats not one of my first priorities when im looking for a new car is excellent gas mileage look   you what what do you look for uh ease of handling or roominess   well my husband has to have a has to drive a pick up so thats so he has his he has a pickup   uh   uh he drives a small uh S GMC S fifteen  which we bought we bought new five years ago and have had real good luck with i mean theres have absolutely no trouble with it   yeah thats i i had a pickup truck in fact i had i had two the last one i gave to my uh uh youngest   uhhuh   uh because we used to go we we we uh built our home and we built it to we designed it to be heated by uh wood you know uh uh wood stove   yeah uhhuh   so and i like the i like the warmth and the comfort of it so every winter well i used to go out and chop wood and get it all ready for the next season so a pickup truck was handy for the work i was doing around   uhhuh oh yeah   but now everythings done so       i figure instead of doing that ill just ill just order wood but uh   uh im just like you gas mileage wasnt a priority   hum   it was it was comfort and it has to be has to have air   oh yes   so down down where you guys are   down here its a its its its a necessity   its a necessity yeah   when it gets to be a hundred degrees every day for a month and a half   yeah thats i had i had gone down to Dallas couple weeks ago   its   uh on a seminar for a week   oh yeah   and thats when you broke all the records was up to like ninety six   yeah it was its pretty warm   eighties and you know when i left here and were down to the thirties and twenties and   uhhuh         so its a shock   so i can see you yeah and you need air you actually need air now it gets warm enough down there for it so   yeah ive ive in the car ive been running it uh uh uh uh because it but uh the the weather the weathers just been really nice but i mean you you just cant sell a car down here that does not have air conditi oning in it   yeah   like were from Missouri and when we moved   oh are you   we when we moved down here the our uh the vehicle we had did not have air conditioning and we went through one summer that way and that was it  thats when we traded it   so thats thats one of your priorities theres got to be air has to be an automatic   yes   uh how about uh accessories power windows and all that   oh thats not really important the the other stuff is just you know window dressing because we weve never ordered anything fact the the van that weve got we bought uh from an estate it was an estate trade uh it was almost brand new the the gentlemen who owned it had died   uh   so we got a really good deal   so you got a yeah   and its loaded i mean it it i mean if i would have went to buy that thing new  theres no way i could have afforded it   yeah   but uh since it was a state vehicle  we got a really good deal on it but it   so if you know if you know where where youre get getting your your automobile from   yeah   its best to buy it that way because like our sales tax up here is seven percent   oh its its eight percent its eight here   its eight percent down there   yes yes   so who so if you go out and youre talking like a ten or fifteen thousand dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on thats a thats a big chunk of change you have to come up with   yes it is it   and then we have an excise tax up here too i dont know if you have one every year down there   oh no   so they take the they take the uh whatever the book value of the vehicle is and then whatever your tax rate is and they just tax you every year on the vehicle or two vehicles yes its terrible   oh how awful   and in our town we live in a like a rural area and they have a fire tax that they add on too   oh how awful   so so weve got to pay a fire tax and we got to pay you know two taxes sounds like you got a a little one there   oh she hit her she hit her head  now shes fine so   oh so once you buy a vehicle and you pay you pay the sales tax thats it they dont tax you on it anymore     oh uh property tax the city of Dallas but uh since we moved out of the city of Dallas we dont have to pay property tax on it anymore   so thats what they consider property tax its like like if you own your own home you have to pay property tax   right homes vehicles you know everything       has everything like that gets uh taxed property uh property tax   yeah   even if you you know if you dont own it yet it if youre paying off a note you still have to pay property tax on it   i still have to pay it yeah thats just like up here too its like that Mustang that we have the excise tax on it every year theres a minimum you have to pay and and its only twelve dollars   uhhuh   so weve got an automobile thats thats got some class to it but i dont really i cant tell now what kind of a car is coming down or what kind of a car im following unless i get up close enough to read the name on it   yeah   because they all look the same   yes everything look thats it i dont i dont foresee buying us buying an a a vehicle anytime in the near future because were very pleased with what weve got plus i dont like anything that theyve come out with   yeah and if you take care of it i mean you can get uh some good mileage out of it   oh yeah   because of the the im driving a Pontiac now and its uh its a sixty seven Pontiac its got a hundred fifty eight thousand miles on it   ooh wee     and its absolutely gorgeous just i mean just glides along and i still get that good mileage and   well thats great that   i take it back and forth to work and then my wifes got a a an eighty four Parisian Pontiac   uhhuh   and thats a big car its a V four door   uhhuh   and thats got uh a hundred and sixteen thousand miles on it and that runs perfectly well too   well that thats great you got a hold of a couple of vehicles uh really good vehicles   so when we get like i said you know the next one when she decides to to sell the car she has now ill end up with the Parisian and my wife will have the newer one of course and   yeah   so we we just been doing it for years and years and years   well down here if you want to go buy a used car its impossible because they want just as much for a used car as they want for a new car and it it it just does   thats incredible   it just doesnt make sense to buy a used car down here   yeah if youre going to pay the same amount of money and and you dont really know where it came from   yeah   then youre buying somebodys headaches probably   oh you have no idea where it comes from you dont   its yeah and theres no warranty   no none   so whatever happens to it youre stuck with it   yes true   unless you buy it from i say somebody you know you know like from a family member or a like that one   yeah
