        hi   i dont know much about this topic let me ask you does she spell her name with two Ns and an E   uh no she doesnt  okay     oh okay well then were all right okay that would have been totally weird   yeah   i have no idea who listens to this   oh yeah thats right well well find out later  theyve got this all reported i guess   there you go yeah   oh right i didnt know there was a proposal to serve young people to have a year of public service   actually i didnt either um uh i really wasnt familiar with that and um i didnt even realize i had put that as you know this must be something fairly new because i dont remember this as even being one of the topics you know  had to put have be discussed   yeah i didnt i didnt either are you from Pennsylvania   yes   are you from Pittsburgh   oh God close Johnstown     ha were not suppose to do this  i i can im from originally from Beaver County oh my God       oh your kidding   no i could smell an accent a mile away   oh isnt that fun only people from there can tell everyone else is where did you get that weird accent   are you in Pennsylvania or Dallas right now   uh no right now im in uh Washington DC area   oh okay   and youre in Dallas     yes im in Dallas my husbands a TIer   okay oh okay well my yeah actually my husband hes with the uh hes with the federal government and uh im a civil engineer but im taking a year off     are you my oh how nice   um what uh how do you feel about uh the the young people are they are are they talking uh do you think eighteen years of age like right or during high school   i dont know id first of all is there a proposal in this i mean is there a legitimate proposal i didnt see that on the list but i guess its unless yeah   ive never heard of such of thing this is this is really a surprise to me i wasnt total im glad it was you because i was afraid id get some guy on here that knows all about this   yeah really i guess i would say that if there is one i would think that they are talking eighteen years or twenty one years of age   uhhuh   but i personally dont think its a good idea for a year i would look at it more as a uh internship kind of thing maybe three months through you know ninety days to six months or something um but more than that i would have a problem with it   uhhuh yes and and how do how do you think that they would propose to do is far as if uh a person is coming out of high school and going to college how could you know i wonder how they could possibly   enforcement     uh if this would be a voluntary thing or a mandatory   yeah the way the the way the voice might have worded it it sounded almost mandatory as opposed to elected and i would obviously i mean not obviously but i would be against anything like that being mandatory   yes it did yeah well i think i would also and i think it it really uh would be very difficult in terms of uh you know people im thinking mainly people going to college i dont see how   right   how with uh the work load kids have nowadays and what often most college students im like maybe when we went to school i dont know how long ago you went but   thirty something   yeah  me too and and uh you know i think it its its most of them now carry parttime jobs on top of having fifteen or sixteen credits   there you go yeah   that and thus think i mean i dont know i went to uh even though im from that part of the country i did go to high school in uh the Midwest and Chicago and i we had it was mandatory that we took civics every year   yeah oh really   yeah it was a mandatory and then you had to take a test that showed you had a certain knowledge of state government and state service and they did offer actually certain types of public service internships that i think is a very good idea that thats mandatory   yeah i see yeah   but i dont know how any i mean the whole thing sounds a little bit ludicrous but thats my word   yeah the other thing i think that they could do possibly is with um i dont know when i went to school we had um in our social studies we had it divided into for every report card period like there were five or six six week sessions and we could pick what we wanted   uhhuh right     to take you know whether you wanted to study American Indians or this or that maybe as one of those six week sessions instead of having a class um or have the class but as part of that or part of the credit would be to do something like that on a voluntary basis   and when theyre younger not when theyre getting into undergraduate and college age   yeah yeah i i uh i really im bewildered as far as how they could even work something like this in if they try to make it mandatory   i dont yeah and i maybe thats not what they meant maybe thats just the way both of us took the wording but i i think its a good i get idea to get younger people involved in the government in some way or the public you know happenings its just they theyre not aware of why things cost what they do why things operate the way they do but i just   right right and in this area theres so much going on volunteer wise like for home life uh i you know i know its for     you mean in the in the area of geographic region youre in uhhuh   yeah yeah there there are many organizations uh feed the hungry all these theres a lot of drives in school for this type of thing already you know not neccessarily sometimes um   grass roots effort     they might even have i know uh with a niece and nephew of mine theyre school was uh like uh church school and they even had things where they would have them go to shelters downtown and help for a day   uhhuh huh oh my   or um what a lot of kids do here is um they have things to school where they have actual they have a holiday game night but every your uh your uh fee if you want to call it or the way you get admitted to going to this show is to   uhhuh uhhuh   bring a can or two for the hungry   oh yeah they do that i mean in in in north Texas they do that quite a bit where you know if you want to go to this particular movie or concert or a discounted thing the big thing down here is rodeos uh if you   uhhuh oh yeah  thats quite different from up here i guess yes   yeah really im im bite my lip im not going to talk Pennsylvania  its just listening to you i just talked to my brother       its like really weird  coincidence yeah uh um i really dont think they can do it though i mean i i you know i think that things that your talking about like anything that emphasizes the social services   yeah that is this yeah that is pretty wild that is pretty wild yeah   with the public service  i   right right or yeah i think they can integrate maybe a short period of time in with high school students and get them to be aware that you know theyre not uh especially teenagers theyre not the only ones around and what maybe their   uhhuh   you know their parents are going through especially i know in an area like this its uh fairly affluent and and kids here are really out of touch with reality i always call it Disneyland here   are they even are you are you in northern Virginia or are you in the District of Columbia   uh were in no were in uh where they call it now north Potomac its its a  town but its close to Potomac   yeah okay   and um you know you see sixteen year olds driving around in brand new BMWs and its just unbelievable you know   yeah thats were in a yeah thats were in a near next to a town called Plano Texas and its very um its like Falls Church Alexander i mean Montgomery County im familiar with where youre at um and they really thats a good way to put it i know   right yeah   i went to high school in the city of Chicago at an inner city school although i lived in a different area near a place called Evanston Illinois   uhhuh uhhuh   and the reason that i stayed at the school i did was because at Evanston township which back then was like one of the three larger schools in the country   yes   everybody was already doing the um driving the beamers and you know with nothing to think that um they didnt have five hundred dollar wardrobes you know every week that kind of thing   yeah yeah yeah   i i just i just think the one thing they do so strongly about is what your saying that i dont think kids have a sense of civic responsibility   no they dont   i think then thats a step away from even duty i dont think they even have a sense of the responsibility   right and i think one other area here is that um this is typically what we call in this area yuppie area and people arent my kids you know other than you know occasionally theyre not even aware that there are people over fifty that   uhhuh   exist  you know and and i think it might be another good public service might be to have them help out in geriatric homes or you know this type of thing they are around uh   this is true yeah yeah i think the one thing the the theres a program called uh Habitat For Humanity that Jimmy Carter started the former president and i think i think programs like that with what you just talked about going on in your area local area at and something like that would be good   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   you know but not that specifically but things along that  of of activity   right and i i in general i feel that um i dont know what this still proposes far as what age or or how they would do this but i feel that reaching the kids when theyre younger is better though i think once theyre out of high school theyre so into their own thing that i think it would be very difficult maybe by that time theyre too uh calloused to what is even going on you know where as younger children its the its the grade school children when there say no to drugs and that type of thing in school   formed yeah theyre already right   theyre the ones thatll come home and tell you you know you shouldnt smoke its bad for you shouldnt drink its bad for you   uhhuh   and i think its the younger its the younger uh kids that it reaches more and so if they want to start this type of thing it should be integrated maybe from a young age and and   uhhuh yeah i agree with you like pre junior high and and um see and make it you know a curriculum oriented type of proposal as opposed to anything mandated like the old selective service or anything so it sounds like were in agreement with that   yes right right yeah i think so uh   anything any else we can  we can talk about   i dont know i guess thats it say hi to Pittsburgh if youre   talk about Pittsburgh yeah your right its like i mean this is very strange because im not in that part of the country i dont care if they listen im not in that part of the country  i dont want to offend you i and im not in their part of the country so what i hear all my best friends are in western Pennsylvania and its like oh     yeah yeah you miss yeah i dont know if you miss it or not but   yeah i i do i mean i didnt grow up totally there because of a parent parental divorce in my family but um you know it was always shuttle back and forth so uh its like two homes but yeah i miss it   uhhuh yeah well this is a good area because youre far enough away and yet youre close you know so holidays and things or whatever you wanted to you can be there but   yeah   um you know i enjoy being here i dont know if id ever you know i might go back there eventually one day its a depressed area uh right now you know   yeah really is theyve cleaned it up a lot though i mean i dont think well get in trouble doing that   oh yeah oh Pittsburgh i lived there four years i i liked when i was a teenager and early twenties and i liked it there a lot people didnt but i really enjoyed it   yeah i lived there in my early twenties too before i moved   oh  thats the     thats weird i hope we never met
