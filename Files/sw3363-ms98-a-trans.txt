        okay what kind of car are you gonna buy next     well one of the cars im thinking about buying next is uh a nice safe small car but um uh the reason being is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family and we use that to get back and forth and to haul kids around and   uhhuh uhhuh   so forth and we have another four door car that i drive to work and i think itd be more economical if i were able to get a smaller car and uh wouldnt be wouldnt cost much with gas   uhhuh thats true thats true   what what are you looking at   well im really not looking at anything for a while but you know when youre driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out and you think oh well maybe maybe i would like a new car   umhum oh yeah   but i think ill be driving mine about two or three more years anyway but uh   oh yes oh yes well the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the   right they are i sure do like the looks of that new Mitsubishi Mitsubishi Diamante   when you oh yes oh yes   that is a pretty car   and im uh i really like the looks also of the new Mazda   uhhuh thats pretty too   that they have but um i uh you know the the cost of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now   yeah they get pretty expensive   yes they do   the last one i bought i bought a uh well its a its a Town Car but it was a demo returned   umhum   and i got it with like you know i think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars off less than what the list price was   right well you cant go wrong with that kind of a opportunity   so i was really pleased to find that and i then i bought it for cheaper i was looking at a Honda Accord a brand new one and i bought this uh the the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what i was gonna buy the new Honda Accord   yes wow well you get a much bigger better comfortable ride   and the thing about it is they give you that ten uh that that hundred thousand mile mile five year warranty where it only costs you twenty five dollars to have anything repaired     yes well thats fantastic thats real real good   so uh i have really been impressed i said ill probably never be able to find another one that i can afford you know but i have loved this car better than anything ive ever driven because you you can go on the road and get there and youre not even tired     no do you a very comfortable smooth ride huh   and it gets like twenty six miles to the gallon on the road   oh it does thats thats unbelievable for that size of a cars   it sure does i had they kept telling me that and i thought theyre crazy so the week after i got it well actually before i signed the papers on it i took it over to Boozier City and it did it     yes wow thats great thats great that kind of gas mileage uh were were kind of hoping for on our van   but it uh yeah well thats kind of what weve always been told you know theyll do it and then we hope for it and it never happens but it really it does get good gas mileage   uhhuh well thats excellent did   most of the time when i dont go anywhere i can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work you know and then fill it up so   umhum do you uh do you does it uh need a lot of repairs is it very reliable kind of car   i havent had anything ive taken it in twice for like       just really minor things and it cost me the twenty five dollars the uh really really something really silly when we first got it we couldnt get the light they have all these lights in the car and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the backseat and we couldnt get the light to turn off   yes yes hum   and we kept kept trying you know and we went out to dinner with some friends and it stayed on all night you know just shining right down on them you know   oh dear oh dear   and we couldnt get it to turn off and the next day my husband goes out there and he tries to get it off we turn the knob you know in the front thats supposed to turn the lights on and off and we turned everything we could and he took it in and   umhum umhum   they said you know you just have to press the switch he says ive pressed every switch in that car and i cant get the light off its broken so they took it in and charged us the twenty five dollars and they called and told us though that all you have to do is turn the off switch and they showed us where the switch was     yes they charged you twenty five dollars just to tell you that huh   they they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch but he hadnt he hadnt done the right one and its right on the arm rest in the back and we didnt know it was there   uhhuh oh so they probably went through the i see   umhum oh okay   and the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car   and found it right away huh   and so we thought you know there  it was broken     uhhuh   but weve had just uh i guess its been in two times ive had it three years now   yes   and uh its been in two maybe three times but its just been real minor things   well i think that uh you have an excellent deal then and the the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know its so well built that they dont expect any kind of major repairs   thats right   whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair and those companies wouldnt be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all so   umhum thats right but its really its been an enjoyable car like i say ill probably never be able to have another one because i think we bought it for about sixteen thousand you know and i said ill never find another one for that price   yes   no  not at all   and they keep going up so ill have to enjoy it
