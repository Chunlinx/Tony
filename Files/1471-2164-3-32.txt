                    Background        Recent progress in genomic sequencing has led to the        rapid enrichment of protein sequence databases        Computational biology strives to extract the maximum        possible information from these sequences by classifying        them according to their homologous relationships Classical        protein families are distinguished by members which exhibit        sequence similarity a feature which can often be used to        infer that the sequences are related evolutionarily as well        as functionally One of the first goals of any        genomesequencing project is to broadly classify as many        genes and their products as possible into putative        functional families        Proteins are translated from their corresponding mRNAs        Cellular mRNA levels are immensely informative about cell        state and the activity of genes and in most cases changes        in mRNA abundance are positively correlated with changes in        protein abundance Coregulation of proteins often reflects        that these proteins are involved in similar biological        processes and have related functions     Therefore        changes in the expression patterns of protein families        under different experimental conditions can provide clues        about regulatory mechanisms the relationships between        broader cellular functions and biochemical pathways as        well as interactions between different protein motifs                        The advent of microarray technology has made        simultaneous analysis of the gene expression profiles of        tens of thousands of genes a practical reality            Availability of human genome sequences and massive high        throughput data on their expression provides an opportunity        to study regulatory relationships between gene families             Incytes LifeExpress RNA Database is a gene        expression database that contains raw and normalized data        from hundreds of Incyte microarray experiments Using these        largescale mRNA expression data we can infer the        functional relationships between protein families by        comparing the aggregated expression profiles of the members        of each protein family        Pfam is a functionally annotated database of protein        domain families     In this study each member of Pfam        families was mapped to Incyte clones which were presented        in the Incyte microarray chips based on the sequence        identity We then generated mRNA expression profiles for        these Pfam family members using Incytes LifeExpress RNA        LE database Version  April  release Incyte        Genomics Inc We analyzed  Pfam families whose        family members are well represented on the Incyte        microarrays The expression data for various members of a        single Pfam family in one experiment was first converted        into binary digits and then summarized as the Family        Regulation Ratio The set of Family Regulation Ratios for a        particular Pfam family across multiple experiments is        called a Family Regulation Profile By using Pearson        Correlation we analyzed the similarities between these        Family Regulation Profiles to impute functional        relationships between the different families This method        was validated by comparing Family Regulation Profiles        generated based on two different randomly selected LE data        subsets        This study explores an approach to relate protein        families based on quantitative comparison of the family        mRNA expression profiles Analysis of the profiles may be        useful to address what protein domain families are        coregulated and possibly how they may interact physically        or genetically with one another                    Results                  Clones mapped to multiple Pfam families          Structural similarities between distinct proteins          often involve only a portion of each protein sequence          These conserved substructures which often have readily          identifiable boundaries may recur in a large number of          different proteins in which they perform a similar          function In addition many proteins consist of          combinations of these recurrent substructures domains          in which case the protein function can be economically          annotated based on the presence of these domains Pfam is          a domainbased protein database Multidomain proteins          can be classified into several Pfam families which in          turns means that several Pfam families can share the same          corresponding proteins          Among  Pfam families discussed here there are           clones mapped to more than one Pfam family and  Pfam          families sharing more than one clone Multidomain          proteins are the major reason for this observation ie           PF and           PF representing Cdomain and          Ndomain of           Glutathione          Stransferease respectively Nonuniformity of Pfam          classification and clone mapping may also cause clone          sharing between Pfam families A table listing pairs of          Pfam families that share more than  of their family          members is provided as an additional file see Additional

   Data crossvalidation          Two independent sets of Family Regulation Profiles          were constructed from the randomly selected          nonoverlapping subsets of expression data S and S see          Methods Separate Pearson Correlation Coefficients PCC          and PCC were computed from these data subsets          respectively The correlation between PCC and PCC was          determined by calculating an Enrichment Factor EF that          expresses the degree to which calculations based on one          data subset were corroborated by calculations based on          the other data subset          First we selected Pfam pairs from S by screening for          pairs where PCC is greater than  If PCC and PCC          for a particular pair of Pfam models are positively          correlated an increase in PCC cutoff should result in a          greater likelihood of PCC falling above  ie EF          should increase We calculated a series of EFs with the          PCC cutoff increasing from  to  EF stayed around           for low PCC  to  and gradually increased to as          high as  when PCC   Fig           EFs were also computed to compare PCC and PCC in the          same cutoff range from  to  An EF greater than           indicates higher than background correlation between PCC          and PCC The representation ratio predicted to occur if          there is no correlation between PCC and PCC and the          observed representation ratios were calculated as          described in Methods The discrepancy between them was          evaluated by determining the statistical variable          chisquare   and the corresponding p value The          higher the chisquare and the lower the p value the less          likely the observed degree of correlation occurred by          chance which implies that the observed relationship is          biologically significant As shown in Table  both EF          and  analyses showed strong correlation between PCC          and PCC with the p value less than           The Pearson correlation coefficient between all PCC          and PCC values was determined to be  showing that          PCC and PCC were well correlated Our approach is          validated by this consistency of Pfam correlations          derived from randomly selected LE expression experiments          S and S                            Discussion        Expression monitoring on a genomewide scale was first        successfully demonstrated in budding yeast              Wholegenome expression profiles provide a rich source of        information on protein function proteinprotein        interactions and gene pathways and have been compared        with data sets describing transcription factor binding        sites protein families proteinprotein interactions and        protein abundance           mainly in        budding yeast In this study we used large scale human        genomewide expression data to study the relationship        between the expression patterns of different protein        families We summarized the change in gene expression level        for a set of protein family members as a binary code of        regulated and unregulated A twofold change in        expression level was chosen as a cutoff for categorizing a        change in expression level as significant This cutoff is        arbitrary but from our experience with Taqman confirmation        data not shown a twofold change in expression level        reliably distinguishes real signals from background noise        for most expression experiments The gene regulation was        then converted to a percentage for gene families to profile        the regulation for each microarray experiment        Since the mapping from Pfam families to Incyte        microarray clones is through the Swissprot database Pfam        family members that are not represented in the Swissprot        database cannot be mapped to Incyte clones and are        therefore not included in the Family Regulation Profile        analysis That may be one source of false negatives Other        factors such as sensitivity of the Incyte microarray        technology the arbitrary twofold cutoff etc may also        contribute to false negative results In order to reduce        these types of errors we included in our analysis only        those Pfam families that map to at least  Incyte clones        Due to the fact that the domain hierarchy of Pfam        classification is not perfectly reflected in the database        multidomain proteins may fall into several Pfam members        leading to a significant number of false positives To        address this potential source of error we excluded from        pairwise correlation analysis those Incyte clones shared        by both Pfam families in the pair        To validate relationships that are revealed by        microarray expression profiling one direct way is to split        all the experiments randomly into two nonoverlapping pools        and derive the Pfam relationships independently from each        of these pools The  LE experiment were divided into two        data sets of S and S and the corresponding Pfam        relationships were denoted as PCC and PCC The        correlation coefficient for PCC and PCC of  indicates        a high degree of correlation between two data sets In        order to ensure the independence of the data we also        performed another analysis where data were split into two        sets based on the tissue type The Pfam relationships not        shown derived from these latter data sets are consistent        with each other and with those derived from the complete        data pool further corroborating the observed        relationships        It is important to note that many of the protein family        relationships based on coexpression identified here are        supported by functional links Taking the G proteincoupled        receptors GPCRs as an example after agonist action        GPCRs activate G proteins and become phosphorylated by G        proteincoupled receptor kinases     This event        promotes activation of effector enzymes and ion channels by        the activated G GTP This GPCRmediated regulation of ion        channels also depends on the coordination and parallel        regulation of protein tyrosine kinase and protein tyrosine        phosphatase activities     GPCRs can also interact        with the growing family of PDZ domaincontaining proteins            All of these relationships are reflected in our        study by the strong correlation between  transmembrane        receptors rhodopsin family PF protein kinases        PF protein tyrosine phosphatases PF ion        transport proteins PF and PDZ domain proteins        PF        Our study revealed many intriguing links between protein        families For example the link between homeobox proteins        PF and other protein families Homeobox proteins are        a very important family of transcription factors According        to our analysis homeobox proteins are involved in the        regulation of or are regulated by many protein families        such as GPCRs ion channels tyrosine phosphatases nuclear        hormone receptors and protein kinases For example the        cone rod homeobox Crx binds and transactivates the        rhodopsin promoter     However it has not been        determined whether other rhodopsin GPCRs are also regulated        by homeobox proteins In         C elegans  it was reported that the        homeobox gene lim is required for distinct chemosensory        representations ion sensing which is related to ion        channeltransportation mechanisms Again it has not been        studied systematically whether homeobox proteins are        important regulators of ion channeltransporter Another        example of an intriguing relationship revealed in the        present study is between the PH domain the EGF domain and        the immunoglobulin superfamily Pleckstrinhomology PH        domains are protein modules of approximately  amino        acids found in a wide variety of signaling proteins in        organisms ranging from yeasts to humans The EGF domain        which often occurs as multiple tandem repeats is widely        distributed among extracellular proteins involved in        adhesion receptorligand interactions extracellular        matrix structure determination of cell fate and blood        coagulation     Cell adhesion usually activates PI        kinase activity Many PH domain proteins bind with high        affinity to specific phosphoinositides such as PIP        PIP or PIP which are generated by PI kinase            This relationship was reflected by the high        correlation coefficient  between the PH domain and        the EGF domain seen in our analysis Furthermore another        major cell adhesion molecular family is the immunoglobulin        superfamily PF Two immunoglobulins which are        particularly important in the cell adhesion cascade are        Intercellular Adhesion Molecule ICAM or CD and        Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule VCAM The        coexpression that we observed in our analysis for the        EGFlike domains and immunoglobin superfamily suggested        that they may cooperate with each other in the cell        adhesion process Links between Pfam families like these        suggest novel hypotheses about family interactions that may        be further explored                    Conclusions        Integrating genomewide expression information with        protein functional classifications and genetic networks is        a huge challenge Our model is based on the binary        idealization of gene expression change to generate a Family        Regulation Profile Although this model is simplified the        abstraction may be useful for conceptualizing the nature of        functional relationships between families of protein        domains                    Methods                  Database resources          Pfam is a large collection of multiple protein

and          Body Map                          Selection of probe pairs in LifeExpress          The LE database contains data points from a total of           probe pairs Note here the term of probe refers to          fluorescentlabeled total RNA sample used for microarray          hybridization that have been hybridized to one or more          Human Genome chips   of these probe pairs have          been hybridized to all five chips Using data from all          available probe pairs would reduce the number of genes          that could be compared since many genes are not          represented in all  experiments By contrast limiting          oneself to only those probe pairs that have been run          against all the chips would greatly reduce the number of          experiments from which the data is drawn In order to          optimize the amount of data that could be compared           probe pairs that were hybridized to the first  Human          Genome chips HG HG HG and HG were used in this          study                          Mapping Pfam to LifeExpress          A total of  SwissProt human sequences and           TrEMBL human sequences are included in  protein          families covered by Pfam Version  Corresponding          GenBank mRNA sequences for those protein records were          identified from annotation present in SwissProt and          TrEMBL sequence records and were assembled together with          the clone sequences from LifeExpress Human Genome chips           using the PHRAP assembler threaded version           licensed from Southwest Parallel Software Inc          httpwwwspsoftcom  Incyte clones belonging to           Pfam families were mapped to these sequences Pfam          family PF is most highly represented on the chips          with  Incyte clones while  Pfam families are          represented on the microarrays by only one family member          In total  Pfam families are represented by more than          ten clones on the microarrays There were  clones          that belonged to these largest families                          Data Processing          One probe pair in LE could have been hybridized to the          same Incyte Human Genome chip several times In these          cases the average of the differential expression values          fold difference for the different hybridizations was          used in subsequent calculations For each gene the          expression ratio for a particular probe pair was reduced          to a binary variable regulated or unregulated          rather than a continuous variable For each pair of          experimental conditions a gene was considered to be          regulated if it showed at least a twofold change in          expression level either up or downregulated between          conditions and unregulated if the expression ratio was          less than twofold          In order to analyze the expression profile for each          Pfam family we calculated the Family Regulation Ratio          FRR for each Pfam family as the percentage of its          members which were regulated in a pairwise comparison          and assigned the ratio to the Pfam ID for this probe          pair For example  clones in the           PF family had been hybridized          with the probe pair of            PBMC Cells Untx  hr Dn vs t           hr  of which  clones  showed greater than          two fold difference in the pairwise comparison This          meant that  members in the family of           PF were regulated with this          probe pair So the Family Regulation Ratio of  was          assigned to           PF for this probe pair          In order to reduce random noise we only studied the           Pfam families represented by more than ten clones on          the microarrays Family Regulation Profiles were          generated for each of these largest Pfam families by          calculating the FRRs corresponding to  probe          pairs                          Correlation measure          Correlations between Family Regulation Profiles are          measured with the standard Pearson Correlation          Coefficient PCC The PCC between two profiles           a b with           k dimensions is calculated as                    where           a                       i            and           b                       i            represent the Family Regulated Ratios of Pfam           a and Pfam           b for the sample           i  and and indicate the respective          means If a clone was mapped to both Pfam           a and           b  the Family Regulation Profiles          of           a and           b would be modified with the clone          excluded In other words common clones between Pfam          pairs made no contribution to the PCC calculation                          Crossvalidation with two independent          subsets          One way to validate our approach is to verify that the          Pfam relationships based on our Family Regulation          Profiles would be ubiquitous In other words different          microarray experiment sets as long as the experiment          resource is rich diverse and wellrepresented enough          should generate a similar result The  LE probe pairs          were randomly divided into two data sets with one data          set containing  probe pairs S and the other one          containing  probe pairs S Based on these two data          sets two Family Regulation Profiles for each Pfam were          computed respectively Pearson Correlations among Family          Regulation Profiles PCC and PCC were calculated using          S and S respectively PCC and PCC should be          positively correlated if the derived Pfam relationships          are independent of the expression experiment          selection          The Enrichment Factor EF is a parameter that          represents the extent to which the Pfam pairs identified          by PCC within the cutoff range specified by           C are overrepresented in pools of          Pfam pairs that could be identified by PCC within the          cutoff range specified by           C  The number of total Pfam pairs          are indicated as           G                       total            while the number of Pfam pairs selected by PCC            C and PCC            C are indicated as           G            and           G            respectively The number of Pfam          pairs common to both PCC            C and PCC            C is indicated as           G                       both             Therefore the expected background representation          ratio or the random representation ratio for           G            within           G            is                    and the observed representation ratio for           G            within           G            is                              EF is then defined as                    with a value for           EF   indicating higher than          background representation ratio for           G            within           G                      Take an example where           G            is selected by PCC   and G is          selected by PCC   Out of total  Pfam pairs          there are  Pfam pairs with PCC   so the ratio          of R            can be calculated as             There are  Pfam pairs with PCC   of which          all  also have PCC   The ratio of           R             equals    therefore           EF                                Authors contributions        WD LW PQ carried out the data
