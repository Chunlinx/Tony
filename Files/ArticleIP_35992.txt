                                  The Torah Codes Cracked            Im a rationalist and a skeptic someone who safelyseparates faith from reason But when I read a scientific paper titledEquidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis I confess I felt astrong urge to grow sidelocks and a long beard and start atoning for my yearsof doubt The article published in  in a prestigious peerreviewedjournal called Statistical Science  argued with unnerving force that thefirst book of the Bible contains embedded codes that predict events that longpostdate its writing and that these codes are statistically speaking not dueto chance As I wrote in                   Slate                two years ago see  thepapers hypothesis if correct would all but prove both the existence of Godand the divinity of the Torah the first five books of the Hebrew Bible            The paper startled me and many others Peoplebecame Orthodox Jews because of the codes I know of one man who held offcircumcising his son until the paper was published It spawned a runaway bestseller Michael Drosnins The Bible Code  It became a recruiting toolfor ultraorthodox Jewish yeshivas And it amused then frustratedmathematicians worldwide What made the codes especially eerie was that whilescientists were almost universally skeptical of them nobody could figure outwhat was wrong with them No one had published a rebuttal in a peerreviewedjournal As long as that remained the case even rationalists like me had toconsider the possibility that science could support the most radical religiousconclusions            But the Torah codestime is finally up In the current issue of Statistical Science Australian mathematician Brendan McKay and three Israeli colleagues haveconvincingly debunked them and the former editor of Statistical Sciencewho published the original paper has endorsed their rebuttal For those of uswho were freaked out by the codes the new paper comes as a relief            The codes rebuttal has taken so long because the sciencebehind the original paper is very sophisticated One of the authors HebrewUniversity professor Eliyahu Rips is a wellrespected mathematician Theoriginal paper sought to test the anecdotal observation that pairs ofconceptually related words tend to appear in close proximity to one another inthe Torah coded in what are called equidistant letter sequences An ELS is astring of letters compiled by pulling letters out of a text at regularintervals For example if you start with the first letter of this paragraphand read only every fourth letter you will find the word TORT Every textcontains many such codes so the question was whether the observation ofcodes with apparent meaning in Genesis was a deliberate message from thealmighty or mere coincidence            To test whether theGenesis ELS were intentional Doron Witztum and coauthors Yoav Rosenberg andRips used a computer to search Genesis for ELS containing the names of famousrabbis and their dates of birth or death These rabbis were all born long afterGenesis was written so their names could not have been encoded on purpose byany human author Yet in the Genesis textunlike in control texts such as aHebrew translation of War and Peace the rabbis appeared on averagecloser to their own dates than to the others This seemed to show that someonehad actively encoded the textsomeone who knew beforehand when rabbis would beborn or die            After years of onerous testing and retesting McKay and hiscolleaguesDror BarNatan Maya BarHillel and Gil Kalaihave found theserious methodological flaws the peer reviewers missed First McKay et alnote the codes are hypersensitive to small changes in the data Excluding onlyfour of the  rabbis essentially eliminates the effect for example            The core of theircritique focuses on the manner in which the rabbis were named in theWitztumRipsRosenberg paper The names of medieval rabbis are not fixed in theway that modern names are the great rabbi Moses Ben Maimon for example isoften called Maimonides or the Rambam Searching for the rabbis ELStherefore required choices about what names to use for each particular rabbiWitztum and Rips asked a consultant to compile appropriate appellations foreach rabbi but the rebuttal paper argues that the process used by thisconsultant was sufficiently subjective as to bias the results There issomething indisputably bizarre in the spectacle of distinguished mathematicianssquabbling about the correct names of  th century rabbis            In order to demonstrate that data tuning alone couldaccount for the effect McKay and his coauthors made their own alternativelist of appellations for the rabbis a list they describe as of qualitycommensurate with Witztum and Rips This alternative list produced noeffect in Genesis but a huge effect in War and Peace  Then McKay andco sought to produce the most accurate list they could using their ownconsultant With this list they found no statistical evidence of codes in anytext            Further evidence oftuning was found in other decisions Witztum and Rips made about their data Theauthors of the first paper erred McKay and his colleagues claim in how theychose which rabbis to include The rabbis were supposed to be chosen by anobjective criterionthe length of their entries in a particularencyclopediabut because of the careless manner in which this was carriedout rabbis were included who should not have been while others were wronglyexcluded Birth and death dates were also flawed The authors collected datesfrom a wide variety of sources but apparently did not establish firm rules todecide among disputed dates McKay and his coauthors also claim that aspectsof the experimental design such as the way distances were measured betweenrabbis and dates were tuned When McKay and his colleagues varied theexperimental method the choices of dates and the way dates were expressedthe results almost invariably deteriorated            The rebuttal authors note still other problems in theoriginal paper The Torahs text has varied over the centuries and whendealing with ELS tiny variations can be ruinous Yet when McKay et alcompared the text Witztum and Rips used to other Torah textssome of which areprobably more historically reliablethe Witztum and Rips text producedthe strongest results The authors also note that even using the flawedWitztumRips methodology no book of the Torah besides Genesis shows any effectat all            McKay and his colleaguesdo not accuse the original authors of fraud speculate on how their datatuningtook place or ask whether the tuning was consciously done But they concludethat all the choices available to Witztum and Rips created wiggle room thuspermitting the authors biases to corrupt the results All of our many earnestexperiments produced results in line with random chance they conclude Inlight of these findings we believe that the challenging puzzle has beensolved For all but the true believers the publication of the rebuttal paperseems likely to end the Torah codes debate            But for the true believers of course the phenomenon wasalways more than a mere puzzle and they are not about to roll over Rips wassufficiently enraged by Statistical Science s acceptance of the rebuttalpaper that he retained a lawyer who advised the journal that the accusationsin the article about to be published  are untrue and libelous of Dr RipsRips sought a delay in publication and the chance to respond to the critique inthe same issue  Statistical Science rejected his request but willconsider publishing his formal comments in a later issue Rips contends thatthe rebuttal paper misrepresents the original experiments methods and that itignores subsequent tests that he regards as immune from datatuning charges Hewrote me in an email I believe that the evidence for the Torah Codes is nowstronger than ever I find the paper by the critics more than extremelyunfair            Those who want to believe in the Torah codes willalways be able to find ELS that impress them But theres a difference now Tobelieve today that the almighty wrote the Torah is once again as it should bea matter of faith Its not a conclusion that can be forced on meor anyoneelseby statistical science
