                    Background        Heterochromatin was first distinguished from euchromatin        cytologically on the basis of differential staining        properties   Molecular and genetic properties that        further distinguish heterochromatin from euchromatin        include DNA sequence composition replication timing        condensation throughout the cell cycle and the ability to        silence gene expression     In addition to genes        required for viability and fertility   heterochromatin        contains essential         cis acting chromosome inheritance        loci including elements required for centromere function          meiotic pairing     and sister chromatid        cohesion    A significant fraction of the fly and        human genomes are heterochromatic yet our current        understanding of the sequence and organization of        heterochromatin is very limited Heterochromatin is        concentrated in megabasesized tracts in the centric and        subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes It contains        tandemly repeated short sequences satellite DNAs middle        repetitive elements for example transposable elements        and some singlecopy sequences   Progress has been made        in the analysis of the nonsatellite component of         Drosophila Arabidopsis and human        heterochromatin           Less        progress has been made in analysis of satellite sequences        although recent studies have revealed the structure and        composition of centromeric satellites           Heterochromatin accounts for an estimated  megabases        Mb of the Mb genome of the         Drosophila melanogaster female and        the Mb male Y chromosome is entirely heterochromatic        Figure  Polytene chromosomes which are so valuable in        mapping euchromatic genes in         Drosophila  provide minimal        resolution in the heterochromatin The heterochromatin is        either severely underrepresented or poorly banded in        polytene chromosomes and aggregates into an unbanded        structure known as the chromocenter            Drosophila heterochromatin is best        defined by the cytogenetic map of neuroblast mitotic        chromosomes which resolves  heterochromatic bands        hh by differential staining properties    The        locations of repeated sequences within the heterochromatin        have been studied using         in situ hybridization of probes        derived from known repeated elements to mitotic chromosomes           This together with molecular analysis of        minichromosomes has elucidated the general organization        and composition of heterochromatin Satellite blocks of         kilobases kb to  Mb are interrupted by islands of         kb of complex sequences that contain a high density of        transposable elements             The transition between heterochromatin and euchromatin        appears to be gradual rather than abrupt For example a        hallmark of heterochromatin is a high density of        transposable elements and the density of these elements in        the genomic sequence increases continuously toward the        centric ends of the euchromatic portions of the chromosome        arms     This trend continues in the centric        heterochromatin which contains large blocks of specific        types of middlerepetitive sequences           Heterochromatic genes have been defined by mutations        that affect viability or fertility   Genetic screens        reviewed in   have identified  vital loci in the        heterochromatin of chromosome     and  vital loci        in the heterochromatin of chromosome    Although no        vital loci have been identified in the proximal        heterochromatin of the X chromosome   several        identified loci map near the boundary between the centric        heterochromatin and the euchromatin see   There are        six Ylinked loci required for male fertility          reviewed in   Thus there are at least  identified        genetic loci required for viability or fertility in the        centric heterochromatin This is likely to be an        underestimate because saturating genetic screens have not        been done for all of the heterochromatin        Molecularly characterized         Drosophila heterochromatic genes        encode diverse proteins and functions Examples include         light postGolgi protein        trafficking         concertina like G protein        subunit         NippedB morphogenesis         rolled MAP kinase polyADPribose        polymerase chromatin structure         bobbed ribosomal RNA and the        Ylinked fertility factors         kl kl and         kl dynein heavy chains          Genes have been localized on the cytogenetic map through        analysis of chromosomal rearrangements and by fluorescence         in situ hybridization FISH            The genomic structures of several of these genes        have been determined and they differ from those of        euchromatic genes Their introns and regulatory regions are        composed of clusters of partial and complete transposable        elements and some introns are hundreds of kilobases in        length              The Release  wholegenome shotgun WGS assembly of         Drosophila   included  Mb of        short unmapped scaffolds representing heterochromatic        sequence The most recent version WGS   assembled a        total of  Mb of the         Drosophila genome using an improved        assembly algorithm and the same trace data used for Release         A highquality sequence of  Mb that spans the        euchromatic portions of the chromosome arms is reported in          For the sake of consistency we refer to this        Mb sequence as the Release  euchromatic sequence        even though on the basis of the cytological criteria for        defining the boundary between euchromatin and        heterochromatin described below we believe this sequence        extends into the centric heterochromatin of each chromosome        arm The annotation of genes and transposable elements in        this approximately  Mb of heterochromatinderived DNA are        reported in    Here we characterize and annotate        the  Mb of WGS sequence the WGS heterochromatic        sequence that is not represented in the  Mb Release         euchromatic sequence                    Results                  Annotation of WGS heterochromatic sequences          WGS was aligned to the  Mb Release  sequence          spanning the euchromatin   The WGS sequence that          extends beyond the Release  euchromatic sequence or          otherwise fails to align is an unfinished draftquality          assembly of a total of  Mb of the heterochromatic          portion of the           D melanogaster genome The WGS          heterochromatic sequence is distributed in           scaffolds It includes portions of five scaffolds that          overlap with and extend the Release  euchromatic          sequences of chromosome arms X L R L and R The          scaffolds range from  kb to  kb Figure  and          include  sequence gaps accounting for  Mb           Some scaffolds particularly those under  kb may map          within sequence gaps of larger scaffolds          The WGS heterochromatic sequence was aligned to the          corresponding portion of the Release  sequence Although          there are local differences between the two assemblies          the order and orientation of sequences are well          conserved The most significant difference between them          is that WGS heterochromatic scaffolds are often          considerably longer than the corresponding Release           scaffolds For example a kb WGS scaffold extends          over  smaller Release  scaffolds and includes all          seven exons of the heterochromatic gene           rolled in the correct order and          orientation Figure            rolled maps to bands hh on the          right arm of chromosome             We annotated the  Mb of WGS heterochromatic          sequence in the  scaffolds longer than  kb plus a          kb sequence at the centric end of the Release           euchromatic sequence of the X chromosome that was not          annotated by Misra           et al   We arbitrarily          excluded the  Mb of WGS heterochromatic sequence in          the  scaffolds shorter than  kb from detailed          annotation Preliminary analysis suggested that gene          identification in these small scaffolds is hampered in          part by the separation of exons onto different scaffolds          This is illustrated by our annotation of seven          superscaffolds that were constructed by linking          together  short WGS heterochromatic scaffolds using          cDNA evidence see below Thus the scaffolds shorter          than  kb do contain genes but a reliable annotation of          these sequences will require further analysis          Identifying genes within heterochromatin presents          challenges not encountered when annotating euchromatic          sequences Open reading frames ORFs in transposable          elements can interfere with the identification of          singlecopy proteincoding genes particularly when          transposable elements are nested within introns Also          heterochromatic genes can have large introns separating          relatively small exons       Therefore          transposable element and lowcomplexity sequences were          masked then the lengths of masked regions and sequence          gaps were reduced to a maximum of  bp which is the          median intron length of euchromatic proteincoding genes          in           Drosophila             We annotated the masked scaffolds using the          computational annotation pipeline developed by Mungall           et al   and the annotation          tool Apollo   The pipeline generates stores and          filters alignments of expressed sequence tags ESTs          cDNAs and the results of protein similarity searches and          geneprediction algorithms Apollo displays the filtered          results of the pipeline in tiers of evidence and allows          human curators to evaluate and use the evidence to          construct gene models The guidelines used to define gene          models in the euchromatin   were modified slightly          to deal with the unique properties of heterochromatic          sequence see Materials and methods We generated           preliminary gene models on the masked scaffolds          Next the preliminary gene models were recurated on          the unmasked WGS heterochromatic sequence scaffolds The          unmasked scaffolds were run through the computational          annotation pipeline and the preliminary gene models were          aligned to this genomic sequence Twentyfive preliminary          gene models could not be aligned to the unmasked          scaffolds using sim   After further examination           of these were accepted as curated gene models six were          similar to transposable elements and were rejected and          eight could not be reconciled with the unmasked sequence          A higherquality genomic sequence may be required to          verify these eight models and they have not been          included here The remaining preliminary gene models          aligned in a consistent manner After reexamination of          the evidence a total of  preliminary gene models were          accepted including  proteincoding gene models and          five nonproteincoding gene models          Because they are present on WGS heterochromatic          scaffolds shorter than  kb a number of previously          known Ylinked proteincoding genes were missed by our          analysis We annotated six of these Ylinked genes            kl kl kl Ory PpY and           PprY  The WGS sequence data were          generated from clone libraries made from mixedsex          populations so the male Y chromosome is represented by a          fourfold lower density of sequence reads than the          autosomes In addition Ylinked genes can have very          large introns   Consequently sequences on the Y          chromosome are represented by shorter scaffolds in the          WGS assemblies   In fact five of the six Ylinked          genes that we annotated were first characterized by          analysis of short WGS scaffolds    We used cDNA          sequences to identify short WGS scaffolds bearing          fragments of each of the six genes concatenated these          scaffolds into larger scaffolds superscaffolds see          Materials and methods and annotated the resulting          sequences to produce gene models We produced and          annotated one additional superscaffold linked using          EST evidence The seven superscaffolds contain           proteincoding gene models and one nonproteincoding          gene model                          Evidence for the gene models          We generated  proteincoding gene models and six          nonproteincoding gene models These include           previously known and molecularly characterized          proteincoding genes see Supplementary Table  in the          additional data file The proteincoding gene models are          supported by four classes of evidence alignment to           Drosophila ESTs alignment to           Drosophila fullinsert cDNA          sequences protein similarity and prediction by          genefinding algorithms There are  gene models           that overlap at least one aligned EST and  of these           are further supported by an aligned cDNA sequence          There are  models  with protein similarity          evidence and  models  supported by gene          prediction The numbers of gene models supported by all          combinations of the classes of evidence is diagrammed in          Figure  The  models  supported only by EST          evidence require further validation because cDNA          libraries can be contaminated with various artifacts          including sequences from unprocessed transcripts The           models  supported only by gene prediction are          included in our curated set because they encode peptides          of at least  amino acids with no significant          similarity to proteins encoded by transposable elements          see below Finally the  models  supported only          by protein similarity have BLAST or TBLASTX expect scores          Evalues of less than    to sequences in           Drosophila or other species          We excluded gene models with greater than  identity          over  bp to known transposable elements We then          examined nine remaining preliminary gene models with a          TBLASTX Evalue of less than    when compared to a          database of transposable elements   and we retained          all but one of them in our annotation Although these          gene models have weak similarity to proteins encoded by          transposable elements the extent of similarity is          insufficient to suggest that they represent           bona fide transposable element          ORFs Two of these models represent the genes           kl and           scro  and the region of similarity          in           scro corresponds to the homeodomain          of this transcription factor gene To further verify that          the WGS heterochromatic annotations do not show          significant homology to transposable elements we          compared the distributions of WGS heterochromatic and          Release  euchromatic gene models with TBLASTX similarity          to transposable elements over a range of expect scores          Figure  This analysis shows that the percentage of          gene models with weak similarity to transposable elements          is comparable in the WGS heterochromatic annotation and          the Release  euchromatic annotation          The WGS heterochromatic gene models are supported by          fewer data than the Release  euchromatic gene models In          the WGS heterochromatin  of gene models have an          overlapping EST compared to  in the Release           euchromatin Twenty percent of gene models in the WGS          heterochromatin are based on fullinsert sequences of          cDNAs compared to over  in the Release  euchromatin          However this observation is biased because half of the          cDNAs in the           Drosophila Gene Collection were          selected for fullinsert sequencing based on EST          alignments to Release  gene models   and the WGS          heterochromatin annotation preserves few of the Release           models and adds many new models Many WGS          heterochromatic gene models are based solely on gene          predictions Despite generating a large number of models          genefinding algorithms were less successful at          predicting heterochromatic genes than euchromatic genes          For example only  of the heterochromatic gene models          are supported by Genscan predictions as opposed to           of the Release  euchromatic gene models          Finally we annotated six nonproteincoding RNA          genes WGS scaffold  contains rDNA          sequences including two complete copies each of the S          and  rRNAs a truncated S rRNA sequence that extends          into a sequence gap and a truncated S rRNA sequence          that extends beyond the end of the scaffold This region          probably represents a portion of one of the two           bobbed loci which map to the X and          Y chromosomes    Two additional          nonproteincoding gene models were annotated by          similarity to euchromatic genes see Supplementary Table           in the Additional data file                          Comparison to the Release  annotation          The annotation of WGS heterochromatic sequence has          increased both the number and quality of gene models in          the heterochromatin relative to the corresponding          portion of Release  see Supplementary Table  in the          additional data files During the curation of the           proteincoding gene models in WGS heterochromatic          sequence  gene models from the corresponding portion          of Release  were deleted and  new gene models were          created Many of the deleted Release  annotations          represent ORFs that overlap transposable elements In          annotating WGS heterochromatin  Release  gene models          were merged into five new models one Release  model was          split into two new models and one Release  annotation          was split into two models one of which was merged with          another model Only  of the  Release           proteincoding gene models were preserved intact in the          new annotation  previous models were preserved with          modifications Thus a much higher fraction of Release           gene models was modified in the WGS heterochromatin          annotation than in the Release  euchromatic annotation          in which nearly twothirds of predicted ORFs were          unchanged            As in the annotation of the Release  euchromatic          sequence the increased numbers of ESTs and cDNA          sequences available for alignment to the WGS          heterochromatic sequence resulted in significant          improvements in the annotation of untranslated regions          UTRs alternative transcripts and intronexon          structures see Supplementary Table  in additional data          files Twice as many genes in WGS heterochromatin have          annotated  and  UTRs as in the corresponding portion          of Release  The average  UTR length is  bp and the          average  UTR length is  bp both of which are close          to the average UTR length of Release  euchromatic genes          There are  gene models with more than one transcript          only three were annotated in the corresponding portion of          Release  There are  predicted proteincoding          transcripts encoding  distinct exons three times as          many as were annotated in Release  The average number          of introns per gene model increased from  to  but          remains below the  average in the Release           euchromatin The average length of introns increased          significantly from  bp in the corresponding portion          of Release  to  bp in WGS heterochromatin The          longest annotated intron in WGS heterochromatin is           bp dwarfing a  bp intron that was the          longest in the corresponding portion of Release           Finally only two introns longer than  kb were          annotated in Release  but  gene models in WGS          heterochromatin have introns longer than  kb Whereas          the majority of annotated introns in both the WGS          heterochromatin and the Release  euchromatin are in the          range of  bp there are clearly more long introns in          heterochromatic genes                          Annotations of selected regions          The second largest WGS heterochromatic scaffold          annotated is  kb long Figure  and incorporates five          separate Release  scaffolds The sequence of this          scaffold is contained within a previously described BAC          contig    Because the scaffold contains two well          studied autosomal heterochromatic genes           light and           concertina  analysis of its          sequence provides an opportunity to assess the accuracy          of both the WGS sequence assembly and the annotation          process over an extended heterochromatic region This          scaffold maps within band h on Lh and its orientation          with respect to the centromere is known              The scaffold lies approximately  kb proximal to the          end of the Release  euchromatic sequence of L   as          determined by genomic Southern blots using singlecopy          probes derived from the ends of the scaffold and the          Release  L sequence   The structure of the          scaffold is entirely consistent with previous Lh mapping          studies in that the order of six singlecopy sequences          and the predicted           Not I           Pme I and           Sfi I restriction maps of the          scaffold except for four regions corresponding to          sequence gaps are the same as those observed in the          corresponding BAC contig and on genomic Southern blots          We annotated  proteincoding genes within the          scaffold          The annotation of the           rolled gene illustrates how masking          the WGS heterochromatic sequence improved Genscan          performance and simplified curation Figure  cDNA          sequences define two alternative           rolled transcripts that differ in          their  UTRs All           rolled exons defined by the cDNA          sequences align to the WGS heterochromatic scaffold and          the masked scaffold in the correct order and orientation          In the annotation of the unmasked WGS scaffold          transposable elements within           rolled introns interfered with          Genscan so that a very poor           rolled gene prediction was          generated and protein similarity results of transposable          elements complicated the evidence In the annotation of          the masked scaffold Genscan predicted a single gene          model that includes all but one           rolled coding exon and protein          similarity evidence supported the exon that Genscan          missed                          Transposable elements          We carried out a preliminary analysis of the          transposable element sequences found in the WGS          heterochromatic sequence We used a database of          transposable elements   and RepeatMasker   to          measure the amount of sequence that was derived from each          transposable element family Many of the sequences we          identified represent only portions of elements such          fragmentary elements are often generated when          transposable elements insert into one another to form          complex nests   Despite this complication we were          able to estimate the contribution of each transposable          element class          The most striking observation is the high fraction of          the WGS heterochromatic sequence that is derived from          transposable elements We found that  of the Mb          WGS heterochromatic sequence had similarity to known          transposable elements Using similar analyses          transposable elements account for just  of the          Release  euchromatic sequence a slightly lower value of           was obtained in the analyses reported in            which required a higher level of sequence conservation          There were also some differences in the relative          contributions made by different classes of elements in          heterochromatin and euchromatin LTR elements represent           of euchromatic transposable elements and          approximately  of heterochromatic elements LINE          elements represent  of the euchromatic and  of the          heterochromatic transposable element sequence TIR          elements represent  in euchromatin and  in          heterochromatin No FB elements were identified using          RepeatMasker a more targeted search identified  kb           of FB element sequence          Although we found a much higher density of          transposable element sequences in the heterochromatin          than in the euchromatin it is likely that we missed many          heterochromatic transposable elements In fact we found          ORFs with similarity to transposable elements such as          those encoding transposases outside those regions we          annotated as transposable elements see Figure a for          example suggesting the existence of novel transposable          element families Finally many of the sequence gaps          within scaffolds probably correspond to regions of the          genome with very high transposable element density Thus          our analysis almost certainly represents an underestimate          of the total transposable element content of the WGS          heterochromatic scaffolds As repetitive elements are          difficult to assemble using the WGS strategy an accurate          estimate of their contribution to the heterochromatic          sequence awaits a more finished version of the          sequence                          Cytological boundaries of centric          heterochromatin          Although there is no universally accepted definition          of heterochromatin the most reliable classification of          the centric heterochromatin is cytological Therefore we          consider the sequences located within the bands hh          of the cytological map defined on mitotic chromosomes to          be heterochromatic In order to correlate heterochromatin          cytology with the genome sequence we mapped the          boundaries of the euchromatin and centric heterochromatin          on chromosome arms X L R L and R by FISH of          BACderived probes to mitotic chromosomes see Materials          and methods BACs were selected from the centric ends of          the essentially finished Release  sequence contigs that          span the euchromatin   and the positions of the          resulting hybridization signals on the cytological map          were determined Figure  Table  These data show that          the large Release  sequence contigs extend into the          centric heterochromatin on these five chromosome arms          Although BACs were localized to chromosome  data not          shown the cytology of this chromosome is too poor to          permit a clear BACbased mapping of the boundary of the          centric heterochromatin The Y chromosome has no          boundary because it is entirely heterochromatic          For the purposes of defining the gene content of the          heterochromatic portion of the genomic sequence we          provisionally designate the distal ends of the indicated          BACs Table  as defining the boundaries of the centric          heterochromatin within the finished genomic sequence          However the transition from euchromatin to          heterochromatin appears to be gradual rather than sharp          and the resolution of these cytological mapping          experiments appears to be on the order of  kb          Therefore we have approximately localized the          heterochromatineuchromatin boundaries with respect to          the genomic sequence and have defined precise boundaries          here simply as a convenience in discussing the genome          annotation data By this definition the Release           sequence that spans the euchromatin includes  Mb of          sequence in centric heterochromatin and this sequence          includes  curated genes described in Misra           et al   These genes are in          addition to those identified in our analysis which was          restricted to the WGS heterochromatic scaffolds          described above          The BACs that we localized on the cytological map of          the mitotic chromosomes have also been positioned using           in situ hybridization to salivary          gland polytene chromosomes    Although banding in          the proximal regions of the polytene chromosomes is not          as distinct as in the euchromatic regions comparison of          the two datasets shows the approximate extent of overlap          between the mitotic and polytene cytogenetic maps Table           The boundary of the centric heterochromatin of the X          chromosome at the distal edge of band h corresponds          approximately to polytene division C band h on          chromosome arm L corresponds to polytene division A          band h on R corresponds to polytene division F band          h on L corresponds to polytene division A and band          h on R corresponds to polytene division C                            Discussion                  Improvements to the annotation          The annotation of the heterochromatic portion of the           Drosophila genome described here is          a work in progress We have annotated proteincoding          genes and summarized preliminary observations on          nonproteincoding genes and transposable elements Our          analysis was limited by the high repeat content of          heterochromatin and by the unfinished quality of the WGS          heterochromatic sequence Our decision to delay          annotation of the scaffolds shorter than  kb has          probably resulted in failure to identify some genes          especially on the Y chromosome Despite these          limitations the proteincoding gene annotations are          generally reliable as demonstrated by the identification          of previously known heterochromatic genes and the          alignment of cDNA sequences to the draft genomic sequence          and the annotated gene models Nevertheless the quality          of the annotations will be greatly improved by the          addition of more fulllength cDNA sequences of          heterochromatic genes and by comparative analysis using          the mosquito   and           D pseudoobscura   WGS          sequences          Future analyses of the differences between euchromatic          and heterochromatic sequence may lead to improvements in          the performance of computational geneprediction          algorithms on heterochromatic sequence Our observations          that the geneprediction tools Genie   and Genscan            performed relatively poorly in identifying          heterochromatic genes suggests that these programs could          be modified to improve their performance on          heterochromatic sequence Processing the genomic          sequence by masking repeats and reducing the distances          between potential coding exons improved the performance          of the geneprediction tools and improved gene          identification during subsequent reannotation of the          unmasked sequence Optimization of these preprocessing          steps should lead to improved performance The annotated          gene models that are supported by cDNA andor          highquality TBLASTX matches provide a useful dataset for          training and testing geneprediction algorithms on          heterochromatic sequence          A collection of approximately            P transposable element insertions          in heterochromatin has recently been generated            AY Konev CM Yan E OHagan S Tickoo GHK          unpublished data These           P element insertions will provide          tools for the analysis of heterochromatic genes and          manipulation of the heterochromatic portion of the          genome For example           P elementmediated deletions of          centric heterochromatin have been used to map genes and          regions responsible for controlling gene expression and          replication                            Improvements to the genomic sequence          We plan to improve the WGS heterochromatic sequence          by filling sequence gaps and correcting assembly errors          The quality of the WGS assembly suggests a strategy for          bringing these sequences to high quality first select a          tiling path of kb genomic clones from the WGS that          span each scaffold second sequence each clone to high          quality third assemble these kb sequences to          reconstruct the genomic sequence and fourth verify the          assembly by comparison to cDNA sequence alignments and to          restriction digests of genomic DNA assayed if necessary          on Southern blots cDNA alignments will also be useful in          linking separate scaffolds in cases in which the exons of          a single gene lie in more than one scaffold We gained          extensive experience in each of these steps during our          finishing of the euchromatic portion of the genome            and no new technology is required to bring the WGS          scaffolds we have described here to finished quality          Some regions of the heterochromatin are clonable in          BACs Three small BAC contigs from the genome physical          map are located in the centric heterochromatin of          chromosome arms L R and L   Draft sequences of          BACs spanning these contigs were produced during the          Release  phase of the genomesequencing project             The small BAC contig on L corresponds to the WGS          scaffold that includes           light and           concertina see Figure             and the contigs on R and L also align to WGS          scaffolds We have also identified BACs containing the           rolled PARP and           SNAP genes in pilot STS content          mapping experiments in the heterochromatin Doubtless          other regions of the heterochromatin will be represented          in largeinsert libraries and BACs will be useful for          linking and orienting short WGS heterochromatic          scaffolds However we were unable to identify BACs          containing the Ylinked genes           ccy and           kl in available           Drosophila BAC libraries             perhaps due to high satellite DNA content This suggests          that not all heterochromatic regions assembled in WGS          will be represented in BACs We also do not yet know          whether the highly repetitive nature of heterochromatin          decreases the stability of sequences cloned in BACs For          these reasons we favor a sequencefinishing strategy          based on the kb clones generated in the WGS                            Materials and methods                  Genomic sequence alignments          The alignment of WGS to the essentially finished          Release  sequence spanning the euchromatin is described          in Celniker           et al   WGS scaffolds that          did not show significant alignment were defined to be          heterochromatic In addition five WGS scaffolds aligned          to the centric ends of the Release  euchromatic sequence          and extended beyond them We used sim   and MUMmer            to realign these five scaffolds and the sequence          extending beyond the aligned portions of the Release           euchromatic sequence contigs was extracted with a bp          overlap and included in the WGS heterochromatic          sequence Finally a kb region including BACRD at          the centric end of the Release  Xchromosome sequence            was not included in the Release  annotation of the          euchromatin   This sequence was included in the          analysis of WGS heterochromatic sequence          The WGS heterochromatic sequence scaffolds were          aligned to the corresponding Release  sequence scaffolds          using BLAST   The alignment results were carefully          examined and the two assemblies were found to have few          discrepancies                          Masking sequence scaffolds          We masked WGS heterochromatic sequences before          annotation We used RepeatMasker   with the default          settings to mask transposable elements   and          lowcomplexity sequences Next we shortened all sequence          gaps and repeatmasked regions to  bp                          Databases and tools          To annotate the WGS heterochromatic sequence we used          the computational analysis pipeline and databases          described in Mungall           et al   This pipeline aligns           Drosophila ESTs cDNA sequences          and other sequences in GenBank using sim   performs          DNA and protein sequence similarity searches of the          GenBank and SwissProtTrEMBL databases using BLASTX and          TBLASTX and executes the geneprediction algorithms          Genie   and Genscan   The results generated by          the pipeline were filtered using the Bioinformatics          Output Parser BOP   and the filtered results were          curated using the tool Apollo                            Curation guidelines          To determine the intronexon structure of gene models          curators visually inspected the alignment of          computational evidence types to the WGS heterochromatic          sequences using Apollo Alternative transcripts supported          by EST evidence and UTRs were annotated The criteria          used to curate the gene models in the WGS sequence were          identical to those used in the annotation of the          euchromatin   with two exceptions First          computational results derived from Genscan were not          judged by their scores as it was empirically determined          that lowscoring Genscan results often correctly          predicted the intronexon structures suggested by other          evidence types such as cDNAs Second the predicted          proteins of the WGS annotation were compared to a          curated transposable element dataset   Gene models          with an alignment of at least  nucleotides with at          least  identity to transposable elements were          rejected          Gene models produced on the masked scaffolds were          mapped to the unmasked WGS sequence using sim Gene          models that aligned with less than  identity to the          unmasked sequence were not preserved Gene models were          checked to ensure that they did not overlap transposable          elements and that they did not have major alterations of          their intronexon structure due to the presence of          unmasked data Gene models were refined using evidence          that had not aligned to the masked WGS sequence                          Linking scaffolds with cDNAs          In WGS exons of the           kl gene are distributed over four          scaffolds These scaffolds were concatenated and          annotated to produce a           kl gene model Similar          superscaffolds linked to linked were constructed          for the genes           kl kl kl Ory PpY  and                    PprY An additional superscaffold          linked was constructed based on EST evidence The          superscaffolds were constructed as follows with each          WGS scaffold indicated by the last five digits of the          scaffold ID and relative orientation indicated by F          forward or R reverse          linkedRFRFRFR          linked FFFRR linked          RFFF linked          FFRF linked          RRR linked FF and          linked RF Because the gaps between          individual scaffolds in a superscaffold are not spanned          by identified genomic clones their lengths are          undefined These gaps are represented with a string of           Ns following the convention established for the          Release  genomic sequence                            Fluorescence in situhybridization FISH          Mitotic chromosomes from third instar larval          neuroblasts were obtained by standard procedures            Slides were aged at room temperature for  h or for  h          at C pretreated in  gml

washed in  formamidex SSC at C for  min          followed by four washes in x SSC at C  min each          and  washes in x SSC at C  min each For          those BACs that demonstrated significant          crosshybridizaton to other chromosomal regions FISH was          repeated using higher stringency  formamide          hybridization solution and posthybridization washes In          singlecolor hybridization experiments biotinylated or          digoxigeninlabeled BAC probes were detected using          FITCavidin Vector Laboratories or FITC          antidigoxigenin Roche respectively Detections were          performed overnight at C or  h at room temperature          For multiBAC twocolor FISH biotinylated probes were          detected with FITC avidin and digoxigeninlabeled

relative to the DAPI          banding pattern on the heterochromatic map was determined          by visual analysis in Photoshop Adobe In addition an          independent quantitative analysis using IP Labs Signal          Analytics Vienna VA and a fluorescence quantitation          script   was performed on each image The          fluorescence levels along lines drawn through the          chromosome axis were plotted for the DAPI and BAC signals          Figure b which produces a more precise localization          than is possible by visual inspection of the images A          minimum of  prometaphase chromosomes were analyzed for          each BAC and localizations were determined by          consensus                          Heterochromatin in the Release  euchromatic
