                                 The Republican Presidential Hopeful            After his excruciatingperformance in the  Republican presidential campaign Lamar Alexandershould have had the grace to disappear quietly into the Tennessee backwoodsBut here we are a full  days before the  election and Alexanderis running againairing ads in Iowa fund raising pandering mounting hishigh horse and doing all the other unappetizing things a presidentialcandidate must do            Alexander who has beencampaigning for president more or less nonstop since  is the very model ofthe Republican Presidential Hopeful or RPH but hes hardly alone With noRepublican heir apparent the  race promises to be the wildest GOP primaryin a generation There are by my count two dozen Republicans considered atleast by their own estimation viable  candidates is the full list            And anastonishing number of them are already engaged in allbutofficial campaignsdesperate quests to become an early favorite The willbe candidates arecompeting fiercely for donors staff volunteers endorsements A caveat Notall the potential candidates are precampaigning George W Bush and ElizabethDole for example have carefully avoided any presidential posturing            So who is the RPH What are defining qualities                           The RPH is not easilydeterred Anyone who would spend three years of his life pursuing an officethat he has no reasonable hope of winning must be irrepressible The RPH isntbothered by the fact that hes been routed before Alexander Alan Keyes PeteWilson Pat Buchanan Steve Forbes Jack Kemp that hes the most hated man inpolitics Newt Gingrich that hes a national joke Dan Quayle that hardlyanyone outside his home state has heard of him John Ashcroft Bob SmithGeorge Pataki Tom Ridge John Kasich Tommy Thompson that most voters willconfuse him with an SL crook Frank Keating the governor ofOklahomahes never heard of you either or that he might not get elected ifhe were the nexttolast American alive Gary Bauer                           The RPHpretends he isnt actually running Its tacky to be campaigning forpresident in the first half of  soeven though everyone knows hesgoing to runthe RPH generally insists he isnt a candidate He has devised anumber of lies and halftruths to convey this Its not something Im thinkingabout right now Rudolph Giuliani He wont decide until  Quaylefor another year Kasich until after the  elections lots of themIts just an exploratory committee Keyes Its very premature to talkabout it Pataki Im extremely flattered by the speculation but a worthiercandidate will certainly come along Bauer My focus is entirely on thestate of  Christie Todd Whitman and other governors Instead ofappearing to be the grasping pol he is the RPH exudes the impression that hewont run unless the American people plead for his candidacy Rare is thepolitician who doesnt hear that plea                           The RPH says he has a real job but hedoesnt Some RPHs do actually work for a living Sitting governorsmembers of Congress Dole and Bauer all hold real jobs But often the RPH hasa simulacrum of a career the kind of work that is an excuse to spend everywaking minute campaigning That means you Keyes Alexander Quayle KempBuchanan Would you dare say your job is professional presidentialcandidate            The RPH claims he is workingfor the good of America or the Republican Party or both What exactly doesthis work consist of Much of it is giving speeches Forbes has made nearly over the last  months            The restof the RPHs work is running his political action committee or grassrootsadvocacy group  This group has a magnificent patriotic name Campaign fora New American Century Live Free or Die Solutions America Spirit of AmericaClick to play a game Match the RPH to his group The RPHs group hasambitious goals to advocate the flat tax Forbes to draft an agenda for anew American century Alexander to build and strengthen the RepublicanParty Quayle In fact the group has only one real purpose to raise fundsand promote the RPH before official campaigning as well as official fundraising begins in             What does the RPH believe in Well the RPH hasPrinciples  The RPH is highminded He frequently quotes Ronald ReaganHe especially enjoys taking a bold public stand against his party Thisdistinguishes him as a statesman who wont sacrifice principles for expediencyIt also guarantees a bit of favorable press Ashcroft regularly berates theRepublican Congress for having cut and run rather than having tackled toughmoral issues Forbes periodically slaps Republicans in Congress forcompromising Get real or get out is a Forbes slogan Keyes makes a habit ofdenouncing the GOP for expanding government for approving treaties for notimpeaching Clinton etc And the RPH often slams fellow Republicans for notdoing enough to ban abortion            The RPH who must legislate orgovern Gingrich Kasich Bush is quieter about his principlesprobablybecause he actually has to live by them There is no such check on theunemployed RPH                           The RPHhas a multipoint tax plan usually at least four points often  The RPHgenerally believes in the flat tax which should be set at  percentQuaylethat taxandspend liberalwould set it at a whopping  percentThe RPH might also believe in eliminating the income tax Keyes slashing theincome tax and raising tariffs Buchanan or rejiggering the tax code to savetaxpayers  billion Ashcroft by abolishing taxes on inheritances and onSocial Security benefits among other measures The RPH does not muchelaborate on how he would balance the budget after his cuts                           The RPH is a writer The RPH has hiddenliterary talents You cant turn around in a bookstore without knocking over apile of unsold RPH books Click for a list of them and another mixandmatchgame            The publication of the RPHbook is followed by the book tour which leads to the next fact about theRPH                           The RPH likes totravelto New Hampshire and Iowa Gingrich recently toured to promoteLessons Learned the Hard Way  He found himself signing books inManchester NH and Des Moines Iowaundoubtedly because those cities arefamed for their interest in great literature Forbes Alexander AshcroftKasich and John McCain have also recently visited New Hampshire ForbesAlexander Ashcroft Smith and Keyes have stopped off in Iowa Kemp hastraveled to Iowa at least seven times And the pressing business of New Yorktook Pataki on a city tour through the South and the West            The RPHwill also travel to any place where a few dozen Republicans have gathered Lastsummer the Midwestern Republican Leadership Conference in Indianapolis dreweight RPHs A similar meeting in Biloxi Miss this year also attracted eighthopefuls Even the recent summit of the Harris County Texas Republicansmanaged to pull in Quayle Forbes Keating Ashcroft and Bauer If you held afamily reunion you could probably get Ashcroft Keyes and Forbes to givestump speeches at the barbecue                           The RPH trolls for endorsements The RPHknows he needs support from the opinionmaking class to win in  The RPHhas almost certainly appeared on Evans  Novak  If hes lucky theRPH has been championed by a pundit Cal Thomas just wrote a paean to QuayleKasich won a fullthroated cheer from the New York Times Magazine             There isone endorsement the RPH seeks above all Ralph Reeds  The RPH longs tosign the former Christian Coalition boss as a campaign consultant QuayleKemp Forbes Alexander Bush Kasich and Ashcroft have already met with Reedand kissed his ring            Perhaps the most importantand certainly mostridiculouselement of the precampaign is the early polls  Never has somuch been made of such flimsy numbers Ashcroft got a media boost when hefinished first in a survey of Christian Coalition state chapter leaders Forbesfans tout his top finish in a straw poll of Conservative Political ActionConference members There have been national news stories based on straw pollsof a few hundred party loyalists in Mississippi Texas and the MidwestRecently a person phone poll by a New Hampshire TV station madeheadlines            There is a discouraginglesson in the polls for the RPH Bush has finished first easily in every pollexcept the Christian Coalitions and CPACs He is also one of the few RPHs whoeschews the precampaign Hes running for reelection as governor this falland he doesnt want Texans to worry that hell skip out on them midway throughhis second term which of course is exactly what hed like to do So Bushhas no PAC and no book He hasnt traveled to Iowa or New Hampshire and heavoids most GOP conferences Instead hes just governing and campaigning inTexas            Thisshould frighten the daylights out of the RPH Perhaps all the schemingposturing speechifying and moneygrubbing in the world cant help the RPHPerhaps Republican voters really want to reward the doernot the campaignernot the precampaigner                           If youmissed the full list of Republican Presidential Hopefuls click
