        so have you done any painting projects lately     yeah this is a great topic for me because i just did my first two painting projects ever it was not not a big deal     oh really what kind of painting was it   two little deals the first one um i helped someone repaint an apartment and it was  very easy   uhhuh it was it   yeah and ive never painted anything i always thought it would be so you know youd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something but i know i can do it  and the second one was i bought some toys at a um   yeah oh huh   at a craft fair theyre unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a a little girl for Christmas and so i just decided to paint them and that wasnt as easy as painting the apartment was   uhhuh oh well what kind of paint did you use for the um bookends   well its uh it thats half the problem right there is that it wasnt it was a oil base so i had to get and when i painted them i didnt realize that we didnt have any uh turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house so i had it had it all over my hands at first i didnt realize you know i had never painted anything so i didnt realize that i needed that i mean i kind of knew in the back of my mind   uhhuh so you cant use oil on wood   well no you can use it on wood but i just had it all over my hands and i went to wash the brushes out and uh wash my hands and you cant wash it off with water you have to get the uh a solution   oh  so you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway   and yeah i had to drive to the store yeah i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and right back and everything like that and then um   oh   uh downstairs in the in the apartment i just used we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on you know if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean up   oh is that what you usually use in the house is latex   yeah and and it it just like the same with the toys its just important to look for one that doesnt have lead in it you know it says safe for children and all that   hm uhhuh yeah heard about that i guess a friend of mine had a uh um well she she just started up a day care center and uh and the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff   yeah   so uh she had that done but uh   have you painted anything recently   well um so to speak i had to paint this uh the inside of this warehouse thing uh that you keep some um farm equipment in   wow was it huge uhhuh   and um what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer and uh i had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner i mean i you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner   yeah   but uh you just took a roller and put it on there and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed so   wow   yeah it was it used all of it i guess it was about three hundred yards worth so well i guess it worked out it was pretty easy actually   yeah i think though um were lucky that we didnt have to do any detail work because i dont know if i could you know i dont know i dont know must be difficult   well what about the trim in your house did you have to do that   no it was just it was really easy i just like what i we had a couple of different size brushes and it was   uhhuh   you know real easy i went around the trim and if it and there was wallpaper like i was doing just doing just the trim of the around the doors and windows and there was wallpaper and   umhum   if we got it on the wallpaper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried it came right off so there was no major mistakes there was   oh yeah did you have uh one coat or two   uh two actually um and it there was um you know around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that but that   umhum yeah that would be really time a a time saver   well yeah if you just  you know we didnt tape anything we werent that careful but it wasnt you know i dont know its its funny its like if you just go slow you dont get or at least i didnt get that many       mistakes i didnt make that many mistakes   umhum oh me i wouldve had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges and and then id have probably rolled it on id uh it wouldve taken me forever     why just because youd be afraid to do it or have you done it before   yeah well the first time itd probably wouldve tooken me forever so   well it wasnt if it was my own i wouldve but my friend said oh just go ahead you just go ahead its easy i said okay its your place   well how long did it take yall   well a couple of weekends we would go down two or three hours on the weekends and   umhum so there was two of yall   no there was they were doing all sorts of repairs and there was i was just painting because i dont know how to do anything else so theres a whole bunch of people yeah   well thats easy enough um   so now i feel like if i ever buy a house i can probably paint if nothing else   i think i could probably do it uh as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it   yeah but you know i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys and the guy said oh get this its a nice shiny gloss which was true       but i didnt realize what you know a pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you dont have latex i dont know if its worth the shine   umhum
