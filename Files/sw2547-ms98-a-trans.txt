                okay what uh go ahead and tell me about your home   well my my home at the moment is an apartment   oh is that right   yeah i work here in Germantown but i live in Pensacola Florida   oh thats interesting   so i own a home in Pensacola and uh lets see we are to compare homes correct   okay yeah   uh my home is well is typical for the area i live in a development uh its a relatively i would say oh well God it sounds like  sounds like im bragging   no thats okay   no its upper middle class uh kind of an environment its a   okay   two story colonial which my wife and i designed   oh thats neat   uh it has around thirty two hundred square feet   wow thats large     uh five bedrooms and so forth and so on and it is i would imagine in terms of of size and so forth its relatively typical for the area it might be i would say its probably midsized for the area there are some smaller and there are several you know several larger   umhum   and uh but in based you know in terms of you know in in Pensacola in that area of Florida it uh its what now it is uh probably ten years old   oh well thats not too bad thats still fairly new   yeah and so its in terms of cost and and and size and so forth it uh the house you know housing there is extremely affordable and uh compared to other parts of the country you know lets say compared to Maryland that same house here would probably cost three quarters of a million dollars but   well oh youre kidding well do you mind if i ask what its worth down there i mean what its   i really havent i really havent uh when we built it ten years ago it was it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars   okay   so i i would have really i havent really priced you know in the market so i   huh it it sounds like i mean from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand   umhum   i mean Dallas is a very marked up area although right now its a lot lower  um because of all the layoffs and everything the economy around here is real poor   umhum i thought that was on the upswing again now   well no not really   umhum   um the area itself uh the Fort Worth Dallas area um has become become kind of depressed because theres been so many layoffs with big companies including Texas Instruments  um theres been tremendous amounts of of uh layoffs   yes   so really housing is real bad the economy itself around here is not too terribly bad but housing is still real bad   umhum well Pensacola has   yeah   its really is a buyers market there now and it isnt because of the well there is been a lot of speculative building   yeah this is oh   uh i dont know perhaps not in Dallas but uh im sure people in uh you know in uh Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it uh Pensacola is a Navy town   uhhuh   and home porting was a possibility a few years ago   oh   they were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy  a new carrier was coming in and uh   wow   the uh attendant uh support vessels well thats no longer   so do you think it was overdeveloped then   the case oh its it is i mean the the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population   wow   and so uh overbuilding is it it has been a real problem there   um   so you can still get a get a a good good house for a very very reasonable price and i mean good i would lets say typical say three bedroom uh two and a half baths on a half acre or so of land uh reasonable construction would probably run you uh right now anywhere between somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars   um  yeah thats   and probably perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood so   yeah   what about your home   thats well  right now were just renting but  it is a home um   umhum   its a four bedroom home it has about i guess eighteen hundred square feet its on one floor   umhum   uh we have no basement  i dont know if Pensacopla okay  i wasnt sure most of the ones you know know up north and everything do but  um anyway   no nor nor do we but   um   its uh its pretty also pretty typical for the area most of this area was developed uh this house was built in seventy four   umhum   so most of the its almost twenty years old and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style uh we have a friend that lives two blocks over and his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four   umhum   but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same so i i think most of them are there was it like most areas that are built um there were probably like two or three styles you could choose from   right   and and uh thats pretty much all the houses in the area uh for probably a square mile id say at least maybe even a little bit more than that   w ell the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious and in in the entire DC area im im only about uh twelve miles or so from the uh border of Washington DC and Montgomery County Maryland is probably one of the most expensive   where are you in relation to Sevren are you close to Sevren   places to no we are west Sevren is East near the Eastern Shore if i had   oh okay well i just my i have a sister that used to live in Sevren and they bought their home in i i want to say like around   umhum   nineteen seventy five or something like that and they paid like they they had it built from you know they they designed it and everything and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand so i   oh thats not unusual yeah   yeah so i just wondered you know if the whole area was like that or     well thats that area over there is not as expensive as in the the immediate you know Washington area   umhum   and so we uh i was just looking for example there is a uh condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium and ninety two thousand dollars for two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment   um   now it was very nicely done   yeah sounds like a lot of money though     yes i i cant i cant envision spending that much money uh and     for   on on something along those lines so you know its you i guess you pay the piper but   yeah right   plus the the the phenomenal taxes around here are phenomenally high uh   oh yeah   uh for the and so you on that its not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a on an on a what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say for example in Pensacola Florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes maybe maybe you know maybe a little bit higher than that now   wow yeah thats   but that same house here youd pay almost six thousand dollars a year taxes on it   wow  wow thats pretty     so its uh so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county say drive twenty more miles north buy a condominium for approximately uh the same price maybe a little lower but the taxes would be you know perhaps maybe one third uh of   really that much of a difference uh wow   oh absolutely you know so   thats   its its really sad   yeah   this is one this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country   wow why is that do you know i mean   well they it uh the their they do have an extremely good such things as extremely good school systems for example it has one of the best school systems in the country   umhum   uh and because the cost of living around here is so high public employees make great salaries around here     oh well     i was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the Montgomery County       Public Schools makes and and and im not this is uh the figure he makes eighty thousand dollars a year   my goodness  wow   thats and i by administrator i i think i mean i they didnt they did not define it but for example a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone you know in that uh in that range
