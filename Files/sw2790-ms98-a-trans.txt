                right   what what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation     i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force   yeah   few are uh basically staying home and being homemakers and raising kids exclusively   uhhuh yeah i i i grew up in uh sixties and early seventies and uh my mom didnt work at all when i was growing up she didnt start working until i was um well into high school   uhhuh   so i i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids its a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids   yeah true well mine taught kindergarten but she was always uh i guess her schedule was shorter so she was always uh home   always home by the time you got home   yeah yeah that that statistic i guess has been growing every year its its something around sixty sixty five percent or so now   uhhuh   uh im not sure what the future holds for that whether   it seems like theres it seems like theres a grass roots um effort or whatever going on i i um clean houses parttime and almost all the people that i clean for believe it or not are mothers that dont work   uhhuh   um   thats unusual   theyre all um its and its i think its kind of a new movement its going back towards you know women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years and now theyre wanting to go back to the old days where you know women stayed home with the kids you know and try to give the kids quality time   uhhuh   and i i think that in the future youre i think youre going to see a lot more women choosing to not work after they have a baby   yeah   um i think with uh the uh the work force with the the salaries that a lot of a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are um vice presidents of companies and i think with uh um it seems like its more the upperclass people   uhhuh   um i dont see it as much the like in my situation where i dont i dont have children yet but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids but realistically thats im im realizing thats probably not going to be possible um for middleclass people to be able to live just on one income   yeah that is tough yeah were looking at that now my wifes about six months along   uhhuh i think its going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids   uhhuh   you know its going to kind of  kind of go along with the BMW in the driveway and or in the garage or whatever um and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever   true yeah im surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home i would think it would be women that were working fulltime   yeah believe it or not though the all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home um theyre real active in volunteer work   huh uhhuh   um one of the women is real active with uh muscular dystrophy and uh does a lot of of work with them on a volunteer basis but its still its almost like a job but she just doesnt get paid for it   huh well i guess thats good they got something to keep them active   yeah when when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home or is she going to go back to work   yeah were going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible what do you think   that that that i would i would like to be able to do that   yeah we think its uh that important and i i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction im a a counselor and a therapist and i work with adolescents and   umhum   i see some of the problems the kids have when they dont have a real good family structure   yeah i i see a difference in the generation of even the generation before me   uhhuh   uh were you know mom was like um Mrs Cleaver uh you know June Cleaver or whatever where the the attitudes were a lot different um as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more um there wasnt a lot of the drugs and alcohol and   umhum   um a lot of the the things that are going on in todays society i think morally um it seems like there was the people people were a lot better back then as far as having higher standards   true   huh   well the husbands roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure and and with women working so much theyre kind of pulled out of it too so kids are raised around their friends and by the media   yeah yeah thats true and i think i think youre going to see a lot more of that in the future   thats contributed yeah maybe thats contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time so if there was some way for for women to to stay home even if they could work you know there are a lot of jobs that are coming about like in computers at home and those types of things that would   umhum   at least in some ways bridge the gap   yeah i think that um in the future um the the family unit as it as it once was known is is going to be nonexistent where do how do what do you think   about   uh as far as do do you think theres going to be still a family unit or or do you think that um the trend is going more towards single parenting   theyll understand them the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while um its hard to say families are such a strange configuration anymore um i i see a lot of families where you know in the in the back i grew up about the same time you did   umhum   back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible   uhhuh   nowadays its not the case kids dont kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk and one of the reasons i guess is because theres so much more income in the family with both parents working they get bombarded with junk and they dont have to do anything around the house they never learned to be responsible when the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad   yeah   so  know you create a bigger bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose   yeah yeah   so its not not a real functional situation anyway i dont know its i dont know that that trends going to change the single parent type families and the blended families as long as we ve got so many other crazy things going on in society   yeah i i think that eventually the the family units just not going to even exist anymore its it is that like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think theres going to be more single parent families than there are um you know two parent families   uhhuh   thats pretty sad   yeah it is i guess unless unless theres a a major swing in the change of whats important to people you know probably keep going downhill and i i dont know we we feel like that that we can make it on one income it it may be tough but we may have to give up some some things   i i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that itll make the   yeah   the strain worthwhile   yeah i think so too   well i need to go ahead and and wrap it up it was really nice talking to you   okay well ive enjoyed it Stephanie   and uh thanks a lot okay bye bye   uhhuh byebye
