                okay i will i guess i will start and say that i keep up uh with current events mostly from three or four areas   umhum   and ill tell you what they are and uh then you uh would you please uh tell me how you do it   sure   i think i keep up better with whats going on in the world from the newspaper but i usually am introduced to subjects by television   and then if something that struck your fancy then you pay attention more to that kind of topic then when you get the newspaper   exactly in more detail   umhum umhum   i also take uh Time magazine and i enjoy that a lot and uh i get a lot of uh i think pretty good detail there and uh im pretty im pretty satisfied with i think those and some friends who are who are very knowledgeable   umhum yes   and how how do you   well basically the same thing i i know uh my husbands favorite radio station in all the world is KRLD       he we wake up to KRLD we go to sleep at night to KRLD and i used to just really argue about that and battle that and i dont so much anymore because i do want to keep up and know whats going on and it helps i dont often uh have time to sit down and watch the evening news kind of thing but if im around during the daytime and have a chance ill switch on CNN always have watched CNN ever since we got the cable   yes   uh you know coverage that provided for that and have always enjoyed it and am glad to see them getting a little uh boost these days since the uh war a little more uh recognition and credibility   yes yes   ive i uh have access to Time and Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal all of which i rely on more i think than what i get over network TV news   yes   and like you you know knowledgeable friends i work for a fellow who is uh in the oil industry internationally and travels a lot to third world countries and all around and i feel like a lot of times what we get from his contacts is far more valid   wonderful   then you know but thats only in a real specialized area you know thats not thats just political its not the medical arena its not technology particularly although sometimes it overlaps   of course     into those kinds of things but i dont think i would be satisfied if all i had was just television   no   you know the uh the newspapers i think you know they uh i think a lot of the meat of what i get out  out of the  newspapers not on the front page   i think thats right too well especially The Wall Street Journal   yeah yeah i uh i have really enjoyed being able to have access to that the last couple of years it uh   dont you find though that its hard to find time   yes   to yeah to the reading is The Wall Street Journal if i dont read it the day that it comes in then if they start piling up on me then i have to just forget about about it usually     umhum umhum well and you know you just take a a newspaper just your your regular daily average big city newspaper theres more information in one than an entire month magazine you know monthly periodical   yes   and a lot of times ill just take the whole thing soon as i get it and i take out the sections i want trash the rest otherwise you like you say the the stack of paper is so large     really   its unmanageable just in your home situation   it really is and especially if youre trying to   you know   save papers for recycling   umhum thats right yeah   just terrible job       but uh i think i enjoy uh Time and i i get Insight and i dont like that magazine very much   i im not familiar with that one   it looks like a little Time   umhum umhum   but it is not written as well as Time staff uh writers do but i i like some of those magazines because they just choose certain subjects i guess   uhhuh   and deal with a uh   well im a nonfiction oriented kind of person anyway oh i enjoy a good novel but you know given the choice in the doctors office when theyre all lined up im much more apt to grab the Time or Newsweek or US News and World Reports than i ever would People or McCalls or although ive you know i read those kinds of things too occasionally and and and find things that are current and   well   updated but i dont know i just just my particular predisposition i i tend more the other way so i try not to ever find myself in a situation without something to read because my reading time comes in   yes right   little snatches  i have five kids       so by the time i get around to actually reading i have you know i may have ten or fifteen minutes of slot to read so   i guess you have five children well   uhhuh well theyre good kids   uh oh well of course   and this you know this is another reason though i think that ah makes me real aware and encouraging because i know theres always a a a tidbit of information thats going to come across some im either gonna read it or im gonna hear it that they can turn right around and use in a report   exactly   so if i hear a statistic thats interesting or whatnot even just driving in the car ill make a little note and uh you know of where that came from and the time i heard it and whatnot so they can use that in a bibliography   well you are passing good information on to them arent you   i hope so i hope so i think kids tend to watch news for the sensationalism       my kids love to watch the news but its not always you know you wonder if its for the right reason   yes right   not just the gore   theyve heard it though   yeah yeah but i think its a good habit to   sure it is   to establish uh   it has been nice talking to you   thank you so much and uh   enjoyed it a great deal   ill uh just be anxious to tell my daughters friend that theres a nice lady out there   there really is  its beautiful   and that theres shes not falling off the face of the earth   it really is beautiful you will enjoy i know she will enjoy it   well my daughter hopes to come visit before too long so were uh were anxious to point that way sometime take care and have a good day   oh good thank you you too   byebye
