                    Background        Familial and epidemiological studies have indicated that        there is a strong genetic component in the aetiology of        diabetic nephropathy in Type I diabetes patients           Apolipoprotein E apoE was discovered as a plasma protein        involved in the metabolism of lipoproteins Recently the        apolipoprotein E          APOE  gene has been suggested to be        a risk factor for the development of micro and        macrovascular complications in diabetic patients        The         APOE gene is polymorphic There are        three common alleles         E E and         E which code for three major        isoforms resulting in six common genotypes           Individuals with apoE have higher triglyceride levels and        are associated with lower cholesterol compared to        individuals with apoE Individuals with apoE often have        elevated plasma cholesterol levels There is an increased        prevalence of cardiovascular disease and particularly        Alzheimers disease            Apolipoprotein E polymorphism may influence the        metabolism of lipoproteins in diabetic patients Several        recent studies have suggested that this polymorphism may be        associated with a genetic predisposition for diabetic        nephropathy      Thus         APOE is an important candidate gene        for the development of microvascular complications in Type        I diabetes patients        The aim of this study was to investigate the influence        of         APOE gene polymorphism in the        development of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in Type        I diabetes patients                    Materials and Methods                  Patients          In this study all patients were Russians with          unrelated Type I diabetes All diabetic patients for the          casecontrol study were recruited from StPetersburg          Diabetological Centres and had participated in the          program Diabetes mellitus which included monitoring of          trends and examinations of the determinants of vascular          complications in Type I diabetes carried out in St          Petersburg Russia since           The diabetic patients included in this study satisfied          the World Health Organization criteria for diabetes          mellitus   Glycated haemoglobin HbAlc was measured          by ion exchange chromatography   At entry the          patients had HbAlc levels of  to           The Type I diabetes groups consisted of  subjects          with nephropathy and  subjects without The study          covered  Type I diabetes patients with diabetic          retinopathy and  patients without Some subjects had          more than one type of diabetic complication and          consequently were analysed in more than one group          For Type I diabetes patients all the information was          examined for evidence of nondiabetic renal disease Then          questionnaires medical records and measurements of          albumin excretion were used to determine whether they had          diabetic nephropathy Those patients were considered to          have diabetic nephropathy if they were receiving          treatment for renal disease and either suffered from          persisting proteinuria or had persisting high          albuminuria Urinary albumin excretion was measured by          nephelometry   Nephropathy was defined as a          persistent urinary albumin excretion of more than           gmin or  mg h in two out of three consecutive          urinalyses Individuals with no history of nephropathy          and no albumin excretion were considered free of          nephropathy          Fundus ophthalmoscopy and angiofluorography were used          to diagnose retinopathy The diabetic retinopathy group          consisted of those showing retinal change while Type I          diabetes control group were those who showed no signs of          retinopathy                          DNA genotyping          Blood was collected from each individual and stored in          ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA tubes at C          Genomic DNA was obtained from lysed white blood cells by          phenolchloroform extraction The           APOE gene polymorphism was detected          by polymerase chain reaction PCR           APOE genotyping was performed by          the method of Hixson and Vernier   using a modified          version described by Skobeleva et al            The sequence of the sense oligonucleotide primer was          AGATGCGGGCACGGCTGTTCAAGGA and the antisense primer          was CCCTCGCGAGCCCCGGCCTGGTACAC   Each          amplification reaction contained  mM KCl  mM          trisHCl pH   mM MgCl              M of each primer  M          dNTP  DMSO  g DNA and  U Tag polymerase in a          final volume of  l After denaturation step at C          for  minutes followed by  cycle of denaturation at          C  min annealing at C  min extension at          C  min and a final extension at C  min          using a MiniCycler MJ Research Watertown MA USA          Genotypes were determined by           Hin  Fermentas Vilnius          Lithuania digestion of a base pair PCRamplified          fragment spanning the two polymorphic sites The digested          DNA fragments were separated using migration on           polyacrylamide gels and visualized under UV illumination          after ethidium bromide staining   The codominant          alleles           E E and           E determine the six           APOE genotypes                          Statistical testing          All data are presented as means  SD Groups were          compared using the Students           t test for comparison of two groups          for quantitative variables Allele frequency among          control subjects and case subjects were compared using          standard  tests The difference in genotype frequencies          between the groups was tested by Fishers exact test A          value of P   was considered significant                            Results        Clinical characteristics by study group are shown in        Table  No significant difference was seen between groups        with vascular complications nephropathy and retinopathy        and those without no matter the age diabetes duration        age at diabetes onset and mean HbAlc        The frequency of each genotype in each group conformed        to the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium        The distribution of the         APOE genotypes is shown in Table         There was no significant difference in         APOE genotype and allele frequency        between nephropathic and normoalbuminuric diabetic        patients In this study no association was found between        diabetic retinopathy and         APOE polymorphisms         APOE allele frequencies for males and        females were similar within groups and in different        groups                    Discussion        Diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy are the        two most important microangiopathic complications in Type I        diabetic patients Many of the environmental factors that        influence the risk of vascular disease are known but        genetic components of the risk for diabetic microangiopathy        are poorly understood Several candidate genes have been        investigated to elucidate the genetic factors responsible        for vascular complications The most important of these are        the aldose reductase gene          ALR    the insertiondeletion        ID polymorphism of the angiotensin I  converting enzyme                 ACE  gene    CT        polymorphism of the gene encoding the beta subunit of        geterotrimeric Gproteins          GNB      and CT        polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase        gene          MTHFR           The genetic polymorphism of apolipoprotein E is        associated with lipid abnormalities Eto et al          suggested that lipid abnormalities may contribute to the        development and progression of kidney disease including        diabetic nephropathy The         E allele frequency was significantly        higher in Type II diabetes patients with nephropathy         and with renal failure  than in diabetic patients        without nephropathy    Apolipoprotein E        polymorphism is associated with the progression of diabetic        nephropathy Presence of the apolipoprotein         E allele is a protective factor and        other alleles entail risk factors          The genes responsible for genetic predisposition to        vascular complications are still unknown and little is        known about the molecular basis of these complications The        influence of the         APOE gene polymorphism to the        development of diabetic microangiopathy is uncertain        Chowdhury et al   and Araki et al   demonstrated        an association between the presence of the         APOE E allele and diabetic        nephropathy in Caucasian patients with Type I diabetes        although some investigators do not support this association                  This study elucidated the role of         APOE gene polymorphism in the        predisposition to diabetic vascular complications No        association of         APOE gene polymorphism with diabetic        nephropathy was demonstrated This result for diabetic        nephropathy confirms the findings of Tarnow et al          and Onuma et al   It should be mentioned that sample        sizes in    were larger than in this study With        increased sample size comes the possibility to demonstrate        an association But the larger the necessary and sufficient        minimal sample size the weaker the association        demonstrated        We also analysed the association of the         APOE gene polymorphism with diabetic        retinopathy in the present study No significant        differences were found between groups with and without this        vascular complication A similar result has been shown by        Tarnow et al   for diabetic retinopathy                    Conclusions        The present study found no evidence for a role of the         APOE gene polymorphism in genetic        susceptibility for the development of diabetic retinopathy        in Type I diabetes patients Association between         APOE gene polymorphism and diabetic        nephropathy may be weak or moderate but not strong                    COMPETING INTERESTS        None
