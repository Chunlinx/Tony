                okay can you uh give me your thoughts on what womens roles are or how theyve changed   well um im in my i i ive seen the changes i think in my generation most of all because im a early baby boomer and uh i was brought up uh to sort of get married and raise children and uh be very domestic and uh when i went to college or went to high school i did very well i was urged to become a secretary or a teacher because those are typical roles and uh things have changed and i ive ventured off in all sorts of areas and so have most of the other women in my generation and were all in business or the professions and uh and uh heavens were  were uh astronauts and things like that who know who would wouldnt have been imagined in nineteen sixty eight or something how about you   yeah well i was kind of same thing its you know i was i was brought up in a small town and and women tended to just get married and take care of the house um but as as times changed um the price of things i guess started rising and it took more than one income   yes   so more um more and more of young women were staying in school they were getting a better education and they were going out into the work force   yes another thing that happened that i found is that you know when i got married i didnt know anybody who had ever been divorced or or when i was younger i didnt know anybody who had ever been divorced   yeah   in this day and age people are as likely to get divorced as to stay married and very often the woman has to be able to earn a decent living and uh so theres an additional reason for her to be capable of holding down a good job   yeah i think perhaps uh um years ago it was a stigma on a family to have a divorce in it   yes   and whether it was warranted or not people just stayed together because of what the family thought uh people little bit smarter today than that they uh uh yes theres a family unit and its and its very difficult if there uh are children especially young children but in a lot of cases its probably it would probably more difficult if they stayed together but uh i think women are taking a uh a more active role in politics i i think that uh within the next ten or fifteen years youll probably see a woman vice president or a woman president and youll also see a lot more uh congressmen and senators uh women   i i agree with that and i also think that theyre taking a lead in in the arts and in business too and uh as as the years go by they run surveys to see how many women are CEOs or on the boards of major companies and the number is creeping up very slowly but its definitely increasing so that probably ten years from now   is that right you think they you think thats the case   yes it is i mean ten fifteen ten fifteen years ago there were no women on the boards or or or CEOs of major corporations unless they inherited the firm from their father you know that sort of thing   oh yeah if it was if it was a family owned business you mean   but right if it was a family owned business but now theyre theyre in the board room and theyre trying to get ahead and make it in the business world of course to some extent the laws are helping them but uh uh you know theres no no no holding back their ambition on the other hand what it does to the fabric of society and the family remains to be seen   yeah i still i still think its its uh its a two tiered system i uh i know of of uh women engineers and and uh supervisors that are uh they have to work twice as hard it seems like to achieve the same levels that a male does uh i dont know if thats just my imagination or not but it seems to be thats uh the ones that are up there seem to have a little bit more intelligence than their counterparts   i i i     if there was if it was up to me i think i would have uh more females because it seems like they try harder   well i think that in a way theyre theyre being tested right now were going through a testing period where capability is is everything and if they succeed then the the the generation of girls that are growing up now will have it much easier because there will be a precedent theyll have had role models whereas you know the generation that grew up in the sixties and seventies   right theyll have role models theyll have protectors   sorry   theyll have protectors   yes   uh therell be more and more women that are up higher and higher   yes   um and also they say that the bulk of the wealth is controlled by women now uh just through i guess uh uh the men dying off and just leaving their uh fortunes to women so thats going to have a big impact uh if youve got money and brains you can you can wield a lot of power   um i guess just by virtue of living longer in a way youre right because they do it does does come to them but theyve got to be young enough to enjoy it i mean if theyre just old ladies sitting around waiting for the end to come it doesnt do them much good   yeah       yeah it must be the cultures different uh down there than up here also um theyre kind of uh the old Yankees   yes   you know it it takes uh uh it takes a stick of dynamite to get them moving off center in a lot of cases where uh the Midwest i think is a little bit more aggressive because theyre closer to the west coast where theyre uh highly aggressive you know uh ideas and or it seems like new ideas start out there and then kind of work their way east i dont know if youve found that to be true   well im in the middle of the country and and it seems to me they could they start their from start from both coasts and work their ways inward uh one of the one of the things that that im finding is that ive lived in Texas ive lived in New York and uh i have ive done a lot of visiting out in California and i know that were lagging behind here and yet i really do see uh womens roles have increased and theyre gaining new respect in fact i believe that the mayor of the top five major Texas cities are all women   um   and that goes back to your original point about politics   yeah   so uh uh you know its going to get to a point i some men are going to wonder if theyre falling behind   uhhuh   the uh i think the only problem there is the men that themselves that feel threatened by by a woman   yes   uh by her intelligence probably uh those are the ones that youre going to have problems with i think uh a lot of the at least my kids they seem to have a a more open mind today than uh like when i was growing up   i think the young people today do have an open mind its just not as much uh typecasting by sex by gender uh you know uh a little girl can say i want to be an astronaut or i want to be a fireman or a policeman or   right   or a Rhodes scholar which was impossible when i was going to college uh Rhodes
