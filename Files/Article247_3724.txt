                                 Rads            BEVERLY HILLS CalifJohn McCains speech at the Reagan Library waswellattended by national political reportersmore than he had seen sinceMonday when he made his official announcement in New Hampshire But thejournalists hadnt flown out to Los Angeles just to see McCain They were intown hoping for an announcement that will be far bigger news if it everoccursthat of Warren Beattyscandidacy At a benefit dinner for the Southern California branch ofAmericans for Democratic Action Beatty was scheduled to tease a massiveinternational press corps about the possibility of runningI mean receive theEleanor Roosevelt Award and deliver a speech Anyhow it sounded like too glaman event to pass up so I ditched McCainabout whom more tomorrow            The Beatty event held in a huge ballroom in the Beverly Hilton Hotel wassort of like the White House Correspondents Dinner but with the actors andpolitical reporters kept apart We caught only distant glimpses of JackNicholson and Dustin Hoffman Also in attendance were Penny Marshall RobReiner Larry Flynt and Faye Dunaway Courtney Love teetered in and out onpreposterous stiletto heels flaunting a strategically situated rip in herblouse which was pretty much seethrough anyhow            Events like this remind you of what limousine liberalism was like circa When I arrived the warmup program was already underway Lila Garrettthe president of the organization was saying something about how NATO was nota defensive alliance but a structure of oppression Keeping up a permanent wareconomy requires a permanent war she noted Garrett calls the bombing indefense of Bosnia and Kosovo a day reign of terror            Elsewhere in the country Bill Bradley represents a more liberal alternativeto Al Gore Here Bradley is viewed as just another centrist selloutHollywood liberals still nurse a grudge against him for voting in favor of aidto the Contras in the s Sure Bradley is for extending healthcarecoverage to the uninsured to the tune of  billion a yearbut hes not for asinglepayer system Sure hes for campaignfinance reformbut not for fullpublic financing of all federal elections This explains the Hollywoodenthusiasm for Beatty and Beattys interest in the race            The event began with an elaborate tribute film which might run verbatim asa Republican attack ad against the Democratic Party one day It had clips ofBarbra Streisand Willie Brown Sean Penn Barry Diller Paul Wellstone GoldieHawn George McGovern Dustin Hoffman Arianna Huffington and Jesse Jacksonand others praising and joking about Beatty interspersed with clips fromReds and Bonnie and Clyde  Michael Ovitz appeared in aBulworth outfit of wraparound shades and a black knit cap Roseannecalled Beatty a fine piece of ass and threatened to run against him forpresident Rob Reiner offered to be Beattys running mate The only reallytruly funny bit was Garry Shandlings cameo Listen if you run and getelected make sure you get your name above the title of the countryWarrenBeatty in the United States of America he said The most astonishingbit to me at least was the wrapup by Arthur Schlesinger Jr With a schmaltzyviolin score in the background Schlesinger called on Beatty to keep up thedebate and save our partys soul            As a performance Beattys address was overlong and uneven Parts of it wererelatively clever such as the peroration in which he offered advice to animaginary drum majorette who felt she had something to contribute to theAmerican political debate This was a nice metaphor for his own flirtation witha campaign Some of Beattys jokes werent bad Ive been on a listening tourof my house for the past six weeks he said Another good one was his questionabout the BradleyGore race Whats this insurgency of a centrist against acentrist all about            But most of the speech had an Ishtar like quality Beattyshemmingandhawing style of delivery gets tiresome pretty quickly I want tothank the Americans for Democratic uh Action as do his repetitive screedsabout the special interests the corporations and the plutocrats You do haveto marvel at the ability of Pradaclad celebrities to sit at a aplatedinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel and decry overpaid CEOs and rich people ingeneral as if they were an alien species Beatty referred to his critics asthose moneyed honeyed voices of ridicule            Beattys speech was delivered too late in the evening to receive extensivecoverage in the papers today But if you watched it on CSpan you did learnwhat his political views are Like most of those in the room he is awoolymammoth liberal pining for the days of Hubert H Humphrey Beatty saidhe was accepting the award as an oldtime unrepentant unreconstructedtaxandspend bleedingheart taxandspend liberal Democrat That aboutcovers it He also said he thinks the domestic policies of Lyndon B Johnsonwere all good programs that didnt get a fair shake because of the Vietnam WarBeatty is annoyed that the Democratic Party has become in his view a copycatGOP We dont need a third party he said We need a second party He wantsto recognize Cuba pass singlepayer healthcare insurance install publicfinancing of elections and spend more money on every social problem everdiscovered Beatty did not mention anything about being prolife which MattDrudge claims he is since becoming a father Thats about the only thing hecould have said that would have got him booed by this crowd            It is certainly true as Beatty says that there is no one currently in thepresidential race who represents an orthodox liberal position Where Beatty ismistaken and perhaps a bit delusional is in attributing the failure of hisideas to corporate power and corruption He described our political system asa slowmotion coup detat of big money interests over the public interestThis is the same paranoid view he articulated much more wittily inBulworth  The movie never really took off Based on last nightsindications neither will the campaign
