                                 iDogmais Sacred Profanity            At a press conference following the screening of his film Dogma which will have its first public showing October  as part of the New York FilmFestival the writer director and professed devout Catholic Kevin Smithappeared both shellshocked and befuddled by the outrage that his movie sightunseen had provoked Were talking about a fury so fierce it has beenspearheaded by a group called the Catholic League that Miramax and its parentcompany Disney dropped the theological comedythriller like a hot cross bunProtests are planned for Monday at Lincoln Center and all involved thepictures new distributor is Lions Gate Films have braced themselves for morenoise and death threats The only silver lining said Smith was that hededited out that elephantdung Madonna scene I mean its one thing to havethe Catholic League mad at you but you dont want to have the mayor of NewYork mad at you            Finally seeing the movie I find it hard not to share Smiths perplexity Itwould be one thing if Dogma were as charged virulently antiCatholicor even blasphemous But the film a sort of apocalyptic Miltonian vaudevilleis among the most passionately religious and Godfearing ever made in thiscountry Its supremely moving True its also raucous bloody smutty andstrewn with fourletter words and the final incarnation of the Almighty haslittle in common with depictions you might find in say the Vatican museumYet the qualities that make Dogma seem a work of irreverence areprecisely those that make it so spiritually reanimating The film has been madeby an artist for whom questions of faith are central to daily life It seemsonly logical then not to segregate those questions from that life but toweave them in with the filmmakers other obsessions friendship lustdrinking love of trashy horror flicks and the compulsion to sit aroundbsing all night about why the Creator made so many things that are patentlyabsurd            The movies canvastoo vast to itemize completely herefeatures a NewJersey bishop a Borscht Belt turn by George Carlin who argues that Jesusshould not be represented by gory images of his earthy demise After all Hewas a booster  Seizing on a loophole in Catholic dogma the Bishopplans to reconsecrate his church so that anyone who passes through its archwaywill be officially cleansed of sin and entitled to enter heaven This attractsthe notice of two waggish somewhat insane fallen angels Ben Affleck and MattDamon who have a hilarious HopeCrosby rapport They have spent depressing years in exile in Wisconsin and now see a way to go home Theproblem then is the tension between dogma and Gods will If the angels whobecome serial killers on their trek to New Jersey gorily murdering TenCommandments violators as a kind of last hurrah succeed in their mission Godwill be shown to be fallible the center will not hold and the apocalypse willdestroy all life in the universe            Representatives of the Devil naturally do all they can to make thathappen while Gods servantsamong them Alan Rickman as the resonant andwearily fey Voice of God Salma Hayek as a slinky muse and Chris Rock as theThirteenth Apostle the black one expunged from Scripturestruggle to staveoff Armageddon For reasons that would spoil a number of surprises theirefforts revolve around a Catholic woman named Bethany an unprecedentedlysoulful Linda Fiorentino who goes to church every Sunday but feels that Godhas stopped listening The core of the film emotionally is Bethanysconversations with sundry mortals angels and demons about her loss of faithThe complaints about Catholic dogma are voiced by Rocks liberal Apostle whoargues that what matters most is faith and not the rituals that are supposed togive it a Seal of Approval            So yes Dogma is critical of organized religion But why not regardit as the constructive criticism of a believer Smith described it as kickingthe tires of my faith and added that he considers both God and Jesusfriends who would not be averse to having fun poked at themespecially whenthat fun is grounded in a fervent respect for their existence and power In themovies credits Smith thanks a Sister Theresa who changed his life hesaid when she declared that Jesus remark during the Last Supper that Peterwould be the rock of his church was likely facetiousa joke Suddenly Smithsaid the figures at the heart of Christianity werent abstract theologicalmouthpieces but fleshandblood humans who spoke his language            Smith believes that the Catholic League which is authorized by neither theChurch nor the Vatican was looking for an excuse to attack Disney thatparticular week Many of the letters sent to Miramax chairmen Harvey and BobWeinstein were homicidally antiSemitic But Im not so sure that the filmwould have slipped by unnoticed in any event Another deeply devout andreligious film Martin Scorseses The Last Temptaion of Christ was furiously attacked for portraying Jesus as lost and uncertainplagued bydoubts Smith slyly echoes Scorseses film when Rickmans Voice of Godattempting to convert the reluctant Bethany to his cause explains that Jesusdidnt take it any better when told of the painful destiny that awaited him Ihad to deliver the news to a scared child who only wanted to play with otherchildren There are people who find threatening the idea that no seriousfaith no faith worth a damnnot of men angels or even Jesuscould possiblybe untested            Its the atheists and agnostics who have the easiest time making moviesnowadaysthe ones who dont confront the issue of faith at all The believersmeanwhile get crucified I tried to do something good and got hassled forit said Smith To spread the word of Christ and also throw in a few fartand dick jokes An amusing series of titles that open the film now urge theaudience not to get too worked upto see the movie not as a fanatical attackon religion but as a reverent goof But hes worried about the goodChristians who havent seen Dogma yet and have written to say that hebetter buy himself a flak jacket Once they see it he said their mindswill changeI mean its got a rubber poop monster
