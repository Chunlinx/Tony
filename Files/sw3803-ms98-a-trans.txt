        hi  what do you think about gun control     well uh sort of mixed feelings about it i guess uh uh i i side i lean more towards the control side than than towards you know just the the free free arming um on the other hand i its its sort of an issue of of uh uh im not im not a great fan of of government control in general and so its its kind of a tough issue what about yourself   well i guess that i would like to to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or um have a legitimate use for the the the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the the problems in DC come home very quickly   umhum   im im sure yeah um so you would take a position where somebody without without a uh um specific use in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home uh you wouldnt you wouldnt like them to be able to do that is that   well im not so sure about that but i think somehow uh safety courses or i dont know whether this could be something that was done in school but somehow people id like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were whether they followed them or not you know at least theres the moral issue that they they knew better       which is sort of you know flaky but still   huh yeah i i have i i have the impression that that the the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not are are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway um that may be wrong um you know i mean certainly there there are cases of of you know the children who find their parents gun or something and and shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided and thats thats certainly within the channels right   umhum   but um a lot of the the crime i think that goes on i i dont know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or theyre illegal guns   yeah i dont know this morning in our paper it there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a drivers license so he went over there and got a drivers license the same day bought three guns and went up to New York and sold them for you know very high markups now in a sense thats a legal   uhhuh   way of getting the guns but certainly the the purpose is not very legal   yeah uhhuh  yeah i i mean i think uh some states or i i i dont know if anybody actually has implemented i think so um  at least theres been talk about doing uh you know like waiting periods and and things like that um and and uh   umhum   you know i i think stuff like that  is perfectly good i mean basically if you if you dont intend to do anything strange you know if you if youre buying it for legitimate purposes waiting ten days shouldnt be a problem you know and and things i dont know ive   right   you know i uh i dont own a gun and and dont really want one and id just as soon a lot fewer people did um but on the other hand you   umhum   know uh like i say i kind of kind of against government control in general uh   right and i suppose complete uh you know complete total ban would lead to more illegal weapons   yeah and i you know something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that it theyre not gonna disappear anytime soon um and theyre already i know theres a ready market for them you know in the stolen the stolen stolen guns can be sold i mean their first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun   umhum umhum   right because uh because they they can be so easily sold and you know their their i dont know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country but um its not like theyre gonna disappear all of a sudden um even if you do do a total ban on them uhhuh its a real tough problem   right   i i dont know i dont know where i really come down on it i mean i i grew up my father was a hunter right and thats and thats sort of almost a separate issue i think weve generally been talking about handguns  and that kind of thing right   umhum   you know and   but thats true i mean some people grew up with guns in the house we never had any in the house so to me the you know the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing   uhhuh hm   and im not sure thats good either   yeah  well we you know we i grew up with them i never really took to hunting i mean i did some of it but uh you know we didnt have any we never had any handguns or anything like that we had you know had shotguns for for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that   umhum   and you know it was a whole different thing and and gun safety was taken very seriously and it was you know i mean before we go hunting we we took safety courses but it you know thats that seems to me just to be a whole another issue  um you know the the thing that the  i yeah im not certain that people are are are terribly concerned about other people   umhum
