            Arch how are you doing tonight   good and yourself   oh that yeah fine kind of tired   yeah me too   where am i calling   pardon me   where are you   im in Lewisville   Lewisville okay im in Garland um have you read anything about how they propose to uh come up with the taxes to increase the funding for schools   little bit   what do you think about it equalization of funding   thats a hard issue to decide uh on the one hand you dont want to have to take away but on the other hand you dont want uh the poorer school districts to go under either and uh here in Lewisville they had a thing on the ballot that they wanted to uh rollback the taxes on everybodys houses and everybody would save   uhhuh   uh twenty dollars a year or whatever but it would cut back twenty million dollars in to the schools and i happened to know a good teacher here in the school district and she was really against it because that would just take away all all their money   umhum   and as far as im concerned you know hey twenty bucks a year is not too much to me and they could raise a few more dollars and get better uh things for the schools thats what we need because we got you know Texas is known for its poor schools and thats too bad because we got little kids and were uh not too pleased about that     but were not funding them like other states either though you know it were not funding our schools like other states either   pardon me thats true   thats right but just because weve got a lot of money doesnt mean thats gonna solve the problem   yeah i know thats thats only part of the problem   i mean i think theres a lot of waste in in schools im a teacher i feel that yes i feel i definitely feel that way all this money thats being paid for administrators   i think were gonna see are you okay i think were gonna see a day come yeah   humum i can   i think i think were gonna see a day when schools uh grade schools are gonna be charging tuition just like colleges are uh and itll only be to those who are having kids going to school thats probably the most fair way but you know uh that way old people dont have to have have money going to the schools because they dont have little kids going to schools but uh i wouldnt be surprised if that happens within the next few years uh that sort of thing happening and uh well see what happens   well theyre already talking about freedom of choice you know for schools thats an idea   yeah yes um i dont know that i think has pluses and minuses because uh those that are economically disadvantaged wont have the ability to make a choice the choice will be thrust upon them and so wheres the freedom of choice no freedom of choice in that case and thats   thats true but like in Garland  you can choose the school that youre going to  can you tell this is past bedtime  um like in Garland they get to choose the schools that theyre gonna go to but they got to have the transportation to them if its out of their district you know out of their area i mean   yes   so and i like that because you can find out the good schools in your area   yes i think the only way theyre gonna really get to the problem and solve it is to have equal funding for every school in the state whether you its in a poor tax district or a high tax district and uh thats the only way that i can see its gonna be resolved is there are gonna be people in the rich district that are gonna fight that and and its gonna be a real bad mess because theres people on every side of the problem   so just distribute it equally and not raise taxes   yeah and they should give every teacher a a hundred percent raise  that  thats the problem is the teachers dont get enough money and anybody who could be a good teacher doesnt want to become a teacher usually because they dont pay enough i mean when i was in college i did a lot of teaching uh for my degree and uh i got a lot of good out of that and i liked teaching but i really couldnt go into teaching because it was not economically feasible for me to do so   yeah what do you do   im a mathematician   oh so you picked a good field then you picked a good field   pardon me oh i dont know there are better fields to pick   well yeah but thats not a bad one   i mean yeah where i you know kind of stuff i do i i use my education quite a bit but where i was before i wasnt using it hardly at all so it all depends i mean it depends on where you wind up i guess but i really enjoyed teaching it you know i but wouldnt mind getting back into it someday but who knows whatll happen in the future the way people are being laid off right and left its all a matter of uh what happens next but uh back back to the taxes though i mean uh its a difficult issue no one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand you got to do something   yeah what do you think about a state income tax   i can see that there might be a reason for one but i would hate to do that because uh that would be very difficult for my family financially to to afford a state income tax and most states have it i know and ive lived in states that have had it but way uh way financing is now if we had a state income tax id uh have a very hard time financing my house again you know paying off my mortgage each month thats so thats a problem um which just matter of well see what happens id rather have that i guess than have a state state lottery because when you bring   but didnt they pass that thing that we were gonna have a lottery or not   no it didnt   oh   which means theres a higher probability of now having a state income tax even though good old tax and spend Annie my favorite uh decided that uh during the campaign she said we werent gonna have a state income tax and now shes gonna renege on that which i expected her to do anyway uh well see what happens i dont know at any rate uh   so what about your income tax think theyre hitting you too hard   actually no um   no   im surprised that my uh my income taxes are as low as they are we just finished our income taxes and were getting a nice little refund back this year which is which is nicer than having to pay out uh which is a matter of uh um im surprised its well considering the national budget i think George Bush wanted one point four trillion dollars for the national budget and for a family of four like what i got that comes out to over twenty two thousand dollars that we it its our share to pay in but im not paying that much income tax     huhuh   and youre gonna think well wait now  wheres the other eighteen thousand dollars or whatever coming in where how how is that coming from me i guess it comes from companies and businesses and whatnot but its interesting i dont know i cant imagine i guess thats why were going in debt so deeply they bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one point four and then the rest goes to to the national debt   which just keeps accumulating  i dont know  what else do you think about them lets see the state   thats about it i guess   and the city tax the sale tax they used to you really didnt even think anything about it when you bought something but now you do  it figures in what is it seven p oint   yeah yeah seven percent or something it depends on where youre at some places in Dallas i guess its like closer to eight and places like in Lewisville its a lot closer to seven   i dont even know how they figure it really im glad i dont work in a store   humum hows that   because i wouldnt want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess theyve got a little table though and its all written out   oh yes   so it wouldnt be so bad  all right so you think   thats the way to do it   federal tax is okay state tax you can see the logic of it but you dont think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both of us are teachers and we got four in our family too   no yeah   we dont need anymore   and so when you start taking talking taking more out of your paycheck to go to the state income tax uh   but we can do this tax sheltered annuity thats the only thing thats saving us   yeah i think what we need what uh the government the state government needs to do is get in there and cut spending because when they got all this fraud and waste going on they need to just get in there and and get out the garbage thats in there right now i mean i once heard that uh uh for the for the federal government at least that if they uh uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave all that money directly to the people every welfare recipient would be making like forty five thousand dollars a year       and you know theyre not making that much money theyre making probably more like five or six on the welfare so wheres the other ninety percent going well its going to the some fat guy in the middle whos sitting there on his behind all day doing nothing but filling out papers   part lots and lots of people before they get it   lots of people yeah yeah   but still i work in southeast Dallas and a lot of my children are from poor you know socioeconomic areas homes and its just like they always have money they they always are dressed nice you know most of them are fairly nice not like you would think a a poor person would be   yeah   and i mean theyve always got dessert money or theyve always got you know dollars on them and everything and im thinking you know this isnt right because my children dont have that   yeah well i dont have that  a lot of times if ive got a dollar in my wallet its like boy where do i go where did whered i find that   yeah and you give them you know they get their free lunch and they throw most of it away but then they have their money to go buy dessert and that they eat   wow   you know its just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we pay people to haul them off right   yeah right   and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs   quite a quite a world we live in   that he yeah it is oh well is that you got anything else to say i dont think i do   oh well yeah thats all i have to say thank you   okay well talk talk to you later then bye   umhum bye
