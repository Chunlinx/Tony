                so what kind of a house do you live in   uh im in a uh in a ranch a uh it was about uh sixteen hundred square feet when i bought it and uh its about two thousand square feet now but its one of those typical uh ranches that you find around here oh its uh built in the probably built in the late fifties so its not um what you would find uh uh where you live but uh for the older um ranch homes its pretty typical i guess   umhum well our home is uh probably for our area its probably one of the lower income homes out here  um most of the the homes that theyre building well i shouldnt say all of them but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars oh oh yeah theres   really how many square feet do you have   we have got about uh twenty id say about twenty four hundred   four bedrooms   um weve got five bedrooms because we built on to our garage a a bedroom for my mother   five bedrooms uhhuh   and uh   i made a i made a fourth bedroom out of uh i i made a fourth bedroom out of one of our out of our living room and then added a uh what we call a sunroom to get the you know when we when we added four hundred square feet to our house   oh oh thats great   so yeah   well this this house is very comfortable weve got two living areas and that thats the thing i probably like the most about it     how many stories just one   its just one story yeah its a Fox and Jacobs home   how are they built   um weve been real happy with it   yeah ive heard the ive heard the constructions pretty good on Fox and Jacobs   course im not a carpenter or anything like that they could probably come in and say gee this is not straight and this is under something that   but i mean it doesnt give you trouble   no no we havent had a lot of problems with it at all   uhhuh no cracked slab or anything like that   no weve been real lucky   um and is it um uh natural gas and   so yeah   uh you know what i miss though basements   oh yeah   i sure i sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas   yeah i ive heard a lot of people say that thats for sure uh we have an attic that weve just put you know plywood over over the beams and things up in the attic and so that   umhum umhum so you   has replaced it to some extent but certainly not   can you stand up in it   uh in parts i mean you couldnt you really couldnt use it for a room   so you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here   yes   its ours is pitched so shallow that you uh dont get much room in the attic   yeah yeah we uh weve got you know ill store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there   so five bedrooms and two living two  family things   two living areas we have a living room and dining room at the front of the house and then we have a the uh family room kitchen and play room   uhhuh uhhuh   at the rear of the house which has been really nice in fact i really enjoy the playroom that you you would think that would not be a real bonus you know to a house but of all the rooms in the house id say that was       that was the one thats been really nice to have   isnt it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time   i think thats true yeah probably our family rooms the the biggest uh   you can right some people i mean families seem to migrate towards one one room and carry on most of their activities there and uh uh some rooms uh we have one room that we never use i mean might as well not even heat and cool it   yeah yeah   strange   well thats kind of the way our living room dining room is but it is nice to have it because theres uh   umhum   with our size of family its nice to know that theres one thats always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment   right right uhhuh   so   so youve been fairly happy with it how long have you been in it   seventeen years   wow boy it doesnt seem that long but it is because we uh came to this area about the same time   uhhuh   weve been fifteen fifteen years in the in the house that were living in   oh wow   and we the the principal feature i like about ours is that its pier and beam   oh uhhuh   yours is a slab i assume   yes it is   yeah ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that i could not have done if it was slab ive done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that   uhhuh   by myself and saved a lot of money that i couldnt have done if the house was on a slab   well thats interesting well   but thats because its so old its uh thirty five thirty six years old when they used to build like that and uh   yeah umhum well my husband wouldnt do that anyway thats his thats his worst thing in   i know hes not handy right     life is to have to repair something   i on the other hand seem um   so   do a lot too much of it and uh ive gotten good at it which in a in a way is bad because then you uh you start to take pleasure in it   well uh thats great uh we just kind of save everything for when Al uh for for when his uh dad comes to visit and then   umhum   he does all the repairing you know he does   right   my dad is actually uh
