                                  Douglas Brinkley            Douglas Brinkley is the William Ginsburg of theKennedy death circus Before the crash the boyish gaptoothed Brinkley wasknown primarily as a Michael Beschlossinwaiting a telegenic historianfielding calls from the cable news networks Now the University of New Orleansprofessor has parlayed a contributing editorship at George and afriendship with Kennedy into a job as a necropublicist Between Saturday andTuesday Brinkley appeared on MSNBC Late Edition  Meet thePress  Good Morning America  Dateline  Today twiceand NPR twice He also penned columns about his relationship with Kennedy forNewsweek and the New York Times  and was quoted everywhere elseink touches paper            According to the Washington Post  Brinkleycut a  deal with NBC for a week of exclusive Kennedy commentary butthen agreed to provide it pro bono Editors at George are reportedly soannoyed about Brinkleys death punditry that they have dropped him from themasthead            Even amid this weeks staggering hyperboleBrinkleys emotional profligacy has distinguished him He is as he rarelyfails to remind his audience  years old like Kennedy a vegetarian likeKennedy and a Sagittarius like Kennedy That identification with Kennedyaccounts in part for Brinkleys tenuous proposition that Kennedys death isthe signal event of his generation the moment Gen X lost its innocence In theopening paragraph of his New York Times oped Brinkley opined Its asif suddenly an entire generations optimism is deflated and all that is leftis the limp reality of growing old Kennedys death may have affected hisfriend Brinkley this way I am not sure anyone else outside Kennedys circlewas so moved            Brinkley has alsomounted his thanatic pulpit to tell and retell anecdotes about Kennedysdecency how he declined an honorary doctorate because he felt he didntdeserve it how his racial compassion sparked him to visit Mike Tyson in jailBrinkley has grown comfortable enough with Kennedyfamily talk that he nolonger limits himself to John Kennedy In his second Today jaunt heopined about wouldbe bride Rory Kennedy Its the activist and the feministin Rory Kennedy that I think is her greatest contribution to Americanlife            Its a historical truth handed down from Mark Antony toJesse Jackson to Earl Spencer that celebrity death is a fabulous marketingopportunity but Brinkley is not cynical about his prolific Kennedy commentsI have been in a deep deep depression and my way of responding was to beproactive he says I could have shut up about this and not done anythingbut I really believe that this is someone who matters             Brinkleys belief thatKennedy is someone who mattersmatters enough for two opeds and countless TVgigs in factis a good starting point for understanding the young prof He isan appropriate eulogist for Kennedy because they shared a vision of Americanculture and politics Kennedys worthy democratic instincts inspired him to useentertainment to teach politics Brinkleys worthy democratic instincts inspirehim to use entertainment to teach history In Brinkleys case as in Kennedysthe results have been both inspiring and awkward            Brinkley who is not David Brinkleys sonthats Columbiahistory prof Alan Brinkley stands at the intersection of academia seriousjournalism and TV punditry He is striving for a place in the pantheon ofpopular historians such as Stephen Ambrose and Arthur Schlesinger Brinkleyabhors the narrow academic history that has dominated universities He scornsscholarly monographs and favors a democratic populist history As history grewmore and more abstruse in the s and s historians ceded the role ofpublic intellectual to journalists Brinkley wants to take it back Kennedyhimself admired Brinkleys approach enough that according to Brinkley he hadbeen trying to land Brinkley an appointment at Harvards Kennedy School            Brinkley first came toprominence as Americas leading neobeatnik a believer that the best way tolearn history is on the road In  he led  students from HofstraUniversity where he then taught on a sixweek history road trip from theGrand Canyon to Route  from Ken Keseys farm to Jack Londons ranch Heturned this Majic Bus trip into a popular book He now guides a civilrightsbus journey for innercity highschool kids every spring The Majic Bus alsoinspired CSpan to start sending its own buses around the country            The Majic Bus illustrates both the charms and flaws ofBrinkleys notion of public history Brinkley is the kind of professor freshmenlove because he is a kind of berfreshman himself wildly enthusiastic andinfatuated with popular culture He believes Jack Kerouac and Hunter SThompson are the giants of American literature He quotes Ramones lyrics Heloves the word troubadour He refers to Lou Reed as poet Lou Reed TheMajic Bus is full of passages like this How could I be a great bopwanderer a mystic in search of ecstasy a hobo scribbler of haiku and jazzpoems somehow discovering in Kerouacian terms how to dig life in thedivine world to the fullest            Brinkley is a cheerleaderfor American history Everything is a celebration He likes to cite KerouacsI am not antianything except racists and certain big corporations Thecivil rights movement was great The Beats were cool Dylan is amazing He evenwrote a kindly biography of Jimmy Carter Brinkley skirts the arguments againsthis rosy vision When his Majic Bus students encountered a couple ofbelligerent Buchananites spouting nativist claptrap Brinkleys immediatereaction was to treat the pair as loonies and hustle his students back onto thebus His America is conflictfree Here too he resembles Kennedy who was acheerleader for politics publishing a magazine that detached politics fromideology            The Majic Bus brought Brinkley minor fame Blessed withpreternatural gregariousness good humor and a love of attention hes beentireless about pursuing both celebrity and the cause of popular history eversince The word that is used around Doug is operator That is saidscornfully or dismissively says historian and Brinkley mentor Ambrose whotapped Brinkley to succeed him as director of University of New OrleansEisenhower Center He is an operator and I think thats wonderfulHes entrepreneurial and enthusiastic Its very American            Its hard to find anyonewho knows Brinkley and dislikes him Its also hard to find anyone who knowsBrinkley and doesnt worry about his obsession with fame His namedropping isalmost pathological says one friend In my conversation with Brinkley hetouched on a dozen famous politicians and artists he knows His writing is fullof sentences that begin something like As John Cage once asked me             Brinkley worked assiduously to join Beschloss and DorisKearns Goodwin on the air TV is the most important medium for conveyinghistory For historians not to reach out smacks of elitism he says He willhappily decorate any TV or radio story with a veneer of American historyRecent months have seen him comment on the Kosovo bombing ground troops RosaParks Independence Day impeachment and Al Gores military service to name afew topics            Meanwhile he has pursueda writing career that would fell a less industrious man On the same day hisNewsweek and New York Times Kennedy pieces appeared Brinkleypublished a sweet article in The New Yorker about a yearcorrespondence between Ronald Reagan and a member of his fan club Brinkleypublishes in the Atlantic  Newsweek  American Heritage and George His work ranges from routine commentaries on the dayspolitical news to celebrity puff profiles He writes more journalism than mosthacks and certainly a lot more good journalism than most hacks At thesame time he has managed to write or cowrite eight books in the past sevenyears including three fullscale biographies and a lively page history ofthe United States Brinkleys oeuvre demonstrates his genius forendearing himself to all kinds of people He has done books with the widow ofDean Acheson the ultimate establishment figure with Hunter S Thompson andwith Carter He is currently working on a profile of Gore a biography of RosaParks and a biography of Henry Ford            Brinkleys sunniness and ardor are appealing but hispublic history has its shortcomings His idols Ambrose and Schlesinger havewon the admiration of the academy and the public Brinkley has won the publicbut has not wowed the academy Some of his colleagues dismay is simplyjealousy of his entrepreneurship but some is more substantive His books readlike good journalismand thats no insultbut they are not great history Hehas made no analytical contribution at all says one Ivy League historian whoprofesses to like Brinkley            Arthur Schlesinger went on television to mourn thedeath of President John Kennedy Douglas Brinkley goes on television to mournthe death of celebrity magazine editor John Kennedy Jr This is why hisambition to be a public intellectual may falter A public intellectual resiststhe frivolous Brinkley does not resist the frivolous As his mentor Ambrosesays I wish he would spend less time on John Kennedy and more time on HenryFord
