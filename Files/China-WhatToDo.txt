purchasesEntertainmentAfter a grueling day of sightseeing you might not be too disappointed to discover that an evenings entertainment starts and ends early Nightlife stays on a high cultural plane far removed from the nightclub scene of Europe or North America Chinese performances combine amusement with edification in a glittering package few Western impresarios could afford to mountChinese OperaThe Chinese hospitably assume that foreigners cant bear more than about ten minutes of traditional Chinese opera You might indeed find the voices shrill and the mannerisms maddening many characters seem to spend most of the time fussing with their sleeves which can unroll to the floor So you should not mind if your guide or host rushes you out of the theater into the early evening trafficBut if you persevere you will begin to understand what the Chinese see in this ageold art form If you fail youve still enjoyed the splendid costumes and makeup the acrobatics that enliven some regional versions and the experience of being in a theater surrounded by local people Peking opera is the version most familiar to Westerners but other regions have their own variantsIf possible familiarize yourself with the plot in advance Ideologically uplifting operas were the only ones permitted during the Cultural Revolution classical stories were banned But today both classical and modern works are presented If you have an interpreter at hand youll understand why some scenes animate the audience and others dont The words of the songs are projected onto screens alongside the proscenium arch to clarify the nuances of a tonal language set to music Apart from the set pieces most of the music is percussive and serves to support and reflect the action and moodProps are minimal and the action is subtle an actor closes an invisible door with a mime gesture and anyone walking with a riding crop must be understood to be mounted on a horse But the heroic characters couldnt ever be mistaken for the snarling villainsPuppets Acrobats and Folklore Groups Popular with adults and children the Chinese shadow play a yearold art form dramatizes familiar legends The twodimensional puppets manipulated behind a silk screen can jump and fly giving the colorful silhouettes an advantage over the actors in Chinese opera The busy puppeteers give voice to their characters often in song Professional and amateur shadowplay troupes also put on shows with marionettesThe socalled acrobatic shows staged for tourist groups are more fun than you might expect The trapeze artists of course are firstclass and so are the contortionists and human pyramid acts But they also throw in jugglers and magicians and even comics and you dont have to understand a word to join in the laughterTypically the Chinese folklore performances are organized especially for tourists Shows feature the costumes songs and dances of the national minority groupsoften as foreign to a Chinese audience as they are to visitors from abroad These evenings are usually uplifting and not very longConcerts and BalletDuring the Cultural Revolution Beethoven and Tchaikovsky were banned and many musicians banished to the countryside for reeducation So if you go to a concert today youll sense the drama of recovery from mad xenophobia This neednt obscure the fact that some professional musicians havent yet reached world standards But the enthusiasm of players and audience is exciting in itselfBallet a vehicle for ideological indoctrination during the s and s is much less restricted today Folk legends are often a source of inspiration and classical European works are sometimes performed with elaborate costumes sets and lighting effectsAnd a NightcapWith varying degrees of success the tourist hotels try to meet foreigners demands for a quiet place to have a drink and a chat Only the newest hotels that were built with international cooperation contain bars reminiscent of those in Europe or America The others are likely to be quaint rather than cozy
