                                 Order out of Chaos                        Dear Ester            Sorry you had trouble with your email account Actually last night I hadtrouble getting at an open line But today I made a second pot of coffee andam settling into my office at home            Like you I read Safires piece on the Brooklyn Museum issue in the NewYork Times  It was on the mark The museums ad on Page B of theTimes only confirmed his point Its as if everybody has their scriptand dutifully follows itincluding the media and pundits In my ownexperience including with courts I am stunned by how willing people are totrivialize the concept of free speech in order to exploit it for some form ofpolitical advantage But it is only the beginning of the season            The stunner in todays news was the atrocities by some US troops in KoreaAs tragic as it is to hear finding out about it at least serves the purpose ofdemonstrating that monstrous evil is not only to be found in the formerYugoslavia or African countries The capacity of good people to do or atleast tolerate evil things should never surprise us            Finally for now I have continued to think about the discussion I attendedthe other night about Fukuyamas book The Great Disruption  I think thatwe are slowly beginning to understand the dynamics of why the disruptionoccurred the changing role of women the interaction of that change with thepill the freedom that resulted for some men no longer responsible forbeing a parent the excesses that accompanied the moral freedom that manyfelt from normative setting institutions such as the church and many of theother powerful ideas that caught on so very quickly eg that mental illnessdid not exist and shaped social policy I think that I wrote you about theconversation among Fukuyama Adam Wolfe Norman Podhoretz and others Thepart of the discussion that didnt begin and which I would have enjoyed evenmore was why things now seem to be turning around now I can write what I didthe other night about why and how crime was reduced in New York City but itstill begs the question of why suddenly and a decade is suddenly individualsand organizations could commit themselves to successful strategies andcollaborations Although I havent finished Fukuyamas book he seems tosuggest a biological drive toward order and that humans are rational can seetheir mistakes and can correct themselves I wonder            So I hope your email problems are solved            George Kelling
