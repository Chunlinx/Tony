                                 The New Walter Cronkite            The rampant civility of thepresidential and vicepresidential debates is enough to make me wanna givesomebody a mouthful of bloody Chiclets That somebody is debate moderator JimLehrer            I know my anger ismisplaced That the debates sputtered rather than sizzled wasnt Lehrersfault He may have pitched softballs but thats what the ground rules of theoccasion required And Lehrer cant be blamed for the fact that Dole andClinton satisfied themselves by slapping singles when they could have swung forthe fences            Still myirritation is not entirely misplaced The Dole and Clinton campaigns havingblessedly dumped the usual panel of preening journalists selected Lehrer assole moderator for a reason He has become our national icon of broadcastingprobity and they knew that he would bring the sort of solemnity to theoccasion that would minimize the risk of things getting interesting            Theres a kind of dignity in Lehrers plodding reluctanceto opine in his hangdog humility in his desire to serve as moderator ratherthan interrogator Theres also a reward From his role as the sole moderatorin all three presidential and vicepresidential debates it is suddenly clearthat we finally have a successor to Walter Cronkite in the semiofficial role ofAmericas first TV father Lehrer age  obliquely acknowledged thismilestone when he won the debate assignment I see my selection as a tributeto our NewsHour way of doing things he said            Cronkiteretired almost two decades ago but the chair has remained empty until nowWhos the alternative Of the three commercial anchors Peter Jennings isCanadian and has that randy gaze that makes men hide their wives Tom Brokawlooks too boyish and has a speech impediment and Dan Rather is famously nutsBernard Shaws got the gravitas and a great magisterial voice but theresstill something too cheesy about the CNN miseenscne  Ted Koppel istoo inyourface The retirement last year of Robert MacNeil another Canadiangave Lehrer full ownership of the PBS NewsHour and his debatemoderatorgigwhich made him the one man in America who can lay down the rules topresidentssealed the deal            Lehrers apotheosis has been two decades in themaking It began in the early s when he abandoned Dallas newspapering for ajob at the local publictelevision station He moved on to PBS and during theWatergate summer of  partnered with MacNeil to parlay PBS weakness alack of resources to dig for stories into strength Presaging thetlvision vrit of CSPAN Jim and Robin covered the hearingsgaveltogavel from an Olympian distance mostly letting the story andparticipants speak for themselves An Emmy followed as did their evening showthat now goes by the name of The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer             More talkshow than news program the NewsHour likewise lets people and thingsmostly speak for themselves Each week dozens of government officials foreignleaders experts journalists and voluble wonks descend upon theNewsHour s suburban Washington studios for mild chat with the anchorsabout genocide and tax policy and abortion and airtraffic safety and othertopics of the day Lehrer isnt always as flat as he was required to be in thedebates but there is the same vacant and impassive style and there are formy taste too many of the same easily answeredor evadedquestionsOffcamera Lehrer is a jovial skeptic Yet even though he knows that mostpoliticians CEOs and activists who appear on his show are accomplished liarshe offers little in the way of interruption or contradiction Like theLehrerled debates the NewsHour is a lowscoring game of singlespassed balls and sacrifice flies            Many people claim to find the NewsHour stimulatingbut I suspect that what they really find it is soothing Friction and strifeare the post and beam of genuine journalism but Lehrers product is comfortfirst for his viewers whom he shields from the passion and fury of the newsThe NewsHours minidocumentaries dont shy away from distressing scenesof war and misery but the panel discussions that follow generally still theracing heart Comfort also is extended to NewsHour s guestsand I domean guests He looks at you with those big brown eyes confides onetalking head who has appeared on NewsHour  and you know youre going tobe safe            As on other talk showsNewsHour guests are preinterviewed When the s game shows engagedin this sort of coaching it was considered a scandal And like othertalkshow hosts Lehrer reserves the right to hammer guests with unexpectedquestions But he rarely does No wonder then that the exchanges betweenLehrer and the Cabinet secretaries and senators and law professors andreporters seem so articulate and poised that the guests are eager to return tothe show that Lehrer was a guest at one of Al Gores pretentious metaphorsalon dinner parties in             Lehrer isunabashed about this socializing with pols and power and it has turned himinto one of them He runs the NewsHour as if it were a Senate officeand he the senator says one veteran of the show But Lehrer is not corruptWhen his friends appear on his show they get treated no better than some warcriminal with whom he is not acquainted Or rather the war criminal getstreated no worse than his friends Alexander Cockburn once imagined thisMacNeilLehrer segue And now for another view of Hitler             Since Cockburn cracked wise in  the newsbusinessespecially the TV news businesshas grown more aggressive andcompetitive The networks and syndicates have expanded news magazine coveragepolitical talk shows have multiplied like bacteria the Sunday shows have grownmore slick and three hour news channels now clog cable televisionAdmirably to many resisting this commercial tide the NewsHour seemseven more civil and staid A  Roper Poll concluded that the NewsHouris perceived by the public as the most credible newscast in the countryMaybe so But credibility apparently isnt everything About  million homestune in the NewsHour each night while a combined total of  millionhomes watch the evening news on CBS ABC and NBC            The Cronkite crown thoughis not awarded on the basis of ratings Credibility is a vital factor andJim Lehrer does indeed have it Its an odd factor though Do people believethat Brokaw Rather and Jenningsreading scripts written by others from theirTelePrompTersare making things up No its something more amorphous likeWho do you want to hear it from the next time a plane crashes or a worldleader is assassinated Hell even I might choose Jim Lehrer
