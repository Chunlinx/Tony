                            We appreciate Dr Millers contribution to this debate  Whether one uses his phrase        established treatment or proven therapy we urge caution in using such a litmus test to        decide whether the use of placebo is or is not acceptable Such terms beg to be defined        carefully Should nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs be considered proven for        arthritis despite their problems with assay sensitivity  Dr Miller states that        there is no established treatment for adenomatous polyps However there is evidence from        epidemiological studies and clinical trials supporting the use of aspirin and other        nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for this condition  Armed with such        evidencewhether it qualifies aspirin as proven therapy is open to subjective        interpretationmany placebo opponents we maintain would argue for an activecontrolled        design as a more ethical alternative to the placebocontrolled design actually used in        APPROVe         Dr Miller focuses on the question of defending the use of placebo in the APPROVe study        This focus reflects the prevailing bias which is to choose when it is acceptable to use        placebo rather than to choose when it is acceptable to omit placebo This bias is evident        in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki with wording such as Extreme care        must be taken in making use of placebocontrolled trials Thus the use of placebo is        typically presumed guilty until proven innocent while activecontrolled designs are        presumed innocent until proven guilty The declaration is silent on the possibility that        omitting placebo can lead to problems too as we have now witnessed with Vioxx        So perhaps the more important question should be whether it was defensible to exclude        placebo in the VIGOR study Dr Miller acknowledges that placebo would have provided a        better assessment of the safety signal in the VIGOR study Indeed because placebo was not        used the authors were able to plausibly conclude that the difference between the two        groups was due to naproxen causing benefit rather than to Vioxx causing harm  The        plausibility of this conclusion has since been questioned  This misleading safety        signal only delayed the withdrawal of Vioxx Its design was superficially ethical but        science was not advanced and the public health was illserved        One might protest that these comments are made with the benefit of hindsight It is true        that the medical community at large did not become aware of this safety issue until        September  when the results of the placebocontrolled APPROVe study were made public        and Vioxx was withdrawn However according to David Grahams testimony to the United        States Senate  and a report on internal Merck documents  there was good reason for        concern about a possible safety signal before  when Vioxx was approved and recruitment        for VIGOR began         If the VIGOR study had included a placebo arm the truth about Vioxx could have been        learned in February  instead of September   That is over  weeks during        which the now infamous two to four jumbo jetliners were allowed to continue dropping        from the sky every week  Using the midpoints of Grahams range estimates this works        out to  excess heart attacks and strokes including  deaths in the US        alone        The authors of the VIGOR study said We could not include a placebo group  Was        the idea of including a placebo arm suggested but rejected as unethical even though        rescue medication could have been used Or did they take the path of least resistance in        the interest of rapid institutional review board approval and ease of patient recruiting        Whatever the reason the decision to omit placebo led to ambiguity and inaction        In clinical trials whether one looks at efficacy please see our opening argument in        this debate  or safety omitting placebo often muddies the scientific waters and        places the public health at increased risk Good science and good ethics cannot be divorced        from one another We believe these considerations should factor into discussions on the        ethics of clinical trial design Before we experience another Vioxx we hope that a future        version of the Declaration of Helsinki will add Extreme care must be taken when omitting        placebo
