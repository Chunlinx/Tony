                    Background        The retina which is exposed to both sunlight and very        high levels of oxygen is exceptionally rich in        polyunsaturated fatty acids which makes it a favorable        environment for the generation of reactive oxygen species        For example retinal pigment epithelium RPE generates a        number of reactive oxygen species when illuminated with        light     Furthermore phagocytosis of photoreceptor        outer segments by RPE causes an increase in intracellular           and extracellular H          O          generation     Oxidative stress        has been suggested as the cause of a number of retinal        pathological conditions             A number of         in vitro studies have attempted to        characterize the effect of oxidative stress on RPE        Depending on the experimental conditions treatment of RPE        with H          O          can cause an alteration of cellular        functions     or cell death      Cytotoxic levels        of H          O          can cause significant mitochondrial           and genomic    DNA damage in RPE simulating the        features of programmed cell death      Studies from        other cell types indicate that early cellular events        following H          O          treatment include morphological        alterations and actin reorganization     In addition        activation of the ERK p Extracellular        signalRegulated Kinase MAP kinases MitogenActivated        Protein kinases can occur within minutes following        cellular oxidative stress Depending on the cell type        examined inhibition of the ERK activity can either prevent           or enhance H          O          induced cell death     The        involvement of actin reorganization and ERK activation has        not been examined in RPE under oxidative stress        Lipid peroxidation products such as hydroxynonenal        HNE have attracted considerable attention because of        their potential involvement in aging and in a number of        neuropathological conditions     HNE was implicated        in the etiology of some pathological conditions in the eye        For example levels of HNE increased significantly in the        vitreous of patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy        compared with controls     Further HNE forms a        stable adduct with rhodopsin in the photoreceptor which        may interfere with its functions     HNE even causes        cataracts in cultured rat lens      Whether        oxidative stress on RPE can cause accumulation of cellular        HNEprotein adducts remains unknown        Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors PPARs        belong to a group of nuclear receptors that include        steroid retinoid thyroid hormone receptors and others              There are three types of PPARs PPAR is        expressed predominantly in the liver heart kidney brown        adipose and stomach mucosa and is important for lipid        catabolism PPAR is found in adipose tissues and is        important for adipogenesis PPAR is found in most tissues        but its role is less well defined RPE cells express all        three forms of PPARs but PPAR is the dominant isoform            There is a fold induction of PPAR mRNA that reaches        a peak at hour after phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer        segments The levels of either PPAR mRNA or PPAR mRNA are        not altered under the same conditions Increases in PPAR        in RPE cells may be important for handling the lipids        generated during the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer        segments     Since RPE cells generate large amounts of        H          O          during the phagocytosis of        photoreceptor outer segments there is a possibility that        activation of PPAR may assist in defending the oxidative        stress associated with phagocytosis        This study was designed to examine morphological        alterations in RPE during oxidative stress the involvement        of ERK MAP kinase and HNE and to test the hypothesis that        PPAR activation can prevent oxidative damage on RPE cells        The human RPE cell line ARPE and primary cultures of        adult human RPE were used in this study ARPE is a        spontaneous occurring nontransformed RPE cell line which        expresses RPE specific markers such as CRALBP and RPE        and exhibits morphological polarization and tight junctions        similar to native RPE                         Methods                  Materials          WY dPGJ

            Results                  Cytotoxicity of H O toward primary human RPE and          ARPE cells          Initial experiments analyzing the cytotoxic effect of          oxidative stress on primary cultures of human RPE cells          indicated that H            O            at  mM or less did not affect          cellular viability Higher concentrations caused a sharp          decrease of viability in human RPE such that a hour          treatment of cells with  mM H            O            lowered the viability to  of          controls Fig A squares This concentration lowered          the viability of human RPE to  after a hour          treatment Fig A circles          In a set of analogous experiments ARPE cells          treated with various concentrations of H            O            for  hours or  hours showed that          a hour treatment with  mM H            O            did not affect viability An          increase of H            O            concentrations beyond  mM decreased          viability such as  mM H            O            decreased the viability to  of          controls in  hours Fig B circles Treatment of          cells with H            O            for  hours caused a dosedependent          decrease of viability with a LD            of  mM Fig B squares          H            O            induced cytotoxicity in RPE cells          appears to be affected by the density of cells in          cultures     To study this phenomenon ARPE cells          plated in well plates with densities of            or  cellswell were subjected to H            O            treatment Cells grown in a          highdensity culture were indeed more resistant to H            O            as compared to those grown in a          lowdensity culture Fig C For example H            O            at  mM reduced cellular viability          to   or  of control in cultures with            or  cellswell respectively                          H O induced morphological alterations and          formation of HNEadducts          To analyze morphological changes of RPE cells treated          with a cytotoxic concentration of H            O             ARPE cells were treated with           mM H            O            for various periods of time and then          processed for actin staining Without H            O            treatment stress fibers appeared          thin and diffuse in control cells Fig A arrow At          min after treatment these cells appeared to round up          and significant ruffling occurred at the edge of their          plasma membrane Fig B arrows Overall thickening of          stress fibers occurred at two hours after treatment in          addition to the membrane ruffling Fig C arrows          Additional morphological

        in other cells which made the nuclei prominent Fig E          arrows and microspikes Fig F arrow on the cell          surface of some cells          Subsequent experiments with immunofluorescent staining          indicated that  mM H            O            treatment of ARPE cells for           hours led to the formation of HNE protein adducts both          in the cytoplasm and nucleus presumably as a result of          lipidperoxidation Fig AB Various protein bands on          Western blots were positive for antiHNE antibody          reactivity further intensified as a result of H            O            treatment Fig C Densitometry          measurements were performed to estimate the collective          increase of band intensity in each lane between  Kd and           Kd Results derived from a total of six independent          experiments indicated that treatment of cells with             or  mM H            O            caused an increase of intensity to             or fold of control          respectively          Though there was significant cytoskeletal alterations          and lipid peroxidation at  hours after H            O            treatment nuclear staining using          bisbenzimide Hoechst  indicated that most cells          maintained normal nuclear morphology at this time Fig          A untreated cells Fig B  hours after treatment          Nuclear condensation increased with length of H            O            exposure which was clearly evident          at  hours after H            O            treatment Fig C arrows and even          more prominent at  hours after treatment Fig D          These results suggest that H            O            treatment caused apoptosis in RPE          Nuclear condensation appeared to start at the edge of the          culture relatively lower density area Fig C arrows          and spread to the center part of the culture higher          density Fig D over time This phenomenon is          consistent with the viability assay in which higher          density cultures were more resistant to oxidative stress          Fig C                          Effect of oxidative stress on PPAR protein          expression          During rod outer segment ingestion there is a          generation of H            O                and an upregulation of          PPAR mRNA expression    in RPE experiments were          performed to determine if H            O            could induce PPAR protein          expression over the control levels ARPE cells were          treated with various concentrations     mM          of H            O            for  hours and processed for          Western blot analysis Results indicated a slight          induction of PPAR protein levels in some experiments          This induction however was not apparent in other          experiments Results not shown Densitometry analyses          from a total of six independent experiments indicated          that treatment of these cells with    or  mM H            O            for  hours caused an alteration of          band intensity to    or  of controls          respectively There was no significant change of PPAR          protein level after min or hour H            O            treatment either results not          shown A separate set of experiments also indicated that          treatment of primary human RPE cells with  mM H            O            for  hours did not induce PPAR          protein expression over the control levels results not          shown                          Prevention of oxidative stress induced cytotoxicity          by PPAR agonists          Even though H            O            did not increase PPAR protein          expression significantly as indicated in the previous          study experiments were performed to determine whether          PPAR agonists could activate the existing PPAR thus          preventing H            O            induced cytotoxicity in RPE cells          Cells were pretreated with the PPAR agonist dPGJ            overnight followed by H            O            for one day without dPGJ             and processed for the MTT          viability assay Results indicated that dPGJ            prevented H            O            induced cytotoxicity in primary          human RPE cultures in a dosedependent manner Fig A          Subsequent experiments with ARPE cells also indicated          this saving effect While H            O            at  mM  mM or  mM lowered          the ARPE viability to   or  of control          respectively pretreatment of these cells with  M          dPGJ            raised the viabilities to            or  of control respectively Fig B Cells stained          with Hoechst  indicated that dPGJ            prevented H            O            induced nuclear condensation Fig          E compare this with Fig D The other PPAR agonists          ciglitazone     azelaoyl PAF

high concentration  M however the difference          was not statistically significant results not          shown                          Activation of ERK by H O           A set of experiments was performed to determine the          effects of H            O            on ERK activation ARPE cells          were treated with  mM H            O            for  hour and processed for          immunohistochemical staining using antibodies against          phosphoERK Untreated cells showed a faint phosphoERK          staining while there was an apparent increase of          phosphoERK staining in the cytoplasm and nuclei in H            O            treated cells Fig AB A          separate set of cultures was treated with H            O            for  min and then processed for          Western blot analysis This H            O            treatment of the cells caused only a          slight alteration in ERK levels but led to a          dosedependent increase of phosphoERK with a maximal          stimulation observed at  mM Fig C Densitometry          analyses from  independent experiments indicated that             or  mM H            O            caused an increase of pERK ERK          phosphorylation to    or  fold of          control respectively Similar treatment caused an          increase of p ERK ERK phosphorylation to             or fold of control respectively The          phosphoERK in H            O            treated samples remained higher than          control at hour after treatment results not          shown                          Effect of ERK inhibition on H O induced          cytotoxicity in ARPE          Since ERK activation appeared to be an early event          associated with H            O            induced cytotoxicity experiments          were performed to determine if inhibitors of ERK          activation could affect the cytotoxicity caused by H            O             ARPE cells were pretreated with           M PD a MEK inhibitor which functions upstream          of ERK     followed by H            O            challenge Results from           independent experiments indicated that this agent could          prevent lowdose  mM H            O            induced cell death slightly In          contrast it enhanced highdose  mM H            O            induced cell death These effects in          either case were not remarkable results not shown This          agent at concentrations higher than  M was toxic to          ARPE cells by itself and could enhance H            O            toxicity results not shown          In a separate set of experiments ARPE cells were          pretreated with  M AG a protein tyrosine kinase          inhibitor     followed by H            O            challenge The treatment of cells          with  mM  mM or  mM H            O            decreased the cellular viability to            or  of control respectively Pretreatment of          cells with AG raised the viability to  p            compared to H            O            treatment only  p            or  p   of control respectively AG at          concentrations higher than  M was toxic to ARPE          cells by itself and could enhance H            O            toxicity results not shown          Both AG  M and dPGJ             M could prevent H            O            induced cytotoxicity in ARPE a          set of experiments was also performed to determine          whether these two agents had additive saving effects          While  mM H            O            treatment reduced the viability to           of control AG raised this viability to  of          control and dPGJ            raised the viability to  of          control A combination of these two agents did not raise          the viability above dPGJ            alone Fig                             Discussion                  Cytotoxicity of oxidative stress on RPE          Results from this study indicated that both primary          human RPE cultures and ARPE cells were susceptible to          H            O            treatment It is important to point          out that H            O            showed a very steep doseresponse          curve in primary RPE cultures under our experimental          conditions such that an increase of H            O            concentration from  mM to  mM          for oneday treatment caused a decrease in viability from           to  of control Fig A Though the H            O            titration curve in ARPE was not          as steep as observed in primary RPE oneday treatment of          these cells with  mM H            O            could decrease the cellular          viability to  of control while  mM H            O            did not affect cellular viability          Fig B The sharp doseresponse curves demonstrated in          this study suggests that it is important to have an          effective cellular antioxidation mechanism to prevent          the buildup of oxidative stress over a critical level          An increase of oxidative stress in RPE is associated with          an increase of cellular catalase metallothionein             and glutathione Stransferase     which should serve          as a protective mechanism to decrease the cytotoxicity          caused by H            O            and other reactive oxygen species          This protective mechanism declines with age because a          study analyzing metallothionein levels in RPE of macular          region showed a dramatic decrease in aged donors mean          age  yr as compared to those from younger donors          mean age  yr     A separate report concluded          that there was also an agedependent decrease of catalase          activity in RPE     These studies suggest RPE in the          elderly are more susceptible to oxidative stress induced          damage which may contribute to agerelated RPE          dysfunction and vision loss The oxidative stress induced          RPE cytotoxicity can be aggravated by zinc deficiency as          previously reported by Tate et al              Significant morphological changes were observed in RPE          cells treated with a cytotoxic concentration of H            O             Actin fiber reorganization was          noticed as early as  minutes after treatment Fig           Those images presented in Fig DEand Fare three          representatives of RPE cells at  hr after H            O            treatment The cells shown in D and          F are commonly seen at different locations on the same          slide In Fig D the dense peripheral bands of actin          fibers were very prominent in some cells and the high          intensity fluorescence caused an impression that the          cells were relatively empty The thickening of dense          peripheral bands in this study was in contrast to          previous observations in endothelial cells For example          Zhao and Davis reported that cultured pulmonary          endothelial cells treated with H            O            underwent a morphological change          that was accompanied by an accumulationincrease in          stress fibers running across the cells while the dense          peripheral bands of most cells were disrupted or          eliminated     Similar observations on endothelial          cells were made by Liu and Sundqvist     The dense          peripheral bands are important in cellcell adhesion          which maintains the structural integrity While it is          apparent that endothelial cells used in those studies and          epithelial cells used in this study respond differently          to H            O             the underlying reason for this          difference is currently unknown One may speculate that          RPE cells use this buildin mechanism to defend the          oxidative stress that they are constantly exposed to We          currently have no data to support or dismiss this          possibility In Fig E some cultures responded to H            O            treatment by a perinuclear          distribution of actin fibers In Fig F we observed          microspikes at the periphery of the cells A detailed          study of microspikes by Adams indicated that these          structures consist of actin the actin binding protein           kdfascin and myosin     The perinuclear staining          and microspikes of cells under oxidative stress in this          study are very similar to those observed by Huot et al          in endothelial cells treated with H            O                The functional significance          of these structural changes in RPE after H            O            treatment is not clear There is a          possibility that the appearance of microspikes around the          cells under stressed conditions is an adapted behavior of          the cells in order to attach to the substratum firmly          Prolonged H            O            treatment led to cell death with the          appearance of condensed nuclei is an indication of          apoptosis Fig CD This general finding is          consistent with that observed by others               It is of interest to note that cultures with a reduced          density are more vulnerable to H            O            treatment Fig C One          straightforward explanation for the vulnerability of          lowdensity cultures treated with H            O            is that more molecules of H            O            per cell were present in these          lowdensity cultures which caused a lower viability If          this were the case a mathematic analysis of the H            O            molecules per cell should be able to          estimate the cytotoxicity in this experimental system          For example  mM H            O            in a culture plated at a density of           cellswell should result in a viability close to          twice of that generated in  cellswell and four          times of that in  cellswell Results from Fig          Cindicated that the viability of each condition above          was   or  respectively It is apparent that H            O            killed more cells in cultures of          lower density  cellswell than expected Because          the result could not always be predicted by a mathematic          estimation there is a possibility that cellcell          contacts and some autocrineparacrine production in a          culture may alter the microenvironment thus determine the          cytotoxicity caused by H            O             Since cells with lower density are          more susceptible to oxidative stress there is a          possibility that a vicious cycle exists such that when an          area of RPE loses some of the constituent cells by          oxidative stress the remaining cells will become even          more vulnerable to this insult                          PPARs in RPE          This study indicated that the PPAR agonist dPGJ            could prevent H            O            induced RPE cell death Figs          ABand Fig E This suggests that this agent can          prevent oxidative stress induced RPE damage This finding          is significant given prior reports that oxidative stress          on RPE is an important contributing factor of agerelated          macular degeneration      An earlier report also          indicated that PPAR agonists could prevent laser          photocoagulation induced choroidal neovascularization in          rat eyes and monkey eyes which suggests the possible          application of these agents on the exudative form of          agerelated macular degeneration     It is important          to note that the other PPAR agonists tested in this          study ciglitazone azelaoyl PAF and LY were          ineffective in saving cells under the same experimental          conditions Since three out of four PPAR agonists tested          were ineffective this raises the possibility that the          saving effect of dPGJ            is not through PPAR activation In          this respect it should be noted that this agent has been          shown to exert some biological effects that are          independent of PPAR activation                We have previously shown that dPGJ            can prevent the cytotoxicity of          cholesterol oxides end products of cholesterol under          oxidative stress     Together with results from the          current study this agent may have a general protective          effect against oxidative stress itself or against          cytotoxic agents generated by oxidative stress It is          important to note that dPGJ            functions as a general inhibitor of          immune activities For example this agent is a potent          inhibitor of microglia the macrophagelike cells in the          central nervous system      and shown to be          effective in reducing the symptoms of experimental          autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE an animal model for          the human disease multiple sclerosis     Together          these results suggest that this agent may be useful in          preventing ocular diseases that result from oxidative          stress or inflammation                          ERK activation and HNE protein adducts formation          as a result of oxidative stress          Oxidative stress is a potent stimulator of the MAP          kinase activities       Phosphorylation of ERK          could be observed within  minutes after H            O            treatment Fig  There are          conflicting results in literature regarding whether an          increase of ERK phosphorylation is beneficial or          detrimental to cell survival Bhat et al demonstrated          that  M PD could prevent H            O            induced cell death in an          oligodendrocyte cell line     In contrast  M          PD was shown to enhance cell death caused by H            O            treatment in HeLa cells              This reagent had no significant effect on H            O            treated ARPE cells under our          experimental conditions AG on the other hand          appeared to reduce the cytotoxicity caused by oxidative          stress Fig  While this suggests that inhibition of          tyrosine phosphorylation or ERK activation after H            O            treatment might be beneficial for          the cells results from PD could not support this          statement          There is a possibility that the saving effect of AG          is not related to ERK inhibition Under the current          experimental conditions AG at  M was protective          but it enhanced H            O            toxicity at  M These results          were consistent with those reported by Sagara et al              AG belongs to a group of tyrosine kinase          inhibitors named tyrphostins Many of these agents can          prevent cellular oxidative stress including that          generated by glutamate There is no correlation between          the kinase inhibition and the observed protective effect          Overnight treatment of cells with AG can increase          cellular glutathione levels Furthermore this agent has          some antioxidant effect based on the Trolox Equivalent          Activity Concentration     Collectively this may          explain the observation that AG at  M could          partially prevent H            O            induced cytotoxicity This agent can          also function as a mitochondria uncoupler thus it          actually enhances H            O            cytotoxicity at higher          concentrations              An accumulation of HNEconjugated protein has been          detected in lesions of agingrelated diseases including          Parkinsons disease    and Alzheimers disease              It also accumulates in the affected neuronal tissues of          experimental animals experiencing brain ischemia              and traumatic spinal cord injury     HNE can          impair synaptosomal membrane proteins glutamate          transport and importantly mitochondrial functions               Evidence indicates that HNE increases neuronal          susceptibility to oxidative stress    and serves as a          mediator of oxidative stress that leads to neuronal          apoptosis     As indicated in the Introduction          HNE has been implicated in some ocular pathological          conditions               Several laboratories have attempted to document the          formation of HNE protein adducts during oxidative          stress by Western blot analysis Uchida et al first          reported oxidative stress caused by tbutylhydroperoxide          or ironascorbate could lead to HNE protein adducts in          hepatocytes     Further studies by these researchers          attempted to identify the common epitope recognized by          the HNE antibodies However no specific protein was          positively identified     More recently the          formation of HNE protein adducts was also demonstrated          by Western blot analysis from the heart     the          liver    and the kidney    under oxidative          stress It is important to point out that the patterns of          HNE protein adducts as shown by these Western blot          analyses were different among these studies probably as          a result of tissue specificity No particular protein was          identified as a specific target for HNE adduct          formation in these studies Results from the current          study indicate that H            O            treatment of RPE could lead to the          accumulation of HNE protein adducts in the cytoplasm          and the nuclei of these cells Fig  There was a          dosedependent increase of HNE protein adduct after H            O            treatment with a maximal intensity          of X control at  mM H            O            Fig C This may partially          contribute to oxidative stress induced ocular disease          Even though ocular tissues including the retina contain          glutathione Stransferases that can actively detoxify          HNE      adverse events may occur if aging or          pathological conditions hinder this normal defense from          functioning properly It warrants further studies to          identify those proteins species that are modified by          HNE                            Conclusions        This study demonstrates that oxidative stress induced by        H          O          could lead to RPE cell death which is        preceded by distinct morphological changes ERK activation        and HNE protein adduct formation The cell death can be        prevented partially by AG and the prostaglandin        derivative dPGJ          These agents may be useful        pharmacological tools in the future capable of preventing        oxidative stress induced RPE cell death in human ocular        diseases                    Competing Interests        None declared                    Authors
