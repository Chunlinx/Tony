                    Introduction        Passive leg elevation PLE is a common manoeuvre        performed to prepare the sterile field in several surgical        specialities coronary surgery vascular and orthopaedic        surgery to facilitate surgical exposure gynaecologic and        urologic surgery or to treat acute hypotension It is well        known that this postural change induces some haemodynamic        modifications represented by the shift of blood from the        legs into the central circulation by the increase in the        venous return and by the improvement in systemic        haemodynamics      These effects are more        pronounced under general anaesthesia because of the larger        blood sequestration into the peripheral higher compliant        venous system as a result of the loss in the muscular and        vascular tone induced by the anaesthetic drugs    If        the manoeuvre can be utilized to treat acute hypotension        due to hypovolaemia it could not be as beneficial in the        patient with a compromised right ventricle where acute        volume loading may lead to a further deterioration of the        right ventricular function            Many experimental and clinical studies have shown        however that PLE has no or little haemodynamic benefit in        normovolaemic patients with a stable cardiocirculatory        status       Studying the haemodynamic        effects of the manoeuvre in anaesthetized coronary patients        with a rapidresponse thermistor pulmonary artery catheter          Reich         et al  concluded that PLE results in        minor haemodynamic improvement in right ventricular        dilatation and in right ventricular ejection fraction        RVEF decrease   The authors however did not        differentiate between the patients with a normal right        ventricular function and those with a reduced right        ventricular function For this reason we planned our study        in order to evaluate the effects of PLE on the right        ventricle with the same technique comparing a group of        patients with a preinduction RVEF   with a second        group of patients with preinduction RVEF                      Methods        Twenty coronary patients scheduled for elective        myocardial revascularization were studied after the study        protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee and the        written informed consent was obtained from each patient        The admission criteria to the study were stable        preoperative cardiocirculatory conditions without        intravenous cardiovascular drugs no evidence of valvular        disease or pulmonary hypertension a normal sinus rhythm        normovolaemia and no diuretic therapy        Preoperative cardiac medications blockers calcium        channel blockers nitroglycerin were continued until the        day of surgery        All patients were premedicated with intramuscular        morphine  mgkg and scopolamine  mgkg  min        before entering the operating room They were monitored by        electrocardiogram D II V ST segment analysis by        radial artery cannula and by a thermodilution RVEF        pulmonary artery catheter model AHF Baxter        Edwards Healthcare Laboratories Santa Ana CA USA        positioned before induction under local anaesthesia        General anaesthesia was induced with etomidate         mgkg fentanyl  gkg and vecuronium  mgkg and        was maintained during the study with a continuous infusion        of midazolam  mghour Mechanical ventilation was        provided with an oxygenair mixture and was adjusted to        maintain the arterial carbon dioxide tension between  and         mmHg and to maintain the arterial oxygen tension higher        than  mmHg No level of positive endexpiratory pressure        was applied During the study  mlkg fluids per hour        were administered to all patients and no other drug was        used After endotracheal intubation a twodimensional        transoesophageal echocardiography probe was introduced into        the oesophagus The probe was connected to an        ultrasonograph device Color Doppler model SSD Aloka        Company Tokyo Japan and videorecording of        twodimensional transoesophageal echocardiography images        were made for later analysis        A complete haemodynamic profile was performed before        induction of anaesthesia time point  just before time        point  and  min time point  after the patients had        their legs simultaneously raised at an angle of  and         min after the legs were lowered time point  The        pressure data at each time were recorded the right        intraventricular pressures advancing the pulmonary artery        catheter until the proximal port entered the ventricular        chamber and were then followed by injection of iced         glucose solution at the end of the expiratory time until        three values of cardiac output within  of each other        were obtained        Each haemodynamic profile consisted of data recorded by        the Hewlett Packard Palo Alto CA USA monitor model         C and registered on a fivechannel Hewlett Packard        strip chart recorder and data recorded by the Explorer        computer Baxter Edwards Healthcare Laboratories        The first profile measured the heart rate the systolic        systemic pressure the diastolic systemic pressure the        mean systemic pressure the mean pulmonary pressure the        pulmonary capillary wedge pressure the central venous        pressure the right ventricular diastolic pressure the        right ventricular end diastolic pressure measured at the        interception of the R point in the QRS complex with the        intraventricular pressure trace   and the right        ventricular systolic pressure The right ventricular end        systolic pressure was not measured because the dicrotic        notch on the pulmonary artery pressure wave was very often        not evident All pressures were measured on the strip chart        at the end of the expiratory time        The other profile measured the right ventricular end        diastolic volume the right ventricular end systolic        volume the RVEF and the cardiac output        The derived parameters then calculated were the cardiac        index the stroke volume index the right ventricular end        diastolic volume index RVEDVI and the right ventricular        end systolic volume index RVESVI the right ventricular        end diastolic volumepressure ratio RVED VP the right        ventricular stroke work index the pressure gradient        between systolic systemic pressure and right ventricular        systolic pressure          p         SSPRVSP  and the pressure gradient        between diastolic systemic pressure and the mean right        ventricular diastolic pressure the mean value between        diastolic and end diastolic right ventricular pressures                 p         DSPmRVDP         The patients were divided into two groups on the basis        of the RVEF measured at time point  the patients of group        A had RVEF   and the patients of group B had RVEF                 Statistical analysis was performed by twoway analysis        of variance test for repeated measures with a Bonferroni        correction         P   was considered        significant Results are expressed as mean  standard        deviation                    Results        Sixteen patients completed the study protocol Four        patients two from each group were excluded because of        arrhythmias one patient because of intravenous        administration of nitroglycerin for angina two patients        and because of moderate tricuspid regurgitation at time        point  one patient        The general characteristics of the patients are reported        in Table  There are no significant differences between        the two groups regarding age left ventricular ejection        fraction preoperative therapy and the number of right and        left coronary stenoses        Comparing the basal values between the two groups the        bedside RVEF the heart rate          P   the RVEDVI the RVESVI                 P   and the RVED VP          P   were significantly        higher in group B than in group A time point  Table         This statistical difference persisted at time point  only        for the RVEF the RVEDVI and the RVESVI        The PLE induced similar changes in heart rate which        decreased significantly in both groups and induced similar        changes in the majority of the pressure values central        venous pressure right ventricular diastolic pressure        right ventricular end diastolic pressure pulmonary        capillary wedge pressure which increased significantly at        time point  compared with time point  Table  On the        contrary the systolic systemic pressure the diastolic        systemic pressure the mean systemic pressure and the mean        pulmonary pressure increased significantly only in group A        at the same time point        The main differences between the two groups after the        legs were raised are represented however by the changes        in the data regarding volumes Table  In group A at        time point  versus time point  in the face of a slight        and not significant increase in cardiac index we observed        a significant increase in the stroke volume index          P   the RVEDVI          P   and the RVESVI          P   However the RVEF was        unchanged and the RVED VP slightly decreased        Moreover the right ventricular stroke work index          P   the          p         SSPRVSP          P   and the          p         DSPmRVDP          P   significantly increased        at the same time At time point  the          p         DSPmRVDP change was statistically        significant between the two groups        An opposite haemodynamic behaviour was observed at time        point  in group B In fact while the cardiac index        remained stable and the stroke volume index increased        slightly the RVEDVI          P   and the RVED VP          P   significantly decreased        The RVEF increased and the RVESVI decreased but not        significantly No significant change was recorded in the        right ventricular stroke work index the          p         SSPRVSP and the          p         DSPmRVDP         The graphic representation of the relationship between        right ventricular end diastolic volume and right        ventricular end diastolic pressure shows the upward and        left side movement of this ratio in the patients of group        A and shows the upward and right side movement in the        patients of group B Fig  After the legs had been        lowered the haemodynamic parameters time point  nearly        returned to the same values recorded at time point         The transoesophageal echocardiographic images did not        show any episode of tricuspid regurgitation and no        apparent displacement of the interventricular septum in the        patients who completed the study protocol        No ST segment change was observed in any patient at the        four times of the study                    Discussion        Many investigators have examined the haemodynamic        effects of passive leg raising with different monitoring        techniques Wong         et al  using thoracic bioimpedence        showed a small but significant increase in cardiac index        after PLE in awake patients American Society of        Anaesthesiologists score index II and III undergoing        elective operations   Rutlen         et al  using nuclear scintigraphy        reported that  ml or less of blood transferred to the        intravascular space after leg elevation   Kyriakides         et al  employing a Doppler        echocardiographic technique showed that the postural        change increases preload and cardiac performance in        normovolaemic coronary patients   However studying        the effects of PLE on anaesthetized coronary patients by a        rapidresponse pulmonary artery catheter for measurement of        RVEF and volumes   Reich         et al  found no improvement in        cardiac performance          Our results are in agreement with the conclusions drawn        by the previous authors in fact a slight increase or no        increase in cardiac index was seen in all the patients        studied The haemodynamic response of the right ventricle        to the postural change was quite different in the two        groups of patients however according to the basal right        ventricular function recorded before the induction of        anaesthesia        In the patients with a higher basal RVEF and lower right        ventricular volumes the haemodynamic behaviour was similar        to that described by Reich         et al    The right ventricular        end diastolic volume increased more than the right        ventricular end systolic volume and as the RVEF did not        change the stroke volume increased The cardiac index        increased only slightly because of the reduction in the        heart rate        Moreover the rise in right ventricular end diastolic        pressure did not significantly affect right ventricular        compliance   to which myocardial wall stress and        oxygen consumption are inversely related    because        the pressure increase was proportional to that of the end        diastolic volume The significant increase in the pressure        gradient between radial artery pressures generally equal        to aortic pressures and the right intraventricular        pressures whose gradient is considered a good index of        coronary perfusion pressure   may have improved the        right coronary driving pressure All these findings lead us        to conclude that leg elevation induced a favourable        condition in the right ventricle of these patients        On the contrary with the right ventricles dilated and a        lower basal ejection fraction the manoeuvre of raising the        legs was followed by a decrease in end diastolic volume        index and end systolic volume index and by a small        increase in ejection fraction and stroke volume while the        cardiac index was unchanged because of the reduction in the        heart rate The reduction of the ventricular size seemed to        be advantageous because according to the FrankStarling        relationship the right ventricle accomplished the same        work with a smaller end diastolic volume and a shorter        fibre length    The concomitant increase in the        right ventricular end diastolic pressure however led to a        marked reduction in the right ventricular compliance with        adverse effects on ventricular wall stress and oxygen        consumption            Another difference in group B was the lack of increase        in the pressure gradient between the radial artery and the        right ventricular cavity after the legs were raised This        haemodynamic event combined with stability in the cardiac        index did not offer a significant gain to the right        ventricular oxygen supply        We have to underline however that the conclusions        drawn on the right ventricular oxygen supplydemand ratio        in the two loading conditions are mainly speculative This        is because they are deduced from indirect indicators        intraventricular volumes and pressures of the myocardial        metabolic balance and they do not allow a direct        measurement of the oxygen supplied or extracted by the        heart      Nevertheless we believe that the        variations of the parameters measured in our patients can        help the anaesthesiologist and the intensivist to        understand or to predict the physiopathological changes        that occur in the right ventricle after the legs are        raised also because the haemodynamic data used can be        easily available in the clinical anaesthesiological and        intensive care setting        Our protocol included the ejection fraction as a tool to        divide the patients on the basis of the right ventricular        function This parameter shows important limitations as an        index of ventricular function In fact ejection fraction        is preload and afterload dependent and it correlates        poorly with myocardial contractility It is therefore not a        specific parameter since its variation is due to the        changes of one or more of the related factors preload        afterload or contractility    Ejection fraction        more than a measurement of ventricular performance can        consequently be considered as a measurement of the        integrated cardiovascular system in dealing with a        pathological process   However in spite of these        limitations we used the ejection fraction to define the        basal right ventricular function of our patients because        this parameter is measured by the pulmonary catheter we        used and because it is the one we use in our clinical        department for this purpose        The attempt to correlate the haemodynamic response of        the right ventricle to leg elevation with the degree and        the number of right coronary artery stenoses was        unsuccessful because the coronary obstructions were equally        distributed in the two groups It would therefore not have        been possible to predict from the coronarographic data the        haemodynamic changes of the right ventricle that followed        the passive leg raising manoeuvre        When analysing the haemodynamic data a difficulty can        arise in interpreting the pulmonary capillary wedge        pressure increase whether this change is due to an        increase in left ventricular preload that follows the        increase in venous return or to a decrease in left        ventricular compliance as a result of the leftward shift of        the interventricular septum for right ventricular        dilatation    As the wedge pressure also increased        in the patients of group B whose right ventricular volume        decreased after PLE and the transoesophageal        echocardiographic images did not show any apparent shift of        the interventricular septum in all patients we conclude        that the increase in preload may have been the probable        explanation for this haemodynamic change        The medication drugs given to the patients before        surgery nitroglycerin blockers calcium antagonists        and the anaesthetic treatment drugs mechanical        ventilation may have interfered significantly with the        cardiovascular function and the haemodynamic data recorded        at the four time points of the study              However as the drugs administered before surgery were        distributed equally in the two groups and the        anaesthesiological treatment was the same for all patients        we believe that this interference can be considered        negligible in the evaluation of the haemodynamic        differences observed in the patients studied        Concerning the data recorded by the thermodilution right        ventricular ejection fraction pulmonary artery catheter        the absence of episodes of tricuspid regurgitation a        condition that can lead to underestimating cardiac output        and RVEF     made those parameters reliable and        comparable with the parameters recorded before the        elevation of the legs        Another limitation of the present study is represented        by the number of patients studied which should be larger        to have more statistical weight and to provide additional        support for definitive conclusions However in spite of        the limitations described and the expectation of further        investigations confirming our results we conclude that the        manoeuvre of leg elevation necessary to prepare the        sterile field in several surgical specialities coronary        vascular and orthopaedic surgery or to position the        patient for some gynaecologic and urologic procedures must        be performed slowly and progressively in normovolaemic        coronary patients with a reduced right ventricular function        because it could decompensate the already poor balance of        oxygen supplydemand in the right ventricle        We finally suggest that as the main physiopathological        changes of PLE are caused by the increase in venous return        to the right ventricle and they are common to those induced        by the administration of fluids the manoeuvre of fluid        loading should be performed cautiously and progressively in        such coronary patients Even if this statement seems        obvious and other authors have drawn the same conclusions          further work needs to be carried out in this area to        confirm such a hypothesis                    Competing interests        None declared                    Key messages         PLE brings a slight benefit in coronary
