                        WARTIME            After the attacks had occurred while crisis managers were still sorting out a number                of unnerving false alarms Air Force One flew to Barksdale Air Force Base in                Louisiana One of these alarms was of a reported threat against Air Force One                itself a threat eventually run down to a misunderstood communication in the hectic                White House Situation Room that morning                        While the plan at the elementary school had been to return to Washington by the time                Air Force One was airborne at  AM the Secret Service the Presidents                advisers and Vice President Cheney were strongly advising against it President                Bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and at about  Air Force One changed                course and began heading due west The immediate objective was to find a safe                locationnot too far awaywhere the President could land and speak to the American                people The Secret Service was also interested in refueling the aircraft and paring                down the size of the traveling party The Presidents military aide an Air Force                officer quickly researched the options and sometime around  identified                Barksdale Air Force Base as an appropriate interim destination                        When Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about  personnel from the local                Secret Service office were still en route to the airfield The motorcade consisted                of a military police lead vehicle and a van the proposed briefing theater had no                phones or electrical outlets Staff scrambled to prepare another room for the                Presidents remarks while the lead Secret Service agent reviewed the security                situation with superiors in Washington The President completed his statement which                for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live and the traveling party                returned to Air Force One The next destination was discussed once again the Secret                Service recommended against returning to Washington and the Vice President agreed                Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska was chosen because of its elaborate command and                control facilities and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for                 persons The Secret Service wanted a place where the President could spend several                days if necessary                        Air Force One arrived at Offutt at  PM At about  President Bush met with                his principal advisers through a secure video teleconference                        Rice said President Bush began the meeting with the words Were at war and that Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said                the agency was still assessing who was responsible but the early signs all pointed                to al QaedaThat evening the Deputies Committee returned to the pending                presidential directive they had labored over during the summer                        The secretary of defense directed the nations armed forces to Defense Condition                 an increased state of military readiness                        For the first time in history all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United                States were grounded stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country                Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders had                been implemented  The Pentagon had been struck the White House or the Capitol had                narrowly escaped direct attack Extraordinary security precautions were put in place                at the nations borders and ports            In the late afternoon the President overruled his aides continuing reluctance to                have him return to Washington and ordered Air Force One back to Andrews Air Force                Base He was flown by helicopter back to the White House passing over the                stillsmoldering Pentagon At  that evening President Bush addressed the nation                from the White House After emphasizing that the first priority was to help the                injured and protect against any further attacks he said We will make no                distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor                them He quoted Psalm though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death                   No American he saidwill ever forget this day                        Following his speech President Bush met again with his National Security Council                NSC expanded to include Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and Joseph                Allbaugh the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Secretary of                State Colin Powell who had returned from Peru after hearing of the attacks joined                the discussion They reviewed the days events                        IMMEDIATE RESPONSES AT HOME            As the urgent domestic issues accumulated White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua                Bolten chaired a temporary domestic consequences group                        The agenda in those first days is worth noting partly as a checklist for future                crisis planners It began with problems of how to help victims and stanch the                flowing losses to the American economy such as                            Organizing federal emergency assistance One question was what kind of public                    health advice to give about the air quality in Lower Manhattan in the vicinity                    of the fallen buildings                                Compensating victims They evaluated legislative options eventually setting                    up a federal compensation fund and defining the powers of a special master to                    run it                Determining federal assistance On September  President Bush promised to                    provide  billion for New York City in addition to the  billion his budget                    director had already guessed might be needed for the country as a whole                                Restoring civil aviation On the morning of September  the national                    airspace reopened for use by airports that met newly improvised security                    standards                Reopening the financial markets After extraordinary emergency efforts                    involving the White House the Treasury Department and the Securities and                    Exchange Commission aided by unprecedented cooperation among the usually                    competitive firms of the financial industry the markets reopened on Monday                    September                                 Deciding when and how to return border and port security to more normal                    operations                Evaluating legislative proposals to bail out the airline industry and cap its                    liability                        The very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective                government organization dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems                of protection and preparedness Though a number of agencies had some part of the                task none had security as its primary mission By September  Vice President                Cheney had decided to recommend at least as a first step a new White House entity                to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of                combining them in a new department This new White House entity would be a homeland                security adviser and Homeland Security Councilparalleling the National Security                Council system Vice President Cheney reviewed the proposal with President Bush and                other advisers President Bush announced the new post and its first occupant                Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridgein his address to a joint session of Congress on                September                         Beginning on September  Immigration and Naturalization Service agents working in                cooperation with the FBI began arresting individuals for immigration violations whom                they encountered while following up leads in the FBIs investigation of the                 attacks Eventually  aliens were arrested as special interest detainees Some                such as Zacarias Moussaoui were actually in INS custody before  most were                arrested after Attorney General John Ashcroft told us that he saw his job in                directing this effort as risk minimization both to find out who had committed the                attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack Ashcroft ordered all special interest                immigration hearings closed to the public family members and press directed                government attorneys to seek denial of bond until such time as they were cleared                of terrorist connections by the FBI and other agencies and ordered the identity of                the detainees kept secret INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration                violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist                connections in the chaos after the attacks it was very difficult to reach law                enforcement officials who were following up on other leads The clearance process                approved by the Justice Department was timeconsuming lasting an average of about                 days                        We have assessed this effort to detain aliens of special interest The detainees                were lawfully held on immigration charges Records indicate that  were deported                 were released on bond  received some kind of immigration benefits  had                their proceedings terminated and one of whom was Moussaouiwere remanded to the                custody of the US Marshals Service The inspector general of the Justice                Department found significant problems in the way the  detainees were                    treated                        In response to a request about the counterterrorism benefits of the  detainee                program the Justice Department cited six individuals on the special interest                detainee list noting that two including Moussaoui were linked directly to a                terrorist organization and that it had obtained new leads helpful to the                investigation of the  terrorist attacks                        A senior al Qaeda detainee has stated that US government efforts after the                 attacks to monitor the American homeland including review of Muslims immigration                files and deportation of nonpermanent residents forced al Qaeda to operate less                freely in the United States                        The governments ability to collect intelligence inside the United States and the                sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement                communities was not a priority before  Guidelines on this subject issued in                August  by Deputy Attorney General LarryThompson essentially recapitulated prior                guidance However the attacks of  changed everything Less than one week after                September  an early version of what was to become the Patriot Act officially                the USA PATRIOT Act began to take shape                        A central provision of the proposal was the removal of the wall on information                sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities discussed in                chapter  Ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable action                within the limits of the Constitution to identify potential terrorists and deter                additional attacks                        The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of                Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October                         Flights of Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States            Three questions have arisen with respect to the departure of Saudi nationals from the                United States in the immediate aftermath of   Did any flights of Saudi                nationals take place before national airspace reopened on September                   Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of Saudi nationals                 Did the FBI screen Saudi nationals thoroughly before their departure            First we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals domestic or                international took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning                of September   To the contrary every flight we have identified occurred                after national airspace reopened                        Second we found no evidence of political intervention We found no evidence that                anyone at the White House above the level of Richard Clarke participated in a                decision on the departure of Saudi nationals The issue came up in one of the many                video teleconferences of the interagency group Clarke chaired and Clarke said he                approved of how the FBI was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency                discussion at his level Clarke told us I asked the FBI Dale Watson    to                handle that to check to see if that was all right with them to see if they wanted                access to any of these people and to get back to me And if they had no objections                it would be fine with me Clarke addedI have no recollection of clearing it with                anybody at the White House                        Although White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card remembered someone telling him about                the Saudi request shortly after  he said he had not talked to the Saudis and                did not ask anyone to do anything about it The President and Vice President told us                they were not aware of the issue at all until it surfaced much later in the media                None of the officials we interviewed recalled any intervention or direction on this                matter from any political appointee                        Third we believe that the FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals                who left the United States on charter flights                        The Saudi government was advised of and agreed to the FBIs requirements that                passengers be identified and checked against various databases before the flights                departedThe Federal Aviation Administration representative working in the FBI                operations center made sure that the FBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals                and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart                        The FBI interviewed all persons of interest on these flights prior to their                departures They concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the                 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion Our own                independent review of the Saudi nationals involved confirms that no one with known                links to terrorism departed on these flights                        PLANNING FOR WAR            By late in the evening of September  the President had addressed the nation on the                terrible events of the day Vice President Cheney described the Presidents mood as                somberThe long day was not yet over When the larger meeting that included his                domestic department heads broke up President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of top                advisers a group he would later call his war councilThis group usually                included Vice President Cheney Secretary of State Powell Secretary of Defense                Donald Rumsfeld General Hugh Shelton Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs later to                become chairman General Myers DCI Tenet Attorney General Ashcroft and FBI                Director Robert Mueller From the White House staff National Security Advisor                Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Card were part of the core group often joined                by their deputies Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten            In this restricted National Security Council meeting the President said it was a                time for selfdefense The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of                the attacks but also those who harbored them Secretary Powell said the United                States had to make it clear to Pakistan Afghanistan and the Arab states that the                time to act was now He said we would need to build a coalition The President noted                that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage Russia and China Secretary                Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who might                have harbored the attackers including Iraq Afghanistan Libya Sudan and Iran He                wondered aloud how much evidence the United States would need in order to deal with                these countries pointing out that major strikes could take up to  days to                    assemble                        President Bush chaired two more meetings of the NSC on September  In the first                meeting he stressed that the United States was at war with a new and different kind                of enemy The President tasked principals to go beyond their pre work and                develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them As                they worked on defining the goals and objectives of the upcoming campaign they                considered a paper that went beyond al Qaeda to propose the elimination of                terrorism as a threat to our way of life an aim that would include pursuing other                international terrorist organizations in the Middle East                        Rice chaired a Principals Committee meeting on September  in the Situation Room to                refine how the fight against al Qaeda would be conducted The principals agreed that                the overall message should be that anyone supporting al Qaeda would risk harm The                United States would need to integrate diplomacy financial measures intelligence                and military actions into an overarching strategy The principals also focused on                Pakistan and what it could do to turn the Taliban against al Qaeda They concluded                that if Pakistan decided not to help the United States it too would be at                    risk                        The same day Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage met with the Pakistani                ambassador to the United States Maleeha Lodhi and the visiting head of Pakistans                military intelligence service Mahmud Ahmed Armitage said that the United States                wanted Pakistan to take seven steps                            to stop al Qaeda operatives at its border and end all logistical support for                    Bin Ladin                to give the United States blanket overflight and landing rights for all                    necessary military and intelligence operations                to provide territorial access to US and allied military intelligence and                    other personnel to conduct operations against al Qaeda                to provide the United States with intelligence information                to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist acts                to cut off all shipments of fuel to the Taliban and stop recruits from going                    to Afghanistan and                if the evidence implicated bin Ladin and al Qaeda and the Taliban continued to                    harbor them to break relations with the Taliban government                                        Pakistan made its decision swiftly That afternoon Secretary of State Powell                announced at the beginning of an NSC meeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had                agreed to every US request for support in the war on terrorism The next day the                US embassy in Islamabad confirmed that Musharraf and his top military commanders                had agreed to all seven demands Pakistan will need full US support as it proceeds                with us the embassy noted Musharraf said the GOP government of Pakistan was                making substantial concessions in allowing use of its territory and that he would                pay a domestic price His standing in Pakistan was certain to suffer To                counterbalance that he needed to show that Pakistan was benefiting from his                    decisions                        At the September  NSC meeting when Secretary Powell described Pakistans reply                President Bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban He also                ordered Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a military plan against the Taliban The                President wanted the United States to strike the Taliban step back wait to see if                they got the message and hit them hard if they did not He made clear that the                military should focus on targets that would influence the Talibans behavior                        President Bush also tasked the State Department which on the following day delivered                to the White House a paper titled Game Plan for a Political Military Strategy for                Pakistan and Afghanistan The paper took it as a given that Bin Ladin would                continue to act against the United States even while under Taliban control It                therefore detailed specific US demands for the Taliban surrender Bin Ladin and                his chief lieutenants including Ayman al Zawahiri tell the United States what the                Taliban knew about al Qaeda and its operations close all terrorist camps free all                imprisoned foreigners and comply with all UN Security Council resolutions                        The State Department proposed delivering an ultimatum to the Taliban produce Bin                Ladin and his deputies and shut down al Qaeda camps within  to  hours or the                United States will use all necessary means to destroy the terrorist infrastructure                The State Department did not expect the Taliban to comply Therefore State and                Defense would plan to build an international coalition to go into Afghanistan Both                departments would consult with NATO and other allies and request intelligence                basing and other support from countries according to their capabilities and                resources Finally the plan detailed a public US stance America would use all                its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat punish those responsible for the                 attacks hold states and other actors responsible for providing sanctuary to                terrorists work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks and                avoid malice toward any people religion or culture                        President Bush recalled that he quickly realized that the administration would have                to invade Afghanistan with ground troops                        But the early briefings to the President and Secretary Rumsfeld on military options                were disappointing  Tommy Franks the commanding general of Central Command                CENTCOM told us that the President was dissatisfied The US military Franks                said did not have an offtheshelf plan to eliminate the al Qaeda threat in                Afghanistan The existing Infinite Resolve options did not in his view amount to                such a plan                        All these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over the weekend of September                 as President Bush convened his war council at Camp David                        Present were Vice President Cheney Rice Hadley Powell Armitage Rumsfeld                Ashcroft Mueller Tenet Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Cofer                Black chief of the DCIs Counterterrorist Center            Tenet described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations He                proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would                join the fight against al QaedaThese CIA teams would act jointly with the                militarys Special Operations units President Bush later praised this proposal                saying it had been a turning point in his thinking                        General Shelton briefed the principals on the preliminary plan for Afghanistan that                the military had put together It drew on the Infinite Resolve phased campaign                plan the Pentagon had begun developing in November  as an addition to the strike                options it had been refining since  But Shelton added a new elementthe                possible significant use of ground forces and that is where President Bush                reportedly focused his attention                        After hearing from his senior advisers President Bush discussed with Rice the                contents of the directives he would issue to set all the plans into motion Rice                prepared a paper that President Bush then considered with principals on Monday                morning September  The purpose of this meeting he recalled sayingis to                assign tasks for the first wave of the war against terrorism It starts today                        In a written set of instructions slightly refined during the morning meeting                President Bush charged Ashcroft Mueller and Tenet to develop a plan for homeland                defense President Bush directed Secretary of State Powell to deliver an ultimatum                to the Taliban along the lines that his department had originally proposed The                State Department was also tasked to develop a plan to stabilize Pakistan and to be                prepared to notify Russia and countries near Afghanistan when hostilities were                    imminent                        In addition Bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action                in Afghanistan including the administrations first Memorandum of Notification on                Bin Ladin Shortly thereafter President Bush authorized broad new authorities for                the CIA                        President Bush instructed Rumsfeld and Shelton to develop further the Camp David                military plan to attack the Taliban and al Qaeda if the Taliban rejected the                ultimatum The President also tasked Rumsfeld to ensure that robust measures to                protect American military forces against terrorist attack were implemented                worldwide Finally he directed Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill to craft a plan to                target al Qaedas funding and seize its assets                        NSC staff members had begun leading meetings on terrorist fundraising by September                                            Also by September  Powell had contacted  of his foreign counterparts and                received offers of general aid searchandrescue equipment and personnel and                medical assistance teams                        On the same day Deputy Secretary of State Armitage was called by Mahmud Ahmed                regarding a twoday visit to Afghanistan during which the Pakistani intelligence                chief had met with Mullah Omar and conveyed the US demands Omars response was                not negative on all these points But the                administration knew that theTaliban was unlikely to turn over Bin Ladin                        The pre draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive                National Security Presidential Directive  now titled Defeating the Terrorist                Threat to the United States The directive would now extend to a global war on                terrorism not just on al Qaeda It also incorporated the Presidents determination                not to distinguish between terrorists and those who harbor them It included a                determination to use military force if necessary to end al Qaedas sanctuary in                Afghanistan The new directiveformally signed on October  after the fighting in                Afghanistan had already begunincluded new material followed by annexes discussing                each targeted terrorist group The old draft directive on al Qaeda became in                effect the first annex                        The United States would strive to eliminate all terrorist networks dry up their                financial support and prevent them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction The                goal was the elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life                        PHASE TWO AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ            President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Husseins                regime might have had a hand in it Iraq had been an enemy of the United States for                 years and was the only place in the world where the United States was engaged in                ongoing combat operations As a former pilot the President was struck by the                apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting especially                Hanjours highspeed dive into the Pentagon He told us he recalled Iraqi support                for Palestinian suicide terrorists as well Speculating about other possible states                that could be involved the President told us he also thought about Iran                        Clarke has written that on the evening of September  President Bush told him and                some of his staff to explore possible Iraqi links to  See if Saddam did this                Clarke recalls the President telling them See if hes linked in any way While he believed the details of Clarkes account to be                incorrect President Bush acknowledged that he might well have spoken to Clarke at                some point asking him about Iraq                        Responding to a presidential tasking Clarkes office sent a memo to Rice on                September  titled Survey of Intelligence Information on Any Iraq Involvement in                the September  Attacks Rices chief staffer on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad                concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked Iraq to al                Qaeda The memo found no compelling case that Iraq had either planned or                perpetrated the attacks It passed along a few foreign intelligence reports                including the Czech report alleging an April  Prague meeting between Atta and an                Iraqi intelligence officer discussed in chapter  and a Polish report that                personnel at the headquarters of Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad were told before                September  to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event                Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak the memo pointed                out that Bin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Husseins regime Finally the                memo said there was no confirmed reporting on Saddam cooperating with Bin Ladin on                unconventional weapons                        On the afternoon of  according to contemporaneous notes Secretary Rumsfeld                instructed General Myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible The                notes indicate that he also told Myers that he was not simply interested in striking                empty training sites He thought the US response should consider a wide range of                options and possibilities The secretary said his instinct was to hit Saddam Hussein                at the same timenot only Bin Ladin Secretary Rumsfeld later explained that at the                time he had been considering either one of them or perhaps someone else as the                responsible party                        According to Rice the issue of what if anything to do about Iraq was really                engaged at Camp David Briefing papers on Iraq along with many others were in                briefing materials for the participants Rice told us the administration was                concerned that Iraq would take advantage of the  attacks She recalled that in                the first Camp David session chaired by the President Rumsfeld asked what the                administration should do about Iraq Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the case for                striking Iraq during this round of the war on terrorism                        A Defense Department paper for the Camp David briefing book on the strategic concept                for the war on terrorism specified three priority targets for initial action al                Qaeda theTaliban and Iraq It argued that of the three al Qaeda and Iraq posed a                strategic threat to the United States Iraqs longstanding involvement in terrorism                was cited along with its interest in weapons of mass destruction                        Secretary Powell recalled that Wolfowitznot Rumsfeldargued that Iraq was ultimately                the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked                        Powell said that Wolfowitz was not able to justify his belief that Iraq was behind                 Paul was always of the view that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt                with Powell told us And he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to                deal with the Iraq problem Powell said that President Bush did not give                Wolfowitzs argument much weight Though continuing to                worry about Iraq in the following week Powell said President Bush saw Afghanistan                as the priority                        President Bush told Bob Woodward that the decision not to invade Iraq was made at the                morning session on September  Iraq was not even on the table during the September                 afternoon session which dealt solely with Afghanistan                        Rice said that when President Bush called her on Sunday September  he said the                focus would be on Afghanistan although he still wanted plans for Iraq should the                country take some action or the administration eventually determine that it had been                involved in the  attacks                        At the September  NSC meeting there was some further discussion of phase two of                the war on terrorism                        President Bush ordered the Defense Department to be ready to deal with Iraq if                Baghdad acted against US interests with plans to include possibly occupying Iraqi                oil fields                        Within the Pentagon Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz continued to press the case for                dealing with Iraq Writing to Rumsfeld on September  in a memo headlined                Preventing More Eventshe argued that if there was even a  percent chance that                Saddam Hussein was behind the  attack maximum priority should be placed on                eliminating that threat Wolfowitz contended that the odds were far more than  in                 citing Saddams praise for the attack his long record of involvement in                terrorism and theories that Ramzi Yousef was an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the                 attack on the World Trade Center  The next day Wolfowitz renewed the                argument writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef s coconspirator in the                 Manila air plot in crashing an explosivesladen plane into CIA headquarters                and about information from a foreign government regarding Iraqis involvement in the                attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight Given this background he wondered why so                little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots seeing a failure                of imagination and a mindset that dismissed possibilities                        On September  Rumsfeld offered several thoughts for his commanders as they worked                on their contingency plans Though he emphasized the worldwide nature of the                conflict the references to specific enemies or regions named only the Taliban al                Qaeda and Afghanistan                        Shelton told us the administration reviewed all the Pentagons war plans and                challenged certain assumptions underlying them as any prudent organization or                leader should do                        General Tommy Franks the commanding general of Central Command recalled receiving                Rumsfelds guidance that each regional commander should assess what these plans                meant for his area of responsibility He knew he would soon be striking the Taliban                and al Qaeda in Afghanistan But he told us he now wondered how that action was                connected to what might need to be done in Somalia Yemen or Iraq                        On September  President Bush met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the                two leaders discussed the global conflict ahead When Blair asked about Iraq the                President replied that Iraq was not the immediate problem Some members of his                administration he commented had expressed a different view but he was the one                responsible for making the decisions                        Franks told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning on                military responses in Iraq during the summer before a request President Bush                denied arguing that the time was not right CENTCOM also began dusting off plans                for a full invasion of Iraq during this period Franks said The CENTCOM commander                told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to Iraqi                moves shortly after  both because he personally felt that Iraq and al Qaeda                might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that Saddam might                take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern                or southern parts of Iraq where the United States was flying regular missions to                enforce Iraqi nofly zones Franks said that President Bush again turned down the                    request                        Having issued directives to guide his administrations preparations for war on                Thursday September  President Bush addressed the nation before a joint session                of Congress Tonight he said we are a country awakened to danger The President blamed al Qaeda for  and the                 embassy bombings and for the first time declared that al Qaeda was responsible                for bombing the USS Cole He reiterated the ultimatum                that had already been conveyed privately The Taliban must act and act                immediately he said They will hand over the terrorists or they will share in                their fate The President added that Americas quarrel                was not with Islam The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends it is not                our many Arab friends Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every                government that supports them Other regimes faced hard choices he pointed out                Every nation in every region now has a decision to make Either you are with us                or you are with the terrorists                        President Bush argued that the new war went beyond Bin Ladin Our war on terror                begins with al Qaeda but it does not end there he said It will not end until                every terrorist group of global reach has been found stopped and defeated The                President had a message for the PentagonThe hour is coming when America will act                and you will make us proud He also had a message for those outside the United                States This is civilizations fight he said We ask every nation to join                    us                        President Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with Central                Commands General Franks and other advisers on September  and October                 Originally titled Infinite Justice the operations code word was changedto avoid                the sensibilities of Muslims who associate the power of infinite justice with God                aloneto the operational name still used for operations in AfghanistanEnduring                    Freedom                        The plan had four phases                            In Phase One the United States and its allies would move forces into the                    region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring countries such as                    Uzbekistan and Pakistan This occurred in the weeks following  aided by                    overwhelming international sympathy for the United States                In Phase Two air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al                    Qaeda and Taliban targets In an innovative joint effort CIA and Special                    Operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major Afghan                    faction opposed to the Taliban The Phase Two strikes and raids began on October                     The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially                    securedafter arduous effortby the end of that month                In Phase Three the United States would carry out decisive operations using                    all elements of national power including ground troops to topple the Taliban                    regime and eliminate al Qaedas sanctuary in Afghanistan MazareSharif in                    northern Afghanistan fell to a coalition assault by Afghan and US forces on                    November  Four days later the Taliban had fled from Kabul By early December                    all major cities had fallen to the coalition On December  Hamid Karzai a                    Pashtun leader from Kandahar was installed as the chairman of Afghanistans                    interim administration Afghanistan had been liberated from the rule of the                    Taliban                        In December  Afghan forces with limited US support engaged al Qaeda elements                in a cave complex called Tora Bora In March  the largest engagement of the war                was fought in the mountainous ShahiKot area south of Gardez against a large                force of al Qaeda jihadists The threeweek battle was substantially successful and                almost all remaining al Qaeda forces took refuge in Pakistans equally mountainous                and lightly governed frontier provinces As of July  Bin Ladin and Zawahiri are                still believed to be at large                            In Phase Four civilian and military operations turned to the indefinite task                    of what the armed forces call security and stability operations                        Within about two months of the start of combat operations several hundred CIA                operatives and Special Forces soldiers backed by the striking power of US                aircraft and a much larger infrastructure of intelligence and support efforts had                combined with Afghan militias and a small number of other coalition soldiers to                destroy theTaliban regime and disrupt al Qaeda They had killed or captured about a                quarter of the enemys known leaders Mohammed Atef al Qaedas military commander                and a principal figure in the  plot had been killed by a US air strike                According to a senior CIA officer who helped devise the overall strategy the CIA                provided intelligence experience cash covert action capabilities and entre to                tribal allies In turn the US military offered combat expertise firepower                logistics and communications                        With these initial victories won by the middle of  the global conflict against                Islamist terrorism became a different kind of struggle
