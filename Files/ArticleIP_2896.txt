                                 Where Have You Gone Oscar Hammerstein            The subtitle of GeoffreyBlocks new book tells you the whole story Enchanted Evenings The BroadwayMusical From Show Boat to Sondheim  For some of us thats notprogress In  years what was once the mighty Mississippi of American popularculture an ol man river that seemed set to jes keep rollin along foreverhas shriveled away to one toxic little stream on a dry barren mud flat Youcan measure the difference between Show Boat and Sondheim in a thousandways but a Los Angeles Times column earlier this year is as good a wayas any Defending the cause of Ebonics Professor Ron Emmons of Los AngelesCity College asserts among other fancies that Black English is in Negrospirituals Dat Ole Man River Ah Got Shoes            Ol ManRiver is not a Negro spiritual Its a show tune cooked up in  by a coupleof middleclass honkies who needed something for a spot in the first act YesOscar Hammersteins lyric is full of dat and dese obviously he wasselftaught at Ebonics but funnily enough when Paul Robeson sang the song inthe London production of Show Boat in  the biggest problem he hadwas wrapping his beautiful impeccable vowels around the soidisantdialect lyric Ever since most black singers have preferred to singThat Ol Man River If I were a sweating stevedore on the levee out byLos Angeles City College it would be sorely tempting to mock theprofessor            Ol manEmmonsDat ol man EmmonsHe mus know sumpinHe don check nothin            But in a way he has a point albeit not the one he thinkshes making Hammersteins is an unobtrusive craft an artless art Ol ManRiver was the song in which he first found his lyrical voice compressing thesuffering resignation and anger of an entire race into  taut lines anddoing it so naturally that its no wonder folks assume the songs a Negrospiritual If its any consolation to Emmons Hammersteins very last lyricEdelweiss from The Sound of Music  is invariably assumed to be a realAustrian folk songindeed a few years back the White House went furtherplaying it at a state banquet for the Austrian president under the impressionthat it was the countrys national anthem The great strength of these songsone of the reasons they seep into our collective consciousness is that theybarely seem written at all            GeoffreyBlock professor of music at the University of Puget Sound School of Music inTacoma Wash is determined to change all that Enchanted Evenings isless concerned with enchantment than with the painstaking artistic judgmentsthat lead to it So here he is getting stuck in to Show Boat             In thethricerepeated opening phrase of Wheres the Mate for Me the first shown inExample a Who cares if my boat goes up stream and two statements of Idrift along with my fancy Kern ingeniously varies the harmony of the finalmelodic note D Example b and c Its first appearance on the wordsupstream the third measure is paradoxically the lowest note of thephraseafter all the point is that Ravenal does not care whether he is goingupstream or downstream Here Kern harmonizes the tonic or central key D witha conventional tonic Dmajor triad In the third measure of the next statementExample b Kern sets the word fancy with a fancy and deceptiveresolution to a minor triad on the sixth degree of the scale On the finalstatement of this phrase Example c moments before Ravenal hearsMagnolias piano theme and Kern displays his fanciest chord again on the wordfancy            Ah they dont write em like that anymoreTheres only one problem with Blocks approach Thats not how it happened In percent of his songs Jerome Kerns music was written before the words andhe was notorious for declining to accommodate his lyricistsno extra notes sothat an ingenious word might be made to fit and certainly no concessions toliteral meaning in his melody or harmony He didnt set the word fancy atall and that fanciest chord was there long before Hammerstein fixed the wordsto those notes Its possible that Hammerstein coming upon the lowest note ofthe phrase thought Hey Ill write upstream there Hows that for aparadox but I doubt it Thats not the way the ear hears music andHammerstein was too sensitive a lyricist to be so numbingly literal HerbertKretzmer one of the lyricists of Les Misrables  put it to me this wayIts a question of finding what Johnny Mercer called the sound of themusic Youre trying to capture something as elusive as a sound which suggestsa word from which eventually a complete lyric emerges            Still you cant blame Blockfor trying Hes coming at it from the conservatory end of things and ifyoure used to opera the union of words and music in American song must takeyour breath away Operas have plots and lyrics But the words have norelationship to the music Or to put it the other way round the music takesno account of the words                              La donna  mobile  The worst Tin Pan Alley hack wouldnt giveso much weight to the definite article because hed know it was the mostinsignificant word in the line But Verdi He couldnt give a hoot Insofar ashe gives the lyrics a thought its only to say Stand well back boys Imflyin            Good musicals are both specific and universal But theyrespecific because the words fit the shape of the tune not because the tune is atranslation of the wordsthe method Block appears to favor Here he isbanging on with his upstreamdownstream high notelow note approach again            InYoure the Top Porter does not capitalize on the texts potential forrealism Although the I always appears in the bottom throughout most of thesong the you blithely moves back and forth from top to bottom The upwardleaping orchestral figure anticipates the word top but the sung line doesnot and at the punchline But if Baby Im the bottom  Youre the top bothBilly and Reno Im and Youre share a melodic line at the top of theirrespective ranges            Phew That entire paragraph deserves a rousing chorus ofYoure the Pits With his fixation on tops and bottoms Blocks beginning tosound like the gay personal ads in the Village Voice Unlike Kern withhis top paradoxically on his bottom poor old Porter gets no credit for havinghis bottom paradoxically on his top Blocks so busy following the vocal scorethat hes not hearing the song For nonmusicologists that upward leapingorchestral figure he mentions is the bit that goes            Plinkplink Youre the top            Plinkplinkettyplinkplink Youre the Coliseum             Not onlyis Youre the Top one of the few songs where the little orchestral fillinsare an intrinsic part of the song but more than that the fillins actuallyare the song The sung bits paradoxically are the fillinslittleconversational lyric phrases that fall in the gaps between theplinkettyplinks If you know that good for you if you dont it doesntmatter But how could you sit down and analyze the thing and fail to notice itAs to the bottoms winding up on top as a selfcontained composerlyricistPorter knew enough to let a good strong lyricthrust set itself How couldBlock be so Blockheaded as to think that But if Baby Im the bottom Yourethe top could possibly be improved by putting Im and bottom on low notesIts the relative musical monotony of the phrase that makes it so insistentso driving and such a brilliantly effective cap to the song Its the punchline its the exclamation point How sad that Block for all his technicalability cant hear that            So maybe were better off with ol man Emmons and the WhiteHouse misattributing Hammersteins work to dirtpoor cotton pickers and lonelygoatherds than with Blocks misguided praise In great popular art after allyou notice the art not the artist Which brings us to Blocks final chapterStephen Sondheim One reason Ol Man River is a powerful memorable lyric isthat theres no rhyme until the eighth and  th lines Hammersteinrhymes when the song requires ita lesson his pupil Sondheim has forgottenIn Into the Woods  the mother of Jack as in the beanstalk tells herson to sell the family cow because            Weve no time to sit anddither            While herwithers wither with her            Were backto the preHammerstein era youre distanced from the character because all youcan hear is the voice of the author Sondheim has given us plotless musicals Company  and characterless musicals  Pacific Overtures  andpointillist musicals  Sunday in the Park With George  and musicals thatgo backward  Merrily We Roll Along  but for all the supposed range anddepth and variety what you mainly notice about these musicals is SondheimIts the triumph of the artist over the art the man who knows more than anyoneelse about musicals except how to write one where you dont notice how much heknows the one subject who repays Blocks analytical approach if only becausethat seems his natural home I think of Good Thing Going his wonderfullybrooding ballad from Merrily  with its expert title resolution            We had a good thing going            Going             Gone            And with Sondheim itis gone
