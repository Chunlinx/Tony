                    Background        Proteins recognizing specific DNA sequences play an        important role in the regulation of gene expression and in        DNA replication Nearly all eukaryotic genes transcribed by        RNA Polymerase II for instance contain the conserved TATA        box which is present upstream of the transcription start        site The TATAbox binding protein a  kDa component of        the TFIID complex binds specifically to the heptanucleotide        A and T residues    and forms the core of the        transcription initiation complex Additionally many        specific transcription factors bind to the upstream        promoter in a sequence specific manner and regulate gene        expression For example in         Drosophila  a heatshock        transcription factor HSTF can bind to consensus        heatshock response elements    and regulates expression        of heatstress inducible genes Promoter activity in later        branching eukaryotes is greatly modulated by enhancer and        repressor sequences which have no activity of their own but        are the targets of DNA biding proteins or protein complexes        which can remodel the promoter chromatin to make it more or        less accessible to RNA polymerase Biochemical assays have        shown that the action of ATPdependent chromatin        remodelling activities increase the accessibility of DNA        within chromatin templates         S cerevisiae SWISNF     Ino        complex             Drosophila NURF    are examples of        some high molecular weight chromatin remodelling factors        which can facilitate transcription by binding to        chromatinized DNA templates However none of the above        chromatin remodelling factors binds to specific DNA        sequences        Unlike transcription the role of sequence specific DNA        binding proteins in eukaryotic DNA replication is not well        characterized In higher eukaryotes finding of specific DNA        sequences essential for DNA replication has been elusive so        far In yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae  a        sixprotein origin recognition complex binds to ARS        consensus sequence ACS in a sequence specific manner            Individual ORC subunits have not been demonstrated to        show DNA binding activity         in vitro  Recently in an         in vitro study ScCdc has been shown        to bind double stranded DNA     The minimal requirement        for the binding of Cdc to DNA has been mapped within its        Nterminal amino acid sequence         Saccharomyces pombe ORC subunit has        been reported to contain DNA binding activity by using its        Nterminal AT hook region     Neither ScCdc nor SpORC        showed any sequence specific DNA binding activity        Recombinant six protein         Drosophila ORC DmORC binds to ACE        region of the         Drosophila chorion gene             In vivo  DmORC colocalized with the        amplified chorion gene locus In Xenopus biochemical        analysis of replication and cell cycle events using egg        extracts has helped to understand the mechanism of        eukaryotic DNA replication     However two        dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of the rDNA locus        showed that replication initiated at all sites tested            All six human homologs of yeast and         Drosophila ORC subunits have been        cloned and characterized      Other replication        proteins like Cdc Cdt MCMs Cdc that are essential        for initiation of DNA replication have also been reported            Conservation of replication factors among higher        eukaryotes suggests that functionally they may play similar        roles        In an attempt to identify DNA binding activity of human        Cdc it was expressed and purified as a GSTCdc fusion        protein from baculovirus infected Sf insect cells        Partially purified fractions reduced glutathione eluate        containing GSTCdc or GST showed an ACS binding activity in        an ATP dependent manner The GSTCdc protein fraction        contained both the GSTCdc and a  KDa         S frugiperda protein The DNA        binding activity was confined to a  kDa polypeptide It        was latter found that the p has an intrinsic affinity to        GST This polypeptide bound to yeast ACS like elements in        the presence of ATP  matches to ARS consensus sequence        were found to be essential for this DNA binding activity        both by gel shift assay as well as by in vitro foot        printing assay A DNA fragment containing  matches from        human cmyc replication origin region also showed p        binding activity suggesting that this polypeptide has        intrinsic DNA binding activity The implications of this        DNA binding activity are discussed here                    Results                  Partially purified protein fractions containing          GSTCdc or GST contain an ACS binding activity          We infected Sf insect cells with the baculovirus          expressing GSTCdc Cells were harvested  hours post          infection and the proteins were extracted according to          the procedures described in materials and methods The          GSTCdc protein was partially purified by pull down on          glutathione beads Fig A The partially purified          protein was used in DNA binding assays with a  bp DNA          fragment containing all three conserved boxes A B and          B of the ARS consensus sequences Fig A B As          a control we used GST alone which was purified using          the same strategy used for GSTCdc purification A DNA          protein complex was formed in both the cases as evidenced          by the retarded mobility of the free P phosphate          labelled probe Fig B The specificity of the DNA          binding was examined in a competition reaction by          increasing the amount of unlabeled DNA fragment          containing ACS like elements It was determined that the          DNAProtein complex could be competed efficiently by          increasing amount of unlabelled ACS like DNA             and  respectively Fig  A  bp DNA          fragment from pBlueScript KS            Hin fI digested and subsequently          gel purified of similar base composition did not compete          with the complex formation in the Electrophoretic          Mobility Shift Assay when added at a similar          concentration indicating a degree of specificity in the          DNAProtein complex formation Fig                           An unidentified  kDa protein from baculovirus          infected insect cells is responsible for DNA binding          activity          Partially purified fractions containing GSTCdc or GST          showed DNA binding activity To further fractionate the          proteins present in the partially purified GSTCdc          fraction the glutathione column was washed with  mM          and  mM sodium chloride prior to GSTCdc elution with          reduced glutathione Western blot analysis using anti GST          antibodies Fig A revealed that neither  mM nor           mM fractions contained GSTCdc Fig A GSTCdc protein          was present only in the proteins eluted by reduced          glutathione Proteins released by different salt          fractionation were separated on an SDSPAGE and          visualized by silver stain Figure B A prominent band          of molecular mass  kDa was visualised both in the           mM and  mM salt eluate          To check whether the DNA binding activity was due to          the presence of  kDa band or GSTCdc itself gel shift          assays were performed either using  ng  kDa protein          obtained from the salt wash or GSTCdc by itself Fig          C Salt eluate gave a strong band shift which was          identical with the band shift found with GSTCdc found in          Fig  GSTCdc eluted from the beads following high salt          wash failed to give any band shift suggesting that the           kDa polypeptide was responsible for the DNA binding          activity          To further test whether the presence of p is          absolutely required for DNA binding activity the  mM          salt eluate was dialysed against low salt buffer H          and then passed through Superose  gel filtration          column Each fraction was checked for DNA binding          activity by gel retardation assay using a P labelled          DNA fragment containing ACS elements DNA binding          activity was found only in high molecular weight fraction           kDa Fig A Proteins present in the gel          filtration fractions in the high molecular weight range          fractions  were separated by SDSPAGE followed by          silver stain Surprisingly p was found to be present          only in the fraction  which contains the DNA binding          activity Fig B The presence of p in the same          fraction containing the DNA binding activity strongly          suggests that p is responsible for the binding          activity                          DNA binding activity is ATP dependent          One of the hallmarks of yeast ORC binding to yeast ARS          consensus sequences is its ATP dependence     We were          interested to see whether the DNA binding activity of the           kDa protein is ATP dependent or not Gel shift assays          were performed either in the absence or in the presence          of increasing amount of ATP in the reaction mixture Fig           In the absence of ATP a very weak binding was          observed whereas with increasing amount of ATP strong          binding was detected There is a threshold of ATP          concentration  mM and onwards which stimulated the          binding remarkably A nonhydrolysable ATP analog ATPS          was used in the binding reaction to see whether ATP          hydrolysis is required for this binding With increasing          amount of ATPS the band shift was completely inhibited          suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is required for this DNA          binding activity This was confirmed by adding ATP back          in the reaction mixture when ATPS was already present in          the reaction Under these reaction conditions increasing          amount of ATP again stimulated the DNA binding activity          even in the presence of ATPS suggesting that ATPS can          be competed with ATP and it is the ATP hydrolysis which          is essential for this DNA binding activity Fig  lanes           and                           p binds to A B and B boxes of ARS consensus          sequences as revealed by footprinting assay          After establishing the fact that a protein of          approximately  kDa binds to DNA fragment containing ARS          consensus sequences the exact site of binding of the          protein on the DNA was mapped by copperphenanthroline          footprinting assay Unlike DNaseI          phenanthrolinecuprous complex is a small chemical          probe which can demark the boundaries of the protected          region clearly The protein was bound to a  P          labelled  bp DNA fragment containing yeast ARS          consensus sequence and separated from the free DNA by gel          shift assay The gel was then treated with          copperphenanthroline reagent as described in materials          and methods The bound and unbound DNA was purified and          allowed to run in a sequencing gel Fig  On the          Trich strand bottom strand two protected regions were          observed The first region entirely covered the A box of          the ARS consensus sequence and the second region covered          the overlapping regions of B and B Therefore the           kDa protein has a strong affinity to bind to A B and B          boxes of the ARS consensus sequences The long stretch of          protection could be due to multimeric form of p or          could be due to the formation of a higher order          nucleoprotein complex                          p binds to A B and B boxes and mutation in          these boxes abolish DNA binding activity          Previous studies of the structure of ARS in both          plasmid and chromosome contexts have shown that it          contains one essential DNA element A that includes a          perfect  match to the ARS consensus sequence ACS          Fig A and three additional elements B B and B          with  out of  bases match to the ACS that are also          important for ARS function     We were interested to          see whether A B and B boxes were sufficient to allow          p binding activity We used the pN protein N          terminal  bases of coding region of p    as a          control This DNA when incubated with  kDa protein          does not form a DNA protein complex Fig D The DNA          fragment was divided into four subfragments a b c and          d Fig B and subcloned in the middle of pN fragment          Fragment a does not contain any ACS sequence whereas          fragments b c and d contain at least one ACS like          element All the ACS containing sub fragments b c d          showed a mobility shift Fig D which suggests that at          least one ACS like element either  match or           match to ARS consensus sequence is essential and          sufficient for p binding activity This was further          confirmed by using a subfragment d mutated at the ACS          motif Fig C Subfragment d as shown if Fig Dlane           can bind strongly to the  kDa protein however mutation          altering the A and Ts of the core ACS sequence to G and          Cs Fig C to generate the dmut oligonucleotide results          in the abolition of its ability to bind p Therefore          the ACS sequence is essential for the pDNA protein          complex formation                           kDa polypeptide binds to ARS consensus sequence          found in cmyc origin of replication          In           S cerevisiae  ARS elements have          been implicated to be important both for ORC binding and          origin function     We looked for the availability of          such sequences in known human origins of replication like          cmyc lamin beta  and Dnmt An origin of replication          was mapped previously by nascent strand abundance          analysis within  kb zone immediately upstream of cmyc          gene     Detailed analysis of the  kb upstream          sequences revealed the presence of two ACS like elements          separated by  nucleotides AAAAGATAAAG and          AAAAGAAAAAA A  bp DNA fragment containing both the          ACS elements was amplified by polymerase chain reaction          and the product was used subsequently for p binding          studies          A strong band shift was observed Fig  which could          be competed out using a  bp long double stranded oligo          containing two ACS like elements oligo b Fig B          Increasing amount of  bp long unrelated non specific          double stranded oligo did not have any effect on this          binding activity suggesting that binding of p to cmyc          origin region is specific Interestingly analysis of          Lamin beta  origin of replication region also revealed          the presence of two ACS  match like elements              Further studies are required to find out whether p          also binds to lamin beta  origin region                          pACS interaction is sensitive to high salt          temperature and EDTA          The stability of pACS DNA complex was further          tested either by changing NaCl concentration in the          reaction mixture or by shifting reaction temperature or          by adding EDTA The DNA binding activity was found to be          sensitive to NaCl concentration Fig  Strong band          shift was obtained up to  M NaCl NaCl concentration          at  M and above completely inhibited the binding          activity Higher temperature also showed a drastic effect          on the binding activity Normal DNA binding activity was          observed up to C Temperature higher than C          completely abolished the binding activity suggesting that          the off rate of p from DNA is much faster at higher          temperature Finally inclusion of EDTA in the reaction          mixture inhibited the binding reaction suggesting that          the divalent cations are essential for this binding          activity                            Discussion        Few proteins have been reported in the literature which        are capable of binding to DNA in a sequence specific ATP        dependent manner Although transcription factors bind to        specific DNA sequences the binding activity is not        dependent on ATP hydrolysis In contrast chromatin        remodelling factors like SWISNF ISW BRG facilitate        transcription from chromatinised templates in the presence        of ATP     However these factors do not bind to        specific DNA sequences In eukaryotic DNA replication        sequence specific ATP dependent DNA binding activity has        been demonstrated in yeast         S cerevisiae where ORC a six        polypeptide complex binds to yeast ARS consensus sequence        in an ATP dependent manner     The binding sites for        other ORCs are not very clear at present DmORC binds the        critical elements of wellcharacterized chromosome III        amplification domain ACE and ori though the precise        sequence recognized by DmORC within ACE and ori have not        been identified     Studies of both ScORC    and        DmORC    indicate the ATP binding by Orcp is required        for DNA binding However ATP hydrolysis is not required for        DNA binding for both the cases suggesting that ATP        hydrolysis may be required for further downstream        processes Chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP studies        have demonstrated the association of SpORC with         S pombe origins    and human ORC        with the EBV         Ori P       Whether ORC        binds to these sequences directly or indirectly with the        help of other proteins are subject to in vitro DNA binding        assays using purified ORC proteins        In this study we report a  kDa protein from the        baculovirus infected Sf insect cells that binds to yeast        ACS sequences in an ATP dependent fashion p was purified        as high salt  mM NaCl eluate from the GSTCdc beads        GSTCdc eluted from the beads following high salt wash        failed to show any DNA binding activity Fig C whereas        high salt eluate containing only p showed strong DNA        binding activity suggesting that p not Cdc is        responsible for the binding activity This experiment was        repeated several times and always the protein preparations        containing p showed DNA binding activity        p has an intrinsic affinity to GST moieties Sf        insect cells were infected with baculovirus expressing GST        alone The cell lysate was allowed to bind to GST beads        High salt eluate  mM NaCl from GST beads was tested        for DNA binding activity Surprisingly we observed a very        similar band shift as obtained previously using high salt        eluate from GSTCdc data not shown Further high salt        eluate from GSTORC and GSTORC GST fusion protein        containing human origin recognition complex subunit  and         respectively also showed DNA binding activity data not        shown Therefore it can be concluded that p interacts        with GST and high salt concentration is required to disrupt        this interaction The nature and the specificity of the        interaction between GST and p are not clear at this        moment It is important to note that majority of the p        bound to GST or GST fusion proteins are released mostly at        high salt concentration  mM allowing us to get rid of        most of the impurities by stringent washing of the GST        beads with buffer containing  mM NaCl        A weak DNA binding activity was found till  mM ATP        concentration Fig  A strong stimulation was obtained        at  mM ATP concentration It is possible that p is        purified as ATP bound form but an associated weak ATPase        activity does not allow it to give a strong binding        activity It is suggested that  mM ATP concentration may        be sufficient to overcome this inhibitory effect ATP        hydrolysis is essential for DNA binding activity of p        since ATP S a nonhydrolysable analog of ATP completely        inhibited the binding activity Fig  It is possible        that ATP is required for strand opening which needs to be        further explored An insect cell factor polyhedrin        promoter binding protein has been reported previously        capable of binding to AT rich DNA sequence            However the reported DNA binding activity was unusual in a        sense that the activity was heat and salt concentration        resistant  mM EDTA concentration did not affect the DNA        binding activity The DNA binding activity reported in this        study was found to be temperature EDTA and salt        concentration sensitive Fig  suggesting that this        polypeptide is completely different from the polyhedrin        promoter binding protein        p showed a strong DNA binding affinity towards ACS        like elements This was confirmed first by using unlabeled        specific competitor DNA which completely abolished the        binding of P labelled probe Competition using unrelated        DNA did not affect the DNA binding activity We took pN        which normally does not bind to p to further test the        binding specificity Introduction of a single ACS like        element  match in pN ARSc and ARSd showed a        strong band shift Fig D suggesting that only one ACS        like element is sufficient for p binding This was        further confirmed by making mutations in the ARSd fragment        The resulting ARSdmut did not show any p binding activity        suggesting that the ACS like element itself but not the        adjacent sequences are essential for the p binding        activity However a systematic mutational analysis of ACS        like elements will be required to explore the exact binding        specificity of p towards ACS like elements ACS elements        are normally AT rich However p did not bind to random        AT rich sequences p did not bind to pN  ARSa which        contains ARSa oligo  AT rich with no ACS like element        Surprisingly p showed strong binding activity in the        presence of the oligo ARSb  AT rich ARSc  AT        rich and ARSd  AT rich respectively Figure D        ARSb c and d contain at least one ACS like element Fig        B Finally the copper phenanthroline footprint analysis        confirmed that p binds to A and BB boxes of the ARS        DNA fragment At this moment the function of p is not        very clear It may play major roles in the transcription        of certain insect cell genes It may as well be responsible        for DNA replication The fact that it binds to yeast ACS        and to a DNA fragment from cmyc origin of replication        region containing yeast ACS like elements in an ATP        dependent manner further strengthen the hypothesis         S cerevisiae origin recognition        complex ORC binds to ARS consensus sequences in an ATP        dependent fashion and this binding is essential for both        origin function and activity It is interesting to note        that a huge six protein origin recognition complex binds to        yeast ARS whereas p a small protein is showing same        kind of protection as evidenced by foot print analysis        Fig  We believe that p forms an oligomeric structure        or it maintains a multimeric form which may explain the        wide footprint over the ARS fragment The presence of p        in high molecular weight fraction  kDa following        superose  gel filtration chromatography strengthen this        hypothesis and clearly suggests that p forms an        oligomeric structure        ARS consensus sequence has been found near the vicinity        of cmyc lamin beta  and Dnmt replication origin            Therefore Identification and characterization of this        protein from insect cells and finding its human counterpart        will greatly help in elucidating its possible function in        DNA replication                    Conclusions        The data presented here leads to the identification and        characterization of a polypeptide from insect cells with        ATP dependent DNA binding activity This is an important        and unique observation In         S cerevisiae  ACS elements have        been reported to be essential for ORC binding and        replication initiation Yeast ACS like elements found in        cmyc and lamin beta  origin region may play similar roles        in replication initiation However it is also possible        that p is a transcription factor which may facilitate        transcription of some insect cell genes Further        characterization of p from insect cells and finding its        human homolog will be very helpful to dissect its        functional role in replication andor transcription                    Materials
