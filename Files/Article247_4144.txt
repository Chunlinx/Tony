                                 George Ws Smirk A Chatterbox Investigation            George W Bushs smirk has become a hot political story On CSpan BillKristol revealed that Bushs funny little grin almost a smirk that comesacross his face occasionally at inappropriate times had occasioned perplexeddiscussion among staffers at the cuttingedgeconservative WeeklyStandard  which Kristol edits Brian Williams and the Boston Globe sDavid Nyhan also noted the Smirk Problem on MSNBC and CNN respectivelyprompting a superbly detailed Dec  article by the Wall StreetJournal s Jackie Calmes Calmes described the following eerie scene                                             At a campaign stop in Dubuque Iowa Mr Bush toured a Christianpregnancycounseling center to promote his antiabortion views and support forfaithbased social services As he sat at a table with two female workersthere he continuously wore a sort of smile as he listened to each woman Oneof the women a counselor for postabortion trauma told how she had becomepregnant at  helplessly felt she had no alternative but abortion and for years  suffered in silence Still the right side of Mr Bushs mouthseemed frozen in a half smile                                       The smirk resurfaced at last weeks New Hampshire debate according toThe New Yorker s Joe Klein who in the Dec  issue writes thatBush                                             will squinny his eyes raise his chin lift an eyebrow and curl his lipslightlyhis face seems to be involved in a somewhat painfulquasiinvoluntary struggle to prevent itself from erupting into a broadselfsatisfied smile This facial skirmish is often accompanied by a slightforward bend at the waist and a whatmeworry shrug and they often occurafter the Governor has delivered a line particularly well or thinks hehas                                       The smirk is causing much justifiable worry in Republican circles I hearsome saying that his friendly outgoing personality on TV is mistaken for asmirk and smugness a senior Republican official was quoted as saying in theDec  Boston Globe  A few have said to me He has tomake sure that charm is not mistaken for arrogance Presumably Bush himselfgot the message his smirk was not much in evidence at this weeks Arizonadebate Click here to see for yourself            Clearly though the smirk will return and when it does politicalspinmeisters will try to define it away as an image problem a mere matter offaulty subjective analysis by pundits and voters A far more interestingquestion than how Bushs smirk is interpreted  however is What does itmean  Calmes quotes CSpans Brian Lamb as saying in effect that itsjust a cruel trick of genetic physiognomy His father has the same thing itsjust not as pronounced as it is with W But since personality is alsoto some extent genetically based and moreover can be passed environmentallyfrom one generation to the nextparticularly when father and son share notonly the same home but also a few institutional influences egAndover and Yaleit is conceivable that the shared smirk signifies ashared  arrogance            Klein quite rightly warns us not to be too hasty in reaching thisconclusion                                             It would be easy to mistake such elaborate body language for arroganceas more than a few observers have whereas the true meaning of the tic may bethe exact opposite It may just signify reliefthat he has successfullymanaged to jump another public hurdle without embarrassing himself Or it maymean nothing at all                                       Concluding that the matter of Bushs smirk was too weighty to be left in thehands of nonscientists Chatterbox emailed Paul Ekmanprofessor of psychology at the University of California at San FranciscoAccording to the Orlando Sentinel Tribune  Ekman is the nationsleading smile researcher His academic writings on how to interpret facialexpressions have been used by lawyers to figure out which potential jurors toeject during voir dire and by gamblers to figure out the giveaway signsof a card players bluff If anyone could explain the meaning of George Wstroubling smirk it was Ekman But Ekman made clear in a response toChatterboxs note that he wouldnt play                                             I watch George W and have many thoughts about it But I have a policyabout never talking about anyone who is in office or running for office or isin litigation So I cant help you I dont know anyone responsible andknowledgeable who can                                       Undaunted Chatterbox marched off to a nearby bookstore and purchasedWhat the Face Reveals Basic and Applied Studies ofSpontaneous Expression Using the Facial Action Coding System FACS edited by Ekman and Erika Rosenberg He then burrowed in for a long read            Chatterbox learned that the science of studying facial expressions isrelatively new Before the s apparently it was deemed a uselessenterprise This consensus changed as a result of work done by Silvan TomkinsEkman and a few others In  for example Ekman and WV Friesen examinedthe facial expressions of Japanese and American students as they watchedstressful films When they watched these films alone the Japanese and theAmericans had similar distressed expressions on their faces When they watchedthese films in the presence of an authority figure however the Americansfacial expressions were essentially the same as when they watched the filmsalone whereas the Japanese showed much less negative affect smiledsometimes and actually masked negative emotion with smiling behaviorConclusion Americans are less guarded in letting facial expressions show whattheyre feeling A reassuring finding in light of the question before us            During the s Ekman developed a method called the Facial ActionCoding System FACS to measure all visually discernible facial movementThe building blocks of FACS are  action units  AUs such as awrinkling of the nose a puffing of the cheeks dilation of the nostrilssquinting and so on These AUs usually identified by the facial muscles thatperform these various tasks are the tools used in What the FaceReveals  To look at a few examples click here andhere            Sadly there is no chapter on smirking per se in Ekman andRosenbergs book In a  report to the National Science Foundation Ekman and severalcoauthors reject the term smirk on the grounds that its too coarse andimprecise ignoring differences between a variety of different muscularactions to which it may refer and mixing description with inferences aboutmeaning or the message which it may convey But there are threechapters in the book that may nonetheless be relevant to the smirkingquestion                           Lets start with a chapter by Ekman and Joseph G Hager titled TheAsymmetry of Facial Actions George Ws smirk is asymmetrical is it not Thechapter describes an experiment in which  righthanded Caucasian women ages to  were exposed to various mildly unpleasant experiences and asked tosmile Then they were asked Now that this is done arent you glad itsover This inspired spontaneous smiles Ekman and Hager found that thesmilesondemand were less symmetrical than the spontaneous smiles This mightmean George Ws apparent smirk is merely a forced smile not a smug ormean or even dishonest one               Another interpretation is suggested in a chapter by Ekman and severalothers titled Type A Behavior Pattern Here the authors argue that thegroup of people most likely to suffer heart attacks are more apt than others toglare and show facial signs of disgust George W doesnt glare much as far asChatterbox can tell but his smirk may be an expression of disgust Ifthats true he would seem to face a heightened risk of heart disease               The most provocative chapter in the book by Ekman Wallace V Friesen andMaureen OSullivan is titled Smiles When Lying According to Ekman Friesenand OSullivan there is a clear distinction between felt happy smiles andmasking smiles intended to hide some other emotion The subject doesntactually have to be telling a lie rather the facial expressionitself is the lie Felt happy smiles are defined as the actionof the zygomatic major lip and orbicularis oculi parslateralis eye muscles Masking smiles use a whole bunch of otherfacial muscles associated with fear disgust contempt sadness and anger Onesuch muscle is the triangularis  which judging from an illustrativephotograph on Page  pulls the corner of the lip down in anexpression that Chatterbox would call  a smirk                        Chatterbox will refrain from endorsing any of these threehypotheses forced smile  susceptibility to heart attack falsity to explain George Ws smirk Rather he calls on Ekman or someother expert to tell us which if any is correct
