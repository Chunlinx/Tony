                                 Hi Fidelity            The Washington Post and New York Timeslead with the likely easing today by the Clinton administration of somerestrictions governing US interactions with Cuba The Wall Street Journal also flags this story in its frontpagenews box USAToday reefers the Cuba story at the bottom of its front while leadingwith the endorsement by new California Governor Gray Davis in his inauguraladdress of a plan to increase diversity in the states university system byadmitting the top  percent of each California high school graduating classThe paper notes that the proposal would counter the effects of Propositionwhich among other things banned affirmative action in state universityadmissionsby raising the numbers of minority students admitted at the expenseapparently of other higherachieving students elsewhere The state Board ofRegents of which Davis is a member could take up the idea next month Thebiggest mystery of the day has to do with the Los AngelesTimes lead which also covers the Davis inaugural The story somehowmanages not to mention the  percent solution Specific policy proposalsexplains the LAT  will be saved for release later in the week            Is this merely faulty reporting or a conscious attempt not to alert themajority of its readers that a law they voted forbut that the LAT isagainstis about to be undone Similar news tailoring seems to be going on atthe WP  which in an inside story on Davis delays until thesecondtolast paragraph word of his  percent plan and never mentions that itthreatens to undo Prop             The main upshot of the Cuba moves say the NYT and WP  is thatCubans would be able to receive more money from American friends and familymembers thered be more direct flights between the two countries and directmail service would be reestablished Additionally the Baltimore Orioles wouldbe allowed to play the Cuban national baseball team once here and once inCuba The papers report that Madeleine Albright recommended the Cuba easeup toPresident Clinton yesterday and that he is expected to announce it today            The papers all note that despite the new measures the Clintonadministration is nonetheless resisting bipartisan calls for a more sweepingopening to Cuba such as dropping the yearold economic embargo altogetherThe WSJ offers a domestic political reason for this continuedintransigence a desire not to hurt Democratic prospects in Florida in the presidential election Thats something Gore can do right after hes electedthe paper quotes a senior White House official as saying            The WP emphasizes the baseball angle a bit more than the others evenworking that detail into its headline US Ready to Play Ball with Cuba TheNYT mentions the Orioles losing record last season leading the readerto wonder why they rather than the World Serieswinning Yankees were tappedfor this bit of diplomacy The Post advances a plausible answer unlikethe Yankees the Orioles dont suit up any Cuban defectors None of the papersmention why baseball may be especially well suited to this particular ireniccause Castro was once a very good pitcher even drafted by the WashingtonSenators            A frontpage WP story reports on the latest impeachment defense thinking at the White House Oneexample according to the Post  The presidents lawyers are planning toargue that when their client denied he had sexual relations with MonicaLewinsky he could have been focusing on the role of intent made relevant bythe definition of sexual relations he was given That definition referred tofondling certain parts of the anatomy with an intent to arouse or gratify thesexual desire of any person and it could be argued that no one has provedthat Clinton had any such intent even if he did in fact touch Lewinsky as shetestified In other words if Clintons earlier position was that he didnthave sex with her this new move is that he didnt have sex with her onpurpose Note that for this to work the presidents lawyers have to argue thatnot only was Clinton not trying to gratify Lewinsky but he wasnt trying togratify himself either Puhhhhleeeeze            The Post front features a story recounting horror tales of domesticservants brought to the DC area by various foreign diplomatic employers andthen treated horribly A separate story inside focuses on one Ethiopian womanstale of working for years without any time off for three cents a day for an IMFstaffer who also beat her A question Before doing these stories did thePost look into whether or not any of its employees are likewiseunderpaying or otherwise mistreating their servants Not to mention makingsure they have proper visas and legitimate Social Security withholdings            The WP TV column reports that Al Franken in preparing a new spate ofshows for his abouttoberesuscitated news spoof Lateline reached out tovarious political types to do some script doctoring For a show having to dowith something called the Moral Coalition for instance Franken got formerChristian Coalition head Ralph Reed to vet the script Reed added two jokesThe NBC censor cut one for being too racy
