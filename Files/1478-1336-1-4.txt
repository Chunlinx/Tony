                    Background        The nuclear receptor NR family comprises         structurally related transcription factors many of which        require their cognate ligand for activity       The        NRs regulate transcription by binding to response elements        in the promoters of target genes and acting as scaffolds        for the assembly of large coactivator and corepressor        complexes     NR coactivators include the ps        including GRIPTIF SRC and AIBACTRpCIP The        ps enhance transcription by binding histone        acetyltransferases such as pCBP and pCAF    and        methyltransferases such as CARM and PRMT    which in        turn enhance transcription by modification of chromatin        Other NR coactivators include TRAP     which is part        of a larger complex TRAPDRIPSMCCmediator that contacts        the basal transcription machinery and PGC     a cold        inducible coactivator that binds CBP and SRC and proteins        involved in RNA processing     NR corepressors include        NR corepressor NCoR and silencing mediator of retinoid        and thyroid responsive transcription SMRT     Both        NCoR and SMRT repress transcription at least in part by        binding to histone deacetylases HDACs either directly or        indirectly through other corepressor complex components        Other known NR corepressors include RIP            Hairless     short heterodimer partner SHP           and DAX     and receptor specific corepressors such as        the estrogen receptor ER interacting proteins REA and        HETSAFB             Generally NR transcriptional activity is dictated by        the balance between coactivator and corepressor        recruitment and one of the most important factors that        influences this balance is the absence or presence of        agonist ligands reviewed in     Unliganded NRs such        as thyroid TRs and retinoid receptors RARs bind        corepressors and ligand promotes release of corepressor        and subsequent binding of coactivators The mechanism of        this coregulator exchange is well understood NRs consist        of three domains the Nterminal domain which contains a        contextspecific activation function AF the central DNA        binding domain DBD and the Cterminal ligand binding        domain LBD which contains a hormonedependent activation        function AF The unliganded LBD recognizes hydrophobic        motifs termed interaction domains IDs which are        reiterated three times in NCoR and twice in SMRT and        conform to the consensus LIXXIIXXXL    see also            By contrast the liganded LBD binds shorter hydrophobic        motifs termed NR boxes that are reiterated several times        within each coactivator and conform to the consensus LXXLL        The LBD utilizes a large hydrophobic cleft composed of        residues along H and H to bind IDs     and a smaller        hydrophobic cleft that is composed of residues in the upper        part of H and H and H and corresponds to AF to bind        NR boxes     Thus agonists promote coregulator        exchange by promoting the packing of H over the lower        part of the ID binding region an event that simultaneously        completes the coactivator binding surface In other cases        however the balance of coactivator and corepressor        recruitment is regulated by direct competition for the AF        surface rather than liganddependent coregulator exchange        RIP Hairless and DAX possess NR boxes that interact        with AF      and these corepressors act as        negative regulators of the activity of the liganded NR        The NR family contains two related ERs ER and ER        that conform to the typical three domain NR structure and        share extensive sequence homology in the DBD and LBD region             Analysis of the function of the individual ERs        in mouse knockout models suggests that the major        proliferative effects of estrogen are mediated by ER and        not by ER which seems to play an inhibitory role in        proliferation in some studies      The        ligandbinding properties of the ERs are different with        ER often exhibiting stronger binding to plantderived        phytoestrogens     More importantly the ERs exhibit        isoformspecific effects on gene expression Both ERs        enhance transcription from genes with classical estrogen        response elements EREs but ER requires less ligand to        obtain maximal activation than ER      Likewise        both ERs suppress the activity of the TNF promoter in        response to estrogens but ER is a more potent repressor        than ER     However some of the most striking        isoformspecific differences in gene regulation are        observed at promoters such as that of cyclin D which        contain AP sites or related cyclic AMP response elements        CREs ER enhances AP activity in response to        estrogens     but ER inhibits AP activity in        response to estrogens       ER also completely        suppresses ER activity at the cyclin D promoter and even        suppresses the activity of an ER mutant that is        selectively superactive at AP sites and CREs            Finally ER shows a unique capacity to enhance AP        activity in response to selective estrogen receptor        modulators SERMs such as raloxifene tamoxifen and ICI        Faslodex ICI       Together these        observations suggest that there are fundamental differences        in the way that the ERs bind unspecified cofactors that        modulate gene expression and that some of these cofactors        must play a role in differential ER activity at AP        sites        Although the poorly conserved NTD region clearly plays        an important role in isoformspecificity      it is        also likely that there are differences in the better        conserved LBD region that contribute to differential ER        and ER activities Phage display techniques have revealed        that ER and ER show different preferences in LXXLL        binding reviewed in      Moreover some cofactors        that contain LXXLL motifs show differential binding to LBDs        of the ER isoforms reviewed in     SHP binds ER        preferentially     and represses ER activity more        strongly than that of ER The PGC related protein PERC        also binds ER preferentially and potentiates ER activity        more strongly than that of ER     We recently        observed that ER binds the Cterminal NR interacting        regions of NCoR and SMRT in the presence of SERMs but not        estrogens     In this study we report that ER        interactions with NCoR and SMRT are promoted by agonists        and inhibited by SERMs Thus the ERs show completely        opposite ligand preferences of interaction with        corepressors We discuss the potential significance of        these different modes of ER interaction with NCoR in terms        of known isoformspecific behaviors                    Results                  Agonist Dependent ER Interactions with NCoR and          SMRT          To investigate ER interactions with corepressors we          examined the interactions of full length ER amino acids           with bacterially expressed Cterminal NR          interacting domain of NCoR amino acids            in vitro Fig A Fig Breveals          surprisingly that ER bound NCoR in the absence of          hormone and in the presence of agonist ligands E DES          and phytoestrogens genistein coumestrol Moreover          these interactions were suppressed by SERMs ICI          raloxifene and tamoxifen ER bound to the coactivator          GRIP more strongly than NCoR but did so with an          identical ligand preference Similar agonistdependent          interactions could be observed between ER and the          alternate NR corepressor SMRT           in vitro Fig C Control binding          experiments performed in parallel confirmed that ER          bound to NCoR in the presence of SERMs and not          estradiol Fig D and that TR bound NCoR in the          absence of hormone and was released in the presence of          T whereas TR only bound GRIP in the presence of T          Fig E          To examine interactions between ER and NCoR in          mammalian cells we performed twohybrid assays using a          GAL DBDNCoR Cterminus fusion protein as bait and a          VPER LBD fusion as the prey Fig shows that the          ERLBD bound NCoR in the presence of agonists and          phytoestrogens but not SERMs Control twohybrid assays          confirmed that a VPTR LBD fusion protein bound NCoR          in the absence of hormone but not in the presence of T          E dependent binding of ER to NCoR was dose dependent          Fig B with an EC  nM that resembled that of          ER binding to the GRIP NR box region amino acids           Thus ER binds the NCoR Cterminal NR          interacting region in the presence of agonists but not          SERMs and does so           in vitro and in mammalian cells          Moreover results from the twohybrid assay indicate that          the ER LBD is sufficient to obtain estrogendependent          interactions with NCoR                          ER Interactions with NCoR are Dependent on AF          and require H          Unliganded NRs usually bind ID motifs consensus          LIXXIIXXXL in the NCoR Cterminus To ask whether ER          might bind these motifs in the presence of estradiol we          examined the ability of peptides containing known NR          interacting motifs to compete for the interaction Fig          A A peptide overlapping to the NCoR ID motif amino          acids  that competes for NCoR binding to          unliganded TR and RAR    failed to compete for          agonistdependent ER interactions with NCoR By          contrast a peptide corresponding to GRIP NR box  did          compete for this interaction      This finding          suggests that agonistbound ER does not recognize ID          motifs and that ER interactions with NCoR more closely          resemble those with GRIP          NR interactions with NCoR are usually mediated by a          hydrophobic cleft that spans residues from H and H and          includes residues that lie under H in the liganded          configuration      These interactions are either          independent of or inhibited by NR H       By          contrast NR interactions with coactivators are mediated          by residues from the upper part of HH and also require          H itself     Fig Bshows that a mutation in a          conserved residue on H that is required for coactivator          binding EK abolished the interaction of ER with          both NCoR and GRIP Moreover other mutations in the          upper part of the HH region that comprises the AF          surface DY IR and KA on H VR and LR on          H abolished ER interaction with both cofactors          Control mutations in other regions of the ER surface          left its interactions with NCoR and GRIP either          slightly reduced or intact these are LR at the base          of H VR in the Sbends MR in H LR TR in          the H and YS in the HH loop Thus ER          interactions with NCoR are dependent on the AF surface          including H and in this regard resemble those of          ER and GRIP                          ER Binds an NR BoxLike Motif in the NCoR          Cterminus          To map the region of NCoR that interacted with ER          we examined ER binding to a series of rationally          designed smaller fragments of the NCoR Cterminus Fig           ER did not bind two of these smaller fragments of          NCoR   that contain known ID motifs          IDs  and      ER bound weakly to two regions of          NCoR   one of which           contains an ID motif ID but did so in a          ligandindependent fashion However ER did bind to a          fragment that spanned the extreme Cterminus           and did so in a manner that was promoted by E and          suppressed by ICI much like the interactions of ER with          the entire NCoR nuclear receptor interacting region          The interaction of ER with the small NCoR Cterminal          fragment amino acids  was stronger than that          observed with the intact Cterminus amino acids           This apparently improved binding is likely to          be a consequence of our methodology West           et al  Unpublished data In          general expression of large fragments of the NCoR          Cterminus in E Coli yields a mix of full length protein          along with truncated products To create the expression          vectors for the smaller fragments truncated NCoR          polypeptides that were obtained in E Coli extracts were          subjected to protein sequence analysis and cDNA fragments          that coded for the major truncated products were          prepared Each of the resulting polypeptides was          expressed very efficiently in E Coli The end product          that was obtained after GST purification essentially          consisted of a single short polypeptide as judged by          Coomassie stain Binding of ER to NCoR  is          probably very efficient for two reasons First equal          amounts of GST fusion protein were used as baits for the          translated ER protein in this series of experiments g          per assay Thus NCoR  is present in molar          excess over NCoR  Second as developed          above preparations of NCoR  generally          contain truncated products so sequences corresponding to          the extreme NCoR Cterminus which binds ER is          markedly underrepresented In any case the fact that          ER binds weakly or not at all to the three NCoR ID          motifs that mediate interactions with TRs and RARs and          instead binds in an agonistdependent fashion to a          region in the Cterminus of NCoR that has not previously          been implicated in NR interactions indicates that ER          recognizes a novel protein sequence motif within          NCoR          The NCoR Cterminus contains the sequence PLTIRMLS          box amino acids  Fig  This sequence          does not exactly conform to the LXXLL consensus but          contains features underlined that resemble the ER H          region L           L LE           ML  and artificial ER          interacting LXXLL peptides            P NLIS           LLS  D           PL LLS           LLS  both of which bind to the          ER AF surface         Moreover the          presence of a proline residue aminoterminal to the          hydrophobic groups is typical of socalled class II LXXLL          motifs which are found in ER interacting cofactors such          as TRAP and RIP     Finally the unusual          Cterminal hydrophobic pair ML has been observed in ER          and ER H       and in RIP NR boxes                       We investigated the significance of the box in ER          interactions with NCoR As Fig Ashows a synthetic          box peptide competed for binding to NCoR albeit          somewhat less efficiently than native GRIP NR box           Similar results were obtained in competition experiments          that used GSTGRIP instead of GSTNCoR data not          shown The isolated box also acted as bait for a          VPER fusion protein in mammalian cells and did so          with similar efficiency to other known ER interacting          peptides Fig B Finally mutations within the box          especially MA LA disrupted ER interactions          with NCoR in mammalian twohybrid assays but did not          affect TR interactions Fig C Thus the box is          sufficient to bind ER and is essential for          agonistdependent ER interactions with the NCoR          Cterminus          Next we examined whether the box would bind other          NRs The Galbox fusion failed to recruit the ER TR          or RAR LBDs in mammalian twohybrid assays Fig A          Moreover while the box and GRIP NR box  peptides          both competed for ER interactions with GRIP only the          NR box  peptide competed for ER interactions with GRIP          Fig B Thus the NCoR box is at least to some          degree ER specific Mutation of NCoR to obtain a box          sequence that more closely resembled a conventional LXXLL          motif TL led to enhanced hormonedependent          interactions with ER and permitted novel          hormonedependent interactions with ER Fig C Thus          some of the observed ER specificity is probably a          consequence of an unexpected ability to tolerate the          absence of a leucine residue at the Nterminus of the          LXXLL motif Together our results indicate that ER has          the potential to utilize its AF surface to bind NR          boxes within coactivators or an NR boxlike sequence in          the Cterminus of NCoR                          A HDAC Repressor Enhances ER Activity          Since ER bound NCoR and SMRT in the presence of          estrogens we investigated the possible involvement of          corepressors in the actions of agonistbound ER           in vivo  To perform this          experiment we examined the effect of the HDAC inhibitor          trichostatin A TSA on ER activity in transiently          transfected HeLa cells Fig Aconfirms that ER shows          stronger transcriptional activity than ER at a simple          ERE responsive reporter gene TSA enhanced the basal          activity of the ERETK reporter gene by about          fifteenfold in the absence of ER see inset However          TSA also equalized the relative transcriptional activity          of both ERs Fig Bshows that the isolated ER LBD          exhibited more potent transcriptional activity than the          ER LBD However both LBDs showed similar          transcriptional activity in the presence of TSA Thus          corepressor complex HDACs must play an unspecified role          in restricting the transcriptional activity of both ER          and in particular the ERLBD This is consistent with          the notion that corepressors restrict the activity of          agonistbound ERLBD                            Conclusions        NRs generally interact with the corepressors NCoR and        SMRT either in the absence of ligand or in the presence of        receptor antagonists and agonists promote corepressor        release     In this study we demonstrated that ER        binds to NCoR in the presence of ER agonists such as        estradiol and DES and the phytoestrogens genistein and        coumestrol but not in the presence of SERMs Moreover        this interaction is dependent upon ER AF including H        and is competed by NR box peptides but not ID peptides The        hormonedependent component of the ER NCoR interaction        maps to the extreme Cterminus of NCoR which has not been        previously implicated in NR interactions and requires a        sequence that resembles an ERspecific NR box PLTIRMLS        box In this regard ER differs from ER which        probably binds ID motifs in a SERMdependent fashion            and shows reduced binding to NCoR in the presence of        estradiol     ER also differs from many other NRs        which either bind NCoR in the absence of ligand and are        released in the presence of ligand or interact with NCoR        in the presence of antagonists but not agonists            The fact that the mode of ER interaction with NCoR        resembles that of NRs with coactivators     or with        corepressors that modulate the activity of liganded NR        complexes such as RIP     raises the possibility        that ER may be able to recruit NCoR and SMRT to        estrogenregulated promoters in response to agonists and        that the balance of overall ER activity in the presence of        estrogens may be regulated by competition between ps and        corepressors for the same ER AF surface We recognize        that our studies do not directly address this issue Our        attempts to identify ER mutants that differentiate between        GRIP and NCoR binding to analyze the role of        agonistdependent corepressor binding have not yet been        successful probably because ER utilizes the same surface        to bind both cofactors Moreover transfection of NCoR or        various mutated NCoR derivatives did not significantly        affect ER activity at EREs or AP sites data not shown        We do not understand why but in our hands transfected        NCoR also fails to affect TR or ER activity data not        shown despite the fact that it clearly interacts with        both NRs Nevertheless we suspect that estrogendependent        NCoR binding may represent an important component of the        regulation of ER activity As described in the        Introduction ER and ER must interact differentially with        factors that modulate ER activity in the presence of        estrogens The finding that estrogens suppress NCoR        binding to ER     but promote NCoR binding to ER        represents the first demonstration of a corepressor that        shows completely distinct modes of hormonedependent        interaction with the ER isoforms Thus NCoR and SMRT and        their associated HDACs are excellent candidates to explain        some of the differential behaviors of the ER isoforms        Consistent with this notion the apparent weak        transcriptional activity of the ER LBD is a consequence of        corepressor HDAC activity at some level Fig  Full        verification of the importance of ER interaction with        NCoR will await demonstration that ER recruits NCoR and        SMRT to estrogenregulated promoters         in vivo  and that this event is        related to modulation of estrogen response        While the ER isoforms have contrasting effects on AP        activity in the presence of estrogens ER truncations that        lack the NTD and ER both enhance AP activity in the        presence of SERMs      Mutational analysis of ER        action at AP sites suggests these effects may be related        to NCoR binding     and we have proposed that SERM        action at AP sites may therefore involve contacts with        corepressors      The fact that ER and ER show        completely different ligand preferences of interaction with        NCoR suggests that the target for SERM activation at AP        sites may not be NCoR in both cases Thus this finding        complicates our attempts to explain this unusual        phenomenon Perhaps the ER isoforms enhance AP activity        by superficially similar mechanisms that involve different        cofactors Alternatively ER and ER action at AP sites        could in fact be mediated by SERMdependent contacts with        a common cofactor that is as yet unidentified This        common factor may yet prove to be NCoR if ER interactions        with the box were somehow masked         in vivo         What features of the box contribute to ER        specificity Intriguingly the box contains Nterminal        proline and Cterminal serine residues that extend the        homology of this region to an artificial ERspecific        peptide     However the box also lacks the first        Leu of the consensus LXXLL A mutation PL         T IRMLPL         L IRML that restores the LXXLL        consensus increases ER binding to NCoR and permits ER to        bind to NCoR in the presence of estrogens in mammalian        twohybrid assays Thus the unusual sequence of the box        contributes to ER specificity and ER can tolerate the        absence of a conserved Nterminal leucine in LXXLL motifs        ER might bind to yet more cofactors that contain variant        NR boxes that resemble the box Other aspects of ER        interactions with corepressors warrant further study It        will be interesting to understand whether the weaker ER        interactions with other regions of NCoR which are        insensitive to ICI play a role in ER binding Fig         Finally SMRT also binds ER in the presence of estrogens        but we have not explored the structural features that        promote this interaction Intriguingly human SMRT contains        a sequence insertion at the position of the hydrophobic        pair in the NCoR box which apparently leads to deletion        of both residues NCoRRMLSSMRTRLqagvmaS            Perhaps SMRT contains a different NR interacting motif or        the NCoR NR box sequence may be more complex than we have
