                    Background        Cytosolic PLA          specifically hydrolyzes         sn arachidonate from phospholipid        providing the precursors for many different lipid mediators        including prostaglandins and leukotrienes      These        lipid metabolites play a role in acute inflammatory        responses and also regulate normal physiological processes        Certain prostaglandins are required for female reproduction        and kidney function       Because of its important        role in controlling levels of arachidonic acid AA much        attention has been focused on the regulation of cPLA          activation with particular emphasis        on the role of its phosphorylation and Ca mediated        translocation              cPLA          is regulated by controlling its        cellular localization and access to membranephospholipid        substrate An amino terminal calciumdependent lipid        binding CaLB or C domain regulates Ca mediated cPLA          translocation to intracellular        membranes     In vitro membrane docking via the C        domain is necessary and sufficient for catalysis and        release of AA     Binding of calcium ions by the cPLA          C domain is essential for the lipid        association in vitro     and translocation in vivo             In response to an increase in Ca          i  cPLA          translocates to the Golgi and ER        however translocation to Golgi occurs at a lower Ca          i            Protein kinase pathways play major roles in cPLA          activation and regulation by the        mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase MEK        extracellularsignal regulated kinase ERK signaling        pathway has received particular attention cPLA          is phosphorylated by mitogen activated        protein MAP kinases including pp ERKs and p on        Ser in vitro     and in response to receptor        stimulation         In addition to        phosphorylation by MAP kinase it has been shown that cPLA          is also phosphorylated on Ser by        MAPKinteracting kinase I MNKI    and on Ser by        calciumcalmodulindependent protein kinase II            Phosphorylation of these sites may also play a role in        regulating cPLA          function in certain cell models        Phosphorylation of Ser has been extensively studied        because it is readily detected due to a characteristic        electrophoretic mobility shift when analyzed by SDSPAGE             The importance of Ser phosphorylation in        regulating cPLA          has been demonstrated in different        cells and in vitro models by using cPLA          containing a SA mutation             However the mechanism whereby Ser phosphorylation        regulates cPLA          function has been elusive In vitro        studies have demonstrated that dephosphorylated cPLA          is catalytically active and that Ser        phosphorylation increases activity by only  percent            In contrast cells expressing the cPLA          SA mutation fail to release AA in        response to a low dose of calcium ionophore but release        similar amounts of AA as cells expressing wildtype cPLA          in response to high dose ionophore            From these studies it has been suggested that cPLA          Ser phosphorylation may have a role        in regulating translocation     A previous study        demonstrated translocation of cPLA          SA in response to Ca ionophore        but did not address the kinetics of translocation        translocation in response to a physiological agonist or        differences in targeting            To better understand the regulation of cPLA          by the MEKERK pathway and Ca  we        investigated the effect of MEK inhibitors on AA release        cPLA          phosphorylation of Ser  cPLA          translocation kinetics and Ca          i increase in MadinDarby canine kidney        MDCK cells We found that inhibition of MEK by U        significantly inhibited AA release and this was correlated        with inhibition of ERK activation However MEK inhibition        only partially affected cPLA          phosphorylation and had no effect on        the kinetics of Ca mediated cPLA          translocation to membrane In        addition using cells expressing wildtype cPLA          and cPLA          with SA or SA mutations it was        found that translocation kinetics and membrane targeting in        response to ATP or ionomycin was similar to wildtype cPLA           These data suggest that MEK        inhibition reduces cPLA          catalytic activity and AA release        independently of phosphorylation and translocation                    Results                  Effect of MEK inhibition on AA release ERK          activation and cPLA Ser phosphorylation          To study the role of the MEKERK pathway in cPLA            activation quiesced MDCK cells were          treated with the MEK inhibitor U and the effect on          AA release ERK activation and cPLA            gel shift determined Fig  For          equivalence with the imaging studies cells expressing          EGFPcPLA            were used in all experiments          EGFPcPLA            was expressed to similar levels as          endogenous enzyme but did not contribute significantly to          AA release in stably transfected cells However          EGFPcPLA            is functional since it          dosedependently catalyzes release of AA when expressed          in cells that lack endogenous cPLA             such as Sf cells    and          immortalized mouse lung fibroblasts from cPLA             knockout mice     In order          to enhance AA release in cells containing endogenous cPLA                      it is necessary to overexpress          the enzyme several fold as previously reported              Cytosolic PLA            has been shown to mediate Ca          induced AA release in MDCK cells treated with ATP and          IONO in experiments using the group IV cPLA            specific inhibitor pyrrolidine              To measure cPLA            mediated AA release EGFPcPLA            transfected MDCK cells labeled with           HAA were incubated with   or  M U for           min prior to stimulation with  M ATP  M IONO or           M IONO AA release was measured at  min because we          have shown that ATP and IONOstimulated AA release peaks          between  to  min poststimulation              Agonistinduced AA release was inhibited dosedependently          by U Fig A with the highest U concentration          used  M reducing AA release by  with all          agonists Table I This inhibition was independent of          the total amount of AA released since AA release          stimulated by  M IONO was fold greater than release          stimulated with  M IONO or  M ATP but the percent          inhibition by U was similar Treatment of MDCK cells          with  M PD a less potent inhibitor of MEK               resulted in a  reduction in AA release in          response to  M ATP  M IONO and  M IONO data          not shown Thus in MDCK cells MEK inhibition          significantly reduces the ability of cPLA            to hydrolyze AA from membrane          phospholipids          The effect of MEK inhibition on activation of pp          ERK measured by immunoblot analysis using          phosphospecific antibodies in cells treated with U          and stimulated as above was determined Fig B Work in          our laboratory has shown that recognition of ERK by          antiphosphoERK antibodies correlates with an increase          in ERK activity       Interestingly the          antiphosphoERK immunoblots revealed that ERKs were          constitutively activated in untreated quiesced MDCK          cells and activation was not enhanced further by ATP or          IONO Fig B left panel ERK activation was diminished          by increasing concentrations of U and was          quantitatively inhibited after  min incubation in  M          U U decreased ERK activation following ATP or          IONO stimulation in the same fashion as in unstimulated          cells Consequently there was a direct correlation          between the reduction of AA release Fig A and          inhibition of ERK activation Fig B in MDCK cells          treated with U          Because cPLA            is a target of the MEKERK          signaling cascade we assayed the effect of MEK          inhibition by U on cPLA            phosphorylation by analyzing gel          shift of cPLA             Phosphorylation of Ser results          in a retardation of its electrophoretic mobility gel          shift      In unstimulated cells EGFPtagged and          endogenous cPLA            were nearly completely gel shifted          indicating that most cPLA            was phosphorylated on Ser Fig          C which is consistent with the observation that ERKs          are constitutively activated Incubation with U          resulted in a partial reversal of the gel shift although          at  M U approximately half of cPLA            remained phosphorylated on Ser           Thus unlike the quantitative effect of U on ERK          activation inhibition of MEK with U only partially          reversed the gel shift of cPLA             The reversal of the gel shift was          similar in cells treated with ATP and  and  M IONO          Due to the increased molecular weight of the EGFPtagged          cPLA             the two forms of cPLA            did not separate as well making the          gel shift more difficult to visualize but generally          mirrored the gel shift characteristics of the endogenous          cPLA             These results suggest that in          response to MEK inhibition there is a quantitative          dosedependent decrease in AA release that correlates          well with the loss of ERK activation but not with the          extent of cPLA            Ser phosphorylation          To further investigate whether the MEKERK pathway          played a role in regulating AA release independent of Ser          phosphorylation we treated cells with anisomycin          which activates the MAPK homolog p but not the          MEKERK pathway     Activation of p in response          to anisomycin treatment was analyzed by immunoblotting          using an antiphosphop antibody Fig A The          immunoblots demonstrate that  min treatment in  ngml          anisomycin resulted in phosphorylation of p in          unstimulated MDCK cells and in cells treated with ATP or          IONO ATP and ionomycin treatment in the absence of          anisomycin only weakly increased p phosphorylation As          expected the MEK inhibitor U did not significantly          affect anisomycinstimulated p phosphorylation In          control experiments anisomycin treatment did not induce          ERK activation nor interfere with inhibition of ERK          activation by  M U treatment Fig B We have          previously reported that p is also selectively          activated in anisomycintreated macrophages              Importantly pretreatment of cells for  min with          anisomycin resulted in maintenance of the cPLA            gel shift in the presence of U          in unstimulated cells and in cells stimulated with ATP          and  and  M IONO Fig C AA release assays show          that in MDCK cells treated with anisomycin U          resulted in an AA release reduction of  Fig D          similar to the inhibition observed without anisomycin          These results demonstrate that activation of the MEKERK          pathway is required for AA release even under conditions          where cPLA            Ser phosphorylation is          maintained suggesting an alternative role for the          MEKERK pathway in regulating cPLA                                      Ca  iincrease is independent of MEKERK          pathway          One explanation for the decrease in AA is that U          inhibits Ca            i mobilization in response to ATP or          IONO thereby preventing translocation of cPLA             In chick ventricular myocytes          inhibition of MEKERK by PD inhibits          zinterolmediated AA release but also inhibits          zinterolinduced stimulation of Ca            i cycling in electrically stimulated          cells     In MDCK cells extracellular ATP acts via          P           Y receptors to elicit an IP            mediated Ca            i increase    and IONO acts to          increase Ca            i by permeabilizing cell membranes to          Ca  To determine the effect of U on intracellular          Ca mobilization by  M ATP or  M IONO we          utilized singlecell fluorescence microscopy on cells          loaded with the calcium indicator Fura Analysis of the          Ca            i increase in individual cells reveals          the heterogeneity in the response to ATP although most          cells exhibited Ca            i spikes of similar magnitude and          duration Fig Aand B thin lines Analysis of the Ca                     i increase in several cells Fig          Aand B thick line revealed that although the duration          of the Ca            i increase elicited by ATP in control          cells was the same as in the Utreated cells          approximately  min the amplitude of the Ca            i increase was slightly higher           in the Utreated cells IONO elicited a sustained          supraphysiological Ca            i increase in cells that was also          slightly enhanced by U Fig Cand D These          experiments demonstrate that U does not decrease Ca                     i mobilization and the inhibition of          AA release by U cannot be ascribed to a failure in          Ca            i mobilization                          cPLA translocation is independent of MEKERK          pathway          The effect of inhibition of the MEKERK pathway by          U on translocation of cPLA            was investigated Although there is          no inhibition of Ca            i release by U and little effect          on Ser phosphorylation it is possible that MEK          inhibition by U prevents cPLA            translocation by another mechanism          To investigate this possibility cells were transfected          with a wildtype cPLA            fused to EYFP EYFPcPLA             and the distribution of EYFPcPLA            was imaged in response to Ca            i transients elicited by ATP and          sustained Ca            i elevations elicited by IONO in the          presence and absence of U Following stimulation with           M ATP there was a rapid translocation of EYFPcPLA            to Golgi that was unaffected by          U Fig AB In response to physiological agonists          that elicit transient Ca            i changes only a small fraction of          the cPLA            translocates This observation is          consistent with our previous results    and has been          demonstrated by Hirabayashi et al     Most studies          of cPLA            translocation have utilized          ionophore which elicits a large supraphysiological          sustained increase in Ca            i           or          agonists that produce a sustained Ca            i increase     Under these          conditions a large proportion of cPLA            binds to membrane These studies          show extensive translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum          ER nuclear envelope and Golgi         We          found that U also failed to alter extensive EYFPcPLA                     translocation to Golgi and ER in          response  M IONO Fig CD These results          demonstrate that MEK inhibition has no effect on cPLA            translocation                          Translocation of phosphorylation site mutants SA          or SA is similar as wildtype cPLA           Phosphorylation of cPLA            on Ser has been hypothesized to          play a role in Ca mediated translocation since Ser          phosphorylation is required for cPLA            mediated AA release in response to          lowdose but not highdose ionophore              Translocation of cPLA            SA in CHO cells has been reported          in response to ionophore stimulation     but the          effect of Ser phosphorylation on the kinetics of          translocation targeting and in response to a          physiological agonist was not investigated MDCK cells          were cotransfected with EYFPcPLA            and a cPLA            with a SA mutation fused to ECFP          ECFPcPLA            SA Using dual EYFPECFP          imaging we were able to directly compare translocation          of both constructs in the same cell The resting          distribution of EYFPcPLA            was similar to that of ECFPcPLA            SA and in response to ATP          followed by IONO the pattern of translocation of          EYFPcPLA            was similar to ECFPcPLA            SA Fig panels A and B D          Analysis of the increase in fluorescence at the Golgi          with respect to time demonstrates that the rates of          translocation of cPLA            and cPLA            SA elicited by ATP followed by          IONO are very similar Fig C As previously reported              the cPLA            SA mutation has a similar          phenotype on AA release as the SA mutation and Ser          was found to be phosphorylated in tandem with Ser           Imaging experiments were performed using EYFPcPLA            and ECFPcPLA            SA and we found that the          distribution of EYFPcPLA            was identical to that of ECFPcPLA            SA before and after stimulation          with  M IONO Fig  panels A and B D Analysis of          the increase in fluorescence at the Golgi with respect to          time demonstrates that the rates of translocation of cPLA                     and the cPLA            SA elicited by IONO are very          similar Fig C                            Discussion        The MEKERK pathway regulates cPLA          and ERKs phosphorylate cPLA          on Ser  The results of this study        demonstrate that this pathway is required for cPLA          mediated AA release independent of        Ser phosphorylation and extend our previous work in        macrophages    by demonstrating that this alternative        role of the MEKERK pathway is not involved in regulating        Ca          i change or cPLA          translocation kinetics or targeting        but is required for optimal hydrolytic activity and AA        release        The results shown here demonstrate that inhibition of        MEK with U quantitatively inhibits both ERK        phosphorylation and AA release in MDCK cells in response to        Ca          i mobilization The MEK inhibitor        PD a less potent inhibitor      also        inhibited ATP and IONOinduced AA release data not        shown ERK was found to be constitutively phosphorylated        in our study using MDCK cells from ATCC in contrast to        what has been reported previously for MDCKD           a subclone of MDCK selected for        adrenergic receptor expression      However a        sidebyside comparison of MDCK cells from ATCC and the        MDCKD          subclone kindly provided by Dr Paul        Insel UCSD demonstrated constitutive activation of ERKs        when both are grown at low density not shown However at        high density ERKs are less active and can be further        activated by phorbol ester not shown        In MDCKD          cells without constitutively active        ERKs AA release is delayed after Ca          i mobilization and is temporally        correlated with ERK activation     whereas in MDCK        cells with constitutively active ERKs AA release is rapid        with significant AA release measured  s after Ca          i increase     This temporal        correlation between AA release and ERK activation has also        been reported in CHO cells in response to PAF stimulation             These results support the observations made here        that ERK activity is required for phospholipid hydrolysis        independently of cPLA          translocation        cPLA          mediated AA release must be preceded        by translocation of the enzyme to its membrane substrate        which is a Ca dependent process and is a function of the        calciumdependent lipidbinding C domain cPLA          translocates primarily to Golgi in        response to a transient Ca          i changes and to Golgi and ER in        response to a sustained Ca          i increase     The reduction in AA        release by MEK inhibition did not involve a failure in Ca                 i release or translocation These        results show that translocation is necessary but not        sufficient for optimum hydrolytic activity        Measuring cPLA          translocation is not a trivial matter        when investigating mechanisms of AA release For example        cPLA          constructs with a SA mutation have        long been recognized as unable to support AA release in        response to physiological agonists or lowdose ionophore        when transfected in cells In contrast cPLA          SA is active in vitro and        phosphorylation only modestly increases the activity of the        enzyme       Interestingly the inhibitory effect        of the SA mutation on AA release is obviated by a high        Ca          i increase In light of these        observations it is possible that Ser phosphorylation        may alter the Ca          i sensitivity of the enzyme its rate of        translocation its intracellular targeting or as has been        previously suggested     the ability of cPLA          to release from a nonmembrane        sequestering agent Although one report has shown that cPLA                 SA translocates in CHO cells in        response to ionophore we were able to directly compare        rates of translocation between cPLA          and cPLA          SA to a physiological agonist and        found no difference between translocation rates or        intracellular targeting We also demonstrated that there        was no difference in translocation rates or intracellular        targeting between wildtype cPLA          and cPLA          SA which has the same phenotype as        SA with regard to AA release when transfected into        cells Thus the role of cPLA          phosphorylation in mediating AA        release remains unclear        Although the alternative mechanism whereby the MEKERK        pathway regulates cPLA          is not known it is possible that it        affects membrane properties andor cPLA          conformation that promotes optimal        hydrolytic activity It is also possible that the        alternative mechanism is due to phosphorylation of cPLA          on a novel site by a kinase that is        downstream of the MEKERK pathway or phosphorylation of a        regulatory protein                    Conclusions        Translocation to membrane is a critical regulatory step        for the action of cPLA          because it is necessary for access to        substrate In this study we demonstrate however that        association of cPLA          with membrane when phosphorylated on        Ser is not sufficient for its full activity in vivo        This is demonstrated by the results showing that inhibition        of the MEKERK pathway significantly blocks AA release but        has no effect on Ca          i mobilization or cPLA          translocation and targeting        Diminution of AA release by MEKERK is also independent of        cPLA          phosphorylation on Ser         Consequently our results demonstrate in living cells that        the translocation process and subsequent catalytic activity        on the membrane are two independently regulated steps                    Materials and Methods                  Fluorescent proteincPLA fusion constructs          DNA encoding the fulllength human cPLA            was cloned into the vector pEGFPC          Clontech to
