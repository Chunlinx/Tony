                                  Tigers Tale            There had been many years of success of rapidgrowth fueled by the money of international investors anxious to get in on agood thing But then with startling suddenness things went sour The leaderadmitted that some bad investments had been made and that even good investmentshad been financed with too much debt and too little equity But much of theproblem he insisted was other peoples fault investors who pulled out theirmoney at the first whiff of difficulty forcing a sudden financialrestructuring that aggravated the losses hedge funds that seeing hisweakness speculated against him And so to the shock of many he suddenlychanged the rules imposing new restrictions on the ability of shortterminvestors to withdraw funds If we had been smart he declared we wouldhave tied up these guys for a long long time when we were kings of the worldrather than excrement            No this isnt anotherarticle about Malaysia and its fiery prime minister The individual in questionis Julian Robertson manager ofyesa hedge fund Tiger Management untilrecently the largest such fund in the world In its heyday in the summer of Tiger had more than  billion under management considerably more thanGeorge Soros Quantum Fund and was reputed to be even more aggressive thanQuantum in making plays against troubled economies Notably Tiger was perhapsthe biggest player in the yen carry tradeborrowing yen and investing theproceeds in dollarsand its short position in the yen put it in a position tobenefit from troubles throughout Asia But when the yen abruptly strengthenedin the last few months of  Tiger lost heavilymore than  billion on oneday in Octoberand investors began pulling out The losses continued infrom January to the end of September Tiger lost  percent compared witha gain of  percent for the average SP  stock By the end of Septemberbetween losses and withdrawals Tiger was down to a mere  billion undermanagement And a furious Robertson blaming flighty European investors foraggravating the problem announced that henceforth the privilege of quarterlywithdrawals would be revoked As my wife declared after reading news reportson the move Julian Robertson just imposed capital controls            Of course everyone makes mistakes although MrRobertsons difficulties may inspire a bit more Schadenfreude than yourordinary average business disaster The large loud toughtalking Robertsonhas none of Soros intellectual veneer or social graces he might have beendeliberately cast to play the role of Ugly American And while he does notshare Soros ambition to be seen as a sort of philosopherspeculator hisprominence does constitute a sort of bully pulpitwith the operative wordperhaps being bullyfrom which he has not hesitated to lecture nations ontheir failings The irony of his current situation no doubt pleases many            But the reallyinteresting thing about Robertsons problems is the way they highlight the keyrole played in the recent travails of the world economy by hedge fundsor touse the terminology preferred by the IMF highly leveraged investors YesHLIs In the world of international organizations such as the InternationalMonetary FundIMFand the World Trade OrganizationWTOeverything seems tohave a threeletter abbreviationTLA Never mind the allegations ofconspiracy the claims that hedge funds profit from countries when they aredown Where hedge funds really get important is when they dont makeprofits when they themselves are in trouble Indeed the troubles of hedgefunds played a remarkably large role in the financial instability of the worldover the last few years            The reason for this crucial role is that in the s ahandful of highly leveraged investors became key even dominant players in anumber of financial markets In the international arena Tiger and a few otherfunds became the key conduit via the carry trade for the export of capitalfrom Japanthat is hedge funds came to play a central role in the exchange ofyen for dollars In the domestic US arena LongTerm Capital Managementbecame a key purchaser of a number of crucial if slightly obscure financialinstruments such as commercialmortgagebacked securities Exactly how centralthese hedge funds had become was not clear until they got into trouble Butthen it turned out that without them the markets could barely function            Why were these funds soimportant Even the  billion that Tiger managed at its peak is not a largesum in the world financial scheme of things the total wealth of the UnitedStates alone is in the tens of trillions And LongTerm Capital Managementwhich nearly brought down the US financial system had less than  billionunder management What was different about hedge funds was first theirability and willingness to leverage up the money they managedin effect touse their limited wealth to buy or shortsell much larger values of assets onmargin and second their willingness to play outside the mainstream marketsHedge funds were never important in the market for Microsoft stock or USTreasury bills but when it came to the secondary market in Danish mortgages orthe forward market in the Thai baht it was a different story            Underlying the ability and willingness of hedge funds totake huge positions in obscure markets was the belief both by lenders and bythe hedge fund managers themselves that they had special expertise In thecase of LongTerm Capital Management that expertise was technical Thesophisticated financial models implemented on their computers were supposed toallow them to diversify away risks In the case of Tiger and Quantum it wasmore a cult of personality People believed in the ability of Messrs Robertsonand Soros to outsmart marketsand so did Robertson and Soros Indeed youprobably cant become the manager of a really large hedge fund unless you havea slightly irrational faith in your own judgment when success depends on beingable to convince other people to let you take huge risks with their money itis not the paranoid but the megalomaniac who survive That is until realitycatches up with them            When reality did catchup it had unanticipated consequences both for the funds and for markets Lookfor example at what happened to that yen carry trade last fall Tiger andother funds had borrowed heavily in yen betting on a decline in the yenagainst the dollar When the yen started to rise instead they suffered lossesSince the funds were already leveraged to the hilt this reduction in theircapital forced them to reduce their exposure which meant paying off some ofthose yen borrowings But that created a fresh demand for yen and supply ofdollars in the foreign exchange market which led to more losses forcing evenmore repayment pushing the yen still higher The result in a short period oftime was a drastic appreciation of the yen and billions of dollars in lossesfor Tiger A similar process of selfreinforcing movement in asset prices whenLongTerm Capital Management got into trouble drove interest rates on virtuallyeverything except the most plainvanilla of US securities to dizzyingheights or in some cases led markets simply to close up shop And more was atstake in these assetmarket collapses than the money of hedgefund investorsThe sharp rise in the yen last fall threatened to send Japan into adeflationary spiral the drying up of liquidity in the United States brieflyseemed to threaten a general financial collapse            Which is why in a perverse way Tigers current problemsare good newsfor they take place against a background of a generally calmerworld one that has learned to live with a greatly reduced role for investorssuch as Mr Robertson Tiger and LTCM are still around but they are no longeras central to the world financial picture as they werewhich means that theparticular sort of vicious circles that brought the world to the brink a yearago are less likely to happen today            Some of my friends in the financial industry thinkthat hedge funds were not just a  but the source of instabilityin the late crisis In that case the clipping of those funds wings is afundamental change in the situation The world is really a much safer place nowthan it was three years ago I think this is a bit too optimistic there areunfortunately many other ways for a global financial system to get into troubleand the yen as it happens is once again dangerously overvalued Butanything that makes the new global economy a bit more stable is to bewelcomed
