              well and   well lets see were going to talk about uh   kids in college and how to help them   kids how to pick one right   yes   well it   and youve been through three of those   uh three times yeah   yeah well ive been through once so   well if   how did you do it with your three   well with uh John the first one he wanted to go into engineering so uh he had never really lived in a large town so we looked at good engineering schools in relatively small towns like Purdue in uh Lafayette Indiana we looked at uh Clemson and VPI   where were you living back then   we were living in in north Alabama at the time   okay   and uh we looked at Mississippi State which was in a small town in Mississippi and uh finally settled on Auburn which was in Alabama in the small town of Auburn   uhhuh   and uh we also wanted a school that had a uh coop program because uh he wanted to go into engineering and we thought that a coop program was a good way to get some experience at the same time   uhhuh   so that was kind of how uh we finally settled on small town and good engineering school with a coop program for him for Brian   yeah   it that was kind of funny because he first started out thinking uh that he wanted to go to a small school thats what he thought when we lived in Alabama and then he moved to Plano and went to Senior High   uhhuh   he figured if i can go to Senior High i can go to school any place   yeah i i think theres a lot of that when you go to a school with two thousand kids there   thats right   suddenly a college thats small seems im going backwards   yeah so he ended up   so   uh i dont remember what his original major was because he changed it about three times       at AM but he ended up going to AM i think because of   yeah   uh he just thoroughly enjoyed the uh the atmosphere down there when he went down for a trip   uhhuh   and uh he was sold on the place Jana i think wanted to to stick a little closer to home and really didnt have a major when she went in in fact i think that was somewhat of a a default because her grades were not as good as uh Brian and Johns in high school so she was somewhat limited in her in her choices to places like Stephen F and   uhhuh   North Texas and maybe UTA and uh   uhhuh   she had some idea that she might want to uh do something with uh physical therapy and TWU was also up in uh in Denton so if she started at one she could move to the other and might not even have to move out of her apartment   uhhuh yeah   so it was kind of close to home and there were two schools in town that uh she could commute back and forth between the two   uhhuh   how did uh your gal picked Baylor   well i think it was well a little bit of she narrowed it pretty rapidly to eliminate the real big ones Texas and AM   yeah   and then it kind of got to be a combination of what she thought she wanted to do and uh the uh quality of the program it it you know Baylor was kind of always at the lead there for uh for some time uh she looked at Austin College i think she applied at Trinity but she really wasnt applying at any of the state schools   oh whats her major   um accounting   uhhuh   so it was a bit of of the major but not a whole lot theres a lot of campuses have business majors so that was not a big deal for her   sure   but she just uh it was sort of her choice and i think it was a little bit of we visited there and she visited some because her high school boyfriends sister was there so she had spent some time there and   i see   felt pretty comfortable she she looked at Austin College but i think again it was the the size aspect it was just too small for somebody coming from Plano unless you you really felt you needed something smaller   good one in Plano yeah yeah what is the population of Baylor i dont even know   so its uh about uh eleven thousand   oh is it okay   yeah so its uh its sizeable but its its sort of in the not giant size   yeah yeah not like uh Austin and College Station   yeah yeah in the case of your kids that i i guess with Jennifer it was more uh that she was making her own choice which i kind of feel is one of the keys if theyre going to go do it they better they better decide where with uh   yeah it needs to be a place they want to go   yeah   uh if theyre going to be successful if they think Mom and Dad picked it or theyre going there because thats where Mom and Dad went and thats what they want them to do uh thats the wrong reason for picking a place   yeah   thats kind of the way Brian picked his first major i think he without asking me he thought because i was in computer science that he should do the same thing and so he started out in that arena and didnt really care for it and finally asked if i would mind if he changed and i said   uhhuh   not at all because you you want to find something that you like to do not necessarily what your Dad does   yeah   so uh   definitely   he felt a little easier about that after uh after i told him it wouldnt upset me at all if he found something that he wanted to do rather then copy what i did   yeah well it seems uh i dont know of a whole bunch of kids who uh really do what their father did theres some i think doctors may be a place where and i dont know quite why that sons often follow Dad   uhhuh   into the profession and maybe thats some of it takes Dads pull to get an in and other  folks cant get in as easily   well that could be   but uh i dont have any kids who want to become engineers       uh so uh you just kind of live with it   sure well and they they need to do something that they think they will enjoy   yeah   and uh uh like i told Jana once she finally settled on a major she just did so much better in college than she did in high school once she found something to get excited about   uhhuh yeah   and uh whether she ever makes a lot of money at it or not is is immaterial if she enjoys it and is good at it and uh so far i think she is   yeah well thats the key to it is that enjoying what youre doing and uh you know i think the folks i see having more trouble picking colleges are i got some friends who at Arco there who uh well theyre from back east and uh and uh their kids are are looking in on some of those eastern private schools   uhhuh   when you start looking at the twenty to thirty thousand dollar price tag and you   oh i know it   start saying well do you really have to go there to get what you want   thats right i mean it would be nice if you could but you you can be successful without necessarily having a uh a degree from an Eastern school   uhhuh but theyre from back east and they got a lot of relatives there so its uh some of them do that   uhhuh well they feel some uh some peer pressure from their peers the parents do sometimes   yeah yeah
