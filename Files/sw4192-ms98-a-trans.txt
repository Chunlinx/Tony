                alright what do you think   well uh i think air pollution is a pretty big problem right now and its i mean i think its a real bad problem i dont think that a lot is really being done about it at this point and theres just things like uh for a i think that cars especially here in the United States are just a major source of the pollution when you consider that most people have at least one automobile and people drive around all the time and i think you know if you just totaled up i dont know any of the exact figures but all the millions of cars that are driving around spewing out carbon monoxide all the time i think youre going to end up with a pretty big uh number      right right   um and if you look at other countries like in the third world and stuff where people ride bikes and all that im sure that their uh air quality is much better than ours just as a result of their lack of having cars like if you look at Los Angeles i mean theyve they said that the major reason that its so smoggy there is because they all sit and drive down the freeway everyday   hum okay well um i i mean also along the same lines i know that theres somebody i i read one time about um somebodys developed uh a test to look at the emissions from um your car      uhhuh    right   you know you know i i just dont understand i mean everybodys so concerned right now about recycling and everything i think thats pulled away from the focus of air pollution      uhhuh   and were making all these changes with cars and everything and and and battling to have US built cars versus other countries and were not looking at  um the air quality that were producing from our cars      uhhuh    right and there was just i just saw today that uh President Bush they were had new a new regulation out that was going to put a canister to collect some of the exhaust fumes on most new cars and he uh is not going to let that regulation pass through because he says that well its going to cost too much money and take too many jobs away from the people up in Michigan and i just think thats ridiculous that i mean if theyve developed the technology to remove some of the harmful pollutants that come out of peoples exhaust pipe and not implementing it is just seems kind of ludicrous to me   yeah i i i hadnt heard anything about that      uhhuh   well you know until these older model cars i mean granted i have an older model car  but i mean some of the some of the really older ones that you know the mufflers falling off you know and theyre not quiet up to specs but theyre still being driven around      right    uhhuh    right   you know and you can i mean id go behind somebody the other day and you mean you saw this this huge amount of smoke pouring out the back of their car and you had to change lanes to get away from them      uhhuh   you know and i mean if you can see it and smell it that badly on that vehicle think about how many others are pouring out that you cant see and smell         right exactly uh the another thing i dont know here in the Midwest in Indiana at least we produce most of our energy burning coal and if you just look at some of these theres a coal burning electricity plant here in town and you can just sit there and watch the the smoke stacks and the amount of pollution that just pours out of there   thats right   i use to live right next to this plant and every single day you would go out and your car would just have you know its not like three inches of dust or anything but you can see the dust that had come out of this smoke stack and just fallen right down on your car and you know they say that the the coal we burn here in Indiana is responsible for a large part of the acid rain that they have up in New York state and in Canada and all that and its just you know its ridiculous when we could be spending the money to develop the technology to you know clean up some these uh sources of pollution like the smoke stacks but then the big businesses say well we cant do it because its going to cost us too much money and its like well we kind of got to think a little bit more forward instead of you know were not going to make as much money this year because were trying to clean things up i just it kind of   thats right thats   bothers me   well i know in Dallas um im i i live pretty close to downtown to Dallas and you know and there are days you just you open the door and just go huh im not leaving here today you know      uhhuh    yeah   and and i mean theres uh theres a place that used to be called Concrete City and they have all these things where they used to burn um and and what they would burn off would be lead      uhhuh    uhhuh   and now you know i mean here theyve been spewing this stuff out for forty years or more and theyre just now beginning to figure out that you know that what theyve done is is wrong      right   you know and now were trying to clean that up but you know weve seen the visible effects in the soil but it makes me wonder what kind of effects that its had on the atmosphere that we dont know yet      umhum    right   you know and so many of these things takes so many years to develop that weve never you know itll be past my life time before i see the effects of some of the things that were doing now      right      so   yeah all and all i think that we really i mean almost if you look at almost any industry its its producing so much pollution i mean theyre spewing out just tons of this atmospheric garbage every single year   umhum   and something really ought to be done because it its basically we dont see the problem right now and like you said even the pollution that were putting out now is not really going to affect anybody for twenty thirty years so i dont think its got i mean the the past     right
