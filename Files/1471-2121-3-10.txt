                    Background        We have been interested in quantitative analysis of gene        expression within single cells and the distribution of that        expression within populations of cells replicating in        culture eg       Since the level of any specific        protein within a cell is dynamic and since it is difficult        to describe cells in tissue culture as steady state        entities describing gene expression in cell populations in        quantitative terms becomes a complex problem Here we have        explored the relationship of SV large T antigen Tag        expression as a function of cell density and cell cycle        duration in clonal populations of Tagimmortalized mouse        astrocytes These cells depend on expression of T antigen        for viability        Expression of Tag in mouse cells under selective        conditions that do not require tumorigenic transformation        eg transduction by retrovirus and selection for drug        resistance produces immortal cell lines with limited        transformation phenotypes      However expression of        Tag has profound effects on the cell cycle significantly        reducing cell doubling time and increasing saturation        density       These direct effects of Tag result from        binding and inactivation of the retinoblastoma family        proteins p Rb p and the tumor suppressor p              Tag is rate limiting for G          transit and this effect as well as        saturation density and growth in soft agar is Tagdose        dependent        Since the cell lines in this        study are capable of entering a quiescent state at        saturation density     one might expect that the levels        of Tag would decrease at saturation and as cells        progressively slow down as a function of cell density        However we have previously noted that the Tag increased        in Tagtransformed NIH T cells as the population became        more dense and the cell cycle time increased during        exponential growth     For some cell types like        fibroblasts and lymphocytes G          cells have less cell mass than cycling        cells and one might expect that Tag expression would        decrease as the G          phase of the cycle lengthened and        cells achieved confluence Since Tag did not decrease        simultaneously with an increasing G          time and since Tag was one of the G          ratelimiting molecules the activity        of Tag must have been decreasing while Tag levels        increased Thus negative control of the cell cycle as a        function of cell density was dominant to the activity of        Tag Though the Tagtransformed NIHT cells could not        maintain a monolayer at confluence did not enter G           during the plateau phase of growth        it was expected that expression would eventually plateau or        decrease        The purpose for this study was to explore further the        relationship between Tag expression as a function of cell        cycle time and cell density We asked whether Tag        expression in immortalized mouse cells always increased as        a function of G          time during exponential growth and        whether levels eventually decreased or achieved a steady        state level at high cell density The advantage to using        astrocyte lines is that many of these lines can maintain a        monolayer in culture for long periods of time     Since        Tag levels are significantly determined by the strength of        the transcription promoter in this retroviral system             we examined cell lines immortalized by Tag transcribed        from two different promoters In the analysis of these        data we  explored the relationship between expression        G          phase time and cell density         asked whether the transcriptional promoter affected those        relationships  explored analytical methods for        describing expression within the context of these        relationships and  asked whether the intrinsic        expression potential of Tag affected Tag expression at        high cell density The results of this study have practical        implications for the use of cell lines as standards in        quantitative assays of gene expression eg                        Results                  Characterization of tkT lines          We have previously characterized clonal mouse          astrocyte cell lines immortalized by transduction of          SV large T antigen expressed from the MoMuLV LTR               Here we compare variation in Tag levels in  of          these lines and  additional lines termed tkT lines          immortalized with Moloney Sarcoma Virus vectors          expressing Tag from an internal herpes thymidine kinase          tk promoter The astrocyte lineage of the LTR lines has          been published      The astrocyte lineage of the          tkT lines was confirmed by the presence of the          astrocytespecific intermediate filament protein GFAP             Figure  All of the lines contained GFAP whereas          NIH T cells treated with dibutyryl cAMP at the same          level as the astrocyte lines did not                          Expression of Tag          To determine the Tag expression of each cell line at a          single density and validate cytometric measurements          Western blotting was performed on all cell lines and          compared to purified recombinant Tag Figure A          Lysates from equal numbers of cells were loaded on the          electrophoresis gel with the exception of PD tkT          which expressed the lowest levels of Tag This lysate was          loaded at a fold higher cell number Protein levels of          each sample and the recombinant Tag were adjusted to          equality by the addition of NIH T cell extract The          presence of equal protein levels in each lane was          confirmed by staining the blotted gel with Coomassie blue          and performing densitometry The protein levels were not          significantly different coefficient of variation CV of            Tag in the cell lines migrated at the correct          molecular weight and crossreacting bands were not          detected When the Tagspecific fluorescence all cell          cycle phase fractions measured by flow cytometry was          compared to the intensity of Western blot bands measured          by densitometry the two measurements showed an          essentially linear relationship Figure B Therefore          immunofluorescence flow cytometry provides an unbiased          estimate of the relative levels of Tag expression for the          range of measurements presented in this paper                          Effect of cell density related cell cycle control          on expression of Tag          A priori one might expect that most cell cycle          related genes will be less expressed in growth arrested          confluent or G            cells relative to proliferating          cultures due to a generalized decrease in metabolic          activity cell protein content and cell size However          based on unpublished observations and previous work see          Introduction     we expected that the Tag          expressioncell density profiles would look like that in          Figure  To test this idea we measured Tag expression          by immunofluorescence flow cytometry see Figure  in           Tagimmortalized mouse astrocyte lines plated at a range          of cell densities and cultured for  days as previously          described     The upper densities ensured in most          cases that the cells would be in either the transition          or plateau phase for some of the measurements Since          Tag accumulates throughout the cell cycle populations          with different phase fractions will have different          average levels therefore we measured Tag from the G            population to generate measurements          independent of the cell cycle phase fraction distribution          as previously described              Figure Ashows the relationship of final cell number          to initial cell number for two combined experiments from          one cell line Plots like this were used to determine the          samples that represented the exponential portion of a          growth curve The slope of a straight line was calculated          and samples were chosen for inclusion when the slope was          either maximal or   when sufficient data could not          be obtained by maximization The G            curves B were used as a secondary          guide to selecting the exponential data Figure Bshows          that the G            fraction increased as a function of          final cell density but that more dense cells arrested          with a significant fraction of S G             and M cells The increase in the G                     fraction was expected as we have          demonstrated in several cell systems that the G            cell cycle phase increases in length          and frequency during exponential growth as a function of          cell density       This change in G            can be demonstrated either by          successive harvests from cells plated at a single density          or by plating cells at different densities and harvesting          simultaneously as in this study The presence of S          phase at confluence is typical of transformed cells          Figure C D shows the expression profiles for Tag          versus G            C and final cell density D The          exponential region defines the data used for regression          measurements Tag expression at terminal cell density          Final Tag was determined by the average of the final          two samples arrow          To evaluate expression Tag measurements for samples          in exponential growth see above criteria were subjected          to linear regression on final cell density to generate an          intercept representing the Tag level at a hypothetical          zero cell density This value for each experiment was          used to normalize data for each data set to a zero cell          density value of  and thus correct for differences in          fluorescence measurements obtained in multiple          experiments and additionally scale the data to be          independent of cell line specific expression levels The          normalized data were then combined for replicate or          triplicate experiments and subjected to linear regression          on the fraction of G            cells and final cell densities Data          for two cell lines are shown in Figure  For all cell          lines the slope and SE of the slope were calculated and          plotted in Figure  In one of the cell lines the slopes          for Tag versus both G            and cell density were not          significantly different from zero For another line the          slopes had significant positive values and in the          remaining  lines both slopes were negative and          significant Figure shows data for the cell line that          did not differ from zero and a representative line with          negative slopes The two cell lines that did not display          a decrease in Tag during exponential growth were          transformed with retroviruses utilizing the retroviral          LTR Three of the cell lines that showed a significant          decrease in Tag during exponential growth utilized          retroviruses encoding transcription of Tag from the htk          promoter which can be a weak promoter in mouse cells              but subject to cell line specific effects see          discussion One of the cell lines showing a significant          decrease in Tag expression was K which encoded an          Rbbinding defective mutant Tag transcribed from the          retroviral LTR                              Serum levels do not affect Tag expression          It is possible that Tag expression could be regulated          by factors in serum and that these factors could be          progressively depleted at increasing cell numbers To          test this the cell line in which Tag control was most          sensitive to density PD tkT was grown for  days          starting at an intermediate density of  cells per           cm plate with varying concentrations of serum ranging          from  Tag level as well as G            was equivalent at all serum levels          Table  Since there is significantly less serumcell          in  serum samples we conclude that factors in serum          at concentrations that maintain exponential growth do          not regulate Tag levels in these cell lines                          Characterization of density and growth phase          effects on Tag                      Tag expression at high cell density            For each cell line the levels of Tag at high cell            density either transition or plateau phase were            significantly lower than during exponential growth            This level ranged from a  decrease compared to            the hypothetical Tag level of  normalized at             cell density Table                                 Tag expression at zero and late cell            densities            Figure Ashows the correlation plot for the            objective expression potential intercept measurement            at zero cell density defined above and Tag measured            from Western blots in Figure  The Western blot data            represent a sampling of Tag expression on growing            cultures in late exponential growth and thus might            reflect the average qualitative experiment The            overall agreement with the intercept measurement            supports the use of this objective means to determine            expression potential ie expression that is            independent of population growthdensity effects in            quantitative analysis The R value for the regression            is  The single outlier represents PD which is            the only cell line that showed an increase in Tag            during exponential growth and so would not be expected            to fit the regression as well If PD is removed            the R is                                 Relationship of Tag expression as a function of            cell density and G phase time            An increase in the fraction of G              cells as a linear function of cell            density is a common observation in this laboratory            eg Figure B       Figure Bshows that            there is a correlated relationship between the slopes            ie changes in Tag concentration as a function of G              phase time is correlated with            changes in Tag as a function of cell density                                Relationship between final Tag and the expression            profile for G             Figure Cshows that there is a significant            correlation between the rate of change of T antigen as            a function of cell cycle time and the endpoint            expression level determined at or near a plateau phase            in these experiments Therefore the levels at            confluence or plateau can be predicted by the direction            and rate of change during exponential growth Figure            Dshows that the same relationship holds true for cell            density as would be expected from Figure B                                Control of Tag expression during exponential            growth is independent of the intrinsic expression            potential            Figures Eand Fshow the regression of average Tag            expression Western blot in Figure  on the G              and cell density slopes            Regression of data for the intercept calculations            eg as in Figure A gave a similar plot There            appears to be no relationship between the intrinsic            expression strength or potential and change in Tag            expression as a function of G              phase fraction time or cell            density ie growth related control of Tag            expression                                      Discussion        There is good evidence that quantitative changes in gene        expression are important for some regulatory genes For        example periodic quantitative changes in the levels of        cyclin proteins that activate cyclin dependent        serinethreonine kinases cdks appear to be the core        cell cycle machinery in mammalian cells In this case        cyclin molecular concentration is directly related to cdk        activity and activity is directly related to cell cycle        transition rates     When regulatory proteins affect        cell processes involved in disease measurement of        molecular concentration takes on added importance For        example the expression of a number of oncogenes        protooncogenes and reduced or absence of expression of        recessive oncogenes has been postulated to provide        diagnostic andor prognostic information in human cancers        eg       Currently cancer gene expression        research is seldom done in a rigorously quantitative        manner which may contribute to the sometimes conflicting        results     Much evidence leads to the conclusion that        the tumorigenic phenotype of mammalian cells is markedly        affected by quantitative changes in expression of        regulatory genes In experimental systems small shifts in        expression can have profound consequences For instance in        NIH T cells expression of SV large T antigen Tag at        high levels    molecules per G          cell decreases the G          phase time by       However         of this effect can be accounted for with the initial        expression of   molecules per G          cell and  can be accounted for by        expression of   molecules             Previously we measured the relative dose response for G                 transit for SV Large T antigen        expressed in NIH T cells In this work the levels of Tag        in G          increased  during exponential        population growth as the length of G          was increasing     Since Tag is        ratelimiting for G          transit in these cells the increase        in transit time as a function of G          Tag concentration represented an        apparent paradox that is resolved in the simplest and        obvious manner by stating that additional ratelimiting        entities operate to set the G          transit time One easily measured and        pervasive entity that regulates G          phase time is cell density which is        taken as a surrogate for cellcell contact This effect can        be separated analytically from growth factor concentration            and therefore appears to measure independent        cell cycle regulatory mechanisms Our work     and        most other work indicates that the cell density dependent        mechanisms that negatively regulate cell proliferation are        dominant to Tag Indeed this may be universal for        oncogenes since we are not aware of instances when        anchorage dependent cells fail to enter a plateau phase in        tissue culture        The study presented in this paper represents further        investigation into the effect of cell density on gene        expression Cell lines were created by incorporation of        retroviral vectors into the genome and expression of Tag        from either the retroviral LTR considered to be a strong        promoter or the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter        internal to the viral LTR     In our established NIH        T cell line Tag is expressed from the htk promoter at        considerably lower levels than from the LTR for a        considerable time after transduction unpublished        observations and     However when a large number of        htkTag astrocyte clones were checked  days after        creation the expression levels displayed a very large        range and thus we expect that this weak promoter is        subject to positional effects on transcription or        mutational events that affect gene expression unpublished        data Polyclonal populations produced by transduction of        htkTag vectors that were passaged without selection        displayed expression levels equivalent to or higher than        LTRTag cell lines Frisa and Jacobberger unpublished        data This selection for increased Tag expression makes        sense given the low growth rate of primary mouse astrocytes        and the ability of Tag to decrease the cell cycle time           and increase saturation density eg      In this        study the expression potential of cell lines was not        related to proliferation related changes in expression of        Tag emphasizing that clonal variation for whatever reason        which includes promoter strength accounts for the large        range of htk related expression        Making sense of a quantitative description of the role        of Tag and other regulatory proteins in cell cycle        regulation and cell transformation requires either that all        the parameters affecting expression are measured at the        same time so that differences can be accounted for or an        ability to compute some base line or expression potential        statistic with which to evaluate differences eg between        cell lines A practical application of this knowledge is        the ability to create biological standards from cell lines        that express varying levels of a given protein and then use        these in quantitative andor longitudinal experiments        Clearly in cases where gene expression varies        significantly with cell density eg PDtkT use of        these cells as a standard in a longitudinal study would        require that the standard was measured at the same cell        density for each experimental sampling or that a derived        statistic ExpressionDensity or ExpressionG          intercepts is used to normalize the        data In this regard the good agreement between the        intercepts and nondensity corrected Western blot data for        cell lines varying over a fold range is supportive        Originally we pursued a strategy of reduced Tag        expression from the htk promoter as a means of producing        immortalized differentiated cells that may have a reduced        transformation phenotype We noticed however that        initially slow growing cell lines produced with htk driven        gene expression needed to be cloned early to prevent        overgrowth of more rapidly growing cells that expressed        high levels of Tag This was not true for clonal or        polyclonal transductants that expressed Tag from the MoMuLV        LTR which supports a high level of expression unpublished        observations In the context of this study we wished to        explore density dependent expression as a function of these        two types of transformants The data presented here show        that LTR driven Tag expressing cell lines either increase        Tag during exponential growth despite a progressively        increasing G          phase and contact inhibition density        or the levels to not change significantly whereas those        created with the htk promoter show varying degrees of        reduced expression that is consistent in magnitude between        experiments as the cell cycle lengthens This suggests        that the LTR is less density regulated than the htk        promoter which is subject to down regulation as the cell        cycle lengthens during contact inhibition of growth The        single exception is the pattern of expression observed for        an LTR driven line expressing a form of Tag that is mutant        in binding the Rb family proteins eg     This        densitydependent reduction inTag expression was somewhat        surprising We do not know the half life of this mutant T        antigen K Since it is expressed at levels that are         fold that of wildtype Tag in NIH T cells     we        would not expect that the half life was significantly lower        than that of wild type Alternatively the cell line used        here is a low expressing cell line  fold above the        lowest expressing cell line Thus in this cell line for        unknown reasons the protein could be less stable If the        idea that transcription strength mainly drives Tag        expression is kept as the working hypothesis then there        are at least three possibilities to explain the K data         the K protein has a mildly shorter halflife and the small        difference results in a different phenotype visvis the        density related expression  failure to bind Rb family        members significantly affects the halflife during        exponential growth  the LTR vectors can occasionally        display integration position effects that in this special        case was subject to density dependent control that is        different from most LTR driven cell populations        Both the promoters as well as the protein investigated        here are viral The cells are dependent on Tag expression        and so there is significant selective pressure against        extinction of Tag expression Effects of viral promoters        may reflect the evolution of the viruses and their hosts        We have additional evidence that the same type of density        effects ie changes in gene expression detected        continuously during exponential growth may operate on        native proteins Tag immortalized human tracheal epithelial        HTE cells grown at different densities and assayed for        cytokeratins  and  showed a density dependent decrease        in cytokeratin immunoreactivity and a concomitant increase        in G          both in normal growth medium and in        differentiation medium Frisa  Jacobberger        unpublished Additionally the expression levels of cyclin        B are lower in replicating Hela cells at high cell density        Soni  Jacobberger unpublished results It is        conceivable that other proteins that are at high levels in        densityarrested cells may be positively regulated by        density during exponential growth There are many papers        that describe genes that are up or down regulated at        confluence Several recent papers identify genes that are        upregulated by cell density These include        TEMendosialin IGF IGFR IGFBP Bak drp SP p        Kip         However cell context differences        are apparent eg IGFR     and one study used        several cell lines and demonstrated distinct effects of the        cell genetic background     Downregulated genes        include bFGF FGF Topoisomerase II EGFR human        HDAC as well as cell cycle regulatory genes among others                   Regions in the bFGF promoter        have been identified as associated with densitydependent        downregulation of bFGF     The IGFII P promoter is        downregulated as a function of cell density and a base        pair sequence has been identified that plays a critical        role in this downregulation     Neither the MoMuLV        LTR or the htk promoters encode this sequence although        both encode a base pair sequence that is identical to        the P sequence with an insertion of  base pairs at        position  Most studies focus on transcription andor        protein levels Fewer studies have addressed translation        however isoforms of cmyc and FGF are translationally        regulated by cell density     For many of these genes        down regulation at confluence is not surprising eg cell        proliferation associated genes and upregulation of        differentiation specific genes at confluence is equally        unsurprising However a glance at the literature does not        suggest that any quick classification or generalizations        should be made        Regulation of protein levels is multifactorial        Transcription translation protein stability and        degradation are involved Tag levels in rapidly growing        polyclonal cell lines appear to be set primarily by        transcription      However as discussed above Tag        levels in clonal cell lines produced with the weak htk        promoter and generated from slowly growing primary cells        are related to clonality SV Tag is a longlived protein        with a halflife variously measured at  hrs The long        halflife of Tag would not normally implicate protein        stability however the magnitude of changes that we        discuss here although biologically relevant are within        two fold and might be affected by small differences in        protein stability Given this line of reasoning the data        presented here can be interpreted as evidence for a cell        contact density  cell cycle length related effect on        transcription that does not affect the retroviral LTR to        the extent that it does the htk promoter This effect is        predictive of the plateau growth phase levels of Tag and        thus ultimately should affect in the case of Tag or        similar oncogenes the fate of clones in polyclonal        populations For example if an LTR Tag line and htk Tag        line with equal expression potential were cocultured over        time one would expect the LTR driven line to dominate        Finally the htk lines here varied significantly in        terms of Tag expression potential and in terms of the rate        at which expression decreased as a function of cell        density There was no correlation in the rate of change in        density related expression and the density independent        expression here referred to as intrinsic expression        potential This supports the idea that the density        independent expression in the htk lines is set by the clone        specific effects eg integration position and the        densitycell cycle related expression is set in these cases        by the promoter                    Conclusions        These data show quantitatively that the Tag expression        potential of introduced Tag varies over a wide range        depending on the vector used and clonal variation The        expression level is a complex measurement that can be        partially simplified by accounting for the cell cycle        transit time and cell density        The hypothetical terms expression at zero cell density        and expression at minimum G          phase fraction were introduced to        simplify measures of expression potential        Accounting for both cell cycle transit time and cell        density should increase the precision and accuracy with        which gene expression can be measured This is important        for the use of cell lines as quantitative standards for        gene expression studies for relating expression to        phenotype and for an understanding of gene expression in        general and affects ideas on cell engineering                    Materials and Methods                  Generation of astrocyte cell lines          Cortical astrocytes were harvested from neonatal          CBL mice and infected with a replicationdefective          retrovirus encoding Tag and neomycin resistance as          previously described     The transferred viruses          were SV     in which wild type Tag is expressed          from the MMuLV LTR promoter SVXT K which is          constructed the same as SV except that the Tag is          mutant    and defective for binding the          retinoblastoma protein family     LinkertkT in          which the cDNA for Tag is expressed from the herpes          simplex  tk promoter     The differentiation and          transformation phenotypes of the cell lines utilizing the          MMuLV LTR promoter have been described      The          LinkertkT lines tkT were either isolated as clones          after G selection as previously described    or          frozen immediately after selection pooled clones and          clonally selected at a later time Typically it took           days after infection to obtain colonies and  more days          to generate a rapidly growing line that could be serially          cultured split  at weekly intervals The lines          termed early passage in this paper were  days post          infection and all others were  days post          infection The names of the cell lines designate the          number of days the primary neonatal astrocytes were          cultured prior to infection For example PD is the          eighth clone derived from cortical astrocytes isolated on          the day of birth and infected  days later

fluorescence of samples stained with          the antiTag isotype IgGa and FITCconjugated          secondary antibody served as a control for nonspecific          fluorescence and was subtracted from
