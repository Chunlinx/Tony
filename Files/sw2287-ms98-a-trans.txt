        okay did you vote in the last uh national election   yes we uh uh i havent missed a one since ive been eligible to vote   oh thats good   uh did you get to vote at the last one   i voted in the last national one yeah im not sure if i got the last local one   oh uhhuh yeah and sometimes the the local ones arent as publicized it seems that uh they should be   yeah and youre not sure where to go and vote and all that   right and uh theres usually nobody running against you know the incumbents   right or you dont know what they stand you know where they stand or anything like that   right so uh but i i feel that uh a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting   yeah i think youre right   and its its theyre and also theyre fed up with the system and they say well why should i even vote   yeah or sometimes they dont like either of the choices   right   for the candidates so they think well you know why vote   right the lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it  oh i know it  the last gubernatorial race was oh that was awful   yeah really especially in Texas it really was yeah it was a mess   but uh so i dont know i itll be interesting to see how the next uh few years go   yeah   um   did you think its a serious problem that half the people dont vote or   yeah i think well its its definitely a problem and i think it could get worse   yeah   you know we get this lackadaisical attitude and say huh you know why should we vote and then uh you know it could uh it could lead to some serious things   yeah it also seems like maybe another another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting   umhum right uh yeah we can get uh you know if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes if they were you know had enough pull   yeah its kind of like in Louisiana where that uh guy thats like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected  kind of scary when you think about that   yes umhum yeah and uh whos the other guy LaRouche uh LaRouche LaRouche uh that uh is sort of the uh socialist not socialist but communist uh hes so off the wall that uh hes gone in and tried to get into city elections and uh but hes got hes been put away for uh credit card fraud i believe   oh gosh   yeah Lyndon LaRouche thats it   yeah   and uh so yeah   yeah peoplell will sit home and assume oh that guy would never get elected next thing you know youve got him   umhum right if you dont go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will because a lot of the people like that   yeah   theyll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say well you know this guys got everything together you know i like what he says you know itll be so far off the wall that theyll elect him   right yeah   and uh you know i think thats sort of what happened with Louisiana because because uh the guy did get elected correct thats what i thought   yeah i think so right yeah he sure did   and uh so you know it uh but you know they can always fool us you know they might do a good job   yeah i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or   umhum   something like if you have if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long i think that discourages a lot of people   oh yeah what we do usually is uh vote uh absenteeism   uhhuh   and uh i know here you know you dont have to have any reason you can just go and vote   right   and uh the polls are open what was it a couple of weeks uh the hours are good and it theyre even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays   uhhuh   and so you weve got plenty of time to go uh because uh down here in in Houston its uh the lines are long   yeah im in Dallas and theyre long here too so   so uh but uh   yeah i voted absentee one year i really was going to be gone so i i did it but uh it was nice i would be tempted to do it again   uhhuh well uh i recommend it because you just walk right on in and theres usually not anybody in line   right   and uh you know that votes just as good as you know the one on election day   yeah i think they should change the whole system so that its easier i think i think more people would do it if it wasnt such a hassle   umhum yeah um ive yeah ive been involved with uh some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the of the Republican party and its really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the uh how the uh   uhhuh   the not the ballots but uh my mind has gone blank ive been wrestling with a child all evening uh       what uh how they develop uh what the candidate stands for the you know the views and uh   uhhuh   you know everybody gets to vote on you know well should he be for this and uh you know on and on and on and uh its its interesting   yeah that would be i usually vote a lot of times ill vote a straight party ticket just because i dont take the time to find out what every   but   you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on on what issues so i just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so ill go ahead and vote   huh umhum uh right and uh there for a while that would that works weve uh   but that   i i know i have uh  ill stick to uh to uh you know sometimes ill stick to a certain party depends on the guy   uhhuh   but uh if it uh gets down between two then ill ill vote for the party  if i know you know something about the other guy or you know theyre both just as bad then ill say well   yeah   i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party and um but yeah you know thats not uh the best way but   no i guess itd be best if you knew what each person and  what they stood for and why and everything but   right right but it gets to the point where i mean youve got to have the time find the time also to read read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for   right and try to determine if what you read was objective or not and   right or what youve heard on TV which i think is just outrageous i i dont agree with how the uh media handles elections   yeah yeah   i you know im im tired of hearing about the polls you know you know this is how he stands such and such a day   yeah   they break it out its just its just ridiculous   yeah i think it could affect the outcome you know could make it unfair   umhum it really could and uh uh then how sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an an issue into the ground which is good and dead and they keep dragging it on and it could hamper the uh outcome of an election for the guy that should have won   oh yeah   yeah so uh   yeah the press has a lot of power   they really do i i sometimes think that that should be limited more   yeah oh but boy you try get into that youd really open a can of worms   oh yes or they uh you know i i agree with the freedom of of the press and thats you know all the amendments but sometimes its for the publics own good that we dont hear things   yeah seems like they should regulate themselves a little bit and i dont think they ever care to   no they dont   well i cant think of anything else really about the polls or voting   and well i enjoyed talking to you   to talk about well it was good talking to you um bye   all right thank you byebye
