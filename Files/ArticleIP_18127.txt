                                 Playing by Heartburn            For nearly a decade Ivebeen obsessed by the cellist Jacqueline du Pr whose tremulous frequentlyrhapsodic recordings of concertos by Elgar Schumann and Dvork formed thecornerstone of my music library Thats why Ive been puzzled by my reluctanceto tackle Hilary and Jackie  which pretends to tell the story of du Prand her elder sister from their childhood as prodigies Hilary played theflute to Jacquelines excruciating decline and early death in  frommultiple sclerosis I suppose I hoped that the moviewhich opened on ChristmasDay in New York and Los Angeles to qualify for the Academy Awards and has beenopening across the country over the last few weekswould just go away InEngland it has been reviled as a slander by musicians and music critics buton this side of the Atlantic its reception has been warm and theres a strongchance that Emily Watson will win an Oscar nomination for her committed turn asthe unstable cellist So I suppose Ill finally have to confront this thing Asdrama Hilary and Jackie is merely sketchy and superficial As aportrait of the artist its puritanical crap            Like many I firstencountered du Pr in the Elgar cello concerto in D minor a work of achingdisillusionment that somehow rises to heights of sublimity Whod have thoughtthe old Tory had so much blood in him It wasnt du Prs tone that hookedmethere are more limpid cellosbut the intensity of her bowing You dontneed to have seen du Pr in the flesh to feel an immersion that stops justshort of hysteria Indeed footage shows her strawberryblond hair whippingaround her head her skirts hiked up her thighs tightly gripping herStradivarius The ecstatic sexual component is hard to ignore She wasunconventional too She played with unEnglish emotional abandon married aJew Daniel Barenboim the pianist and conductor and experimented with drugsSo it was probably inevitable that her life and music would turn into fodderfor a cautionary parable about the counterculture complete with the kind oflingering death that lends itself readily to familiar depictions of classicalmusicians physical and mental illness            The instrument of Jacqueline du Prs defilement is AGenius in the Family  a memoir by Hilary du Pr and their brother Pierswho gets all but lost in the transfer to film As the title implies all wasnot equal in the du Pr household Although Hilary got off to a blazing startas a flutist her little sister eventually left her in the dust and thefamilys life came to revolve around the needs of its increasingly demandingyoung star The film from a screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce accords thesisters equal status telling the story of each in a separate strands firstHilarys life then Jackies At the end the two strands converge After herown musical career recedes Hilary Rachel Griffiths retreats to a bucoliccountry cottage with her lovesmitten swain of a husband David Morrissey andher children There are plenty of animals and no shortage of healthy ieamateur musicmaking Then we take a similar journey with Jackie Watsonwho denied a proper childhood and family life pines away in foreign capitalsbehaves with increasing waywardness and vulgarity she adopts a bogusContinental accent and expires in near solitude with only her loyal sisterto remind her of Gods love            Its difficult to believe that serious critics havepraised Hilary and Jackie for its insight into the artistic mind sincethat insight consists largely of the notion that People Like That Are DifferentFrom Us The director Anand Tucker views Jackie from an uncomprehendingdistance fixating largely on her freakishness She seems never to rehearse orto hold opinions about the composers whose works she serves and her rapportwith Barenboim James Frain whose performance is likely circumscribed byconsiderations of libel is chiefly the upshot of their comparable celebrityThe centerpiece of the movie is when the two narratives come together andJackie descends on Hilarys cottage like an invading parasite Flouncing aboutin her furs and miniskirts and drinking heavily she uses emotional blackmailto convince Hilary to let her bed her husband before returning to Paris andher own evidently unsatisfying marriage The illness that strikes her downcould be viewed as vengeance for a profoundly unnatural existence            Friends and colleagues ofJacqueline du Pr have attacked Hilary and Jackie for both its factualdistortions and its unflattering depiction of an allegedly generous artistbutI frankly dont care if the picture is accurate or not The larger point isthats its all dashes and ellipses skipping lightly along the surface of bothJackies career and Hilarys noncareer and wanton in its exploitation of bothElgar and MS to generate pathos and awe Watson does an exquisite impersonationof a troubled soul its probably not her fault that this lonely fruitcakedoesnt connect with anything I hear in du Prs fearless playing whichmanages to be both willful and restrained in equal measure Many talentedmusicians are unstable the wonder is how they also manage to be sodisciplined In Hilary and Jackie genius is too vulnerable toplague            P laying by Heart has the stridentpsuedosophistication of a latenight dorm room colloquy as dramatized by asophomore busy congratulating himself for having more

coursethere is But I dont want to  I have a brain tumor            The rest of the film jumps around among similartwosomes plus Dennis Quaid as a mysterious loner who wanders into bars andtells fantastic tales of tragedy to whomever will listen Madeleine Stowe andAnthony Edwards meet in hotels for kinky anonymous sex Cute party girlAngelina Jolie chases skinny prettyboy Ryan Phillippe who is peculiarlyunresponsive to her blandishments Schlumpy theater director Gillian Andersonis courted by a Mr Adorable Jon Stewart but fears that if she opens herselfup to him shell get hurt Ellen Burstyn hovers at the hospice bed of herdying gay son Jay Mohr Each couple is engaged in its own emotional tug ofwar but disinclined to confront their issues head on In the words of JolieTalking about love is like dancing about architecture            Dancing AboutArchitecture was meant to be the movies title but the more genericPlaying by Heart comes closer to conveying its deep banality The onlydifference between this and a conventional soap opera or for that matter anepisode of The Love Boat  is that Carroll doesnt spell out theinterrelationship among the couples until the final scene a symbolicremarriage in which the characters realize that talking about love might be asfutile as dancing about architecture but you have to do it anyway if your lifeis going to mean anything A character who is HIV positive expresses thatsentiment most clearly the glimpse of his own mortality having given him aperspective that the others come to only gradually Anderson gives the mosttart and likable performance but she along with the rest of the cast has tostruggle with dialogue that has the tackiness of flypaper When she announcesI dont want any more calculated artificiality its a wonder the housedoesnt erupt in cries of Bravo            G loria  a gritty Sharon Stone vehicle  Holdittheres something about the words gritty and Sharon Stone that dontbelong in the same sentence Stone does best when playing creamy glamour girlswith predatory streaks but its not hard to see why shed want to play GloriaThe movie is a remake of a  John Cassavetes sausage a rare formula picturefor the maverick director about a gangsters mistress Gena Rowlands who hasa cameo here who stands up to her lover by rescuing a little Spanish boy whosefamily has been wiped out by mobsters So Stone gets to stride around in shortskirts and spiked heels and hold a gun on big Irish guys and refer to herselfas a broad She gets to act tough but vulnerable and talk with a Noo Yawkaccent and say Im trying to change my life here And shes enough ofa star that you root for hernot so much to save the kid as to make it throughthe movie without unduly embarrassing herself            No such luck The director is Sidney Lumet whofunctions as the opposite of a safety net Even chronic underactors overact inLumet pictures and his camera is somehow always in the right place to catchthem doing it Lumets tempo and staging are just realistic enough to allow youto resent him for melodramatic devices that slicker directors get away with Hemakes a fatal miscalculation The initial murders are so horrifying in theirplainness that when the movie takes the gentlemanly way out and refuses toprovide a cathartic bloodbath the audience feels burned A real gentlemanmeanwhile might have protected Stone from showing so much flesh to so littleeffect In one scene in a coffee shop the kid shes protecting hides underthe table next to her ample legs Once upon a time both heand theaudiencewould be trying to peek up her short skirt But the thrill alas isgone
