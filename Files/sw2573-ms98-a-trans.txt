                all right what do you think about it like well you can go first   well uh i guess uh i hadnt hadnt had a lot of time to think about voters but uh     wow i dropped the phone       that was loud sorry   uh i i guess i voter apathy of course i is uh is a universal thing uh not just i dont think just United States really i think other places have   uhhuh   the same problem and its basically because the voters dont really feel like that their vote really has any influence on the outcome not just of the election but of the results of the election the uh the congressman and the senators and you know the legislators dont really do   uhhuh   uh most of the time what the what the their constituents uh really want them to do   uhhuh   uh they do what they think is either best for the you know the the uh economy or whatevers best for the people that are the lobbyists that are paying you know part of their way   yeah   and and and i think its you know the voters dont feel like they really have as much say so in the government as uh they would like to have so they they kind of drift away because of that   uhhuh really i think that thats a big part of it i think thats probably the root and then also that added with all the pressures on the American family today its a real its a real pain for us to go vote i mean   huh yeah   i remember the last time that we had to go vote it was like man just to get up there and do it was major effort you know   right   and we ran in there it was like right at seven and my husband had worked late and i was going to go we wanted to go together to do it and take our son but it was like we ran in and whew we were the last people in there and i thought you know Kyle gets off usually about oh by five but we live in Tarrant County and he drives from Dallas so you know its a drive but he still had a lot more cushion to be able to go vote a lot easier than most people you know what i mean   right   and because he doesnt hit the North Dallas traffic and all then he might have worked an hour late it was just like ah we had so many things to do and we just couldnt get them done and i i remember thinking that man it im a Christian and i really feel like we have a responsibility to vote but i tell you what if i wasnt a Christian i would theres no way i would have gone to vote just because of the pressures   uhhuh   the you know just the time factor and just the anyway and i felt like i was listening to Dobson this morning and i i guess i even thought that then this morning so its funny i got this topic because there were talking about how the Congress it pays the Congress to make you know legislation that encourages women to work outside the home because then you have two people you can tax and you you put both of those people in a higher bracket   uhhuh   and that its probably not going to end anytime soon the pressure you know to work and just the pressure it puts on the American family and um i  i thought about that and i said yeah thats funny you hardly have time to go vote for this Congressman because you know women are expected to do so much now and i just kind of laughed and i thought God i never thought of it like that you know   uhhuh   so anyway i think thats the other side that   yeah i think thats thats a good observation and and true yes uh   yeah but i agree too with what everything you said but i think the two go and then you put those two things together and youre going to have you know no one going to vote but then um i dont know disillusion whats the solution   yeah oh whats the solution huh start over again  you know thats weve the people have talked you know about having about redoing the Constitution completely or changing the government a little you know to some extent     i know now  come on   uhhuh   and i think thats a you know we really ought to take a long hard look at at the system and and see if theres a way to improve it not just say thats the way it is or its been that way for two hundred years       lets you know see if there are some some improvements uh not a not a change but some improvements i think the system itself basic system is   but i think that   is uh appropriate but i think there are some some modifications even that could be made uh   uhhuh   limitations on Congress and restrictions you know restrictions that could be put on on the government itself   uhhuh   to get them out of our everyday life   yeah theres yeah i know theyre i know you cant even spank your children  these days without   uhhuh   you know with this you know i dont know   you   we dont have we dont have a little child but i know that when you go in a restaurant we had some foster twins and it was last year and it wasnt through the state but boy howdy man these kids needed a whipping sometimes not to be beaten not to be abused but to firmly be told you are not going to do that and you are not going to spit in my face i said no   yeah he uhhuh   and if you do that this is going to be the consequence but it you couldnt do that even through the state even the mother it wasnt through the state but even though um the mother really would given approval but because of the situation we just didnt think it was wisdom you know you go in a restaurant and they start spitting their food out at the table now come on but you know you couldnt do really a lot because of the states control so thats thats a good idea there too i like that but   uhhuh     anyway you know have you ever had a two year olds twins start spitting their food at you at Lubys you know i mean youre like going i mean yes     uh yeah i i remember our our our daughters twenty five     uhhuh   and i remember when she was at you know at that age and and how she was and that thats exactly of course there was only one of her it wasnt twins   uhhuh   but thats exactly the you know the way it was and of course twenty five years ago you could you could uh you could   you could go in the bathroom at Lubys and take care of it   yeah yeah you could could uh   yeah i did i stood there and i did take care of it it took forever though and i think God just had some grace there because i dont think if it had been my child i dont think that would have worked what i did in order to get them to eat that food you know   uhhuh   but it took like twenty five minutes but it was the whole thing was the state but i dont want to rewrite the Constitution i just wish people i wish it would be interpreted like the founding fathers wrote it to be interpreted by   uhhuh right   and that they would begin to teach it in the   yeah i guess the the Constitution is not the part that needs to be changed its the   right  our society is so messed up though its like no wonder they interpret it wrong we were in Dallas last night and we ate dinner at Meadow Road and seventy five at a restaurant there   its the rest of it huh you know the uhhuh   and i couldnt believe it it was like this kid was like Saturday Night Live we were the only normal seeming human people in the whole place almost       and im not kidding and its like these its this it this i told Kyle i said if this is reflective of our society no wonder we are in such a mess and   yeah well i ts there are some some strange things   you know these were the rich people these were the you know these were i mean just the things that happened we had a bulimic in front of us and she just looked crazy but yet she had money   uhhuh   and um she was just so friendly and i asked the manager as we checked out i said is that lady a ballerina or what and he goes he said no shes a bulimic   um   because she was so skinny and then all these other people are coming up around us and   yeah   uh this one man they went to check on their ticket and the other man at their table started taking their plates and and in fear just piling their food on his plate and shoving it in his mouth i mean this was in one night and i was just sitting there thinking now   youre yeah youre kidding   i he did its like said they   you mean its that at a like a stranger a total stranger   uh no he was sitting at the table with um another couple   oh he was sitting at the table with them   right but he took their plates up and made sure they didnt see him and i think he was the one i heard him mention about the tickets were messed up so they went to take care of the tickets he took their plates and began eating his eating their food       im not kidding my husband was like totally freaking out he said i cant believe it look at that       but and i you know what i mean i they were right next to us and it was obvious that they didnt know and so and he ate it all before they got back and everything and so   yeah   i just thought no i dont know if theres an answer to the people not going to vote when they  when our society is falling apart like it is i dont know if people   yes yeah maybe we dont want those people voting   i know yeah i know and they you know these are probably some of the lobbyists in Washington i cant help but think that either   yeah yes yeah thats thats   is it no seriously because these were this was a nice North Dallas this was not we werent over on Cedar Springs or Harry Hines or anything you know   yeah yeah thats uh   so anyway i think our society is just worse off than i realized thats what i thought   thats im going to have to start going out to eat more often id i guess i would like to see some things like that   we live in Euless now we dont see that in Euless too much but you know thats what it i mean it was just absolutely maybe it was just that night right   yeah a a full moon last night or something   but i dont think so i i have a feeling thats more reflective of our government and everything then     yeah well thats our time   well theres your  another call  well i think we had a good call and so okay have a good day bye   okay yeah i enjoyed it thank you uhhuh okay byebye
