                    Background        The location and numbers of intercostal muscle        mechanoreceptors suggest that they mediate the transduction        of chest wall contractile mechanics       Intercostal        muscle spindles have been identified histologically            These afferents increase their discharge frequency during        inspiration and decrease their activity during expiration            Intercostal muscle mechanoreceptors enter the spinal        cord through the thoracic dorsal roots     These chest        wall mechanoreceptors are responsible for segmental and        intersegmental proprioceptive feedback from the intercostal        muscles Intercostal afferents have been shown to alter        inspiratory muscle motor activity        The        activity of respiratory muscle afferents provides essential        muscle mechanical information during ventilation            This is supported by previous reports that have shown these        receptors to be sensitive to changes in muscle length and        stretch velocity and are active during spontaneous        breathing               There have been relatively few studies investigating the        mechanical transduction properties of intercostal muscle        mechanoreceptors with mechanical stimulation confined to        the tidal breathing range      Hindlimb muscle        preparations      and similar studies have shown        that there are two basic types of muscle spindles        receptors  and  endings The  muscle spindles were        shown to be more responsive to the velocity of stretch and        the  afferents were sensitive to static length changes A        third type of mechanoreceptor the Golgi tendon organ        GTO was also responsive to muscle movement        contraction Von Euler  Peretti    found that all        three types of mechanoreceptors GTOs  and  muscle        spindles increase their discharge frequency in response to        changes in muscle length and stretch velocity in the tidal        breathing range This is supported by intraaxonal        recording of  muscle spindles demonstrating increased        discharge with inspiration during tidal breathing in the        cat     While it is known that intercostal        mechanoreceptors are sensitive to muscle motion the        specific afferent response to independently controlled        changes in muscle displacement and velocity over the tidal        volume range of rib motion is unknown It was hypothesized        that intercostal muscle  muscle spindles  muscle        spindles and GTOs transduce muscle length changes with        increased length associated with increased discharge        frequency It was further hypothesized that  intercostal        muscle spindles and GTOs also code muscle velocity changes        with increased velocity associated with an increase in        discharge frequency                    Results        Fiftysix intercostal muscle mechanoreceptors were        localized Muscle spindles accounted for  of these        mechanoreceptors  were identified as Golgi tendon        organs and  mechanoreceptors were not characterized The        receptive field locations of these afferents were        distributed throughout the intercostal muscle Fig  The        receptive fields of the isolated mechanoreceptors were        discretely localized within a    mm circumferential        area The muscle spindles were distributed evenly along the        dorsalventral extent of the th intercostal space The        Golgi tendon organs were located primarily along the caudal        edge of the fixed cranial rib with a few isolated along the        cranial edge of the caudal rib        Eleven receptors were identified as  muscle spindles        and  were characterized as  muscle spindles The         afferents possessed higher conduction velocities CV            msec than  endings CV     msec        although there was an overlap between the two Fig  The         mechanoreceptors classified as Golgi tendon organs had a        mean CV of    msec        Muscle spindles were studied with and without intact        ventral roots There was no significant difference in the L                init static discharge frequencies after        the ventral roots were severed indicating there was no        appreciable activity in gamma motor axons Increasing ICS        displacement resulted in an increased discharge frequency        in all  muscle spindles Fig  The L         init static discharge frequency for all         muscle spindles was    spikessec The slope of        static displacement discharge frequency was found to be         spikessecmm Fig  The range of static displacement        discharge frequency for  afferents was found to be           spikessec at  m displacement to    spikessec        at  m displacement The peak instantaneous frequency        of  muscle spindles occurred during the ramp phase of        displacement The peak instantaneous frequency also        increased with increasing velocity of stretch  muscle        spindles had a characteristic adaptation of discharge        frequency at the end of the ramp phase of stretch The L         init static discharge and static hold        phase discharge frequencies were unaffected by ventral root        section        The  muscle spindles were also found to increase their        discharge frequency with increasing amplitudes of        intercostal space displacement The L         init static discharge frequency of the         muscle spindles was not affected by ventral root        section The response of  muscle spindles to increasing        displacement amplitudes had a slope of  spikessecmm        The mean L         init static discharge of these afferents        was    spikessec Fig  The range for displacement        frequencies for  muscle spindles was    at  m to           spikessec at  m        Golgi tendon organs increased their discharge frequency        with increasing displacement amplitudes Most of the GTOs        had only small increases in frequency with static changes        in intercostal muscle length The slope of the curve was         spikessecmm The mean L         init static discharge frequency for        GTOs was    spikessec Fig  The range of        displacement discharge frequencies was    to           spikessec        The group mean L         init static discharge frequency for         afferents was    spikessec The range of peak        instantaneous frequencies for  afferents was           spikessec at  mmsec velocity to    spikessec        at  mmsec velocity Fig  The curve was sinusoidal        so the slope of the middle linear range of the sinusoidal        curve between stretch velocities of  to  mmsec was         spikessec mmsec  The static discharge hold        phase frequency for  muscle spindles was           spikessec         muscle spindles increased peak instantaneous        frequencies with increasing intercostal muscle stretch        velocity Fig  The range of discharge frequency was           spikessec at  mmsec to    spikessec at         mmsec intercostals muscle stretch velocity The slope of        the frequency response for  afferents was  spikessec        mmsec and was taken from stretch velocities between         and  mmsec The static hold phase frequency was           spikessec and the L         init static discharge frequency was           spikessec  muscle spindles were found to have the        lowest velocity sensitivity of the three types of        mechanoreceptors studied        Golgi tendon organs mean L         init static discharge frequencies was           spikessec Fig  The peak instantaneous frequency        range for GTOs was from    to    spikessec as        velocities were increased from    mmsec GTOs        were found to possess a sensitivity of  spikessec        mmsec between stretch velocities of  and         mmsec The GTOs had a mean static hold phase frequency of           spikessec                    Discussion        The results of this study provide a systematic        description of the mechanosenitivity of the three types of        intercostal muscle mechanoreceptors  muscle spindles         muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs These        mechanoreceptors have discharge properties that transduce        the magnitude and velocity of intercostal muscle length        changes into an afferent code that is transmitted to the        central nervous system via their spinal dorsal roots These        afferents were located throughout the intercostal muscles        All the mechanoreceptors studied increased their frequency        of discharge with increased velocities of intercostal space        stretch With the exception of three Golgi tendon organs        all of the mechanoreceptors increased their frequency of        discharge with increased magnitudes of intercostal space        displacement These afferents enter the spinal cord through        the thoracic dorsal spinal roots and provide essential        information to the central nervous system on intercostal        muscle mechanics        In the present study intercostal muscle        mechanoreceptors were characterized as muscle spindles        primary or secondary or Golgi tendon organs using        criteria based primarily on physiological response patterns        see Methods It has been shown by others that compared to        muscles in the cat hindlimb where spindle classification        can be based almost entirely on conduction velocity        nonlimb muscles contain primary and secondary muscle        spindle afferents that are generally slower conducting and        exhibit overlapping bimodal or unimodal conduction velocity        spectra      These studies have shown that only the        very fastest afferents innervate primary endings         ms and the negatively adapting discharge frequency during        static hold and the abrupt decrease in firing at the end of        static stretch are the best criteria for characterization        of primary spindle afferents In the present study        intercostal muscle spindles exhibited a bimodal but        overlapping conduction velocity distribution necessitating        the use of these physiological criteria        The maximal displacement amplitude used in this study        was  m This magnitude is approximately equal to the        change in intercostal muscle length recorded during a tidal        breath with artificial and spontaneous respiration               Mechanoreceptors were recorded from the intercostal        muscles of the th intercos tal space These are the lower        parasternal intercostal muscles and increases in their        length can occur during spontaneous and mechanical        ventilation Von Euler  Peretti    used a change in        intercostal muscle length of  mm at a velocity of        approximately  mmsec to study intercostal        mechanoreceptors The present study used a velocity range        of  mmsec   mmsec to span the velocities observed        in spontaneously breathing and ventilated animals The        responsiveness of intercostal muscle mechanoreceptors to        stretch velocities and displacement amplitudes used in the        present study encompassed the physiologic range of        intercostal muscle motion        The intercostal muscle spindles localized in this study        show that  and  afferents could be found with equal        frequency along the dorsal  ventral extent of the        intercostal space Golgi tendon organs were also evenly        distributed along the intercostal space at the tendinous        attachment of the muscle to the rib None of the receptors        localized in these experiments were found in the most        ventral regions of the rib cage This is consistent with        the results of Von Euler  Peretti     who found        intercostal muscle spindles in the cat to be evenly        distributed along the dorsal  ventral extent with a slight        decrease in the numbers of afferents towards the more        ventral aspects This decrease in the number of afferents        ventrally may be related to the fact that all of the        receptors studied were recorded from the rostral three        dorsal rootlets supplying the th intercostal space These        rootlets were used primarily due to their longer length        compared to the more caudal rootlets Intercostal muscle        mechanoreceptors are distributed throughout the        intercostals muscle with afferent nerve fibers distributed        throughout all the dorsal rootlets The activity of the        mechanoreceptors functioning within the more rostral        rootlets were randomly recorded in the present study and        should be representative for the discharge properties of        the afferents throughout the intercostal space        The static displacement sensitivity for intercostal        muscle mechanoreceptors has not been studied previously         muscle spindles were found to possess the highest firing        frequency range with displacements to  m Cooper           recorded muscle spindle response to static displacements in        cat soleus muscle and found sensitivities of         spikessecmm for  spindles and  spikessecmm for         afferents when the muscle was stretched in  mm increments        to  mm displacement The results of the present study are        similar to the sensitivities reported for the cat soleus        muscle but differ from muscles of the digits in cats These        differences are probably due to the significant mechanical        variations in the function of these different muscle        groups The intercostal muscle has a unique attachment        between the ribs that results in an angle of           degrees between the muscle fibers and the rib A linear        displacement of the rib space will therefore not produce a        linear displacement of muscle fibers The change in fiber        length is probably less than the change in space width        resulting in an underestimation of the displacement        sensitivity This is particularly true for changes in        tension and the associated discharge of the GTO The        experiments described above show that tendon organs are        responsive to static changes in intercostal muscle length        but at a sensitivity lower than that of either the  or         muscle spindles Increasing the width of the intercostal        space may change the length of the muscle fibers less than        space width producing smaller changes in muscle tension        This would reduce the stimulation of GTOs and their        displacement sensitivity would be underestimated While the        absolute sensitivity to fiber displacement may be        underestimated for the mechanoreceptors recorded in this        study the above results do provide important        quantification of the sensitivity of intercostal        mechanoreceptors to changes in the functional displacement        of the intercostal space        The dynamic sensitivities of the receptors were found to        correspond to the ranges of discharge frequencies of        afferents characterized by other investigators              Matthews    found that deefferented  muscle spindles        in the soleus muscle of the cat responded to varied        velocity changes    mmsec in the range of           spikessec Discharge frequencies found for primary        muscle spindles in the present study are also similar to        those for  afferents in other muscles with intact        innervation      and without innervation              In these studies the  muscle spindles were found        to possess the greatest sensitivity to changes in velocity        Our finding of a decrease in the frequency response at the        highest velocity of stretch used  mmsec shows a        limitation of the primary muscle spindle in coding for        rapid length changes        Matthews    described a frequency range for two         afferents to be approximately    spikessec with        velocity changes of  mmsec to  mmsec to a final        length change of  mm in the soleus muscle of the cat The        instantaneous burst frequencies obtained in this study for         afferents were also similar to those found in other        studies       The results obtained by these        investigators were from hindlimb muscles of the cat at           different velocities ranging from    mmsec        Intercostal muscle afferents studied by Critchlow  Von        Euler    were shown to discharge at rates of           spikessec during the inspiratory phase but were not        characterized as being either  or  muscle spindles The        velocity of intercostal width change was not determined in        their study In the present study the  afferents were        found to discharge with a slope of  spikessec        mmsec and were the least sensitive of the three        types of respiratory mechanoreceptors to dynamic changes in        intercostal muscle fiber length        The Golgi tendon organs in this study were found to have        a much greater response to the dynamic phase of intercostal        muscle stretch compared to the static response Von Euler         Peretti    reported that a few GTOs in cat        intercostal muscle could follow vibrational frequencies        within the range of  muscle spindles This suggests that        the Golgi tendon organs supplying respiratory musculature        may be more sensitive to changes in muscle mechanics than        those functioning in other muscle groups Houk         Henneman    considered the variable response of GTO        discharge to tension changes to be due to differences in        motor unit recruitment These differences ie numbers of        muscle fibers activated either parallel to or inseries        with the mechanoreceptor create changes in the afferent        receptive field and alter its discharge properties Passive        length changes caused a linear increase in force acting on        these receptors On the other hand the forces acting on        the receptor with active contraction were dependent on the        motor units activated When the motor units inseries with        the receptor were activated there was a linear force        applied to the receptor resulting in increased impulse        discharge However if the neighboring extrafusal fibers        were stimulated to contract they unload the tendon organ        thus bringing it to a subthreshold level Houk         Henneman    also found the GTOs to exhibit a saturation        effect where by the responses to one motor unit and that of        a second motor unit did not sum algebraically The primary        role of this type of intercostal mechanoreceptor is        hypothesized to be the same as in other muscle groups ie        the transduction and coding of muscle tension        The results of the present study provide a unique        demonstration of intercostal muscle mechanoreceptor        transduction properties throughout a wide range of        intercostal muscle displacement magnitudes and velocities        These afferents transduce the intercostal muscle mechanical        events into a neural code that projects to the central        nervous system    via thoracic spinal dorsal roots                    Conclusions        The results of this study provide a systematic        description of the mechanosenitivity of the  types of        intercostal muscle mechanoreceptors These mechanoreceptors        have discharge properties that transduce the magnitude and        velocity of intercostal muscle length These afferents        transduce the intercostal muscle mechanical events into a        neural code that projects to the central nervous        system                    Methods                  Displacement protocol          The response to intercostal muscle displacement was          determined by applying graded amplitudes of stretch to          the intercostal space The intercostal space was set at L                    init  the width measured at FRC The          displacement amplitudes were applied above L           init  The amplitudes were                     and           m These displacements were presented at a constant          velocity of  mmsec Each displacement test was          initiated by activating the displacement motor which          pulled the caudal rib at a constant velocity to the          predetermined amplitude The stretch was then maintained          for  seconds after which the displacement motor          returned the rib to L           init  There was a  second rest          period before the next displacement test was initiated          The discharge of the afferent was recorded throughout the          stretch          The displacement protocol began with at least           displacement stretches of  m to provide a constant          stretch history in the muscle The ICS was displaced at          each amplitude  times in an ascending order of          amplitudes The response of the mechanoreceptors to          graded displacement of the ICS was determined by          measuring the frequency of discharge at two different          points during the applied stretch The first measurement          was taken at L           init  This frequency was the baseline          discharge of the respiratory muscle afferent The second          discharge frequency was determined  seconds after the          end of the ramp phase Fig  The discharge frequency          at this point was termed the static hold phase          frequency                          Velocity protocol          The response of RMAs to dynamic changes in intercostal          muscle length was determined by varying the stretch          velocities of the intercostal space This experimental          trial followed the displacement test The intercostal          space was set at L           init and the velocities applied to          displacements above L           init The velocities tested were                 and  mmsec Each velocity          test was initiated by activating the displacement motor          to deliver a  m displacement at the predetermined          velocity The displacement was maintained for  seconds          after the completion of the velocity ramp The rib was          then returned to L           init and the muscle allowed to rest          for  seconds The next velocity test was then          initiated Each velocity was tested  times The          discharge of the afferent was recorded throughout the          stretch The velocity protocol again began with a series          of  displacement stretches to  m to provide a          constant stretch history          The response of the intercostal muscle afferents to          graded changes in displacement velocity were then          determined The discharge frequencies measured were the          peak instantaneous static hold phase and L           init static discharge frequencies The          peak instantaneous frequency was obtained during the ramp          stretch of the intercostal muscle and was the maximum          frequency of discharge The static L           init discharge and static hold phase          frequencies were taken from positions as described in the          displacement protocol                          Data analysis          Afferents were classified as Golgi tendon organs if          electrical stimulation of the adjacent extrafusal muscle          fibers caused the receptor to increase its discharge          frequency Those afferents that exhibited a pause in          discharge frequency as the extrafusal fibers contracted          silent period were classified as muscle spindles               Primary muscle spindles were differentiated from          secondary muscle spindles with the satisfaction of at          least two out of three criteria tested on every afferent           a conduction velocity   msec  an increase in          discharge frequency at  m displacement reflecting a          low stretch threshold  an abrupt decrease in frequency          discharge at the end of stretch that returned to L           init static discharge levels In          addition to these criteria the frequency discharge at          the end of the dynamic phase of stretch was used as a          distinguishing characteristic of  and  muscle          spindles Those spindles that decreased discharge          frequency gradually to static hold phase levels could be          identified as primary endings Secondary afferents          reached static hold phase discharge frequency at the end          of ramp stretch and showed little adaptation during the          static phase These differentiation criteria have been          used by others in studies of nonlimb muscles where          conduction velocity of only the very fastest spindle          fibers can be associated with primary spindle endings               The data recorded on magnetic tape was analyzed          with the aid of the Spike  Cambridge Electronics          Design Ltd computer program The analog signal from          the LVDT transducer connected to the displacement motor          provided a measure of length changes and the output was          sent from the magnetic tape recorder to a digitizing          signal processor CED  The afferent spikes were          passed through a slopeheight window discriminator          Frederick Haer  Co and then sent to the signal          processor as transistor transistor logic TTL pulses          The digitizing rate of the afferent signal was  Hz          The program was designed to provide the instantaneous          frequency of the afferent spikes at the corresponding          amplitudes of the displacement motor that produced the          muscle stretch          The response frequencies used for analysis of the          displacement coding properties included the baseline or L                    init static discharge and the static          hold phase frequency The velocity protocol recorded          these static frequencies in addition to the peak          frequency obtained during the dynamic phase of stretch          The data were grouped by afferent population and graphed          as means  Standard Error SE with the dependent          variable being spike frequency and the independent          variable being amplitude andor velocity of muscle          stretch An ANOVA and Scheffes test for multiple          comparisons were used to compare the coding properties of          three populations of mechanoreceptors
