                    Background        Chemokines are small positively charged secreted        proteins that consist of an Nterminal region of variable        conformation three antiparallel betapleated sheets        connected by loops and a Cterminal alpha helix            These proteins are multifunctional with different regions        of the molecules in particular the N and Ctermini        performing specific functions eg               Chemokines are best known for their functions in        attracting and activating leukocytes Shortly after injury        these small cytokines are primarily produced by        fibroblasts chemoattract leukocytes and activate their        integrins causing them to adhere strongly to the        endothelial cells as a prelude to their migration through        the blood vessel wall to the underlying tissue and towards        the source of the chemokine     In addition to these        functions during the early stages of wound healing these        small cytokines are also known to be involved in        reepithelialization angiogenesis and granulation tissue        development        processes that are critical for        proper healing        The first evidence that chemokines are associated with        wound healing         in vivo was reported in  using        the chemokine cCAF chicken Chemotactic and Angiogenic        Factor the product of the E gene a CXC chemokine that        is now known to be the ortologue for human IL            cCAF is expressed to high levels very shortly after        wounding and during the first  hours after injury and        remains elevated for at least  days after wounding             It is primarily expressed by the fibroblasts of the        granulation tissue especially where interstitial collagen        Coll is abundant but the levels are also high in the        endothelial cells of the microvessels in the healing        epidermis and in the connective tissue beneath the skin             In the chicken chorioallantoic membrane CAM assay        low concentration of cCAF results in chemotaxis of        monocytemacrophages and lymphocytes and the formation of a        granulationlike tissue beneath the chemokinecontaining        pellet     After four days of exposure to this        chemokine the ectoderm of the CAMs becomes thickened and        the amount of fibrillar collagen in the tissue is markedly        increased strongly suggesting that cCAF is able to        initiate some of the primary events that lead to        granulation tissue formation            Fibroblasts are important cells in the healing process        Upon injury they are activated by the cytokines and growth        factors released during the coagulation process to produce        chemokines and additional cytokines and growth factors that        are important in setting up the cascade of events that lead        to granulation tissue formation Activated fibroblasts        proliferate and migrate across the provisional matrix        formed by the fibrinplasma fibronectin FN clot As the        clot is digested by plasmin fibroblasts replace it with        cellular FN tenascin TN and Coll III      These        extracellular matrix proteins are critical for migration of        endothelial cells keratinocytes and additional fibroblasts        into the wound and are important for proper generation of        healthy healing tissue Some of the fibroblasts        differentiate into myofibroblasts which contract to close        the wound       Myofibroblasts are fibrogenic        showing elevated expression of interstitial collagens        laminin FN and TN and inhibitors of matrix        metalloproteinases such as TIMP                Because cCAF is expressed highly in the granulation tissue        of wounds in areas where ECM is abundant       and        it stimulates fibroblasts to differentiate into        myofibroblasts     we investigated whether this        chemokine stimulates the production of the four major ECM        molecules mentioned above interstitial Colls I and III TN        and cellular FN Here we show that cCAF stimulates cultures        of fibroblasts to produce TN FN and Coll I albeit with        different dynamics and that these ECM molecules are also        increased in wounded tissues treated with cCAF                    Results                  Effects of cCAF and its peptides on the production          of TN          In adults TN specifically TN C is present almost          exclusively in the granulation tissue of healing wounds               In addition to providing a matrix for rapid          migration of cells during wound repair TN supports          differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts              which then produce more TN than do normal fibroblasts               Because cCAF stimulates fibroblasts to          differentiate into myofibroblasts we tested the          possibility that this chemokine also affects TN          production Immunolabeling of cells treated daily for          four days with  ngml of the chemokine showed that          cCAF stimulates the cells to produce more TN than the          control cells Fig A B We have previously          determined using dosedependent studies that this          concentration is optimal for functions of this chemokine          on these embryonic fibroblasts and in processes of          granulation tissue formation      Although          chemokine concentrations of   ngml can          chemoattract and activate leukocytes chemokines acting          on other cell types such as endothelial cells smooth          muscle cells and fibroblasts require concentrations in          the range of  ngml and higher        This          is within physiological range for example wound fluid          from burn patients contain MGSA a chemokine that is          highly homologous to cCAF concentrations of            ngml     Because both the Nterminal and          Cterminal peptides of cCAF have been shown to be          functional in culture and           in vivo   we also tested          these two peptides Fig  The Nterminal aa peptide          produced an effect at least as strong as the whole          molecule Fig C whereas the effects of the Cterminal          peptide aa was closer to those of the control Fig          D Western blot analysis of extracts from treated          fibroblasts confirmed that cCAF increases production of          TN in culture that this effect also can be accomplished          effectively by the Npeptide but that the Cpeptide          produced an elevated but substantially smaller response          than either the Npeptide or the whole cCAF molecule          Fig E To determine whether cCAF stimulates TN          expression we examined the levels of mRNA for this ECM          molecule RTPCR analysis showed significant increased          levels of mRNA for TN after treatment with either cCAF or          its Npeptide Fig F but the increase stimulated by          the Cterminus is much smaller correlating with the small          increase in protein levels          To determine whether this effect is also observed           in vivo  excision wounds were made          on the underside of wings of  weekold chicks To avoid          variations in genetic background for each bird one wing          was treated with vehicle and the other with cCAF and          treatments were applied every other day for  days In          normal wound healing TN appeared at days  and          disappeared during remodeling which begins around day           after wounding Therefore tissues were collected at days           and  after wounding and analyzed for TN by          immunostaining and western blot analysis Fig A          B Immunoblot analysis of protein extracted from          control wounds confirmed that TN deposition begun by           days and that it increased dramatically by  days Fig          C Control In contrast by  days cCAFtreated wounds          already contained as much TN as the control at  days and          that by  days the TN is dramatically reduced by the          ongoing processes of repair Fig C cCAF Thus the          addition of the chemokine to wounds shifts the peak of TN          in the wound tissues to earlier stages of wound healing          than in control wounds                          Effects of cCAF and its peptides on the production          of FN          Cellular FN is abundantly present in granulation          tissue is produced primarily by the wound fibroblasts          and myofibroblasts Fibroblast cultures treated as for          TN produced much more FN as shown by immunolabeling          Figs A B and immunoblot analysis Fig E          Unlike TN this effect can only be accomplished by the          whole cCAF molecule immunolabeling and immunoblot          analysis of cells treated with the Npeptide Fig          C E or Cpeptide Fig D E revealed          similar FN levels to control Unlike TN cCAF did not          affect FN mRNA levels Fig F           In vivo  immunostaining for FN           days after making excision wounds showed that levels of          this protein are high in the healing tissues and that          treatment with cCAF increased FN accumulation in the          granulation tissue Fig A B Immunoblot analysis          for FN extracted from excision wounds showed that by           days after injury the cCAFtreated wounds contained more          FN than the control wounds but that the levels by  days          are similar to those of the control Fig C          Taken together the results in culture and           in vivo suggest that the chemokine          does not stimulate FN gene expression but rather may          directly or indirectly affect stability of this protein          Therefore we tested the possibility that cCAF treatment          leads to stability of the protein by stimulating decrease          in matrix degrading enzymes In chickens plasmin          generated from plasminogen by plasminogen activator PA          degrades much of the FN To investigate whether activity          of PA might be decreased with cCAF treatment leading to          accumulation of FN we examined the levels of PA          activity Our results showed that there is no detectable          PA activity in untreated or treated fibroblasts whereas          the activity is high in RSVtransformed CEFs tCEFs Fig          A which are known to produce high levels of PA              Because PA does not appear to be activated by cCAF we          tested the possibility that the stability of FN is due to          a decrease in MMP productionactivation In humans          MMP MMP and MMP stromelysins are the most          active proteases for FN but these molecules have not          been isolated in chickens However we can test for          general activity of these MMPs in the chicken system by          zymography using casein as substrate Fig B Whereas          the positive control trypsin was able to digest the          substrate at specific sites in the gel the supernatants          of our treated fibroblasts did not This suggests that          the stromelysins are not active in this system or that          our test is not sensitive enough To further investigate          whether MMPs are involved in the cCAF induced high levels          of FN will require evaluation of matrixdegrading enzymes          specific for chickens and is an ongoing project in our          laboratory as we obtaindevelop probes for theses MMPs          However another possible mechanism for the cCAFinduced          FN accumulation could be linked to an increase in TN          TNC knockout mice show decreased accumulation of FN in          wounded tissue and this decrease has been hypothesized to          be due to disrupted incorporation of FN into the matrix          in the absence of TNC      To determine whether          cCAFinduced TN production is involved in the increase in          FN observed after cCAF treatment we used antisense          phosphothioated oligonucleotides to inhibit TN          production Sense oligonucleotides did not have an effect          on cCAFinduced TN or FN production However the          antisense oligonucleotides were able to significantly          decrease the production of both TN and FN Fig C                          Effects of cCAF and its peptides on the production          of Colls I and III          To determine whether cCAF stimulates fibroblasts to          produce increased levels of Colls I and III we treated          cultures as for TN Immunoblot analysis for Coll I showed          that cCAF but not the N or Cpeptides caused a small          increase in Coll I protein levels Fig A Probing the          same blots for Coll III revealed no cCAFinduced          difference in the level of production of this protein          Fig B           In vivo Coll I was also slightly          increased by treatment with the chemokine at  days after          wounding but did not increase to higher levels than the          control at  days whereas the same blots probed for Coll          III showed similar levels in treated and control at both           and  days Figure C          The effect on Coll I could be due to remodeling of          this protein by proteases induced by the chemokine          Therefore we tested whether cCAF affects the production          or activity of the gelatinases MMP or MMP or the          collagenase MMP all of which digest collagens I and          III Using zymography we found that treatment with cCAF          or the peptides does not alter the levels of proMMP and          there was no detectable levels of proMMP Fig A          However immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal antibody          to human MMP this reagent is not available for the          chicken homologue of this matrix metalloproteinase          showed that cCAF treatment caused a decrease in the          amount of the collagenase MMP detected but neither          TIMP nor TIMP two natural inhibitors of these MMPs          levels were changed as evaluated by immunoblot analysis          with a monoclonal antibody to the corresponding human          proteins Fig B                          Effects of cCAF on migration of fibroblasts          During healing fibroblasts migrate into and within          the wounded tissue and lay down the extracellular matrix          that forms the granulation tissue These ECM molecules          especially TN and FN together stimulate cell migration          thereby facilitating the entrance and movement of          additional fibroblasts and of endothelial cells into the          wound tissue Because tissues treated with cCAF have more          FN and TN at the time that these cells are entering the          wound and chemokines are well known for their          chemoattractant properties      we tested whether          cCAF stimulates chemotaxis of fibroblasts using transwell          assays To avoid effects of gravity on cell migration          the top chamber was inverted the cells were plated on          the underside of the membrane allowed to adhere to it          and then the chamber was turned right side up The cells          were incubated overnight in standard medium to allow          expression of the cCAF receptors and the following day          cCAF was applied at increasing doses  ngml to          the top chamber only The migration assays were carried          out for  hrs We found that cCAF stimulated migration          of the fibroblasts up the concentration gradient in a          dosedependent manner Fig A To test whether the          cCAFinduced effect is due to chemotaxis we repeated the          transwell assay and compared cell migration when cCAF is          added to both wells Placing cCAF in both wells abrogated          cell migration strongly suggesting that this protein          chemoattracts fibroblasts Fig B We also tested the          effects of the chemokine on migration by using the          cloning ring assay In a specified length of time cells          treated with cCAF moved a longer distance than did          control cells corroborating the previous results that          the chemokine stimulates cell motility Fig C           In situ hybridization for cCAF          showed that the migrating fibroblasts also express higher          levels of cCAF Fig D E see also ref                                         Discussion        The work presented here shows that cCAF the IL of        chickens stimulates expression of several ECM molecules        important in development of the granulation tissue We show        that         i cCAF stimulates TN expression and        that a  aa peptide containing the Nterminal sequence        causes the same effects as the whole molecule         ii in contrast to its effects on TN        production cCAFinduced increase in FN and Coll I        accumulation requires the whole molecule         iii the increase in FN protein is not        a result of a corresponding increase in mRNA or increase        in MMP production or PA activity but appears to be linked        TN production         iv increase in Coll I correlates with        decreased levels of MMP         v cCAF chemoattracts fibroblasts and        accelerates their migration         vi treatment of excision wounds with        cCAF increased the levels of all three ECM molecules in the        granulation tissue of wounds albeit with different        dynamics This is the first demonstration that treatment of        wounds with a proinflammatory and angiogenic chemokine        accelerates development of the granulation tissue during        healing by stimulating the precocious deposition of ECM        molecules that are critical for proper healing        We showed previously that cCAF is highly expressed in        the granulation tissue of wounds      that this        chemokine and several of its human homologues stimulate        differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts both in        culture and         in vivo and that the latter effect        can be achieved very effectively by the Nterminal aas of        the protein      In addition to cCAF other CXC        chemokines have been associated with wound healing events        In the granulation tissue of burn wounds expression of        gro MGSA and CXCR the receptor for MGSA was associated        with fibroblasts smooth muscle cellsmyofibroblasts and a        subpopulation of macrophages     GroMGSA and IL        have also been shown to enhance reepithelialization of        human skin grafts in chimeric mice      It has also        been found that several CXC chemokines can modulate        angiogenesis     a process that is critical for proper        healing Some CXC chemokines such as IL and cCAF are        angiogenic         in vivo        Others such        as IP interferon and PF platelet factor are        antiangiogenic In the case of IP it has been shown        that in transgenic mice treated with this chemokine wounds        heal poorly and exhibit defects in angiogenesis and        development of the granulation tissue            Work of others has shown that TN is expressed in        association with differentiation of myofibroblasts and is        important in cell migration during healing               Here we show that cCAF and the Npeptide stimulate        fibroblasts in culture to express TN and that this increase        in TN is due to an increase in mRNA levels The increase is        lower for Cpeptide treated cells after  days in an        environment mimicking the wound these cells had lesser but        significant tenascin protein levels most likely due to the        small increase seen in mRNA In addition in wounds treated        with the chemokine TN levels are much higher at early        times after wounding but drop by  days after wounding At        this stage the wounds are closed and are beginning to        remodel in the cCAFtreated wounds while the granulation        tissue in the control wings is still maturing These data        taken together strongly suggest that as chemokines induce        the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts they        contribute to the production of TN in the granulation        tissue Our finding that the Nterminal peptide is able to        stimulate expression of TN much like the whole protein is        potentially important because this small peptide may be        useful to develop therapeutic agonists or antagonists for        wound healing        The effect of cCAF treatment on Coll I accumulation in        culture and in wounded tissues is small but reproducible        Because MMP levels were also decreased by cCAF treatment        it is possible that the small rise in Coll I levels is due        to decreased degradation of this ECM molecule by the        collagenase Another chemokine that has been associated        with Coll I production is monocyte chemotactic protein         MCP This chemokine belongs to the CC chemokine family        and stimulates Coll I production both by lung fibroblasts        taken from areas of inflammation    and in kidneys that        suffer from crescentic nephritis     The former        investigators reported that MCP increases collagen        accumulation not by decreasing the levels of the        collagenase MMP but by stimulating the production of        TGF a wellknown stimulator of collagen expression and        expression of TIMPs the natural inhibitors of MMPs In        addition to MCP IL and MGSA have also been evaluated        for production of collagen     These investigators        reported that treatment of normal fibroblasts with these        chemokines did not affect collagen levels It is not clear        from their results whether the elevation in collagen        production in normal fibroblasts may have been small like        that observed with cCAF and therefore gone unnoticed        FN accumulation due to cCAF treatment also differs from        that of TN The FN mRNA levels are not affected by cCAF        treatment but the protein accumulates in culture and in the        granulation tissue of wounds upon exposure to the        chemokine By analogy with the increase in Coll I we        hypothesized that decrease in protease levelsactivity is        involved in the accumulation of FN Plasmin resulting from        cleavage of plasminogen by plasminogen activator PA is        the major enzyme affecting FN degradation in chickens        However testing for decrease in PA activity showed that        this enzyme is not activated even in the controls        therefore it is unlikely that this would be a major        mechanism involved in degrading FN In humans there are        several MMPs that are known to degrade FN We found that        MMP levels are unaffected by cCAF treatment and that        there is no detectable MMP  and  activity as        evaluated by casein zymography using tCEFs as control for        production of these stromelysins Another FNdegrading        metalloproteinase MTMMP is unlikely to be involved        because it also activates MMP and this enzyme is not        activated by cCAF treatment        Another possible mechanism that may explain FN        accumulation could be an increase in TN TNC knockout mice        show decreased accumulation of FN in wounded tissue and        this decrease has been hypothesized to be due to disrupted        incorporation on FN into the matrix in the absence of TNC             Therefore our observation that inhibition of        cCAFinduced TN production decreases the accumulation of FN        supports the findings in the knockout mice However this        does not explain the unchanged FN levels with the Npeptide        treatment One possible explanation for these findings        could relate to the fact that FN does not selfassemble        Therefore it is possible that alterations in the        activities of integrins or adhesive sites on other ECM        molecules induced by the whole cCAF molecule and not by        the Npeptide could affect FN accumulation     We are        currently pursuing studies to determine whether adhesion        molecules or other ECM molecules play a role in FN        accumulation due to cCAFinduced TN production        Migration of fibroblasts from the area surrounding the        wound into the wound site is critical in order for        remodeling of the extracellular matrix and for wound        contraction to occur TN and FN especially in combination        promote migration therefore cCAF may facilitate fibroblast        migration by increasing TN and FN levels However this        chemokine is also able to chemoattract fibroblasts and        accelerate their migration in the absence of these        molecules strongly suggesting that it contributes to        fibroblast movement independently of the deposition of        these ECM molecule These findings suggest that during        wound healing cCAF produced by the resident fibroblasts        chemoattracts additional fibroblasts that contribute to the        production of these ECM molecules which then support        migration of both fibroblasts and other cells in the wound        tissue        TGF is another factor known to stimulate myofibroblast        differentiation ECM production and accelerate wound        closure and healing However this growth factor has a        strong inflammatory effect that leads to excess fibrosis        and scarring In addition to greatly increasing        accumulation of Colls I and III TGF has been shown to        also increase FN and TN production cCAF and maybe other        chemokines on the other hand may have a subtler more        controlled effect promoting the earlier appearance of a        normal granulation tissue without leading to excess matrix        accumulation and scarring                    Conclusions        Our results strongly suggest that cCAF plays an        important role in wound repair by activating fibroblasts to        form early granulation tissue through cell migration        myofibroblast differentiation and productionaccumulation        of ECM molecules that are critical for proper development        of the healing tissue of wounds This is a previously        unknown role for chemokines and unlike other inflammatory        factors that promote granulation tissue formation cCAF        does not appear to stimulate increased fibrosis If similar        behavior is seen in human chemokines it could be a        promising target in designing drugs that promote formation        of granulation tissue in poorly healing wounds without        causing excess scarring                    Materials and methods                  Reagents          All tissue culture supplies and the TRIzol reagent          were purchased

 Primary chicken embryonic fibroblasts were cultured as          previously described      Briefly primary          fibroblasts were isolated from dayold chicken embryos          and cultured for  days These cultures were passaged          once and used as secondary cultures at a density of             cells mm plate Due to the use of primary cells          rather than cell lines there are variations in cellular          responses between sets of cells Therefore internal          controls were always included and results from different          batches of cells were not averaged Secondary cultures          were treated with  ngml cCAF  nM or its terminal          peptides in tryptose phosphate broth and  donor          calf serum This dose of cCAF was chosen because it was          the optimal dose for inducing differentiation of          myofibroblasts cells known to produce large amounts of          ECM     Media was changed and new cCAF or peptides          added every

underside of the wings of           weekold chicks using a scalpel blade The left wing was          treated with vehicle alone and the right wing with  g          cCAF The wounds were photographed immediately after          wounding and then covered with Biocclusive bandage  l          vehicle or cCAF were deposited through the bandage onto          the wound using a gauge needle This procedure was          repeated the next day and every other day thereafter on          days   and  Samples were collected at days  and           postwounding for ECM analysis All experimental work          with animals reported here was done under full compliance          with our animal protocol approved by appropriate campus          authorities                          Preparation and staining of

tissue was          ground with glass beads in a mortar and pestle on dry          ice The powdered tissue was dissolved in RIPA containing           mM salt and a cocktail of protease inhibitors and          vortexed vigorously After centrifugation the          supernatant was used in immunoblots                          Transwell assay for migration             cells in  l  medium containing  serum          were plated on the underside of transwell membranes by          inverting the insert They were allowed to adhere for           minutes then the well was turned right side up and both          sides of the well were filled with serumcontaining          medium The cells were allowed to recover for  hrs and          express the cCAF receptors Then the medium in the top          well was changed to serumfree medium containing           ngml cCAF or   serum positive control serum free          medium alone was placed in the bottom well The cells          were allowed to migrate towards the chemoattractant for           hrs The cells on the underside of the membrane were          removed with a cotton swab The membranes were then fixed          and stained with  toludine blue in formaldehyde To          determine the number of migrated cells all cells on the          upper side of the membrane were counted Control for          chemotaxis was performed by adding  ngml cCAF to          both wells of the Transwell unit                          Cloning ring assay for migration             cells in  l  medium containing  serum          were plated in a cloning ring in a  mm plate They were          allowed to adhere for  hour then the ring was removed          the culture medium added to the plate and the cells          photographed on a phasecontrast microscope to record the          area of the cells and the edge of the ring cCAF was then          added at various doses  ngml The following day          the medium was changed and the cells were treated again          On the third day after plating the cells were          photographed once more before the experiment was          terminated To determine the extent of cell migration we          measured the distance between the edge where the cloning          ring was at day zero and the edge of the culture          delineated by the migrating front of the cells on the           rdday
