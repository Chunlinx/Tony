          well whats uh whats the best experience you can come up with uh as far as camping   oh gee the first one that comes to my mind is uh camping outside the river at the uh at New Braunfels there   oh man that sounds like a blast     yeah weve gone down there many a year   is that right   camping riding the river rapids   yeah that thats where you just float down the river right   yeah well they have some you know half way decent rapids there   on tubes an i see   its not Deliverance but its pretty good     well that sounds pretty neat i guess i guess for me um um probably the last time i went camping was uh back in high school with Boy Scouts we always took an annual trip up to uh Colorado and went fly fishing   oh really   and uh we had we had a blast up there   yeah i never tried that   it it was nice going up there and see that scenery   well i uh weve done quite a bit of camping we uh used to uh throw everything in we had some old Volkswagen buses in our years early days when we had kids and they uh wed uh you know go uh drive up into the hill country around uh oh New Braunfels and   i see   San Marcus around in through there   right   Austin up around Austin area   i see   just camp out   did they have some pretty good campsites up there   yeah uh usually wed go uh like the state parks a lot of the state parks up in through there   i see   theres quite a few of them up there uh We started off pretty rough you know pretty much roughing it and we had like i say the Volkswagen bus wed pull up and just i had fixed up the thing where you could just open up the doors id hooked on a little extension and made a tarp for  the side and and       and uh then we were set up in about five minutes ten minutes   that was a regular party machine huh   out by the side of the river yeah then we uh later on we started using a tent when wed go to uh you know tent camping   i see that sounds pretty neat   we enjoyed it uh we had three kids and uh theyve done a lot of camping with us and   right   they just seemed to like it   yeah i remember uh going with my parents uh we werent very good campers it seemed like we were never prepared and uh we i grew up right around Amarillo up in the very northern part of Texas   umhum   and uh we had a couple of lakes out there that wed go and and go fishing and then camp out and uh seemed like it always rain or something you know something had to go wrong and uh we were never prepared for it     ha   so uh it wasnt it wasnt until Boy Scouts that i really started enjoying uh going out and camping   pretty uh pretty rough up around Amarillo isnt it   it sure is uh in fact we went up there for Easter and and we we had uh a beautiful day we had a day where it snowed and then uh it rained the next day and you know you just never can tell what the weathers going to do   thats my uh one of my wifes favorite stories to tell about Easter camping trips it the coldest Easter ever         we left here uh we left here it was shorts weather in uh on Easter and   right   we went up and were going to spend on the Blanco River and we got there and a front come through and it was  it was freezing   oh Lord     we didnt of course werent prepared for it so   right oh and theres nothing worse when youre out camping if you get wet you know it   we sat there my brotherinlaw cooked chicken bless and he was dont know how in heck he managed to do it but he did he stood out there and cooked that and we had something hot to eat     thats hilarious   we got up the next morning and she said i dont know about you but she said im going into town and were going to buy some long johns     im surprised you didnt just pack up and go home i tell   so i was ready i was ready to go back to Houston   thats right thats right oh Lord i guess everybodys got those experiences when uh when things just didnt didnt go right for them   yeah thats uh sometimes turns into fun i think another similar one was when wed go uh up to Bastrop Strate State Park there in uh kind of got caught by the cold weather and we uh gathered what firewood we could and built us a campfire you know and sat around there   right   into the wee hours and uh ran out of firewood so we uh each took turns going out and gathering up big bundles of pine needles and throwing them on the fire and they didnt last very long but they burned hot   oh Lord oh Lord   i remember that that was a lot of fun   that is funny but   we uh most recently we still go camping every well not as much anymore we our kids are pretty near grown and uh   really   i uh we had uh weve used a tent you know pop up trailer   right   weve done some camping in that we still go down to the river at least try to get down there once a year   i see   Braunfels   do they have uh actual camp sites there where you can go and   yeah uhhuh   i see   theyre some theyre some theyre some what youd call primitive i mean there are no uh real  facilities and then others that have uh   facilities or yeah   theres a few that have hot and cold uh you know electricity and and hot water and so forth theres a few of those and you have to make your reservations pretty well in advance   oh you do have to make reservations there   yeah because its you know it is so nice and there limited space so   uhhuh right   we usually if were going we usually try and make them by March or so anyway   oh i see huh i didnt realize that   so its uh yeah its uh pretty nice   since its so popular its best to to have the reservations huh   well if you want to get a good camp site yeah you can go down and get a camp site pretty near any weekend they get prett y crowded on the uh you know the main July Fourth of July and   right right Memorial Day and whatever   yeah and Labor Day   yeah   that water can get pretty cold though  if you go too early   oh is that right   yeah   whens the best time to go down there for the water   we try not to go before uh July because uh it takes uh   it takes that long to get it heat up   gets warmed up yeah it comes out of the Canyon Lake up there and its uh   comes out of that deep lake and its pretty cold water you know   i see huh because my wife and i had thought about going down there uh you know just for a weekend   umhum   because we have some friends from uh that went to school in San Marcus at South Texas   yeah   and uh theyre always talking about how they rode the uh those inner tubes down the river and that sounded like a fun thatd be a fun weekend   well in addition to to the river what we call its the Guadalupe River its uh has campsites all along the river uh but then theres also Camp Warnicke where you can get cabins you know its right on the  River   hum   downtown New Braunfels   i see   and then they have the uh what they call the shoot which is uh its a bypass around the dam where they have uh the  comes right through the downtown part of New Braunfels   huh   thats a lot of fun   yeah so you can actually rent cabins there   yeah umhum at uh Camp Warnicke   and thats in thats in New Braunfels property   right in yeah right in uh almost right in downtown   huh   and uh  thats a lot of fun then they have a uh theres a commercial water park theyre called the Schlitterbahn which is a barrel of fun   i see   especially if youve got kids   yeah yeah   they have tube ride tube shoots and just and so many rides you cant almost cant do them all in a day you know   God that sounds like a blast   yeah its uh its a uh all day event   well that sounds like that might be a fun fun place to visit then   yeah   well have to give that a shot well i tell you what i guess uh i need to head out but i i appreciate the the conversation   yeah well im uh   you have a good you have a good week   hit one of my topics huh   oh good deal good deal well you have a good one   you too   all right byebye   bye
