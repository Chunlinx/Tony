            here we go i guess were on the air huh yeah well i tell you what this been pretty nice today hasnt it   yep uh yeah weve been uh real lucky here it was one of those days where you wish you uh you didnt want to have to go back into work   umhum yeah im well im on im taking some vacation this week so it didnt bother me uh im a distance runner by hobby and uh i might say it was a little humid running out there tonight i was probably wetter than i have been in some time     uhhuh huh   but uh for for a guy that likes to be outside as much as i do and run like i do this Texas is almost ideal because uh i would say probably i run three hundred days out of the three hundred and sixty five and theres probably not more than thirty of those days that i cant wear shorts and tee shirt   yeah   i mean i have to wear long sleeves and maybe some long pants and thats fine with me if i can wear shorts and tee shirt im perfectly happy   yeah i would i remember how the weather was when i was down there i got a sunburn in February working on my uh my roof in a house in Plano       so i uh i remember how it was yeah its its really great um here on the east coast weve you know we usually have the traditional April showers but it has just been so unusually wet here     yeah   weve had all the rain that they shouldve had out in California   yeah well what what what we like to do is get enough rain so not to have to water the lawn   yeah   and its been ive watered once in March and not any time in April because i figure we figure if we go five days without rain we need to water and just about every fifth day were getting rain right now   well thats great   so everything is pretty and green here and were not really uh and not having to pay money to water and uh of course of course summers summers uh i i guess uh once you get climatized and i am i mean i kind of look forward to the hundred degrees days except except for the air conditioning bills i i could i could do without the three hundred dollar electric bills   yeah i remember those yeah well weve moved into a new house uh at the end of February   umhum   and of course its a new development and theres only one house in the whole thirty houses that are here that has grass   oh for goodness sake oh i know what that means   so everything everything else is mud   that means mud in the road yep   theres mud in the road theres mud on the sidewalk theres mud in the house i mean you just cant get away from it and of course its been you know ideal weather for grass to grow   yeah yeah oh sure   and unfortunately they havent gotten around to put they you know they were waiting until they got i think the other two houses on the culdesac on one done before theyre going to plant all the grass at one time   what what do you do you put in up there do you i mean here we know we know two grasses Saint Augustine and Bermuda uh what what do you normally put in up there   uhhuh you can put in any number of grasses up here uh a lot people like the red fescue they like to mix red fescue in with uh Kentucky Blue um the uh   uhhuh   my favorite is uh a zoysia grass uh when i lived in Laura which is about sixty miles south of where im living now   uhhuh   uh that my neighbor had it and i was forever trying to get you know decent grass to grow in my yard and he talked me into trying to some plugs of the zoysia and i just loved it because the zoysia you can uh you can quite literally just plug it around the yard and it just spreads and it chokes out the weeds and the weeds cant get in there and so you dont have to weed and feed and do all that other crazy stuff you just you know the only bad part about it is during the winter the grass is brown but i mean you know   yeah uhhuh oh that happens here too   yeah   but this year of course we got uh we had a very mild winter this year with very little freeze uh so we didnt have any problem uh uh with the uh uh with the grass greening up quickly you know last year it was well into May before all the bare spots got covered   uhhuh   uh because of the of the severe winter that we had around Christmas of eighty nine but this year it uh we did have some cold days but not down in the single digits or anything like that so when things started greening up in March they greened up and everybodys grass is is is perfectly green do your homes you say you moved into a new home are homes normally built there with central air conditioning is that part of the uh the standard for a home   yes pretty much standard now   oh okay i i didnt know whether you were far enough south for that of course im im from New England my parents are there and its its unheard of there i guess anybody that wants air conditioning goes out and puts a window unit in   well the uh the thing about uh Maryland is um the last few years uh since ive been back and uh it was like that oh it started this way about mid seventies um we started having a very abbreviated Spring   umhum   you would go  from having fifty sixty degree days right into the eighty eighty five degree days which you know in Texas its not bad because the humidity is real low but here when the temperature is eighty degrees the humidity is eighty   yeah no yeah the humidity is eighty degrees along with it   and eighty per cent and and and worse i mean ive seen days here when the humidity is like ninety three a hundred per cent and its just absolutely the worst feeling in the whole world   yeah uhhum yeah im im aware of that did you have a very severe winter   uh not really we had uh a couple uh real good snow storms uh but they were the kind that came stayed for a couple of days and then melted off and thats the best kind to have around here   umhum okay yeah yeah we we had zero snow here in fact we havent had any measurable accumulation now in six or seven years uh   yeah i remember the uh ice storm back in uh nineteen eighty eight   yeah that was a nice one too that was an ice storm there and uh uh i remember one year   yeah   i cant tell you the exact year it was probably about uh eighty seventy nine or eighty that we had such a severe ice storm that it uh knocked tree limbs down on the wires and there were some uh four hundred thousand homes out of electricity   wow   and i know it was after seventy eight because we built our home here in seventy eight and it was a new development that didnt have any trees yet so we had electricity and we had fifteen people camped out on our floor in sleeping bags   jeez   and and unfortunately when it thawed then most everybodys houses got filled with water too  and uh but we we were fortunate that year and even at that this development was built in seventy eight and even now all all the utilities run under ground   oh God uhhuh   so theres still no big trees in the development but the uh uh all all the utilities so we we wouldnt have to look forward to that but we had a uh we had a mild winter as i say the previous year we had three or four days uh it it wasnt much it was only about a week and i think it was the week just prior to Christmas when the temperature got down into the single digits and as a result a lot of the the trees and uh the grass and shrubbery was killed uh was killed out and at this time last year nothing looked very good but it it does right now uh at this time last year we were under water most of Texas was under water uh if you remember uh uh uh downtown Dallas you could go down and look up in the Reunion Tower and look over toward the Trinity River and it looked like lakes not a river   yes yeah i remember that   and uh Lake Texoma was up uh twenty feet over flood level   wow   uh at at this time last  year it was it was uh it was pretty bad but uh im im hoping you know you you dont want anything to flood but you want to get normal rain and uh were probably some where near normal right now   yeah i noticed uh tonight when i was out driving around that the uh the one of the main reservoirs in the county i live in is uh fuller that ive ever seen it i mean its its up over its banks but its not that far over its banks   how long have you been back in Maryland from Texas   uh moved back here in uh eighty nine yes so i spent two uh just about two years exactly in Texas   eighty nine okay yeah and where did you say you lived in Plano   uh yeah i lived in Plano um worked at Spring Creek for a while and was on the moon job and then when my clearance came through for APD i worked for DSEG uh worked at North Billings for a while and then down at Love Field   uhhuh yeah oh okay okay thats a nice facility at Spring Creek isnt it thats the thats the Taj Mahal of TI facilities   oh God i tell you it spoils you rotten to work there you you work there and they send you any place else its like youve been demoted   yeah well well were in the i dont know if youre familiar with the center complex uh in in Dallas its across LBJ from the main TI site its three glass buildings and that for someone thats been at TI thirty two years this is kind of unTI like too   right i had a uh a uh an employee that i hired there Lita Mytek Lita Mytek i mean she uh she worked over in the building at Center Three i think it was and uh you know she said she liked it over there   yeah yeah im in im in center one the big thing that i think other than the fact that weve all got double the size offices weve ever had anywhere else and its so quiet that you can hear a pin drop to me the big advantage and i didnt realize it when we came over here is the covered parking it is amazing in the middle of the summer when its a hundred and ten out to go out and be able to get into your car and touch the steering wheel       which we could never do parked outside of the SC Building or the South Building or various other places that ive i worked and and you notice the finish on your car lasts longer when you wash it it stays clean longer   yeah uhhuh   uh it is is uh uh to me to me thats thats probably one of the biggest advantages that weve got over there plus im in center one and the credit union is down on the first floor and it seems that im always always there ive got a daughter away from college away at college thats always out of money so its easy i can get down to the credit union quite often and uh are you looking forward to a hot summer there now     um id id prefer it not to be that hot uh the the days usually arent arent that bad um its just when the humidity gets up i mean its like last week we had a day it was i think it was eighty degrees but the humidity for some strange reason was only nineteen per cent and that   uhhuh uhhuh oh that thats Texas like   yeah that was a rarity for here and God it was just beautiful   thats Texas like did you ever get out to Midland while you were here   no i never did
