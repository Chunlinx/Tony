        okay so what kind of cars are you looking at   well weve uh weve weve test driven the Oldsmobile Delta eighty eight and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac about three or four years old   umhum umhum   because uh i get married in a couple of weeks and i have two kids and my fiancee has two kids so we need we need a car thats big enough for six   umhum yeah   and so that we went i guess it was two weekends ago we went uh car shopping and looked around uh   umhum   we found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway   umhum   that uh in addition to to getting a new car there they can get you a car thats new but its been uh a demonstrator model   oh okay   for uh two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car   uhhuh   so they call this program cars and they come with a new car warranty and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that   right thats a real good deal in fact my dad recently got a um a Pontiac uh believe six thousand   uhhuh   and he got a a demo and its been a real good car and its its like new and it only had had very very low mileage on it   okay yeah uhhuh sure   and so he i think he got a real good deal of course theyre fully loaded usually so its i think its a pretty good option   oh yeah yeah i think so too   are the uh Oldsmobiles that youre looking at are they the demos or they used are they new   well the the ones that we were test driving were the uh were the new ones there umhum well now um   uhhuh   now they may be the demonstrator models but that the sales reps drive around in   umhum and then the Cadillac is is definitely a used car or uhhuh   yeah it was in eighty eight the guy said itd been on the lot about thirty minutes he says itll probably be gone in a day and its probably gone by now   oh no   those things go fast   uhhuh   um uh of course were were not we cant consider getting a brand new Cadillac because those are twenty twenty five to thirty thousand dollars but when theyre three years old theyre the price already drops in half   yeah umhum   so then it becomes uh more realistic   right thats what im thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new or do i want to look for a used car thats maybe two three years old that but thats you know low mileage and in good shape   uhhuh yeah   but i just i kind of worry about getting a car thats that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it is it a lemon or  or is something wrong with it but i guess thats a risk you have to take   thats right thats right well you can reduce that risk by uh having the car checked out i mean you know you you if youre going to look at fifty different cars you dont want to do this but if youve narrowed it down to one or two   umhum umhum   you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they dont have any financial interest in it   umhum right   and then youll have a realistic assessment of what youre getting   umhum about how much do they charge to do something like that do you know   oh im thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars   yeah thats not bad   no huhuh   itd be well worth it if youre considering buying a car  to find out yeah   i i would i would think so   yeah well its kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago and i yes i dont want to think about buying a car for a while i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and   isnt that a good feeling thats right   and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and uh you know hang on to the one ive got for a few years because its its its almost four years old but its still in great shape i have a Mazda RX   well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for for three or four years and when youre ready to get another car just pay cash for it   umhum yeah i just about could really because i think my car if i continue taking good care of it its going to hold a pretty good resale value and uh that if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldnt have too much trouble at all   yeah oh yeah umhum yeah i would i would think thats true   could you hold on for just a moment okay   sure   okay im on a cordless phone and i was picking up uh some background noise so i just switched the channel up on it i didnt want to interfere with whatever theyre trying to record so  anyway   right right thats fine   but uh i really i really enjoy the car i have now and i do want to hold onto it and and uh you know enjoy it while its not having any mechanical problems whatsoever in fact it never has and uh   thats right thats right   its been kind of nice and i surprisingly enough after four years im not tired of the car at all and um   well   ill just hang on to it while its still being a good car and while im not tired of it and while im single and can handle a two seater for now  and get that out of my system   yeah yeah thats right thats right   because one of these days ill be getting a six seater probably too so  um   eventually yeah the first two cars i ever bought um well uh ive ive bought three cars and ive ive always bought them new the first car i kept for thirteen and a half years and got a hundred and sixty one thousand out of it   umhum wow umhum   the second car i ever bought i drive to work now that just turned ten years old and ive got a hundred and twenty two thousand miles on that   umhum   so that thats kind of been the way ive done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever   umhum   but uh my car is is using two quarts of oil a week now   oh my gosh   about about a quart every hundred miles   oh no   so uh but but uh it runs fine all you have its just very thirsty if i just keep the oil in it seems to be okay but you know thats a sign that im going to have to do something sooner or later   umhum yeah right what kind of car is it   its a a Buick Century   umhum are you going to trade it in on this new one or   uh no my fiance is selling uh a nineteen seventy eight Cutlass Supreme that she has its actually in better condition than my car   okay uhhuh   and so shes going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low   umhum so shes going to sell it rather than trade it in thats probably the best thing   yeah um you you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in   or maybe more than that as ive learned  yeah when i bought my RX i uh best offer i got for my other car was twenty five hundred well i turned around and sold it myself for forty two hundred so   oh really oh there you go   you can do much better im glad youre youre taking care of it yourself i i think trading it in they just use that as additional they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car youre buying but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in   well thats fact   thats what i think so   i think youre right   but strangely enough the best offer i mean the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price   interesting   trade in but its a place in Arlington and i think maybe as you get outside the Dallas area i kind of i bet you its kind of what i decided well maybe because its outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better   umhum   prices plus i was going through that TI fleet discount program   the okay did you did you use it  the car shop place   um well its before they had that   oh okay   i had gone over to Texins and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program and what you could expect they said you know a five percent   thats right yeah   over cost and then options at cost and everything so i figured out a price based on that   right right yeah thats good   but i i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the Town North Mazda right off central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was gonna be able to get it for in Arlington   uhhuh right   and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the and the cruise control he said youre going to get a car thats got flood damage or hail damage and they just laughed at me   yeah yeah   and i went the next morning to Arlington and they gave it to me for that price and whats so funny is they took the car they i knew they were gonna pull it from Town North because thats where the white one was and they had already told me we located one at Town North so it was that same car   is that right my gosh   and i said like yeah well unless youre selling car with hail damage and flood damage  i got the car off your lot for that price   and you and you laughed all the way to the bank   oh i did and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup and uh   uhhuh   that they required you to do and i took it to Town North and sure enough i saw that guy and he recognized me he said he said oh hi Dana and he kind of looked down and saw that car and im and im sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day of course when when the place in Arlington   yeah yeah yeah   went and took the car because i told him theres a place in Arlington thats gonna give it to me for that price he said no theyre not and the next day they   thats right yeah   pulled the white car and took it to Arlington so im sure he knew  so i loved it i sat there and i just had the biggest grin on my face   such a deal ill bet you did   is kind of nice but   well Dana its been really interesting and i appreciate talking with you   yeah good talking to you too Don   okay have a good evening   okay good luck in your car hunting uhhuh byebye   thank you much bye
