            um are you from this area   im from Dallas yeah   oh okay im in Garland so well im in Dallas right now but im living in Garland um   okay umhum   well i dont know if you know but Garland has got a real big recycling center that in fact we went to yesterday you drive up and you take the stuff out of your trunk and they have different bins for the different materials like clear glass and colored glass and plastics and uh they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom       thats pretty neat my my daughter is four and shes real interested in recycling  so were were trying to promote that because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away but   umhum   we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them uh does Dallas have a curbside recycling program yet   um well i dont know if Dallas is Richardson does   oh okay   um they started with newspapers and uh of course aluminum cans and and bottles and plastic   yeah   i didnt know there were different types of plastic though   hum yeah um like soda bottles are one kind one type of plastic and milk jugs are one type of plastic you can tell its got itll most of the recyclable containers have a little symbol on the bottom with little with the arrows around it that tells whether its a one or a two or a three   umhum oh   its its just different kind of plastics like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic know thats what the different types are   oh okay yeah it seems to be made out of something different   yeah yeah yes i i know theres a long scientific name but its like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff um i like   uh umhum   i dont know if if they do it all over but our Kroger does a a newspaper recycling every Saturday you can drive up and they have one of the clerks out there no the bag boys out there um that will take the papers newspaper out of your car and theyll put it in their little bin and they do the recycling i mean they collect the newspapers and their plastic the plastic grocery bags   yeah   which i think is pretty neat thats something since we all have seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags  i know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things      hum thats right yeah umhum lunch bags and   yeah yeah in fact i have one today its umhum the only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom   right yeah they didnt   and  its like whoops there goes my chips okay fine   yeah umhum   now i  in fact did you happen to see twenty twenty the other night   uh no   they did a program or the one of their articles was on recycling and or it was actually on a a town that has a dump that they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there they have made so much money from that that they built they bought a brand new fire engine and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasnt big enough so they mought bought a new or built a new one paid for it in cash with the money that theyve earned from this landfill   umhum oh   they have built up one mountain they call it Mount Trashmore they built up one mountain covered it with grass and put ski lifts on it and in the winter they put snow on it and they charge to ski on it   yeah     so the city gets the money from that they built a golf course at the bottom and they get the money from that its like thats its a its Riverview Ohio or some place up there   wow umhum   but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea they i mean their city hall looked better it was nicer than Dallas and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city   hum   and they like the trash so i like well okay but i thought that was pretty neat it it would be nice if more communities could do that but you have to know from beginning and you have to have the space to do it and   yeah theyll run out of space before long   yeah see thats well theyre already planning a second mountain so theyre gonna get going to be called the Twin Peaks i was like uhhuh go back to the TV shows   umhum   this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling oh its we i know like i said ive got a two year old and a four year old and thats my daughter thinks that anytime she sees newspapers bundled up theyre being recycled so its like well no honey so that like so that was one reason we went to show her   umhum   what people did with their their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well yeah you melt down the cans and you make them into new things and you get the paper all wet and you make it into new paper and   right   thats fun trying to explain that to a four year old  oh so do yall go ahead and   right yeah they dont even know that paper comes from trees yet so   well yeah she that was the her next question was how do you grow paper   how do you grow paper   was like well from trees um thats why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees   umhum and how do you grow aluminum   yeah exactly um well lets see um  we really dont but and then she was like well what do you do with the glass well   um     you crunch it up real small and then you melt it down well what if it breaks well okay  it it it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her   right   but at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing and she got our baby sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because thats all she talked about so i guess what   umhum
