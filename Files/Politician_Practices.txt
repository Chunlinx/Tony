A Politician Practices What He ProfessesGene R NicholSunday December  Chapel Hill  There must be something different about formerGeorgia governors I was never crazy about Jimmy Carter while hewas president But since he left office he has led like noneother Whether by swinging his solo hammer or by standing for peaceagainst the epithets of the world Carter has become the firstAmerican Some shine best as citizensSoon the world will be treated to a brand new exGeorgiagovernor Democrat Roy Barnes was upset in November by SonnyPerdue I had the misfortune of watching one of the BarnesPerduedebates on CSPAN Sonny didnt know much But he knew Barnes hadtried to do something about the Confederate symbol on the Georgiaflag Trent Lott must have been movedSo now Barnes too will retire into citizenship Thepatterns of course are well established Former governorssenators majority leaders and the like can expect a cascade oflucrative offers Law firms fight for their names and contactsLobbying outfits roll out a carpet of goldAnd Roy Barnes has an added benefit He is apparently a skilledlawyer  having built a hugely successful trial practice inMarietta before running for governor The Georgia papers havespeculated that Barnes could go to work for any number ofsilkstocking Atlanta firms for a sevenfigure salarySo it is perhaps understandable that Steven Gottlieb executivedirector of the Atlanta Legal Aid Society initially thought it wasa joke when he received a phone message from Governor Barnes sayinghed like to go to work as a legal services lawyer Ive neverheard of a former governor going to work for a legal aid programsaid GottliebBut it was no joke Barnes has confirmed that hell join thenonprofit group for six months donating his time and considerableskills to handling the legal cases of lowincome Georgians Holdingelective office he explained is not the only way to helpothersBarnes wont lack for clients Last year Atlanta Legal Aidhandled over  cases  representing AIDS patients domesticviolence victims desperate mothers seeking child support elderlyhomeowners fleeced by lenders and the like But due to the federalbudget cuts of the past  years the office was forced to turnaway many thousands moreGeorgia is a lot like the rest of the country Huge percentagesof the population are priced out of the legal systemSo Barnes remarkable decision swims against the tide on twofronts First as one astonished consultant put it itsrefreshing to see someone leave political office and not cash inAnd second as a leader of the legal community Barnes seems tohave decided that an unfulfilled rhetorical pledge to legalequality isnt enoughFor generations we have we have declared as a cornerstone ofconstitutional government that there can be no equal justicewhere the kind of trial a person gets depends on the amount ofmoney he has But study after study shows that about  percent ofthe legal needs of the poor in the United States are unmet Thefigure is almost as bleak for middle income AmericansYet unlike many industrial nations weve recognized no generalright to representation in civil cases Less than  percent of ourtotal expenditure for lawyers goes to service for the poor Mostlawyers do no pro bono work at all Recent affluence has erodedrather than expanded support for such programs Over the pastdecade the average revenue of the countrys most successful firmsincreased by over  percent and their pro bono work dropped by athird We carve equal justice under law on our courthouse wallsBut thats about as far as the sentiment goesIt is true Ill concede that Roy Barnes has only committedhalf a year to the Georgia legal services program not the rest ofhis life And he is already a wealthy man so its not exactly thesame thing as a young lawyer going to work for exceedingly modestwagesBut one of the perplexing rituals of American politics islistening to candidate after candidate explain that he runs foroffice because he is driven to represent the interests of ordinaryAmericans We accept these claims even though we know thecandidate has never spent a moment representing the powerlessbefore the campaign began and that it would never even occur tohim to be bothered with such matters once the election is overBesides even if its just for six months Barnes has made itclear hell roll up his sleeves and be a real Legal Aid lawyerHell be trying cases day after day No staff No prepared papersNo scripted presentations No assistants toting his bags Just adaunting caseload and beleaguered frightened clients Standingshoulder to shoulder with those who have no one else to speak forthem Carrying out the highest aspirations of both the legalprofession and the American democracyI love Jimmy Carter Im starting to feel the same way about RoyBarnesGene R Nichol is dean and Burton Craige professor of law atthe UNC School of Law
