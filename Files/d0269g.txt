United States General Accounting OfficeExecutive GuideGAOOctober STRATEGIES TO MANAGE IMPROPER PAYMENTSLearning From Public and Private Sector OrganizationsaGAOGPrefaceThe federal government of the United Statesthe largest and mostcomplex organization in the worldexpended approximately trillion dollars in fiscal year  As the steward of taxpayerdollars it is accountable for how its agencies and grantees spendthose funds and is responsible for safeguarding against improperpaymentspayments that should not have been made or that were madefor incorrect amountsDespite the amount of funds involved and the impact improperpayments can have on a programs ability to achieve its intendedoutcome most agencies have not yet estimated the magnitude ofimproper payments in their programs Without a systematicmeasurement of the extent of the problem agency management cannotdetermine  if the problem is significant enough to requirecorrective action  how much to costeffectively invest ininternal control systems to correct the problem or the impact of the actions already taken to reduce improperpayments or additional corrective actions neededThis executive guide is intended to identify effective practicesand provide case illustrations and other information for federalagencies consideration when developing strategies and planning andimplementing actions to manage improper payments in their programsIt was prepared at the request of Senator Joseph I LiebermanChairman Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs This is one ina series of projects we are undertaking for the Senate Committee onGovernmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government Reformconcerning the issue of improper payments involving federalprogramsIn producing this guide we contacted a number of private andpublic sector organizations which we identified primarily throughextensive research on financial management practices and obtainedinformation on actions that they took and considered effective inreducing improper payments The participants were the Department of Health andHuman Services Health Care Financing Administration the Social Security Administration the Department ofVeterans Affairs the states of Illinois Texas and Kentucky thegovernments of Australia New Zealand and the United Kingdom andthree private sector corporations We thank them for their willingness to participateand for

Managing Director Financial Management andAssuranceContentsPrefaceIntroductionObservationsAbbreviationsIntroductionImproper payments are a widespread and significant problemreceiving increased attention not only in the federal governmentbut also among states foreign governments and private sectorcompanies Improper payments include inadvertent errors such asduplicate payments and miscalculations payments for unsupported orinadequately supported claims payments for services not renderedpayments to ineligible beneficiaries and payments resulting fromoutright fraud and abuse by program participants andor federalemployees In the federal government for example they occur in avariety of programs and activities including those related tocontractors and contract management health care programs such asMedicare and Medicaid financial assistance benefits such as FoodStamps and housing subsidies and tax refundsWhile in the private sector improper payments most often presentan internal problem that threatens profitability in the publicsector they can translate into serving fewer recipients orrepresent wasteful spending or a higher relative tax burden thatprompts questions and criticism from the Congress the media andthe taxpayers For federal programs with legislative or regulatoryeligibility criteria improper payments indicate that agencies arespending more than necessary to meet program goals Conversely forprograms with fixed funds any waste of federal funds translatesinto serving fewer recipients or accomplishing lessprogrammatically than could be expectedDespite a climate of increased scrutiny most improper paymentsassociated with federal programs continue to go unidentified asthey drain taxpayer resources away from the missions and goals ofour government They occur for many reasons including insufficientoversight or monitoring inadequate eligibility controls andautomated system deficiencies However one point is clear based onour studythe basic or root causes of improper payments cantypically be traced to a lack of or breakdown in internal controlCollectively internal controls are an integral component of anorganizations management that provides reasonable assurance thatthe organization achieves its objectives ofeffective and efficient operations  reliablefinancial reporting andcompliance with laws and regulations Internal controlsare not one event but a series of actions and activities thatoccur throughout an entitys operations and on an ongoing basisPeople make internal controls work and responsibility for goodinternal controls rests with all managersThe risk of improper payments increases in programs with complex criteria for computing payments  a significant volumeof transactions or  emphasis on expediting payments Sincethese factors apply to a number of government programs thatcollectively disburse billions of dollars there is clearly a needfor federal agencies to be ever more vigilant in the designimplementation and maintenance of proper controls for safeguardingassets and preventing and detecting fraud and errorsThe risk of improper payments and the governments ability toprevent them will continue to be of concern in the future Undercurrent federal budget policies as the baby boom generation leavesthe workforce spending pressures will grow rapidly due toincreased costs of programs such as Medicare Medicaid and SocialSecurity Other federal expenditures are also likely to increaseThe increased size of federal programs spending pressuresimplementation of new programs and changes in existing programsall but guarantee that absent improvements in internal controlsand other proactive actions the potential for additional or largervolumes of improper payments will be present Figure

Fiscal Year  Historical TablesThe Presidents Management Agenda Fiscal Year  includes agovernmentwide initiative for improved financial performance Underthis initiative the administration will establish a baseline ofthe extent of erroneous payments and require agencies to includein their fiscal year  budget submissions information onerroneous payment rates including actual and target rates whereavailable for benefit and assistance programs over  billionUsing this information the Office of Management and Budget willwork with agencies to establish goals to reduce erroneous paymentsfor each programFew would argue that the goal of reducing improper payments isnot a worthy one But attacking the problem requires a strategyappropriate to the organization involved and its particular risksincluding a consideration of the legal requirements surroundingsecurity and privacy issues The organizations that participated inour study have taken actions that they consider to be effective inreducing potential as well as actual improper paymentsAll of these actions shared a common focus of improving theinternal control systems over the problem area This focus oninternal controls does not necessarily mean that the programslacked controls but that the existing controls needed to be updatedor policies and procedures added to strengthen the overall controlsystemIn this executive guide we highlight many of the strategicactions taken by the study participants to reduce improper payments We categorize theseactions into the five components of internal controlcontrolenvironment risk

guide focuses on internal controls asthey relate to reducing improper payments The following graphicrepresents the interrelationship between the components and effortsto manage improper paymentsFigure  Managing Improper Payments Through InternalControlsWhile this guide discusses each of these control areasseparately actions to manage improper payments would typicallyrequire a continual interaction between these areas As depicted inthe figure the control environment surrounds and reinforces theother components but all components work in concert toward acentral objective which in this case is managing improperpaymentsWe conclude our discussion of the actions taken to addressimproper payments with observations about key factors necessary forsuccess We have included descriptions of the entities we visitedin appendix II Also appendix III identifies other sources ofinformation that may be useful to federal agencies in their effortsto address improper payments in their programsSee also

ServicesCommissionOf the elements that are critical to the identificationdevelopment and implementation of activities to reduce improperpayments perhaps the most significant is the control environmentBy focusing their attention on and communicating their intent toreduce improper payments throughout an organization and to allaffected organizational units and individuals toplevelofficialswhether in the government or within private sectorcompaniesand legislative bodies set the stage for change Theyinstill a culture of accountability by adopting a positive andsupportive attitude toward improvement and the achievement ofestablished program outcomes They also establish a transparentenvironment in which their expectations for program improvement areclearly defined and accountability for achieving these improvementsis set The actions of the entities in our study in areas includingpassing legislation setting and maintaining the ethical tonedelegating roles and responsibilities and implementing humancapital initiatives clearly communicated the need for changeWe were told by many of the officials we met in the course ofour work that without the clearly established expectations anddemands for improvement by top management and legislativeofficials little would have happened to effectively reduce fraudand errors in their programs However it is important to notethat while top management sets the tone for cultural changeeveryone from program managers to staff performing daytodayoperational activities must buy into this change and work toachieve its overall goals The cultural change fostered by aneffective control environment stresses the importance ofimprovement and efficient and effective program operations whilemaintaining a balance with concerns raised regarding privacy andinformation security in a world where computers and electronic dataare indispensable for making payments In the legislative arena itinvolved passing laws requiring certain actions by agency orprogram management the use of various prevention andor detectionmethodologies and periodic agency reporting on the status ofimprovement efforts At the agency

actions basedon performance resultsToplevel interest in the amount of improper payments at theorganizations that participated in our study often resulted fromprogram audit andor media reports of misspent funds orfraudulent activities As the magnitude of these improper paymentsbecame known pressures increased on government officials andlegislative bodies to reduce themIn Texas the legislature was instrumental in effecting changesto the states benefit programs through provisions in severalpieces of legislation The legislatures involvement wasprecipitated in  by the reported amounts of improper paymentsin Texas Medicaid program estimated to range from  million to million or  to  percent of total expenditures andTemporary Assistance for Needy Families TANF and Food Stampprograms estimated at a total of  million or about percent of total expenditures for the two programs Texaslawmakers sought to reduce improper payments by mandating specificactions by responsible agencies including the use of computertechnology to identify and deter fraud and abuse in the TexasMedicaid program In addition the lawmakers called for publicizingsuccessful fraud prosecutions and fraud prevention programs todeter benefit fraudAustralia and New Zealand prepared and adopted a joint standard on risk management to provide a cultural frameworkfor managing risk Risk management is the term applied to a logicaland systematic method of managing risks associated with anyactivity function or process in a way that will enableorganizations to minimize losses and maximize opportunities Thephilosophy makes risk management a part of its organizationalculture and integrates risk management into its daytodaypractices and business activities When this is achieved riskmanagement becomes the business of everyone in theorganizationPeople are what make internal controls work and the integrityand ethical values maintained and demonstrated by management play akey role in the entire organizations ethical tone After theidentification of significant internal fraud New Zealands InlandRevenue Department IRD created the position of National AdvisorFraud Prevention and Investigation and adopted a fraud controlstrategy The primary aim of the strategy is to enable responsibleconduct where the need to obey the law and to behave ethically ispart of the organizations ethos Accordingly

those who defraud the benefit systemAdditionally television commercials billboards newspaperarticles and an antifraud Web site  wwwtargetingfraudgovukcommunicated thegovernments message to the public that fraud and abuse of thebenefits system would not be toleratedParliament has also stayed actively involved in benefit paymentreform and improper payment reductions For example it enactedlegislation authorizing data sharing activities within and betweengovernment agencies and departments Also the Treasury requiresdepartments to disclose instances of irregular expenditures arisingfrom erroneous benefit awards and fraud by claimants Further theComptroller and Auditor General has qualified his opinion on DWPsfiscal year  through fiscal year  financial statementsbecause of the level of fraud and error identified in the benefitprograms This served to reinforce the message that high levels ofimproper payments are unacceptable in the United KingdomAmong the organizations we studied the pressures applied byoversight entities and top management were instrumental as changeagents They not only defined and communicated a need for improvedprogram operations but most important they redefined theorganizational culture Further by being transparent in redefiningthe culture oversight entities and top management set expectationsand obtained buyin on the need for and importance of change fromindividuals throughout the organizations This was critical forsuccess since these individuals managed the daytoday programactivities Further a culture of accountability was essential

over improper payments the following strategiesshould be consideredprovide leadership in setting and maintaining theagencys ethical code of conduct and in ensuring proper behaviorunder the codeprovide a cultural framework for managing risk byengaging everyone in the organization in the risk managementprocessincrease accountability by establishing goals forreducing improper payments for major programs andfoster an atmosphere that regards improper payments asunacceptableRisk Assessment Determining the Natureand Extent of the ProblemOne of the worst problems an organization confronts is theproblem of institutional denial An organization should not simplysay We know we have a problem but we dont want to know how bigit isAurora LeBrun Associate Commissioner Office of Investigationsand Enforcement Texas Health and Human Services CommissionStrong systems of internal control provide reasonable assurancethat programs are operating as intended and are achieving expectedoutcomes A key step in the process of gaining this assurance isconducting a risk assessment an activity that entails acomprehensive review and analysis of program operations todetermine where risks exist and what those risks are and thenmeasuring the potential or actual impact of those risks on programoperations In performing a risk assessment management shouldconsider all significant interactions between the entity and otherparties as well as all internal factors at both theorganizationwide and program levels Once risk areas areidentified their potential impact on programs and activitiesshould be measured and additional controls should be considered Asrisks are addressed and controls are changed they shouldoccasionally be revisited to determine where the risks havedecreased and where new areas of risk may exist As such the riskassessment process should be iterativeThe information developed during a risk assessment forms thefoundation or basis upon which management can determine the natureand type of corrective actions needed and it gives managementbaseline information for measuring progress in reducing improperpayments The specific risk analysis methodology used can vary byorganization because of differences in missions and the difficultyin qualitatively and quantitatively assigning risk levels Inaddition because governmental economic industry regulatory andoperating conditions continually change risk assessments should beperiodically updated to identify and deal with any special risksprompted by such changesThe organizations that participated in our study found thatconducting risk assessments to determine the nature and extent oftheir improper payments was an essential step in helping themfocus on the most significant problem areas and determine whatneeded to be done to address the identified risks in thoseareasMany federal agencies even those with recognized weaknessesthat result in improper payments do not perform risk assessmentsto identify and estimate the magnitude of improper payments withintheir programsHowever some agencies do perform risk assessments For examplethe Department of Health and Human Services HHS began reportingan annual estimate of improper payments in the MedicareFeeforService program in  In fiscal year  it reportedestimated improper Medicare FeeforService payments of billion or about  percent of such benefits HHS reporting andanalysis of improper Medicare payments has helped lead to theimplementation of several initiatives to identify and reduce suchpayments These initiatives include working with providers toensure that medical records support billed servicesA thorough risk assessment also allows entities to targethighrisk areas and therefore to focus often limited resourceswhere the greatest exposure exists For example the IllinoisDepartment of Public Aid IDPA conducted a  comparison ofMedicaid payments made with information and documentationassociated with the claims to determine if the payments wereaccurate From this information the IDPA calculated that thestates payment accuracy rate was about  percent The reviewidentified errors and their causes and provided IDPA withinformation that allowed it to focus attention on the  percent ofinaccurate payments and target strategies to improve the accuracyof these payments For example of the  million spent fornonemergency transportation services included in the study million  percent were estimated to be in error The paymentaccuracy review and three other studies led to a series of actionsthat included assuring that transportation providers actuallyexisted and were providing services assuring that providers billedMedicaid correctly and sending notices to let providers know whatis expected of themTexas has performed two reviews of the accuracy of its healthcare paymentsone in December  and a second in January Both reviews of the Medicaid program were designed to measure theincidence of potential overpayments that could be due to fraud andabuse The  study used three different types of analysesclienttelephone interviews data analysis identifying billing trendsthat are known to result in overpayments and medical recordreview Documentation errors clerical errors and potential fraudand abuse were identified Texas used the results to improve itsfraud and abuse detection process by considering certain highriskareas in the development of data analysis techniques in itsMedicaid Fraud and Abuse Detection System MFADS For example itrecommended an increase in analyses targeted at medical suppliesand durable medical equipment and at providers who bill higher costprocedure codes to maximize their reimbursementBoth Texas and Illinois found the firsttime payment accuracyreview to be expensive and  in direct costsrespectively However both states recognized that the cost of riskassessments would decrease after the baseline measurement had beendetermined and found them to be costbeneficial in light of theability to focus on highrisk areas Resources are maximized whenstrategically aimed at the areas that need the most improvementThus they regarded the payment accuracy review as an effective andcostbeneficial way to combat improper paymentsGovernment agencies in other countries also use payment accuracyreviews to identify risk areas For example the Department ofSocial Security in the United Kingdom uses the results of a rollingprogram of reviews to determine the levels of fraud and error inits Income Support and Jobseekers Allowance benefit programsSpecifically these reviews quantify the amount of fraud customererror and official error error by government employees affectingbenefit claims The government uses the October  throughSeptember  review results as a baseline against which theresults of subsequent reviews are measured Further DWP in theUnited Kingdom plans to use this information to target areas forprevention and detection in the benefit programs to identifycustomers who are at risk for higher levels of error in theirclaims and to facilitate case interventionsControl activities will not be fully effective until everyonefrom the person on the counter through to the head of the agencytakes responsibility for managing risk from the perspective oftheir respective positionsRalph Watzlaff General Manager Professional Review DivisionAustralian Health Insurance CommissionIn our study of activities to reduce improper payments riskassessments identified problem areas and resulted in estimates ofmonetary values associated with the problems Thus the process ofdoing risk assessments was essential for evaluating the feasibilityand costeffectiveness of the various corrective actionsconsidered The organizations viewed risk assessments asopportunity and identified risk areas were communicated throughoutthe organizationAssessing its risks allows an organization to set goals andtarget its efforts to reduce improper payments Having developedsuch a framework an organization is well positioned to determinewhich control activities to implement to reduce risks andultimately reduce fraud and errorsStrategies to ConsiderRisk AssessmentTo assess risk by determining the nature and extent of improperpayments the following strategies should be consideredinstitute a systematic process to estimate the level ofimproper payments being made by the organizationbased on this process determine where risks exist whatthose risks are and the potential or actual impact of those riskson program operationsuse risk assessment results to target highrisk areas andfocus resources where the greatest exposure exists andreassess risks on a recurring basis to evaluate theimpact of changing conditions both external and internal onprogram operationsControl Activities Taking Action toAddress Identified Risk AreasThere are no brownie points for just talking about theproblemJoan McQuay National Benefit Control and Debt Manager Work andIncome New ZealandOnce an organization has identified areas of its operations thatare at risk and quantified the possible extent of the risk and itsmanagement and other key officials are committed to and have set agoal for reducing the risk the organization must take action toachieve that goal Control activities are the policies procedurestechniques and mechanisms that are designed to help ensure thatmanagements decisions and plans are carried out They includeactivities designed to address risks that lead to fraud and errorThey are an integral part of an organizations actions in planningimplementing reviewing and achieving effective resultsThe control activities used by an organization to addressimproper payments vary according to the specific threats faced andrisks incurred differences in objectives managerial judgmentsize and complexity of the organization operational environmentsensitivity and value of data and requirements for systemreliability availability and performance Additionally they mustcomply with all relevant laws and help strike a balance between thesometimes competing goals of privacy and program integrity Controlactivities can include both prepayment and postpayment mechanismsto manage improper payments Given the large volume and complexityof federal payments and historically low recovery rates for certainprograms it is generally most efficient to pay bills and providebenefits properly in the first place Aside from minimizingoverpayments proactively preventing improper payments increasespublic confidence in the administration of benefit programs andavoids the difficulties associated with the pay and chase aspects of recovering improper payments Howeverrecognizing that some overpayments are inevitable agencies alsoneed to adopt effective detection techniques to quickly identifyand recover them Detection activities play a significant role notonly in identifying improper payments but also in providingdataPay and chase refers to the laborintensive andtimeconsuming practice of trying to recover overpayments once theyhave already been made rather than preventing improper payments inthe first placeon why these payments were made and in turn highlighting areasthat need strengthened prevention controlsThe organizations in our study used many different preventionand detection control activities to manage improper payments Thenature of these activities ranged from sophisticated computeranalyses of beneficiary and program participant data to postawardcontract audits The kinds of activities pursued were dictated bythe types of payment activities each entity had identified aspresenting the most significant risk of improper payments as wellas the kind of data and other resources that were available to theentity in this effort This guide discusses the following six kindsof control activitiesdata sharingdata miningneural networkingrecovery auditingcontract audits andprepayment investigationsThe data sharing data mining and neural networking techniquesdiscussed in this guide are powerful internal control tools thatprovide more useful and timely access to information The use ofthese techniques can achieve potentially significant savings byidentifying clientrelated reporting errors and misinformationduring the eligibility determination processbefore payments aremadeor by detecting improper payments that have been madeHowever the more extensive use of personal information in anevolving technological environment raises new questions aboutprivacy and how it should be protected In the federal arena suchactivities must be implemented consistent with all protections ofthe Privacy Act of  as amended by the Computer Matching andPrivacy Protection Act of  and other privacy statutesData sharing allows entities that make paymentstocontractors vendors or participants in benefit programstocompare information from different sources to help ensure thatpayments are appropriate For government agencies data sharing canbe particularly useful in confirming initial or continuingeligibility of participants in benefit programs and in identifyingimproper payments that have already been made A form of data sharing that Texas has found to be effective fordetermining the initial eligibility of individuals for Food Stampbenefits puts information from several state and local agenciesinSee also Benefit and Loan Programs Improved Data SharingCould Enhance Program Integrity GAOHEHS September the hands of state caseworkers by means of a vendorprovidedsoftware program The vendor maintains public information such asthat recorded by local department of motor vehicles or municipalcourts where it can be easily searched by caseworkers to evaluateinformation provided by individuals applying for benefits Usingthe software caseworkers can target questions to applicants whenthere are discrepancies between information provided by the clientsand that recorded elsewhere Caseworkers can search the databasefor data such as drivers license information records showing thenumber of individuals or vehicles at the clients reportedaddresses telephone numbers vehicle values boat and motor filescriminal convictions marriagedivorce records and consumer creditreports Then for example if the data search shows two cars at anapplicants address when the benefit applicant has reported onlyone the caseworker can at the time of the benefit applicationquestion the applicant concerning this discrepancy Generally thisquery information is treated only as a case clue and must beverified The database contains reporting options that allowsupervisors to monitor employees use of the system to ensure thatall queries are appropriatein addition the states internalauditor monitors the staffs use of the databaseBeyond determining initial eligibility of participants inbenefit programs data sharing can also be used to identifyimproper payments that have already been made Data sharing allowsa flow of information in two directions which is particularlyhelpful to some organizations in managing improper payments Forexample the Social Security Administration SSA obtains deathrecords from states to determine if deceased individuals arereceiving benefit checks At the same time SSA provides data tostates and other agencies Among the data it shares is notificationof whether there is a valid social security number to confirm theeligibility of an applicant for various state or federal benefitprograms The exchange of information allows data matches to takeplace a process in which information from one source is comparedwith information from another to identify any inconsistencies Datamatches of social security numbers and other data can helpdetermine whether beneficiaries are receiving paymentsinappropriately or under more than one name or addressSSA performs over  data matches with over  federal agenciesand more than  state and local entities using incominginformation Additionally SSA shares outgoing information withfederal agencies through more than  matches For example SSAshares data with the Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentHUD so it can perform a match to verify the identity ofrecipients of housing benefits and identify potentially fraudulentclaims SSA uses data matches to prevent and detect improperpayments in its programs It estimates that it saves  millionannually for Old Age and Survivors Insurance and DisabilityInsurance and  million annually for Supplemental SecurityIncome through the use of data matching Further the savings arenot limited toSSA data matches save  billion for other governmentagencieseach yearthose realized by SSA According to SSA its matches saveapproximately  billion each year for other agencies Data matches to identify improper payments can be performedperiodically ie daily monthly or yearly or on an ad hocbasis using various sources of data to reconfirm eligibility ofbeneficiaries and accuracy of payments Texas conducts bothperiodic and ad hoc matches using data includingprisoner information obtained from the Texas Departmentof Criminal Justice and SSAs Prisoner Verification System todetermine whether prisoners are receiving benefits to which theyare not entitleddeceased individuals lists obtained from the TexasDepartment of Health Bureau of Vital Statistics to determinewhether benefits are being paid to such individualsandincome information obtained from the Texas EmployeesRetirement System to check retiree income for amounts that affectthe level of benefit eligibilityTexas also shares data with three of its bordering states todetermine duplicity of benefits which for the four states hasresulted in an average of  potential duplicates per state perquarter In fiscal year  after researching potential duplicatepayments Texas denied or decreased benefits in  casesresulting in approximately  in benefits savedKentucky performs data matches to determine eligibility for FoodStamps TANF and Medicaid benefits using an integrated automatedsystem that lets caseworkers determine eligibility for the threeprograms simultaneously At the time the application is enteredinto the system the system performs several matches to obtainadditional information on the applicant and prevent duplicateparticipation These matches are made through its incomeeligibility and verification system using the applicants socialsecurity number name date of birth any previous disqualificationrecord from assistance programs and income In addition on amonthly basis other matches are conducted The state matches datawith the National Crime Information Center to check for fleeingfelons with SSA to determine if any clients are in prison or havedied and with assistance programs in other states to check forclient disqualification In addition matches with unemployment andstate wages records are done monthly When these matches result ininformation that could require changes in benefits the matchesappear on the daily case status reports alerting caseworkers topotential changes in benefitsThe United Kingdom formalized data matching between governmentorganizations in  and it reported that through March  ithad realized benefit savings of about  million From April throughSSA calculates the annual savings based on a compilation ofcostbenefit analyses performed by the matching agencies under theterms of their matching agreements with SSAMarch  matches identified about inconsistencies for further investigation and resulted inan overall benefit saving of about  million Additionallylegislation has now been passed to enable the government to obtainfinancial information from the private sector in certaincircumstancesThe prevalence of data sharing is evidence of the value providedto agencies when they can obtain and use data from sources externalto an individual programs systems Having the two streams of dataallows for matches to occur and inconsistencies or anomalies to beflagged for further research Federal entities contemplating datamatching must do so in accordance with the provisions of theComputer Matching and Privacy Protection Act which requires that the privacy of data used in computer matches be protected agencies complete costbenefit analyses on all computer matches andreport annually on their findings unless the matches are exemptedby law and  data integrity boards be established to approve andreview the data matchesWhile data sharing gives an organization the means tocompare data from different sources data mining offers a tool toreview and analyze diverse data Data mining analyzes data forrelationships that have not previously been discovered Forexample the incidence of improper payments among Medicaid claimsmight if sufficiently analyzed and related to other Medicaid datareveal a correlation with a certain health care provider orprovidersThe central repository of data commonly used to perform datamining is called a data warehouse Data warehouses store historicaland current data and consist of tables of information that arelogically grouped together The warehouse allows program andfinancial data from different nonintegrated systems throughout anorganization to be captured and placed in a single database whereusers can query the system for information The information canthen be mined or searched according to specific criteria toidentify associations sequences patterns and clusters betweendifferent pieces of informationrelationships that are often hiddenin separated databasesAs a tool in managing improper payments applying data mining toa data warehouse allows an organization to efficiently query thesystem to identify questionable activities such as multiplepayments for an individual invoice or to an individual recipient ona certain date This technique allows personnel who are notcomputer specialists but who may have useful program or financialexpertise to directly access data target queries and analyzeresults Queries can also be made through data mining softwarewhich includes prepared queries that can be used in the system on aregular basisIDPA began data mining in an effort to improve a system that wastoo slow to provide the timely information needed for a wide rangeof agency functions including the prevention and detection ofoverpayments As of December  the state had spent  millionto create a data warehouse to supplement the Medicaid ManagementInformation System MMIS which maintains data on Medicaidproviders and beneficiaries as well as claims and payments Thedata warehouse includes over  different fieldselements Theresults of data queries are particularly useful because the datawarehouse is able to store more current data than MMIS At presentthere is a month lag in current information compared to the to month lag that existed before IDPA began using data mining Inaddition the data warehouse can now store up to  years of dataand IDPA is currently weighing the costs and benefits of increasingthis to  years of dataIDPA officials noted that using data mining allows them toanalyze large amounts of data Because the large number oftransactions in the system precludes manually examining eachtransaction for associations and patterns with other transactionsdata mining is an effective and efficient alternative The IDPAOffice of Inspector General OIG also uses data mining to quicklyrespond to requests for information for ongoing investigations fromthe Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois StatePoliceThe IDPA OIG created the Fraud Science Team FST aninterdisciplinary team that includes an economist program andpolicy experts and information specialists FST maximizes thevalue of the data warehouse by performing data mining activitiesand providing a researchbased approach to fraud prevention anddetection FST has produced documentation on over  fraudschemes which it has categorized into  different types such asbilling for services not rendered and kickback schemes Theinformation on these schemes is used in the development andimplementation of targeted analyses that are run against the datawarehouse information to identify data relationships and anomalieswhich are often signs of fraud This information can also be usedto implement specific controls in the system intended to preventthe identified types of fraudDuring our visit the IDPA OIG staff ran several queries andanalyses For example one risk area identified was health careproviders that were billing for services provided in excess of hours in a single day With the capabilities of the data warehouseOIG staff developed an analysis that identified  providers thathad billed over  hours for at least  day during the  monthsended December   A number of the identified providers werealready under investigation for other program violations As aresult of this analysis the OIG plans to refer serious cases toappropriate law enforcement agencies and take administrative actionagainst the less serious violatorsAn early effort at using data mining software in Illinois hasidentified  million in potential overpaymentsBefore the data warehouse was available obtaining responses toqueries of this kind would have required obtaining separate reportsfrom different systems and could have taken up to  monthsHowever during our visit querying the warehouse took from severalseconds to a few minutes per queryNew initiatives that Illinois expects will further improve datamining at IDPA are the development of a day training course tohelp users properly structure queries and the use of data miningsoftware In an early effort using data mining software IDPA OIGas part of a partnership audit with HHS OIG identified hospital transfers that are believed to have been miscoded asdischarges creating a potential overpayment of  millionThe large number of computerized claims processed by Medicarealso lends itself to the application of data mining techniquesClaims administration contractors at HHS Centers for Medicare andMedicaid Services formerly the Health Care FinancingAdministration use data mining and statistical analysis as part oftheir postpayment review activities Since  CMS also hascontracted with a specialized statistical analysis contractor toperform largescale analysis of durable medical equipment claimsData mining can identify many potentially inappropriate paymentsbut determining which ones are actual overpayments takes additionalinvestigation Currently the contractors only have the resourcesto investigate situations in which the data indicate potentiallargescale abusive practicesNeural networking is a technique for extracting andanalyzing data In this case the system analyzes associations andpatterns among data elements which allows it to find relationshipsthat can result in new queriesA neural network is intended to simulate the way in which abrain processes information learns and remembers A neuralnetwork is initially trained or fed large amounts of data andrules about data relationships for example a personsgrandfather is older than that persons father Neural networkslearn by comparing new data with historical data and can be usedto detect patterns that are difficult and sometimes impossible todetect without computer intervention in large volumes of data Themore data a neural network processes the better it performs iethe better it identifies the characteristics of potentiallyfraudulent payments Based upon this knowledge neural networksautomatically alter their analytical processes to produce moreaccurate detection resultsIn  the Texas legislature mandated the use of neuralnetworks in the Medicaid program After examining the results of apilot testTexas Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Detection System used neuralnetworking to recover  million in fiscal year of neural networks conducted by the Comptrollers Office TexasHealth and Human Services Commission HHSC responded to thelegislation and implemented MFADS The MFADS project wasoperational in January  and combines both data mining andneural network capabilitiesIn Texas models used with the neural network technologyidentify fraudulent patterns from large volumes of medical claimsand patient and provider history data For example they can helpidentify perpetrators of both known and unknown fraud schemesthrough the analysis of utilization trends patterns and complexinterrelationships in the data The state currently has models forphysician and dental providers and plans to initiate a model forpharmaceutical providersHHSC awarded a contract for the development and operationalsupport of MFADS Annual contract costs range from  million to million for contractor operations that include the developmentand ongoing support of the models The Texas models are composed of to  variables and generate an annual report that identifiesthe potential unscrupulous providers and ranks the providersaccording to how questionable their billing patterns appear to beThe models detail the variances through graphs that compare amountsbilled and services rendered among others items by the identifiedprovider with the average of the other providers For example onedental provider was ranked third on a dental model listing due tounusual activity in areas such as multisurface restoration and rootcanal activities An investigator using MFADS was able to rundetailed reports on the providers activity in the identifiedhighrisk areas and determined that the combination of servicesprovided volume of services provided and the recurring pattern ofthe services provided were indeed suspicious Additionally adental consultant reviewed  of the providers dental charts anddetermined that many of the services claimed were unnecessary As aresult the provider agreed to a settlement and has repaid theidentified overpayments of  plus other penaltiesAdditionally the provider was excluded from the Medicaid programfor  yearsThe results from both the data mining activities and the neuralnetwork reports are reviewed and possibly investigated to determineif the claims are fraudulent or the providers are unscrupulousAccording to Texas officials medical judgment is important whenconsidering the accuracy of claims and as such medicalprofessionals assist in reviewing medical claimsTexas HHSC prepares quarterly reports for the legislaturesreview The Second Quarter Fiscal Year  Contract PerformanceReport for the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Detection System reportedthat it had identified  cases representing over  millionfor investigation in fiscal year  As a result of investigatingthese cases approximately  million has been recovered Thesereports also show how HHSC is performing in relation to itsperformance measures In fiscal year  one of the performancemeasures was that total dollars identified for recoveries equal orexceed  percent  million of the fiscal year contract costamount HHSC exceeded its goal by identifying  million forrecoveryRecovery auditing is the practice of identifying andrecovering overpayments that examines payment file information toidentify possible duplicate or erroneous payments For instancevendors make pricing errors on their invoices forget to includediscounts that have been publicized to the general public neglectto offer allowances and rebates miscalculate freight charges andso forth In addition the same invoices or portions thereofcould be paid more than once These mistakes when not caughtresult in overpayments Recovery auditing can incorporate datamining techniquesWhile traditionally used as a technique to identify improperpayments already made organizations have also experienced successin using recovery auditing to analyze records prior to paymentBecause it helps to prevent improper payments before they occurthis use of recovery auditing eliminates the costs associated withobtaining reimbursements for the erroneous payments or taking otheractions needed to offset future payments by the amount of theimproper paymentRecovery auditing started about  years ago and it is used inseveral industries including the automobile retail store andfood service industries and to some extent within the federalgovernment Some entities use their employees to analyze theirpayment records while others contract with recovery audit firms forthe work Contract firms often perform this work on a contingencyfee basis that is they only receive compensation if they identifyand recover amounts determined to be improper payments Asdiscussed below recovery auditing which has a longstanding trackrecord in the private sector offers an opportunity to identifyimproper payments before they occur and to identify and recoveroverpayments if they do occur One private sector company contracted on a contingency feebasis with a recovery audit firm for a review of its accountspayable files files in which its systems controls had not founderrors The review resulted in the recovery of  million inimproper payments The company recently began using recoveryauditing techniques on accounts payable information to preventimproper payments before they occurred It expected that thisactivity would identify possible duplicate payments and the testverified the companys expectations For example during our visitit identified and avoided a duplicate payment of  from thereports generated by the recovery auditA private sector companyrecovered  million in improperpayments as a result of a recovery auditsoftware In addition as a result of using recovery auditingbefore payments are made the company identified and stopped theprocessing of  million in wire payments that had already beenprocessed Another advantage of the recovery audit services used bythe company is that the software identifies the employees who aremaking processing errors so that the company can take appropriatecounseling and training action Another private sector company contracted with a recoveryaudit firm on a contingency fee basis to perform two separatereviews of its disbursementsthe first review was for disbursementsmade from  through  and the second for disbursements madefrom  through  Both reviews identified duplicate paymentsand resulted in recovery actions and in changes to the paymentsystem to help reduce future overpayments For example from through  the company processed about  million invoices Therecovery audit review of these invoices identified about  millionin potential overpayments and resulted in actions to recover thesefunds where appropriate Further based on an analysis of theoverpayments identified the company has implemented proceduresthat have reduced its dollar error rate per one million dollars oftransactions from a reported  in  through  to a reported dollars in  through  In addition the company is nowpreparing to enter an agreement with the recovery audit contractorunder which the recovery auditing software will be installed in thecompanys system allowing its staff to perform the recovery auditfunctioneven as part of the prepayment processRecovery auditing is also being used to some extent in thefederal government For example the Department of VeteransAffairs VA Financial Services Center FSC in Austin Texas hadcontracted with recovery audit firms in the past but now performsrecovery auditing inhouse using about three fulltime employees toadminister the program and one employee for software developmentIf a duplicate payment is identified VA takes one of severalactions including canceling the transaction prior to paymentnotifying Treasury to stop issuance of a check or issuing a billof collection For example FSC has identified over  million inoverpayments and has collected by either offsetting futurepayments or cash collection nearly  for the first  monthsof fiscal year  A FSC official noted that recovery auditingcould be beneficial to almost any organization that makespaymentsPostaward audits of contracts are another technique that canhelp to combat improper payments and are used to some degreewithin the federal government These audits verify thatVA reported recoveries of  million from contract auditspayments are being made in accordance with contract terms andapplicable regulations They can detect improper payments that havebeen made help avoid future payments of the same kind and provideoversight of companies conducting business with the government Forexample in fiscal year  the VA Office of Acquisition andMateriel Management partnered with the VA OIG and the VA Office ofGeneral Counsel to establish the VA Procurement Working GroupPWG As a result a Contract Review and Evaluation Division wasestablished to provide audit and advisory services related tocontracts awarded by contracting officers in VAs Office ofAcquisition and Materiel Management From  through September PWG reported recoveries resulting from postaward audits ofcontracts totaling about  million This represents a reportedreturn of  for every dollar spent in support of these auditsPWG attributes its success to the establishment of a knowledgeableand professional group of contract auditors in the pharmaceuticaland medicalsurgical supply industries As a result of the auditsand PWGs efforts many contractors have voluntarily elected toperform internal reviews and have submitted  voluntarydisclosures and refund offers to VA Prior to  VA receivedalmost no voluntary disclosures Some contractors have alsodeveloped and implemented corporate responsibility plans to ensurecompliance with acquisition regulations and statutesIllinois reports saving  for every dollar spent on fraudprevention investigationsIn  IDPA established a Fraud Prevention InvestigationsProgram FPI to prevent ineligible persons from receiving FoodStamps TANF and Medicaid Under this program case managers inthe Illinois Department of Human Services IDHS refer applicationsthat contain suspicious or conflicting information to IDPAs Bureauof Investigations BOI for action before benefit payments beginCase managers use certain referral criteria such as applicationsthat contain contradictory information about household compositionor employment to identify these applications BOI submits referredcases to a private investigation firm under contract with the IDPAOIG which investigates the information on the application Thisinvestigation may consist of interviews contacts with employerslandlords or neighbors or a visit to the applicants home Theresults are reported to BOI within  business days  business daysfor food stamps and then to the local IDHS office for appropriateaction approval denial or reduction of benefitsThe program was piloted in  and was implemented in with five Cook County Chicago IDHS offices participatingCurrently all  IDHS local offices in Cook County participate inthe program FPI reports total savings since program inception ofabout  for every dollar spentSpecifically in fiscal year  FPI prevented  million inimproper payments from being issued at a cost of  Savingsare calculated based on the administrative and contract costs ofthe program as a percentage of gross savings and cost avoidance forcases that resulted in denied or reduced benefitsThe preceding examples of control activities are meant toillustrate a sample of the type of

controlling program operations needrelevant reliable and timely financial and nonfinancialinformation to make operating decisions monitor performance andallocate resources This information can be obtained from a varietyof sources using a wide range of data collection methodologies Theorganizations that participated in our study used internal andexternal sources to obtain needed information Further thesesources varied widely from information contained in multiplecomputer databases to periodic meetings of individuals to shareinformation on emerging issues and other areas relevant toeffective program operationsThe need for information and communication extends beyondorganizational boundaries Many of the governmental programs withimproper payments are benefit programs that involve recipients andproviders of services Organizations in our study developededucational programs to assist these participants in understandingeligibility and other requirements and for service providersinformation on issues including common claim filing errorsHaving information available to provide feedback to managementon initiatives is necessary to adequately evaluate performance AtCentrelink in Australia information showing achievement againstkey performance indicators KPI for compliance activity isprovided to managers monthly within  days of the end of themonth Information is provided about the number of compliancereviews cases identified as high risk for incorrect paymentcompleted savings incorrect payments identified for recovery andthe level of incorrect payment Information is also provided onprosecution activity In addition comparative information is madeavailable so that the managers see how they are doing compared toother managers While these reports are available within  days ofthe end of the reporting period a database containing reviewinformation can be accessed within  hours This enables managersto produce detailed flexible reports online As a resultWe are always working to achieve balance between programintegrity and access to health care for recipientsRobb Miller Inspector General Illinois Department of PublicAidof having this timely information managers can more effectivelymanage the resources available to themMinimizing improper payments often requires the exchange ofrelevant reliable and timely information between individuals andunits within an organization and with external entities withoversight and monitoring responsibilities This can be achieved byestablishing working groups For example in  Illinoisestablished its Medicaid Fraud Prevention Executive Workgroup Thepurpose of the workgroup is to develop reasonable and prudentmeasures consistent with the provision of quality health care tocombat fraud and abuse in the Medical Assistance ProgramThe workgroup has approximately  members from both the programand integrity sides of IDPA including members from claimsprocessing technical support budget and analysis fraud researchinvestigations information technology and information systemsThe cooperation between the program and the integrity divisions isthe vehicle by which emerging issues are addressed The group meetsmonthly to discuss the status of previously discussed andorimplemented initiatives and to propose and discuss current problemsand potential initiatives Topics discussed have resulted inongoing changes to computer edits and policies reflecting thedynamic nature of fraudWhile timely accurate and reliable information is necessaryfor internal use the organizations we visited stressed thatcommunication with the public benefit providers and beneficiarieswas also necessary Educating the parties involved in thetransaction reduces the risk of potential errors and strengthensjoint responsibility and accountability of those involvedTexas considers the various forms of education to becostbeneficial in its Medicaid program For example in  itimplemented several initiatives to educate new providers beforethey enroll in the Texas Medicaid program First each new Medicaidprovider receives a Success with Medicaid package containinginformation on claim filing including helpful tips andinstructions on how to use the automated phone system forinquiries This welcome package is hand delivered during a sitevisit by one of Texas  Medicaid field representatives Threemonths after enrollment the field representatives evaluate asample of each new providers claims to see if there are any issuesthat should be discussed Then the same representative who madethe initial visit revisits the new provider to answer questions anddiscuss any problems noted in the claims sample In additionprogram personnel conduct various workshops for and makeeducational materials available to new providersIn another example Australias Health Insurance CommissionHIC implemented a feedback program to provide medicalpractitioners with regular information about their own benefitauthorization age and gender patient demographics and comparativestatistical information showing the number of services rendered anddollar value of benefits paid All  practitioners receivecorrespondence once a year from HIC The programs educationalfeedback encourages compliance and can act as a deterrent to futurewrongdoing as practitioners are aware that HIC tracks what isclaimed for reimbursement on an annual basis While at first mostpractitioners did not realize that HIC was able to accumulate andanalyze this information the program has now become both aneffective deterrent and a desired source of information for thepractitioners For example some practitioners have asked foradditional information or statistics prior to the annual feedbackreport In October  the HIC Internet Feedback ReportingFacility was established to provide online feedback and statisticsto general practitioners About  general practitionersaccessed their feedback reports online during  and HICimplemented further enhancements to include feedback to othermedical practitionersAlso in Australia Centrelink has determined that  percent ofits preventable incorrect payments relate to incorrect declaration of income by thecustomer or beneficiary Based on this risk assessment Centrelinkdeveloped a range of specific prevention strategies aimed ateducating beneficiaries and employers on income reportingrequirementsThese include educating the beneficiaries on the correct way to declareearnings and reminding them of the consequences of failing tocorrectly declare earnings and outreaching employers in industries whose employees aretraditionally more likely to receive improper payments such asthose with seasonal or parttime employeesIn the latter case Centrelink provides these employers withmaterials to distribute to existing and new employees who arereceiving benefits from Centrelink For example to encourageaccurate income reporting the employers distribute payslipsenvelopes to employees for their use in storing their wagerecordsIn addition to working groups coordination and cooperation withlocal law enforcement and other sources external to an agency canestablish an infrastructure conducive to preventing and detectingfraud Our case illustration shows the value of such anCentrelink defines all incorrect payments as preventable unlessthe payment is unavoidable such as legislated advance paymentsFurthermore Centrelink categorizes preventable payments into threeareas preventable by the customer preventable by staff andpreventable by the system Centrelink reports

Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee of PublicAccounts United KingdomMonitoring performance over time is critical to programmanagement and oversight Evaluation of an organizations programsand its successes in meeting its established goals and inidentifying additional actions is an integral element ofperformance measurement and continued improvement in operationsMonitoring focuses on the assessment of the quality of performanceover time and on the prompt resolution of problems identifiedeither through separate program evaluations or audits Once anorganization has identified its risks related to improper paymentsand undertaken activities to reduce such risks by upgrading itscontrol activities monitoring performance allows the organizationto gauge how well its efforts are workingIn the United Kingdom the Department for Work and PensionsDWP annually reviews its Income Support and Jobseekers Allowanceprograms to estimate the level of fraud and error in the programsmeasure progress toward meeting established performance goals andreport performance results to Parliament As a result of theprogram monitoring and evaluation activities these reviews permitthe government has set new more challenging targets for futureperformanceIn addition the National Audit Office NAO in the UnitedKingdom uses the review results in its annual audits of DWPsfinancial statements NAO reviews DWPs

Health Care System Illinois assessed the risk of improper payments in its Medicaidprogram and based on the results implemented initiativesdesigned to improve payment accuracy To monitor the effects of thenew initiatives Illinois will use random claims sampling to testthe accuracy of the payments by reviewing  randomly selectedclaims per month or  per year The goal of this project is toensure that every paid claim faces an equal random chance ofreview The judgment of field staff auditors nurses and policyexperts will be used to determine if they are paid correctly Thisapproach not only provides periodic estimates of payment andservice accuracy rates to help measure the results of existingenforcement and detection efforts but also helps deter futureerroneous and fraudulent billingsPerformance measures are key to monitoring progress inaddressing improper payments New Zealand requires entities fromwhich the government purchases a significant quantity of goods andservices to include audited statements of objectives and statementsof service performance with their financial statements Thesestatements include where appropriate performance measures relatedto improper payments For example performance measures relating toentitlement accuracy services to reduce benefit crime and debtmanagement have been established for Work and Income New ZealandWINZ a government agency that provides income support andoremployment assistance to eligible people WINZs financialstatements are the main accountability reports used by Parliamentto monitor the agencys performance In addition Parliament usesthe audited information to make informed decisions on resourceallocation and through a Public Service Monitoring Body theState Services Commission to hold the entitys chief executiveofficer responsible if performance standards are not met Forexample the government in its role as purchaser can offerrewards and apply sanctions to a chief executive officer to ensureperformance In addition the government may seek to purchase goodsand services from more than one sourceWINZs monitoring of its payment accuracy is discussed furtherin the case illustration on the following pageMonitoring the activities used by an organization to addressimproper payments should be performed continually and should beingrained in the entitys operations Ongoing monitoring enables anorganization to measure how

activitiesObservationsOur study identified many techniques and approaches thatorganizations have used and found effective in reducing theirlevels of improper payments that could be used by federal agenciesto help reduce improper payments in their programs The techniquesand approaches shared a common focus of improving the internalcontrol systems over the problem areas and generally includedactions in five areascontrol environment risk assessment controlactivities information and communications and monitoring Ourobservations on the key factors for successful actions in each ofthese areas followIn the area of control environment we found that for improperpayment initiatives to be successful setting the tone at the topis critical The pressures applied by top management and oversightentities are instrumental in clearly defining and communicating theneed for improved program operations and most important inredefining the organizational culture The goals and objectives ofthe initiatives being implemented must be transparent to all in theorganization Without ongoing strong support both in spirit and inaction of toplevel program officials and legislative bodies thechances for success in implementing the changes needed to addressimproper payments are slim This toplevel support is especiallycritical given that an investment of time and money is often neededin these types of effortsOne of the biggest hurdles that many entities face in theprocess of managing improper payments is overcoming the propensitytoward denial of the problem It is easy to rationalize avoiding ordeferring taking action to address a problem if you do not know howbig the problem is The nature and magnitude of theproblemdetermined through a systematic risk assessmentprocessneeds to be determined and openly communicated to allrelevant parties When this occurs especially in a strong controlenvironment denial is no longer an option and managers have theinformation as well as the incentive to begin addressing improperpayments This risk assessment is used to determine where risksexist what those risks are and the potential or actual impact ofthose risks on program operations As such it helps identify theareas most in need of corrective action and helps form a basis fordetermining how to allocate resources human and monetary to theproblem areas By performing risk assessments on a recurring basisorganizations also obtain information on the status of theirefforts to reduce improper payments and on areas needing furtherattentionIn the area of control activities we found that organizationsneed to tailor their actions to fit their particular needs Thereis a wide range of activities that can be used to effectivelyaddress improper payments These include the use ofcomputerassisted activities ranging from simple comparativeanalyses eg comparing beneficiaries with mortality rolls tothe use of sophisticated computer models for interactive analysisof large amounts of information eg using neural networking toidentify suspicious patterns of payments Regardless of the levelof sophistication involved the key to success is having the rightpeople perform the right jobs While these technologybasedsolutions can be expensive such investments usually more than payfor themselves in terms of dollars saved They also can be asignificant deterrent and provide for a level of program integritythat could not otherwise be achievedWhen obtaining storing and using computergeneratedinformation an organization must always be mindful of privacy andsecurity issues In the federal arena including federal programsmanaged by state organizations computerassisted activities mustbe implemented consistent with all protections of the Privacy Actof  as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy ProtectionAct of  and other privacy statutesWe also found that organizations use both computergeneratedinformation and nontechnical methods to obtain summarize andcommunicate information needed to evaluate program performanceWhatever method is used the flow of relevant reliable and timelyinformation regarding performance should lead to improvedperformance particularly if an atmosphere of healthy competitionis introduced into the processEducational activities for both beneficiaries and other programparticipants also serve as an effective communication approach tohelp reduce improper payments and strengthen program operationsThe better educated agency employees contractors andbeneficiaries are about what is expected of them and theconsequences of not meeting those expectations the greater thechances for reducing fraud and errors in the payment processAnother key point is that just putting control activities inplace is not the end of the processmonitoring progress and resultsis essential and must include the involvement of toplevelofficials In addition to monitoring daytoday performance it isimportant for an organization to track performance over time andmeasure it against established performance goals or indicatorsThis monitoring activity provides information on the effectivenessof the control activities implemented and helps oversight andtoplevel management officials identify areas needing furtherattention or a shift in focusHigh levels of improper payments need not and should not be anaccepted cost of running federal programs The organizations thatparticipated in our study found they could effectively andefficiently manage improper payments by  changing theirorganizations control environments or cultures  performingrisk assessments  implementing activities to reduce fraud anderrors  providing relevant reliable and timely informationand communication of results to management and monitoring performance over timeIn the federal government implementation of this process willlikely not be easy or quick It will require strong support notjust in words but in actions from the President the Congresstoplevel administration appointees and agency managementofficials Once committed to a plan of action they must remainsteadfast supporters of the end goals and their support must betransparent to allFurther there must be a willingness to dedicate the humancapital and monetary resources needed to implement the changes Inthe human capital area this could involve performing needsassessments and taking the actions necessary to hire individualswith the skills and knowledge necessary to turn the planned actionsinto reality Regarding funding many actions that provedsuccessful to the organizations in our study involvedcomputerassisted analyses of data Effectively and efficientlyimplementing some of these practices could require funding forcomputer software and hardware additional staff andortrainingIn addition it is important that the results of the actionstaken be openly communicated or available not only to the Congressand agency management but also to the general public Thistransparency demonstrates the importance that the government placeson the need for change and openly communicates performance resultsIt also acts as an incentive for agencies to be ever vigilant intheir efforts to address the wasteful spending that results fromlapses in controls that lead to improper paymentsAppendix IObjectives Scope and MethodologyThe objectives of this study were to identify effectivepractices and provide case illustrations and other information forfederal agencies consideration when developing strategies andplanning and implementing actions to manage improper payments Inperforming this study we conducted extensive research andidentified three federal agencies three state governments threeforeign countries and three private sector companies that tookactions that they considered effective in reducing improperpayments in their programsIn general for the organizations that participated in thisstudy we conducted extensive Internet and literature searches toidentify actions that each had taken to reduce improper payments made site visits to interview representatives involved inidentifying and taking actions to reduce improper payments and obtained and reviewed organization reports and other documentationdescribing the actions taken the results of those actions andfuture plans in the areaAs outlined below we used several techniques to identify thestudy participantsFederal AgenciesWe formed a focus group within GAO that was composed of programand financial analysts familiar with each federal agency Thisgroup identified agencies that had implemented practices to reduceimproper payments Additionally we contacted the inspectorsgeneral of the  Chief Financial Officers CFO Act agencies toobtain their views on agency activities if any designed to reduceimproper payments Once we identified potential participants weconducted extensive Internet searches of their Web sites andreviewed entity and GAO audit reports and other documents to obtainbackground and other information for potential best practiceefforts We then contacted three agencies discussed our studyobjectives and planned approach and asked each if it had anyprograms in which actions to reduce improper payments wereeffective Representatives at the three agencies the Department ofVeterans Affairs the Social Security Administration and theDepartment of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare andMedicaid Services formerly the Health Care FinancingAdministration identified programs in which their organizationshad taken actions considered effective and agreed toparticipateState GovernmentsWe conducted extensive Internet searches for all  states toidentify reports and other studies that identified states that hadtaken actions that appeared to identify and reduce improperpayments We also coordinated with other GAO representatives toidentify states that had taken actions to reduce improper paymentsin federal programs in which program management is a stateresponsibility such as the Food Stamp program Based on theinformation obtained we asked representatives in the states ofIllinois Kentucky and Texas if they had any activities that theybelieved were effective in reducing improper payments Eachidentified some actions and agreed to participate in the studyPrivate Sector OrganizationsWe contacted the Private Sector Council a public serviceorganization that assists in the sharing of knowledge between theprivate and public sectors Through this organization threecompanies volunteered to participate in our study and supplied uswith information on the techniques they used and consideredeffective in reducing improper paymentsForeign GovernmentsOur External Liaison Office contacted our counterparts in countries and two world organizations to explain our studyobjective and ask for input on activities if any each had takento reduce improper payments in its programs We also conductedextensive Internet searches to identify programs in each of theseentities in which actions had been taken to reduce improperpayments Based on the responses from our initial requests forinformation from the countries and organizations and our Internetsearch results we selected three countries Australia NewZealand and the United Kingdom as possible study participants Wecontacted representatives for each and they agreed toparticipateIn the course of identifying actions that possible participantsin our study had taken to reduce improper payments we identifiednumerous Web sites that might provide organizations with usefulinformation that they can consider when attempting to addressimproper payment or other problems in their programs Appendix IIIlists these resourcesWe conducted our fieldwork from May  through March  Weasked officials of the various organizations highlighted in thecase illustrations and throughout the report to verify the accuracyof the information presented on their activities and incorporatedtheir comments as appropriate We did not independently verify theaccuracy of that information In addition we issued an exposuredraft of this executive guide to obtain comments from interestedparties including members of the CFO and OIG community OMB andselected professional organizations in the United States andabroad We incorporated comments as appropriateAppendix IIEntity DescriptionsThis
