            all right   okay   what uh what baseball teams do you follow   i follow ive been a long time Cincinnati Reds fan because when i was growing up and i was five years old i wanted to be a catcher so i was a big Johnny Bench fan so i was a big Johnny Bench fan so ive been through the Reds with the Reds since you know nineteen seventy   uhhuh   and i remember the Seventy World Series like i said i was only five years old then but i had to give a report to my dad every because that was when they played World Series games in the afternoons sometimes   uhhuh   and ive kind of gotten away from them until the last couple of years because i didnt really know many players and their team but i also being from the Indiana area i like the Cubs and the White Sox so i kind of follow those two teams   hum yeah   a little bit and you know since moving down here the Rangers you know ive been picking up on them a little bit and uh it looks like they could do all right this year and uh of course theyre in there with the right White Sox i believe and theyre in their division so   uhhuh   the White Sox headed for probably another good year i hope what about yourself   oh i guess mainly the the Rangers such as they are   yeah   they do seem to have a pretty tough division though with Oakland and Kansas City and White Sox all uh   yeah   jammed in there   yeah do you go to a lot of games   oh i get to i dont know quite a few in the summer   uhhuh thats ive been looking forward to it ive only been to one game and i just moved down here at the end of last summer so that last season was winding down so im hopefully ill uh get to a couple this year i want to see Nolan pitch one time that thats be thatd be really neat   yeah it looked like theyre starting off kind of shaky but they theyve gone i guess over five hundred now   yeah   i was hoping that no hitter that he threw would would get them fired up a little bit   it might   but its hard hard to tell   did they uh play today   uh i was trying to think they were up in a stand at Detroit   uhhuh   i dont know if theyre playing today or not   yeah thats right thats right yeah i watched a little bit of the i was flipping back and forth between the the Pacers and the Celtics and uh the White Sox game   uhhuh   that was on today i i just like i like the White Sox ive never really got into them and then this friend of mine was just a hard core White Sox so he took me to a game and you know i think theyre you know theyre really neat because theyre such a young team   uhhuh   actually the youngest team in baseball and they got some you know the last three or four years their number one picks you know theyre all suited up and playing for them   yeah   and the draft and uh you got to like that you know building the team through draft picks and stuff like that   yeah it says a lot for their future   yeah it does hopefully some of their players will come through and they got Tim Raines a veteran and they got Carlton Fisk hes you know still pretty solid a lot of experience but uh uh you like the Astros or anything like that   oh i dont really follow them a whole lot um i i hear about them occasionally ive got a friend whose a a trainer for one of their farm clubs   uhhuh   i think so  we hear off and on about them theyve never really done a whole lot i mean theyre up and down kind of like the Rangers are  most of the time   yeah well when was the last time the Rangers really did well   its been probably three or four years since they were i think they finished second in their division i dont remember what they ended up last year third or fourth i guess   yeah so they were contenders till about three or fours years ago   yeah they have been off and on uh maybe maybe three or four times since theyve been here   yeah i dont i never really followed them all i knew uh kind of watched them a little bit in the seventies there again you know cause i was a little catcher in baseball i liked to watch a Jim Sundberg and uh like Jeff Burroughs   uhhuh   uh forget who else used to play for them but uh yeah those guys were were really tough   well theyve been like a lot of teams and the minute they do real badly in the past they just got got rid of their manager this is Valentines the first manager theyve had in on you know any kind of length of time   yeah   and so hopefully hell eventually put something together   you think hes pretty good   i i cant  i dont know uh sometimes i think he is and sometimes i wonder   yeah i was watching the game yesterday and they had had bases loaded and they tried a uh a squeeze play and uh i just couldnt understand that i forget whose who was batting and but uh i dont know i just i couldnt understand that move there was only one out   uhhuh   and its like you know give the guy a cut you know you got bases loaded you know one mistake cause a lot of these players arent used to bunting that much and its a easy double play   yeah true   but   i guess i was feeling pretty confident about the team Valentine this year until uh he got mad at Pete Incaviglia and just cut him for because he was upset at him   you didnt like that move   well i i can understand his point i thought it was kind of childish to just cut him instead of trying to trade him because then Detroit picks him up and he started out real good for them and he hes gotten kind of shaky now   yeah   and i think they should have at least gotten something for him   yeah its true what about uh Sierra you a big Ruben Sierra fan   yeah   hes been around what four or five years   i think so yeah   you think you can see him staying there for awhile or   yeah i think i think as long as he produces he and Franco they they run kind of hot and cold too   yeah   i think Franco hit a home run was it last night to win the game   oh yeah id i turned the game on i dont know who won   i think they won six to five and i think that was on his he hit a home run at the end and broke the tie up   well good yeah im kind of into baseball cards so uh last year i was buying a lot of Juan Gonzalez cards   hum   so im hoping hes going to blossom and make me a rich man someday   yeah  thatd be nice   yeah   yeah i think the Rangers have the the pitching staff they need if they would just produce some offense they might do all right   yeah well im definitely looking forward to going to a few games this summer thats good entertainment at a budget price   yeah you said you were a Cincinnati fan has uh all this brouhah a with Pete Rose over the years   yeah   caused caused you any distaste for them or   no you mean like no i mean thing about rose i mean you know that hes got a problem in his personal life i just you know he he messed up but i still think hes belongs in the Hall of Fame and   uhhuh yeah   and you know he played for so many so well for so many years that   sure   yeah its uh its just too bad its you know like the players that do drugs or do you know are alcoholics they just have a problem   uhhuh   and its too bad it carried over and has hurt his image and everything else   well but it didnt didnt seem to really hurt the team in fact seemed to kind of fire them up and make them work harder   yeah yeah   after he was gone   yeah i think Lou Pinella is doing a good job too obviously   uhhuh yeah   he knows you know hes you know hes been there hes played a lot of ball himself so hes been in some World Series and you know hes a lot of experience as a player and it looks like hes doing all right as a manager   uhhuh   well thanks for this is the first time ive ever been called so its kind of interesting yeah i usually get home and pick up the phone and do some calling so uh   really   but i appreciate your calling   sure i enjoyed talking to you Fred   all right take care   you too byebye   bye
