                                 Out of the Past            In the movies the past isindeed a foreign country they dress differently there The clothes on womenparticularly create foreignness in different ways Depending on what era themovie is set in clothes can conjure a unfamiliarity that is soothinglyadorable or uneasily alien Twenty years back and the gaze is nostalgic Butgo  years back and the fashions cross into a mist that renders them faintlydangerousthey are feared because their truth has finally been let go Insteadof indulgence yearold fashion seems to need taming How else to explainthe way movies use ridicule and easy clichs when recreating the clothes ofthe s            You can see how it worksin the recent movie Pleasantville  in which a pair of modern teens aretransported back  yearsnot into real life but into a blackandwhiteOzzie and Harriet style TV sitcom The movies conceit is that sitcomconventions of that timeno color no sex no bathroomsdelimit thecharacters reality The extrademanding female underwear and extrasilly bigskirts also confirm our sense of the foreignness then when painful situationscould be resolutely ignored and awkward facts kept under wraps while incompany The womens clothes in Pleasantville  with all their ridiculousexaggerations show us a country now alien indeed They remind us that therewas a time when the line between the personal and the public wasimpassable            P leasantville suggests that s fashions for womenhave now come to mean what female Victorian clothing used to mean in thesnot just clothes in a different style but a metaphor a compendium ofridiculous and unnatural devices invented to dishonor female life and libertyThe actual clothes of the s are now almost half a century gone most of themvanished We only see them in old films old television and old magazinesjust the way s fashions were understood  years later in the s fromancient fashion plates and daguerreotypes            The transition from thes to the s was severe By the second half of the s female fashionand female life had been totally transformed Women had adopted short hair andshort skirts they wore the easyfitting sweaters and dresses appropriate formodern female citizens who by that time had acquired effective means ofcontraception gainful employment and the vote Too young to remember theordinary clothes of the previous era they regarded huge bustles sweepingtrains lofty coiffures and tightly laced waists with a ferocious derisionborn of dread            Now at the end of the s with the evidence drawnmainly from old movies and old sitcoms s fashion is similarly ripe forreductive contempt Those big pointy breasts useless hats and lampshadeskirts look so creepy on the screenand hardly a woman now alive can rememberwhat the great range of real clothing was like at the time            Yet this phenomenonmysteriously rights itself the further we recede in time Go back  moreyears and all our social perceptions become romantically transformed Clothesin historical movies can show the really distant past as a friendly foreignland perhaps even a lot like the here and now All Ancient Historical Drag ismorally and visually neutral apt for inventive play with the styles of acentury back or five centuries or  Victorian fashion for example whollyredeemed is often treated with great respect in movies such as The Portraitof a Lady  The high hair and big bustles have been assimilated to all theother harmless customs of antiquity theyve become the equivalent of Egyptianbreastplates and Elizabethan padding            Historical films are usually kind to the olden daysupdating the principal womens clothes so the actresses look attractive bymodern standards Two recent releases deal with the Elizabethanage Elizabeth  the bloody tale of the Virgin Queens rise andShakespeare in Love  a romp through Elizabethan theater The first showslate  th century fashion looking ridiculous only on the aging queenherself as if no other woman at the time ever wore a rigid farthingale andstuffed sleeves a tightly frizzed wig and a bushel of pearls or painted herface with white paste The young court ladies in Elizabeth appear intheir natural hair and skin wearing modernlooking Renaissancey garments thatrun to becomingly mobile and flowing silk dresses with smoothly boned bodicesShakespeare in Love has authentic Elizabethan dress for everybody buttheres a good deal of extra emphasis on the way the period corsets flatten thebreasts and strictly encase the ribsand on how thrilling it is when thecorsets come off In s movies set in Elizabethan times of course everybodywore big molded and pointy breasts with their Renaissancey garbnoflattening was permitted and certainly no exposure            Even though corsetedbodies are authentically Elizabethan they are used so freely in both thesefilms because theyre modish once more Modern designers such as ChristianLacroix and John Gallianoand especially JeanPaul Gaultieroverthrew sideology to reinstate the corset using them as sexy accents in the early sSuch recent use has decisively transformed the standard  th centuryemblem of female oppression back into the erotic device it always wasCorseting has stopped looking dishonorable and started looking chic again bothas a feature of recent ball gowns and wedding gowns and as a costume componentthat can give a modern frisson to movies set in ancient days            The s arent quite ancient yet but theyre getting moreso By contrast to the condescension of Pleasantville  genuinetenderness for the time could be seen in The Last Picture Show  a film about real life in  Nostalgia could still be evoked after only years and many remembered when The movie was beautifully restrained andaccurate with respect to clothingthe peasant blouses the swinging skirtsthe smooth sideparted hair the garter belts and capacious underpants from atime before spandex were all deliciously heartbreaking never exaggerated forlaughs The films evocation of the style of the time was marred only byinsufficient attention to movement The young jeanswearing actresses of thes failed to walk in the correct s style while wearing long narrow skirtsThe secret Knees together and dont try to stride            Today in the sright on schedule fashions of the s are being given a nostalgicsympathetically accurate whirl in such movies as Hilary and Jackie andThe Ice Storm  A genial gaze is being cast on them just as flaredtrousers squaretoed shoes and long male hair are once again looking normalin the reallife fashion universe In another  years no doubt s fashionwill be in for its share of cinematic contempt once the square toes are trulygone just as the s finally achieve true antiquity            The modes of any period can easily be made to look stupidEven in its own day fashion needs a lot of enhancement to make it look greatWhereas fashion photographyin the s as alwaysaimed to arouse active lustfor new goods the clothes in s movies were so thoroughly surreal as to lookquite unfit for normal wear even if they were waitresses uniforms orgirlnextdoor dresses Movie garb was automatically read as part of thetradition that stretched back to silent Hollywood days with everything madespecially for the stars and uniquely worn by them In Cat on a Hot TinRoof  the designers fit Elizabeth Taylor into a formfittingmadetomeasure bonedandstayed builtinbra sort of slip unobtainable byanybody else an inspired collaboration between Taylors unbelievable body andthe costume department Real s slips had no relation to it at all They werelike the ones in The Last Picture Show  with wrinkles around the middleand unreliable straps that slid around on the shoulders uneasily contendingwith the bra straps In the s nobody wanted the movies to show all thatexcept for the Italian ones where the sexiest women all wore illfitting slipsand had hairy armpits too That was really foreign            But equally strange wasDoris Day whose many movie outfits were conceived as musicalcomedycostumesbright smooth and jaunty every blue and yellow clear and trueevery neat hat perfectly matching and every outline eternally crispeven ifshe was supposed to be working in an office or teaching in a journalism schoolNobody ever wanted to emulate this effect it was hers alone            Today we cede our vision of s female fashion to themovie version as if that were the real mirror of the decadeeverythingblatantly cleansed of error willfully idealized into unreality odorlesseffortless affectless Those excruciatingly cleancut and perfectly cladcinematic female bodies can seem to suggest a world unwilling to acknowledgethe existence of adultery homosexuality racial strife female lust and ragepolitical and cultural revolution family dysfunction or messy passion of anykind not to mention irreparable loss unbearable pain and death            In fact many s movies were about all thesethings and more the most intractable aspects of human life But they werealways careful to suggest that none of that could affect the timehonoredconventions for the cinematic female wardrobe Those conventions had animportant meaning at the time They stood for the notion that private life wasprivate
