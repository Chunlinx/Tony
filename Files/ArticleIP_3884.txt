Bandits Finallya voice in the wildernessI have been trying to understand why I should cry for tobacco farmers andcant understand why others do When slavery ended cotton growers had eitherto figure out how to harvest their crop without dirtcheap labor or findanother crop to grow Many opted to grow tobacco and it looks like its timeto switch again            I find itinteresting that my representative in Congress Thomas Bliley can with astraight face recommend subsidies for these farmers when he and others in hisparty have vowed to get rid of welfare as we know it Tobacco subsidies arejust another form of welfare I say give the growers two years then make themget a job like everybody else             Dina Coles GlenAllen Va                           Shugerless Latte

that in your words tell us what life at these topschools is really like First when you pick two guys that are basicallysimilar in background and basically similar in every other way you get twodiaries thathere comes a shockersound similar Therefore how is twobetter than one What kind of sample of real college life is that            Second speaking fromexperience of being at an Ivy and being in a fraternity there are some thingsthat are really missing in their diaries Its a crime to quote thatstory about the fallen teenager and then bring in two guys who would have noclue about Greek life Sure I find it interesting to read that some peoplehave fun playing Boggle and touring the dorms together but is this a good wayto find an answer to a question that uses hotbed and sexual abandon in thesame sentence            Nexttime fit your pointpick somebody in a fraternity or a sorority or somebodythat would bring meaning to the anecdote you quoted Be prepared to take thegood with the bad For instance members of Greek organizations have a higheraverage GPA than regular students Or maybe thats not what Yale or MIT wantedeveryone to hear We wouldnt want everybody to know about our games of bingedrinking sexual abandon and Boggle too             Brad Webber                                       FourWeddings and an Assimilation                        There was a funny moment inone of Eric Lius responses to Elliott Abrams in their Dialogue on mixed marriage Liu declared himself unconcerned withthe very high rate of intermarriage among AsianAmericans and proposed thatthe same easygoing attitude should work for Jews And on the face of it whynot It is only when one considers numbers that the comparison becomes quitehilarious To Abrams concern that the fewer than million Jews in theworld might disappear through assimilation Liu replies with the generosity andlack of worries of one backed by a billion people Give me a tenth of that inIsrael and I could also see it his way Instead in the case of Jews the depthof the mother country runs at about  embattled million            Of courseunderlying this discussion is the deeper question of whether there is any valuein the preservation of Jewish religion and culture Those of us who believethere is such a value are worried                           SandaKaufman Cleveland                           Address your email tothe
