                                 An Awful Lot of Autos            Imagine walking to the edgeof a cliff looking down saying to yourself Boy thats a steep drop Itllsure hurt if I jump and then jumping anyway Such seems to be the curiousstrategy of the world auto industry in the late s as it grapples withprices that are actually declining demand thats stagnant and productioncapacity that against all good sense just keeps getting bigger            Now inone respect this anxiety about the auto industry simply reflects the fact thatit has become the poster child for a global economy in which deflation issuddenly everyones favorite thing to worry about Even in todays supposedlyhightech world General Motors and Ford remain bellwethers for the way peoplefeel about the economy as a whole In the mids Detroits gas guzzlerswere taken as emblems of the United States inability to adjust to the end ofthe postwar boom At the end of that decade nothing made inflation more realthan the phrase sticker shock So today the image of assembly lines churningout hundreds of thousands of unneeded and unwanted vehicles is an excellentrepresentation of the specter of global recession This is a specter that seemsto loom larger of course after the series of currency crises that have besetAsia            In another respect though concerns about globalovercapacity in auto production are industryspecific and by most accountswell justified It isnt just the William Greiders of the world who think thatin the near future there are going to be too many cars and not enough driversInstead just about everyone thinks this Whats curious is that no one isreally doing anything about it            Its truethat overcapacity concerns are at least a decade old click for a quick reviewand that the predicted crisis of demand has not yet materialized thoughperhaps it has and Ive just seen it as a pleasant period when car prices havestayed the same instead of rising Thats because the US economy hascontinued to expand so briskly and because the Big Three automakers haverestructured their operations to do a better job of matching supply withdemand In other words they downsized Overcapacity is in any casedifficult to measure since its more important for car companies to be able tomeet increases in demand than it is for them to make only as many cars ascustomers want You can shut down a line for a couple of weeks without anyproblems if demand falls short You cant build that line from scratch ifdemand rises unexpectedly By some estimates in fact overcapacity of amillion cars is reasonable for the Big Three            You wouldnt be wrong then to see something atad Chicken Littleish in all this overcapacity talk especially when its beingproffered by the very people building the cars for which there is supposedly nodemand And there is clearly an element of saber rattling on the part of UScar companies which are anxious about the continued impact on their earningsof the strong dollar and who want South Korea in particular to open itsmarkets to US cars Last year the Big Three sold  vehicles in SouthKorea out of a total market of  million A Pontiac Bonneville is as rare asight in Seoul as an AstonMartin is here Emphasizing the global realities ofoverexpansion thus becomes a way for the Big Three to serve their own interestswithout seeming parochial            And yetthere are those realities and South Korea is the most remarkable of them At atime when the South Korean economy as a whole seems to be in need of dramaticrestructuring precisely around the issue of excessively free credit for capitalexpenditures South Korean car companies are forging ahead with investmentplans that dwarf anything theyve previously done As a whole South Koreanautomakers plan to put  billion into expanding facilitiesHyundaiformerly the Yugos poor cousinis increasing capital spending by percent Daewoo is doubling its investment And most incredibly Kia Motorswhich needed a government bailout to save it from its creditors will beputting  million into plant expansion in  a threefold increase Ohand then theres Samsung maker of cool stereos and microwaves which decidedlast year that it wouldnt be satisfied until it had become a worldclassautomaker What about handtooled leather bags Theyre nice Couldnt Samsunghave decided to become a worldclass maker of handtooled leather bagsinstead            Similarly Mexicos outputtwothirds of which will beexportedis expected to rise  percent a year for the next three years whileeven the Japanese whose car companies are among the only bright spots in aforlorn economy are adding to capacity And of course US automakers evenas they worry about their inability to raise prices are breaking ground on newplants and pushing their workers to take more and more overtime            In thatsense South Korea is just a striking example of whats happening all over Andit is hard when reading yet another account of an auto company CEOs concernsabout falling prices not to want to shake him vigorously and say Just sayno damn it If there are going to be too many cars then it seems sensible tostop making cars Except of course that if you do you lose all hope ofcapturing what market does exist and except of course that when you stopmaking cars you have to close factories and throw people out of work            Its important to see that the problem here isnot no matter what General Motors says that US workers are overpaid Nor isit really that individual factories are overstaffed After all the Big Threeare enjoying hefty profits and spending billions on sharebuyback plans Allthree companies require between  and  workers to build avehiclesignificantly inferior to Japanese standards but significantly betterthan it ever was and significantly more efficient than most people thoughtpossible for a US company And no I dont know what a  worker lookslike The problems that US automakers endured during the s and swere for the most part selfinflicted as the superior performance ofJapanese automakers over that period suggests But the problem that USautomakers face now is of a macroeconomic not microeconomic nature which iswhat must make it so difficult for them to accept Its about the fact thatwithin a given industry supply does not ensure demand and that what isrational for the individual firmwhich needs to sell as much of its product aspossible and so has to make sure that its product is availablemay becollectively irrational            One interesting questionraised by all this is whether cars are commodities In other words does thefact that there are  million more Kias on the road really make someone lesslikely to shell out  for a Honda Accord Auto design and advertising areall about differentiating one product from another But all this talk aboutglobal overcapacity suggests that automakers see themselves as all making thevery same thing I wonder if thatll make me feel better the next time I seesomeone blow by me in a new Porsche Boxster
