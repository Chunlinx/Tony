          tell me what books you read   oh boy well um i havent been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately i read uh one book a friend recommended to me i cant even remember the guys name it was a science fiction Dean       Cole or something like that and it was so frightening and it had so much violence in it i just  could hardly stand it yeah i didnt think it was so great she thought it was riveting you know but i couldnt deal with that but um   um i try to avoid the   mostly i read im a marriage and family counselor and mostly i read things to do with raising kids and now i have two little kids or codependency or you know fifty thousand things like John Bradshaws books on uh The Family and   uhhuh umhum   Homecoming and Inner Child and so i read usually that kind of stuff if and right now im reading um Judith Viorsts book called Necessary Losses where she talks about different losses that weve had in our lives that we have to get past if were going to mature and   umhum   so in my in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old i i read  yes thats really changed my reading habits because i used to read so much especially when i was in school     that does cut into your reading time a lot yeah   you know but gosh its uh its getting pathetic now if i get through a magazine ive been   well my my kids are up and out of the house now so you know ill uh encourage you that you do get uh a little more time to yourself later on  i wont say lots   yeah later youre probably looking for your kids so you can  talk to them when theyre out running around with friends  yeah what do you read     yeah oh uh well i read for a living uh im an editor   you do oh oh how interesting what kind of books   and so i im at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and therefore i read uh psychology sociology anthropology political science philosophy linguistics history uh   um oh my goodness   yeah and you name it ive read some of it   yeah well that sounds like a fascinating job   it really is it its a great place to be and the uh its nice to work with people uh who   yeah   are not required to use your services and so therefore are grateful and not arguing you with you about them if they dont want an editor they dont come   yeah thats true thats true well you probably i i seem to remember that uh little byline on a lot of things ive read um is is is that um do they have a mail     hum   kind of campaign that they send to professionals in the social no   no we dont uh normally we dont publish uh things under our own imprint uh   hum that sounds so familiar   we have had books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different uh commercial and academic publishers and university presses   umhum   so uh i end up sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through sometimes just a few chapters because thats as far as they get   yeah   but i also get of course lots of references to neat stuff to read about   yeah   so im uh i was just thinking when they told me the topic i should just i should read the uh titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that im in the middle of   yeah   im reading uh Within the Plantation Household which is a history uh sort of a sociological history of southern women black and white living on plantations   oh that sounds interesting yeah   uh a book called Poisons of the Past which is about ergotisms that uh fungus that grows on rye   oh   it causes the uh uh Saint Anthonys Fire Disease where people fell into fits and   i thought that was going to be some oh oh my goodness   there is a a theory at least that a lot of people who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of ergot   huh   and a book called Job Cues Gender Cues which explains uh how certain professions and vocations get uh flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other like uh nursing   umhum nursing or   started out all men and then in the nineteenth century began to have women and now its practically all women   yeah secretaries i bet that used to be mostly men who were secretaries of any type for business   and that uh thats right and the thing that changed that was the manual typewriter   yeah oh   but then it became you see just sort of a clerical task whereas when you wrote it out in long hand you were a   yeah then you were important   yes you were a confidential assistant to the person   yeah yeah like the scribes who did the old documents you know for churches and   right   and stuff yeah thats interesting   and then ive got a book called Fashions in Science which is a sociology that explains uh why certain theories get to be popular in uh sociology and uh how difficult it is to swim against the tide if you have a different idea that isnt vatted by your peers   umhum   and then i have one novel thats called First Light thats about uh archeology   hum   the British novel so its its really quite interesting i havent got too far into it yet   gosh really so are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts that have not been published   uh those are all books that are out uh published and bound now but theyre just things that   huh   uh pertain to various things im working on or were uh mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity so i got them out of the library and decided id read some more in them   yeah my goodness well thats fascinating gosh   so i read a lot of history and uh a few novels an occasional mystery stories just for fun   umhum yeah yeah i never have gotten into any of the romantic novels or any of that kind of stuff my husband reads a lot of the um well he did before we had kids the Star Trek and all those kind of scifi kinds of things you know   umhum oh yeah yeah   you really hes got a quite a collection of those but uh my stuff revolves uh revolves revolves around uh one hundred one thousand lets see ive got one called One Thousands Practical Parenting Tips which teaches you to put elastic instead of shoelaces in your kids shoes hey ive done that to every pair my three year old has     oh hey thats a nifty idea great   you know really and uh   oh i think the the boom to parents and the the shoelace department was those little Velcro tabs i think thats inc redibly   oh yeah yeah but theres a surprising number that are still around that arent that dont have those so thats an alternate means of dealing with  but um im trying to think of what else ive got uh   umhum   since im um a therapist and all ive done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups so ive got all the different alcoholics what they call the blue the blue book the big book   yeah   and all the OA literature and all the CODA literature so im trying to get familiarized more familiarized with that because i refer clients and different groups and uh   umhum   well lets see im trying to think of the   what do you think is the most promising or practical book uh of that kind yo uve read recently   um oh i definitely i have a a love affair with John Bradshaw i just have found everything ive read of his to be fabulous   hum   um he started out with one called The Family which does the family systems and peoples roles in the family and then he did uh Healing Healing the Shame that Binds You about how shame can just be so paralyzing and people isolate and withdraw and then the third one that he came out with is now called Homecoming uh and uh theres a subtitle to it i never can remember what it is its something like um A Journey   umhum   In Your Inner Child or something like that   yeah i knew his literary agent in Houston when she was just uh convincing him to write all this down he was teaching   oh hes just great and now hes had the the first the first one and the third one put into a ten session uh PBS series   yeah i saw i saw one of those episodes on PBS uh from time to time out here we have four different PBS channels that we can get on the cable   yeah oh   and theyll have all ten of those shown back to back in the middle of the night for people can video tape them   i know yeah so people can just tape them i guess you know  but i definitely have gotten a lot out of his lately hes just probably been one of the most theres an author thats in um   yeah   thats in uh Arizona who used to be in Dallas it seems like we have a lot of these that have been in Texas called PM Melody who does a lot of writing on codependency and shes got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and uh   umhum hm   a workbook called Breaking Free and just some real uh helpful practical things for codependency so thats been another one that ive thought was real helpful but   umhum   other than that uh my reading centers on Paddington Bear and  Winnie the Pooh and  Doctor Seuss   oh yes  oh   but i really have enjoyed exploring childrens literature because theres so much more uh new things out that you know i id pull out the classics once in a while for my kids but theres such cute things out for kids   oh theres some absolutely wonderful illustrated childrens books   oh i know and i just go to the library because i just theyre expensive i mean it and they go through them so fast you know   yeah umhum   so i just i really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out and they just love to sit and read and now finally the littlest one is old enough to to sit you know and watch the pictures instead of grabbing it and trying to rip the pages out   exactly right uh well   so that has been fun to do that you know go through the childrens literature and uh     i read the Publishers Weekly uh which lists all the upcoming books forthcoming books and uh   uhhuh   there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful but i was tickled to see that some publisher is uh reprinting those the James Thurber books for children   oh wonderful   the Wonderful O and The Thirteen Clocks that have been out of print for about oh i think about twenty years   gosh really well im going to have to look for those yeah   well i had those for my kids and they really did enjoy them   oh yeah yeah   oh but they were old copies then i didnt buy them when my kids were little and so they probably were out of print all of already when my kids were small but   yeah yeah   um i was really happy to see that yeah i guess its in honor of his hundredth
