        so how do you get most of your current event information   well during see im going to school right now and uh while im working i dont get a i dont get a chance to read the paper a lot   uhhuh   and i dont watch TV as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it while im at work sometimes i on the computer network um   right umhum   i read the news sometimes and thats kind of helpful   i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on whats going on   thats true i mean my roommates and stuff you know   yeah   people around me talk about it and the people i work with are pretty you know up uptodate on that kind of stuff so   right well im a housewife i have three kids and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six oclock and then um   uhhuh yeah   talking with people and just hearing whats going on but   do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the McNeil Lehrer Hour   just the regular channel just channel eight thats our channel here thats the um eyewitness news   oh really uhhuh oh channel see channel where i am channel eights um like public TV so its kind of different   so oh uhhuh yeah   i think i think the uh i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right its kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news   right and i think even in the elections they choose who theyre going to follow and who theyre not and basically you know if a candidate candidate can get them to follow then the news will   yeah   you know kind of publicize his name   yeah exactly   i dont think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of whats going on   uhhuh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say you you just cant get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and read and probably read something on it   right right and the news too it just doesnt um cover all that many stories i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes   yeah   and you know and and your catastrophes catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really dont know whats going on   yeah   um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study whos running in our area and i do study whats going on in the economy it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information   what kind of uh see i subscribe to like Science News and thats thats real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of whats going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldnt know about   right i   but other than that i dont really read i dont i dont really subscribe to anything else   i used to read every month a Readers Digest   uhhuh   but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the war when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on but a lot of the times   oh yeah   i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper but i just cant seem to find the time if theyd put it out in a video or on  not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things   yeah   yeah   but   well i remember during back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the TV on because that they were going constantly with that stuff   right   but uh     well i um they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of and people said that they wanted to see more on       outside of Texas news you know we just dont want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas   yeah   that we want to hear whats going on with the economy whats being done to help it whats going on in other countries whats you know just more information   if they reported every murder if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour but uh   yeah well i guess youll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer Olympics   oh yeah thats they still already theyre having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then on on the Olympics you know and theyve got like a countdown its like sixteen hundred days or something   i know were trying to get tickets to it right now yeah   oh really thats gonna be crazy that time of year here but uh     yeah   i cant believe i mean theyre theyre uh stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over i guess people want to hear about it also big in big in the news right now is the Braves because theyre uh theyre in you know training spring training or whatever and they did so well last year   right right yeah they spent a lot of time thats another thing they spend a long time on sports and i think that um thats fine i would like to see more time spent on other things but   yeah it seems like i dont know its they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know or if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some some channel for it but i dont have cable
