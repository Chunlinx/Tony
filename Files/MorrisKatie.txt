                     Let me start off by asking what is your full name and is there any story behind your name                     My full name is Julia Kate Morris and theres really no story of any importance or interest         I was named after my grandmother Katie Sharp                     OK         Do people in your family normally name children after family members                     Oh yeah its a big deal in our family weve got more Catherines and Margarets running around than I can count                     That is interesting         Well my second question leading into the whole reason for the interview today is childhood stories and what is the first story that you remember from your childhood                     I think the first story I remember is um Rapunzle                  you know Rapunzle Rapunzle let down your gold hair                     Hum         Why         Did you like that story                     I guess                     Do you remember who told you the story                     My mother                              Was that your favorite story                     I think so I heard it a lot and I think I maybe um related to the princess         I think all little girls do because we both have blond hair                     OK         So you and your friends used to playact out some of these stories                     Oh sure I think all kids playact things they hear from their childhood         You know Cinderella Sleeping Beauty that kind of thing                     So of all these stories what do you think might have been your most favorite from your childhood                     I guess Rapunzle         Thats the one I heard the most                     What part of the story did you like the most                     I think when shed let her hair down and the prince would climb up the tower to the tower room                     OK         What was it about that that you liked so much                              I dont know I just thought it was kind of neat                     The fact that her hair could be that long or something                     Oh yeah                     What was your least favorite part of the story                     I really dont think I had a least favorite part         I thought the whole story you know was very interesting at that age in my childhood         The whole thing was just amazing to me                     OK         Of all the stories you read as a child do you think any of those childhood stories had an impact on your life                     Not that I can really say you know         As you get older you realize that theyre fairy stories and not based in any real truth but that they were happy times for you as a child         But I cant say that they made any real impact                     At what age do did you realize that they were more for the fun or mythology or                     Oh I dont know probably around         seven eight nine something like that                     OK         Speaking of your reading habits as you got older as a teenager what type of reading material what type of stories did you read         You know how were they different                     Oh I dont know that they were so much different         I read the um Nancy Drew books and I read the Hardy Boy books and um whatever was         Black Beauty things of that nature         You know whatever was popular with young teenagers and um kids my age at that time         You have to remember this was a long time ago                              Reading into your young adult life what type of reading materials did move into then                  And why                     Um there was a series of books I read as I got farther into my teenage years and for the life of me I cant remember the name of the character but it was um a series of books about a young woman that was a nurse         And um I think those made must have made some lasting impression on me because here I am today                     And whats your profession now                     Im a nurse                     So I so I guess in some small fashion you associated with some of the characters                     Im sure                     Alright         Do you have a favorite author                     Um yes         His name is Frank Perreti                     What types of stories does he write                     Um hes a Christian author and he writes very dramatic stories uh concerning um such issues as the second coming Satan being among us and theyre not theyre not so much preachy gospel type books as they are very good um drama you know almost scary type stories but theyre very good                     So what was it specifically that drew you to these particular books                     Well to tell you the truth um it was the fly page on one of the books that I read         It was the little synopsis on the back on the inside cover that drew me to the book         And I had no idea that the gentleman was a Christian author when I bought the book         It just sounded very interesting and uh Ive become quite a fan of his                     OK                  What uh does your family have any collection of books or anything like that         Childhood books that maybe they passed down through the generations that maybe that was read to you as a child or anything like that                     Not myself specifically but I know that we still have a copy of a um         book your mother had from childhood that we read to you as a little boy                     What was that                      Dalmatians                              Lets see         Going back to the stories about the nurse         Would you say that story had an impact on your life or do you think that was just coincidence                     No it probably in the long run it probably did because it made me think about the you know the desire to do for other people         The interest and excitement I guess there is in the medical field         Working in hospitals specifically emergency rooms was always uh a thrill for me         And um I guess that kind of those books kind of set me to thinking as a younger person                     Were any of your childhood stories somehow related to that in any fashion                     No uh huh they were the typical little golden book childhood stories                     How many stories do you remember from your childhood         You know what types of stories do you remember                              Um oh books like your typical childhood books like Black Beauty         Golly let me think         Oh The Grimms Fairy Tales um         books of that nature Cinderella Sleeping Beauty Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs                     Now you said earlier that your mother read some of these stories to you         Did you ever read any of these stories on your own time                     Oh sure we had we had like I said the little golden books that came in sets and other storybooks         Um          I remember reading them myself as a child and certainly as I got older um reading was important         Its still important to me now because I have such um a reality based profession that when I that when I do read its solely for the purpose uh of escaping reality         Ill read Ill read just about anything I can get my hands on that does not have anything to do with the medical field         Which I cant say is particularly thats not completely the case because I have read several of the several of the Patricia Cornwell novels and her main character um is a pathologist named Kay Scarpetta         So but thats not really the primary sense in her book         Hers are of course murdermystery type novels         Um          I read yes I admit it Ive read Louis LAmour uh but mostly the Sackett novels because that deals a lot with um the part of the country that I was born and raised in         Um and I enjoy reading novels about that but as far as reality based reading material I dont the newspapers about as reality oriented as I get                     So where were you born                     Albuquerque New Mexico                     Do you think that particular area of the country had any influence on the types of things that maybe you read as a child or as a young adult                     Um probably starting in high school it did because my high school English teacher um is a published author and is very popular in that part of the country         And Ive noticed in the past couple of years that theyre starting to sell his novels out here too         And uh which really thrills me to see that because hes such a talented person                     Do you remember what his name is                     His name is Rudolpho Aniya                     What types of stories did he write                     His books course you know they always say you should write write about what you know         His books are centered in that part the country in New Mexico and specifically in the um Hispanic culture         His first uh book is called Bless Me Ultima and it was about his grandmother         Uh and the rest of his books are kind of have kind of a mystical quality to them because theres a lot of mysticism in the uh Catholic uh religion in the Hispanic culture in New Mexico         And uh theyre quite interesting                     Would you say that some of the stories that you read growing up were more geo geographically based in that area         By authors I mean         Um having lived in that area obviously having a strong Hispanic influence were some of the stories integrated in that fashion                     Oh uh sure they were         You always heard stories about that part of the country about the conquistadors coming into the southwest and a lot of the reading material and and uh what not centered around the history of the area         Because there was so much of it         Um books like Rudolpho Aniyas books um Tony Hillermans books even though theyre basically fiction delve a lot into Native American culture and history         And uh that area the country especially the area they call the Four Corners area         Really brings a lot of that to the fore there         They do a lot to help promote the uh culture of that area of the country                     I say going back to some of the childhood stories in specific         Did you ever hear any stories you know like childrens stories not necessarily even books but uh maybe stories that had sort of Hispanic nature to them         Or background         You know like a bedtime story or scary story or anything like that                     Oh sure theyre your usual scary stories         I dont remember any any childhood stories about specifically about children like like Hispanic fairy tales         But I remember um one story in particular about uh its pretty similar to the lady the one they have in South Carolina         About the lady at the beach that lost her children and she walks you know the the beaches at night         This is similar its about a woman who lost her children they were killed and she walks the banks of what we call out there arollos theyre theyre runoff ditches for flood water calling for her children         I think every culture has a similar story in it                     All right
