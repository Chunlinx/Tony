                    Background        Johnes disease also called paratuberculosis is a        chronic granulomatous enteritis of ruminant animals caused        by         Mycobacterium avium subspecies         paratuberculosis          M paratuberculosis  While Johnes        disease can end in death of the animal the economic impact        of this disease is much more significant      Losses        are estimated to be clinically infected cowyear and        are a result of animal culling reduced milk production        poor reproductive performance and reduced carcass value             Research on the pathogenesis and immunology of         M paratuberculosis infections of        cattle is necessary to allow design of more rational        diagnostic and control procedures        A small number of specialized microorganisms can survive        inside macrophages designed specifically to kill bacteria        However a hallmark of mycobacterial pathogenesis is their        ability to survive and even replicate within macrophages        These include         Mycobacteria Salmonella Listeria        Coxiella and         Corynebacteria Different mechanisms        are employed as survival strategies and the mycobacteria        are exceptional in the duration and persistence of this        interaction Survival of pathogenic mycobacteria is        attributed to the fact that the mycobacterial phagosome        does not fuse with lysosomes       The mechanism that        prevents phagosome maturation is still unknown as are any        mycobacterial genes that contribute to the delayed        maturation        Several studies surrounding the interactions of         M paratuberculosis with macrophages        have been published because of its importance in        pathogenesis These studies include entry into J        macrophages      an electron microscopic examination        of goat tissue     and an assessment of intracellular        fate of         M paratuberculosis within bovine        monocytesmacrophages      However many assumptions        regarding         M paratuberculosis interactions with        macrophages are based on analogies to         M tuberculosis    or         M avium     In this        communication we present an analysis of         M paratuberculosis survival within        J macrophages using transmission electron microscopy to        show temporal events early during infection                    Results                  Viability of M paratuberculosiswithin resting J          macrophages          The growth of           M paratuberculosis was measured at          early stages during infection of nonactivated          macrophages Growth was measured by bacterial cell counts          following serial dilutions on HEYM slants The cell          counts from three independent experiments showed a slow          decline in           M paratuberculosis viability over           days Fig  After infection an initial growth phase          occurred until  hours postinfection where mycobacterial          counts began to decline In two of the three experiments          an increase in bacterial counts occurred after  hours          postinfection up until  hours where a second decline in          viable mycobacteria occurred These data suggest that          while           M paratuberculosis survives much          longer in macrophages than some pathogens              including other species of mycobacteria     there          remains a significant decrease in viability over          time                          Immunoelectron microscopy of intracellular M          paratuberculosis          Because the viability of           M paratuberculosis decreased with          time it was of interest to examine the progression of           M paratuberculosis infection by          immunoelectron microscopy However a reliable method to          label intracellular mycobacteria needed to be developed          first Therefore rabbit antibodies against a whole cell          sonicated lysate of           M paratuberculosis were affinity          purified These purified antibodies labeled the outer          periphery of Middlebrook H cultured           M paratuberculosis Fig C This          purified antibody preparation was then used to label           M paratuberculosis within infected          macrophages Fig Aand B The purified antibody was          highly specific as all gold particles are associated with          the mycobacteria and no labeling of the surrounding          background or macrophages was observed Control          preparations of uninfected macrophages failed to label          with antibody against           M paratuberculosis data not          shown Note the mycobacterial morphology remained          constant when comparing intracellular with extracellular          bacilli compare Fig Bwith Fig C                          Temporal events during M paratuberculosisinfection          of J macrophages          Macrophages were infected with           M paratuberculosis at a  ratio          and fixed in glutaraldehyde at various time points to          examine the development of mycobacteria in this          environment Fig  Vacuoles harboring mycobacteria          appeared tightly arranged and not spacious as previously          observed in           Coxiella burnetii containing          vacuoles      The mycobacteria themselves were in          very close contact with each other The size number and          morphology of the mycobacteria appeared to remain          relatively constant throughout the observed time period          At all times postinfection mycobacteria were mostly          found as groups inside vacoules Occasionally single          bacilli were observed within a tight vacuole An increase          in the percentage of degraded mycobacteria was observed          with time There were two degraded bacilli per  fields          at  hour postinfection and  degraded bacilli per           fields at  hours postinfection Similar data were          obtained in two independent experiments Degraded          mycobacteria were morphologically unrecognizable but did          label with immunogold indicating the presence of           M paratuberculosis antigen Fig           These data indicate that macrophages can kill and          degrade a percentage of mycobacterial cells in a given          infection          We next examined the outcome of mycobacteria within          heavily infected macrophages J macrophages were          infected with           M paratuberculosis at high          multiplicities of infection  and examined at          various times postinfection fig  Extracellular          mycobacteria were phagocytosed via actin rearrangement          and remain within phagosomal vacuoles dispersed          throughout the cytoplasm fig Aand B At least           infected macrophages were examined at each time point          Note the electron transparent lipid vesicles present          within           M paratuberculosis These electron          transparent vesicles were seen at all time points          examined At  hr postinfection fig C the cytoplasm          of the macrophage is loaded with mycobacterialcontaining          vacuoles By  hr postinfection the macrophage          cytoplasm is dark and the cell appears necrotic possibly          due to the heavy mycobacterial load or apoptosis Severe          membrane sloughing or blebbing seen to the right of the          macrophage and identified by the arrows in Fig Dis a          sign of apoptosis       No degraded mycobacteria          were observed in these experiments Therefore at high          levels of infection it appears that mycobacteria survive          while the host macrophage is killed Whereas the outcome          is reversed at lower moi                            Discussion        Growth and survival of mycobacterial species within        macrophages has been an area of intensive study because of        its implications in pathogenicity For example         M bovis has been shown to grow        within macrophages whereas BCG strains do not     This        observation is controversial since there are reports of        immunocompromised patients with disseminated BCG Although        multispecies studies are complex and multifactorial         M avium appears to be able to        survive in secondary lysosomes better than does         M tuberculosis     In        macrophages coinfected with         Coxiella burnetii an intracellular        pathogen known to inhabit and replicate within secondary        lysosomes             M avium growth was not impaired            Whereas         M tuberculosis bacilli that        colocalized with         C burnetii containing vacuoles did        show reduced growth     A recent report by Thomsen et        al    showed a higher percentage of degraded         M paratuberculosis in euthymic as        compared to athymic mice The in vivo study by Thomsen        supports data from our in vitro study indicating that J        cultured macrophages are a good model for pathogenesis        studies        Many bacteria such as         Staphylococcus aureus are rapidly        endocytosed and digested by macrophages within a few hours        postinfection     The present study showed an initial         hour intracellular growth period of         M paratuberculosis followed by a        slow decline in the viability within macrophages over a        period of  days This survival curve is similar to that        observed by Zhao et al    which showed         M paratuberculosis intracellular        growth in the first six days followed by killing after day        six The experiments described herein were performed using        the type strain of         M paratuberculosis which may have        affected the survivability within macrophages since it is        not a recent field isolate However         M paratuberculosis     and         M paratuberculosis BO    are        field isolates that have both showed a decline in viability        inside macrophages over time although much slower than        observed with the type strain No attempt has been made to        activate the macrophages in this study although several        laboratories have shown that macrophages activated with        cytokines such as interferon increase the ability to kill        mycobacteria                A very recent communication of         M paratuberculosis interactions with        macrophages was published during the course of our        experiments     This comprehensive study showed that         M paratuberculosis containing        vacuoles were mildly acidified pH  as compared to        latex beads pH  In addition the         M paratuberculosis phagosome was        characterized by the presence of LAMP  and absence of LAMP         lysosomal membrane protein markers as well as other        endocytic tracer molecules These cell biology studies        clearly add to our understanding of         M paratuberculosis interactions with        macrophages        This study has also provided a general description of        early events in         M paratuberculosis infection of        cultured macrophages Several intracellular pathogens such        as         Chlamydia or         Coxiella undergo readily        distinguishable morphological changes during infection of        host cells      This is clearly not the case for         M paratuberculosis or other        mycobacteria as they remain morphologically similar at        least up until  days postinfection However an increased        percentage of degraded mycobacterial forms was observed        over time These degraded forms appeared by  hours        postinfection and were hardly recognizable morphologically        but did label with immunogold particles indicating the        presence of mycobacterial antigen At low moi the bacilli        were tightly clustered into a single vacuole throughout the        observed time period This mycobacterial vacuole is most        likely characteristic of a late endosome based on previous        studies with         M avium M tuberculosis            and         M paratuberculosis            All intracellular bacterial pathogens enter host cells        surrounded by a membrane bound vacuole      Some        pathogens in heavily infected cells collect into a single        vacuole within the same cell     J macrophages        infected at a moi of  showed separate         M paratuberculosis containing        vacuoles within the same macrophage even after  hours        postinfection Figure  Likewise         M tuberculosis and         M avium appear to remain in distinct        phagosomes that do not harbor more than one bacilli per        vacuole see Figures Aand Bin    for example        However in         M avium infected macrophages one        of the first phenotypic alterations following activation        with cytokines is the coalescence of individual         M avium containing vacuoles into        communal vacuoles with many bacilli     The        significance of separate         M paratuberculosis containing        vacuoles observed in this study is still unclear        There appears to be a tenuous relationship to gain        control between         M paratuberculosis and the        macrophage with survival at stake The macrophage can        control growth and even kill         M paratuberculosis However the        mycobacteria are cytotoxic to macrophages or induce        apoptosis at high moi The mechanism that enables         M paratuberculosis to persist within        cattle for several years remains unclear as high moi are        not likely observed at early stages of Johnes disease                    Conclusions        In vitro assays to quantify survival of bacteria in        macrophages provide useful insights into hostpathogen        relations The results of this study provides further        insight surrounding         M paratuberculosis macrophage        infections and have implications in the pathogenesis of         M paratuberculosis a pathogen known        to persist inside cattle for many years Further studies        need to address the tenuous relationship between        mycobacteria and macrophage in relation to disease        outcome                    Materials and methods                  Bacterial strains and growth conditions                    M paratuberculosis ATCC was          grown in Middlebrook H broth pH  supplemented with          oleic acid albumin dextrose complex Becton Dickinson          Microbiology and  Tween  and ferric mycobactin J           mgL For viability counts           M paratuberculosis was cultured on          Herolds egg yolk medium HEYM prepared as

enhanced with complement          protein C     macrophages were infected with           M paratuberculosis in the presence          of  serum from a clinical cow with Johnes disease

macrophages          were then incubated in MEM at C and in  CO             Medium was exchanged every third          day during the course of the infection To determine          survival of           M paratuberculosis within          macrophages well plates of macrophages were infected          at an moi of  Infected macrophages were lysed in          cold sterile distilled H            O at

rabbits were immunized with sonicated          preparations of           M paratuberculosis as previously          described     Antibodies directed at a whole cell          sonicated extract of

was coupled by          reductive amination to a  agarose support column          Pierce Chemical Company Sera from rabbits immunized          with a killed preparation of           M paratuberculosis
