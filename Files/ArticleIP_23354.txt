                                            I work in a small office  people Twoemployees married male unmarried female are spending an inordinate amount oftime together during office hours People are beginning to talk These twospend at least an hour a day in closeddoor meetings another  minutes hereand there during the day chatting and occasionally whispering They go out tolunch together and she even came into the office on a Saturday just to talk tohim They went into her office shut the door and emerged a halfhour laterThen she left                                       Neither of them has any business reason thatrequires meetings It is at the point now where other employees are makingcomments about this relationship These two monopolize each others time andthe bad part is that now he is telling colleagues he is too busy to do sometasks                                       Prudie I dont think this is anything morethan a flirtation I guess Im an optimist But my colleagues and I cannotfigure out a way to tell him or her that this is affecting the workenvironment their reputations and our morale                                       Im writing because I need to know who shouldtalk to him or her My colleagues dont feel close enough to either of them tosay what needs to be said but neither do we want to make a big thing of it bytelling his manager He is the senior of the two people involved How should wehandle it                                       Thanks                                       Anonymous                        Dear An            Lets review He is married they have no businessreasons to get together the whole office is chirping about their lengthycloseddoor meetings they whisper leave to have lunch together and youthink there is no more than a flirtation This is like imagining that adinosaur died in a standing position at the museum of natural historyOf                course theyre having an affair but Prudie compliments you onyour highminded and generous assessment of the situation Now what to doabout it            You and your colleagues must rethink your reticenceabout not saying anything to anybody The fact that you are an office of only people and Lothario now finds himself too busy for some tasks means theinvolvement has begun to impinge on the workplace            Do you have a humanresources department It is pledged to confidentiality and could intervenePrudie agrees that speaking directly to the parties would probably not beuseful If your company is too small to have an HR unit then a designatedrepresentative must go to the mans superiorhe being senior to the womanandlay out the situation Prudie is all for romance she doesnt even mind it inthe office but when it complicates the lives of coworkers something needs tobe done Please note that we are not dealing with the fact that the man ismarried because that is none of our business            Prudie proactively                                             DearPrudie                                                      Your response to recommending that asoontobemarried couple break off relations with highly unsupportivesoontobe inlawsstruck a deep dark chord in me My problem is similarexcept that my fiance doesnt always realize the extent of his mothersmanipulations or their possible effect on our relationship Mostly she tries tomake him feel like hell via barbed remarks andor the silent treatment fordeserting his family in order to be with me She has always relied heavilyon him for emotional support following her divorce from his father                                       Obviously I cantpoint out what a horror his mother is but its very difficult to watch himtake these unrelenting guilt trips Plus I worry that this ever so slightlyOedipal situation is going to get in the way of his commitment to me Is thereany hope                                       Do Tell                        Dear Do            There is not only hope there is a strategy Prudiewill now give you the roadmap            Do not point out that the beloveds mother is awitch He already knows This is a wonderful opportunity to cement yourrelationship as partners Be his ally not his attacker In the interest ofseeing the big picture Prudie hopes you can get him to talk about what he isfeeling when Jocasta does a number on him Discuss in general terms thenature of guilt and point outas sympathetically as you canthat her divorcehad very unhappy consequences for her For that is the crux of her acting outShe has made your intended into a husbandsubstitute            You also might trykilling the old girl with kindness Include her when you can and let it beyour suggestion It will disorient her totally Just know that herneurosis has nothing to do with the love you and the beloved have for eachother  and then see to it You can do an end run around her by understandingthe game and by not responding in a destructive way            Prudie strategically                                             DearPrudie                                                      I truly like my wifes sisters husband but ishe technically my brotherinlawas her family insistsoras I believeamy sisterinlaws husband or b my wifes brotherinlaw The polite answeris of course call him whatever he wants to be called but we are all curiousas to which appellations are technically correct                                       Yoursfaithfully                                       Genealogically Confused in New York                        Dear Gene            Though Emily Post is long gone her answer to yourquestion has been preserved She relied on the dictionary which said Abrotherinlaw is a brother of a husband or wife a sisters husband orloosely a wifes sisters husband            So  your wifessisters husband is a loosely and Prudie is sure hes a swell guy            Prudie Postally
