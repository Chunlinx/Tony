                                 Russians in Space            The Soviet Union put thefirst satellite in orbit Sputnik and the first man in space Yuri GagarinThe space race was once regarded as a metaphor for the Cold War and theCommunists seemed to be winning Today the Russian space program is a jokesymbolized by the space station Mir What happened                           Sputnik was launchedon Oct  the first manmade object to orbit Earth Its eerie beepbroadcast over US radio signaled the Soviet Unions commanding lead in thespace race Masterminded by Sergei Korolev the Soviet counterpart to theUnited States Wernher von Braun and unlike von Braun a native productSputnik seemed to represent a system superior to capitalism and proved usefulin wooing developing nations that had yet to choose sides in the Cold War SenLyndon Johnson declared Control of space means control of the world            One monthlater Sputnik  carried Laika                the                dog in orbit for sevendays Laika suffered the first death in space With no means yet of safereentry she was put to sleep inside the floating capsule            On Dec   the first American attempt to put asatellite in orbit exploded on the launch pad It was instantly dubbedFlopnik Kaputnik and Stayputnik The first successful American launchcame on Jan              TheSoviets with their Luna                program  achieved the first solarorbit the first impact on the moon and the first photographs of the moon froma lunar orbit which allowed them to map and triumphantly name geologicalfeatures of the moons far side Their next program the Vostok eastseries shocked the United States even more On April   Vostok launched the first human into space Yuri                Gagarin s module wascontrolled from the groundengineers were unsure if he would functioncompetently in weightlessness After  minutes of orbital flight the capsulebegan its descent Gagarin ejected as planned at  feet and parachuted toEarth The Soviet government did not reveal that Gagarin landed separately fromthe craft At Gagarins postflight press conference the pioneering cosmonautclaimed While in outer space I was thinking about our party and ourhomeland            Two days later President Kennedy met withadvisers and asked Is there any place we can catch them Consensus held theSoviets were so far ahead that only a manned lunar landing could win the spacerace On May   Kennedy addressed Congress and called for a moon               landing by the end of the decade            Three weeks before thisannouncement the United States had launched its first manned flight aminute journey by Alan Shepard that didnt even reach orbit By  whenJohn Glenn orbited Earth three times in five hours the Soviet Union waslaunching daylong flights and a orbit mission Valentina               Tereshkova  the first woman in space orbited Earth on June  years before Sally Ride Tereshkova announced Warm greetings from space tothe glorious Leninist Young Communist League that reared me            In March a Soviet cosmonaut took the first                spacewalk  A USspacewalk came that summer But the Soviet Union racked up a series of unmannedfirsts between  and  the first                impact                on               another                planet Venus the first soft landing on themoon  and the first orbit of the moon with                a safe return             The Soyuz union program beset by vastlyinferior funding marked the end of Soviet space domination In  Americanswalked on the moon as the Soyuz suffered from malfunctioning launchers WithSoyuz  in  the Soviet Union announced a shift in its goals Introducingthe Salyut  space station a salute to Gagarin the Soviets began afocus on longterm orbital space living that endures today Soyuz  blew ahatch on reentry killing three cosmonauts but after this early catastrophethe Soviet program boasted constant space habitation and scientificexperimentation for more than two decades The Soyuz craft ferried cosmonautsto a series of Salyut stations and once to a  docking with Apollo  thefirst international space rendezvous The Soviet Union put the first man ofAfrican heritage in space in  Americas first black astronaut flew in The crew of Salyut   set a duration record of  days inspacea record since repeatedly broken by various cosmonauts            In the core unit of Mir peace or world was launched As NASA reeledfrom the Challenger disaster the Soviet Union briefly enjoyed a return to itsdominant reputation But as Mir floated in orbit the Soviet Union fell apartRussia took over the space programwith massive expenditure cuts Mirs lifespan has been extended well past what it was designed for as Russia cannotafford a replacement            Financial desperation has led Russia toendeavors shunned by NASA Russias program places advertisements on itsrockets and allows its cosmonauts to film               commercials one for Israeli milk another for Pepsi in space for afee In  a Japanese television network paid  million to send ajournalist to Mir for eight days as a ratings booster            On June  this year asupply ship slammed into Mir Since then Mirs main oxygen system hasfailed repeatedly forcing its crew to burn chemical candles tosurvive its commander has developed heartbeat irregularities caused bystress and a cosmonaut has accidentally unplugged its main computer which isless powerful than the chip in some cellular phones Mirs crew was docked payfor its incompetence The main computer failed again Sept  but thereplacement crew reported that the situation was normal
