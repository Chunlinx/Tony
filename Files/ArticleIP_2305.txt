                                 Bill Paxons Mysterious Epiphany            Briefly displacing MonicaLewinsky as Topic A last week was a news flash from Capitol Hill Bill Paxon awellscrubbed yearold Republican representative from Buffalo NY wasretiring This came as a shock because Paxon was viewed as an ambitious fellowwith a long career ahead of him Though he had been displaced from his positionin the House Republican leadership as punishment for his role in the failedcoup against Speaker Newt Gingrich last July he remained popular with hiscolleagues As recently as a few days before his withdrawal Paxon had beenbusy canvassing support for a challenge to Dick Armey for the post of majorityleader But instead of announcing his candidacy for a job that would put him inline to become speaker of the House Paxon pledged never to run foranythingnot even dogcatcheragain Like his wife Susan Molinari who quitlast year to become a news anchor on CBS he said his move was prompted by adesire to spend more time with his family            Despitethe eagerness of the Sundaymorning pundits to embrace it the official storydoes not begin to add up A purely political creature Paxon has spent hisentire adult life in two jobs New York state assemblyman and member ofCongress Here he was giving up his lifes work with no idea of what he woulddo instead because of an epiphany that seemed totally out of character Histransformation from someone desperate to spend more time with his colleaguesand less with his family to someone desperate to spend none with his colleaguesand all with his family happened within days And even if you take hisexplanation at face value why would Paxon rule out seeking elective officeever again even after his daughter was in college            The predictable result has been a plague of rumors allnasty and none very plausible The only remotely convincing interpretation isthat Paxon knew but was not willing to admit publicly that he could not defeatArmey and that without a path forward he lost heart Beltway outsiders mightwonder why any of this even matters Paxon is the worlds most replaceablemana lightweight operator of fungible principles not especiallyconservative not especially moderate and with no great or special politicaltalent He will be forgotten in months if not minutes What is significantabout the episode and about the haze of innuendo surrounding it is the way itepitomizes what the Republican House has become In the past year the Houseside of the Capitol has become not only an extraordinarily vicious environmentbut also an entirely unproductive and unsatisfying one Paxons hasty departureand whatever invisible machinations lie behind it show that the devil makeswork for idle hands They also show the total intellectual and politicalexhaustion of the Republican revolution of             For over a year the onlyreal news coming out of the Republican caucus has been gossip about internecinewarfare tales about coups and countercoups ambition rebellion andretribution The last month has been consumed with especially intense jockeyingand speculation about the leadership hierarchy Would Paxon challenge Armey forthe majority leaders job in an election that is nearly a year off Whatwould that mean for the eventual succession to the speakership should Gingrichquit to run for president Shortly before Paxon announced his retirement RepBob Livingston RLa decided that instead of stepping down to become afatcat lobbyist he would hang around in the hope of winning the speakers jobafter Gingrich leaves That fueled more kibitzing Could Armey conciliate theangry and disappointed class of  What would Tom DeLay do Would there beanother attempt to overthrow Gingrich            In shortthe Republican House has deteriorated into a subShakespearean Elizabethanrevenge drama This is hardly surprising Where there is no strong leader nounifying sense of purpose and no rule of law political chaos tends to ensueas surely in the Longworth Building as in Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia Butthe fratricidal House is an amazing change from the heady days of early Todays policy vacuum makes the gimmicky Contract With America look likeLenins What Is to Be Done Where there was unity and esprit de corpsthere is now factionalism and demoralization How did the Republican revolutionturn so quickly into a Brooks Bros version of Lord of the Flies             I think there are two important causes Thefirst is structural When he became speaker Gingrich tossed out the ageoldHouse rules He placed a term limit of eight years on himself as speaker and alimit of six years on committee chairs In choosing chairs he suspendedseniority For example Gingrich bypassed four more senior members to makeLivingston chairman of House Appropriations This transformed the politicalculture of the House Advancement no longer had to be slow and steadyShakeups were to be expected Careers could take off and fizzle suddenly Theresult was a lot of scheming by people such as Paxon who suddenly had anopportunity to get ahead quickly            Thesecond explanation has to do with the political trajectory of the last fewyears The Gingrich Congress has paid a high price for overinterpreting its mandate Gingrich almost lost his job and though the GOP kept control ofCongress in  its leaders have abandoned both the rhetoric and substance ofantigovernment radicalism Lately theyve been hanging back and venturinglittle In  Congress has only  scheduled workdays the annual averagesince  is  Gingrich now fears controversy the way a convalescent fearsa draft This means that all the issues that conservatives care mostaboutbanning affirmative action cutting taxes pushing school choiceremainon indefinite hold The demagogic gimmicks get ever more desperate and emptyTheir latest is to fix a date for abolition of the tax codethe idea beingthat it would force sweeping reform details to follow            Gone perhaps for good is Gingrichs visionary rhetoricReplacing it is a litany of Boy Scoutscale good deeds reminiscent of nothingso much as the pointillist Clinton agenda Republicans mocked so sneeringlyaround  In his most recent speech Gingrich boasted about building Fsin his district and improving the water quality of the Chattahoochee River Healso proposed new ideas giving cell phones to teachers andI kid younotscreening Native Americans for diabetes The main business in Congressthis week was dividing up  billion in transportation goodies            In a way the collapse ofconservative principles in Congress only heightens the mystery of why BillPaxon quit The postrevolutionary Republican Congress is an environment inwhich he might well have flourished and where he ought to have felt very muchat home
