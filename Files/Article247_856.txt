                                 Pilot Error            While the New York Times  Los Angeles Times  and WashingtonPost all have big impeachment trial postmortems the actual lead in theNYT and the WP is something different            The Washington Post goes with the blistering crackdownby a nononsense Dallas district court judge Joe Kendall on the AmericanAirlines pilots whove been calling in sick for the last week Its illegalfor them to actually strike The Post story much more colorful thanthe NYT and LAT frontpagers on the same subject has the judgecomparing the pilots to Mafia extortionists promising the union that itsassets will fit in the overhead bin of a Piper Cub after he got through withit and even pointing out that many of the pilots had learned their trade whilein the US armed services That last is a cheap shot as the paper notessome of the pilots are combat veterans who risked their lives for the countryat the time            The NewYork Times leads with President Clintons conditional decision toparticipate in a NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo The paper says about Army and Marine soldiers will be stationed in the southern part of the Serbianprovinceif the two sides fighting a civil war there can come up with aceasefire agreement in the negotiations currently under way in Paris Thatsnot for certain The NYT  ever suspicious of the presidentsmotivations goes out of its way to report that White House aides expectedClintons announcement to draw concentrated news coverage and commentary tocompete with lingering musings over the trial the WP  playing thestory just below its onecolumn lead details the complex and delicate plannedmobilizations and postings of the multinational troops            But back to Clinton The Los Angeles Times lead is just a poll story the oldnews that Americans didnt like impeachment want to get back to businessetc etc The companion story a news analysis by Janet Hook sees themakings of a honeymoon in DC Both sides Hooks reports want to get down tolegislating The WP analyzes the scandals effect on the  electionsIn a nice passage Dan Balz writes Virtually every candidate contemplating apresidential campaign will look in the mirror this weekend and see a possibleanswer for what the country wants after ClintonAl Gore the Eagle ScoutElizabeth Dole the antidote to Clintons lockerroom antics and so forthThose who make it to the end of the story will probably say amen to the closingquote from a Steve Forbes adviser I think the public probably will notwant to hear the word impeachment for another  years            The WP also has a very long intensely reported recap of thepolitical phenomena that all along seemed systematically to help theDemocrats and hurt the right It includes a trenchant for want of a nail taleexplaining how an early Dick GephardtNewt Gingrich agreement to keep the StarrReport under wraps broke down Gingrich was incommunicado the day the reportwas unexpectedly delivered to Congress even as an overheard remark of BarneyFranks enraged a Republican representative leading him to introduce a motionto make the report public            The NYT s main impeachment postmortem pace Janet Hookis apessimistic one Democrats and Republicans hate each other the paper saysThis is a followup to a ferocious inside story the paper ran yesterday inwhich Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott got a full year of pentup disgust atClinton off his chest The most telling point of analysis in the piece comesfrom a Republican adviser who says that since Clinton wont be able to getanything done anyway he might as well concentrate on electing Gore and aDemocratic House of Representatives next year            The WP fronts a look at how certain Salt Lake Cityans went nuts toget their burg an Olympics The conclusion The decision to go low to do whatever it took to win was a stepbystep and relatively open process involvinglarge numbers of people A major report on the LAT front page detailshow tobacco companies strongarmed smokingcessationaid manufacturers to keepthem out of the smoking wars            The NYT has a classic obit to show off today about the best poloplayer ever Cecil Smith the piece by Frank Litsky effortlessly takes thereader back to the days when the sport was played by the likes of Walt Disneyand Will Rogers and tens of thousands watched games In  Smith a Texanled a dusty group of cowboys to take the national championship away from thehoitytoity East Coast He continued to ride up until he was  three yearsago The NYT Magazine s cover look at Steven Spielberg is marred bybanal sycophantic writing within a few minutes Spielberg has put themat ease He has that effect on people writer Stephen Dubners tiresomeinjections of himself into the story We first meet up early Thursdaymorning and minor irritants like referring to Spielbergs assistant byher first name A female movie exec gets the same treatment In this contextits not clear whether the writer or the subject appreciates the irony of theprofiles key sceneSpielberg fatuously defending the behavior of his closepersonal friend Bill Clinton Morality is defined not just by a sexualdalliance as he puffs contentedly on a cigar
