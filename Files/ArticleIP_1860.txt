                                 Henry Louis Gates Jr            Eversince the media first noticed Henry Louis Skip Gates Jr professor ofAfroAmerican studies at Harvard he has held their attention and affection Hemay now be the most famous literature professor in America and its easy tounderstand why Besides being  Gates is a force for good in the world Knownby fellow scholars for his theories linking the AfroAmerican literarytradition to the African vernacular and for his excavation of forgottenmasterpieces of black literature he caught the publics eye in  when hepublished several salutary and wellreasoned articles criticizing theinflammatory antiSemitic rhetoric of certain black nationalists The allstardepartment hes built at Harvard over the past seven years it includesphilosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah sociologist William Julius Wilson andphilosopher Cornel West has helped elevate AfroAm from relative marginalityto one of the most thrilling and visible disciplines around At The NewYorker  where he is a staff writer he has produced several strong piecesof literary journalism on subjects as varied as Harry Belafonte and thedeclining importance of loyalty            Gates does so many things at the same time that you have towonder how he makes sure all of them meet the same high standard The answeris he cant In  alone according to his c urriculum vitae  he wrotefour long pieces for The                New Yorker  published one book andedited two more He also supervised doctoral dissertations taught twoundergraduate courses ran Harvards WEB Du Bois Institute for AfroAmericanResearch raising funds balancing budgets recruiting professors planningconferences served as director of editorial content for a publishing imprinthe cofounded was a consultant on Steven Spielbergs Amistad  scriptedand hosted a Frontline documentary on the black bourgeoisie anddeveloped a sixpart BBCPBS documentary on Africathe entire continent Hecontinued as an editor of Transition magazine the Black PeriodicalLiterature Project the Zora Neale Hurston Library series the volumeAfricanAmerican Women Writers   and the  million wordEncyclopedia Africana  Nominally at least he sat on the board ofeditors of  other journals and on  advisory committees for museumstheaters institutes literary prizes and universities            Gatesworks very hard Most days he starts writing at  am A word NewYorker profile that would take most journalists weeks or months flowseffortlessly from his pen An incisive piece on Louis Farrakhan was reportedMonday afternoon written Tuesday edited Wednesday and closed Thursday Gatesdrafted his page memoir Colored People  in six weeks thoughthought the final result reflected the hasty composition            But hard work alone doesnt explain Gatesoutput He also understands a fundamental maxim of capitalism Dont doyourself what you can pay others to do for you            It is atimehonored perquisite of senior professorship to have students act asminions fetching books from the library and doing grunt research Manyscholars have figured out how to turn this somewhat feudal tradition into anindustry In the s for example Yale Professor Harold Bloom served as theeditor of  anthologies of literary criticism even though it was graduatestudents and a few undergraduates who actually waded into the library andpicked out the selections But Gates pushes the envelope He may be the onlyacademic with a selfdesignated chief of staff who handles daytoday detailsand deals with reporters An assistant edits his writing Another conductsresearch keeping him abreast of the latest developments in hiphop and diggingup quotes for New Yorker pieces Dozens of other writers and editors arehired to help produce his various projects To put together one volumeThe                Dictionary of Global Culture  for instance Gates used research assistants and  fact checkers in addition to  writers For thispiece I spoke with  current and former Gates employees            The project Gates considers his most important is also hismost lucrative to datethe Encyclopedia Africana  coedited withAppiah Originally conceived by Du Bois the Encyclopedia is intended tobe the definitive guide to Africa and the African diaspora Gates says it willbe the factually unassailable foundation upon which AfroAmerican studies willgrow to maturity It is designed to trounce once and for all the fictionspromulgated by Afrocentrists they hold among other things that Jews ran theslave trade and that Egyptians were black To finance the Encyclopedia Gates reportedly cut a  million deal with Microsoft to put out a CDROMsigned a book deal with Civitas the imprint he coowns and formed apartnership with music mogul Quincy Jones            A closerlook at how Gates et al are putting the Encyclopedia togetherhowever raises the question of whether reference works benefit from a Gatesianpace Writers have been told to hit a  word a day quota Editors at timeshave had to groom  words a day Their pay depends on it The results areunimpressive According to some of Gates deputies on the project Microsoftexecs grouched that the first  word batch of entries they received waspoorly organized and badly written Gates later confessed to Microsoft that hehad made an appalling discovery Nearly onethird of the entries had beenplagiarized wholesale from other reference books For the record Thismagazine is owned by Microsoft However no Microsoft employee spoke to meabout Skip Gates project My information comes exclusively from current andformer employees of Gates himself            The Encyclopedia is due out in storesnext February Gates says he has become much more involved in editing the bookso as to avoid further anomalies According to some who have worked on theproject however his main concern still seems to be meeting Microsoftsdeadlines He has described the Encyclopedia to his colleagues inclassic Microsoft terms If Version  contains bugs and glitches not toworry You let readers point out problems then try to get Version right            With anelectronic encyclopedia a process of constant revision may have itsadvantagesunless youre among the customers for Version  But print isless flexible The last largescale reference work Gates coedited also withAppiah was The                Dictionary of Global Culture  published lastyear The book was meant to be the multiculturalist rebuttal to ED HirschJrs controversial The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy  the ideawas to highlight the accomplishments of nonWestern societies and theircontributions to Western culture But it was too weirdly conceived and poorlyedited to do all that As a response to Hirsch it is irrelevant appearinglong after most had forgotten Hirschs book It is also filled with easilydismissable  As a reference work it fails because entries are shorter andless informative than most entries for the same subjects in even theEncyclopedia Britannica  And it is             Why would Gates allow the publication of such a book withhis byline and photo on the dust jacket He had no idea it was so bad Aftercoming up with the idea for the project and appointing an associate editor torun it he says he was only minimally involved According to those who editedthe Dictionary  Gates read entries only just before they were sent topress then looked closely only at items within his area of expertise such asthe Harlem Renaissance and Hurston The books introduction was drafted byAppiah            Gatespage CV is packed with other projects to which he devotes scant energyBetween  and  for example he contributed not a single word to  ofthe  magazines where he is listed as an editor He does none of the lineediting of articles for Transition  even though it proclaims hiseditorship in ads For the  volume Schomburg Library of NineteenthCenturyBlack Women Writers he edited he appointed others to put together thebooks and write their introductions Ten other editors helped put togetherThe                Norton Anthology of African American Literature  even thoughit was his byline that appeared on the cover            The activities cited here would not be unusualor even objectionable if Gates imposed strict quality control standards uponthem Members of scholarly journals editorial boards rarely edit they areguarantors of the journals intellectual integritywhich is to say theyrefigureheads And if Gates didnt edit the anthologies himself his namenonetheless lent credibility and therefore enhanced funding prospects todeserving projects Reference books are perforce feats of organization notindividual scholarship            The problem is the workthat comes out of his scholarly chop shops isnt nearly as good as it shouldbe And even if it were there is something dishonest about marketing underGates signature work that is produced mainly by his assistants At worst heis amassing credentials fame and wealth on the basis of others uncreditedlaboronce considered a scholarly sin At best he is severely diluting thebrand name that is Henry Louis Gates Jra brand name based in large part on This is bound to hurt both his own reputation and that of the enterprises hebelieves in so sincerely            So whydoes Gates produce at such a frantic pace A profile in the April issue ofBoston Magazine hinted it was for the money the magazine put Gatesannual income at nearly  million He denies both the amount and the motiveHe clearly is driven by a kind of missionary zeal I think that these projectswill make a difference to people and the field of AfroAmerican studies I am acanon builder he told me Another explanation may lie in his brilliance Hecomes up with more ideas than he can handle and he lacks the discipline not tooverextend himself By impulse I am an entrepreneur he says If I werentin the academy I could be a CEO Quincy Jones is my hero I have a picture ofVernon Jordan on my wall right over one of John Hope Franklin Its anappealing image for a professoriate that has long been accused of being out oftouch and moribundthe consummate schmoozer combined with the eminent scholarOne just wishes the results looked more like scholarship                           If youmissed the links in the piece click to read  a of Colored People about the in the Dictionary of Global
