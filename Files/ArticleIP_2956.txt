                                 Magnum Farce            For the past week Ive beendriving people nuts with my Clint Eastwood impression I dont do an especiallygood one but then Eastwood is not especially difficult to do You lower yourvoice pull it back into your throat so that its breathy verging on a raspand yet smooth almost plangent then expel the line from The Outlaw               Josey Wales  addressed to the bounty hunter who insists that hesonly trying to make a living Dyin aint much of a livin boy Its abedroom voice menacing but seductive with overdeliberate diction thatimplies Im so powerful so coiled so masculine that I have to modulate mytoneor else Eastwoods most famous Dirty HarryismsAsk yourself Do Ifeel lucky Well do ya punk  and Go ahead make my dayarepurring comeons The bad guy is practically compelled to submit to this tallhandsome killer with his long Magnum pistol Submit in many cases by goingfor his gun and getting blown into orgasmic nonexistence            Eastwoodhas one of the great movie voices of our era but its also kind of ridiculousProbably no star could get away with it if he werent such an image of cool asbeautiful and remote and selfcontained as Garbo or Chet Baker What hasenraptured so many critics among them Richard Schickel in Clint Eastwood ABiography  is that the actordirector has learned to play with his owninexpressivenessto make a joke of his frigid machismo without and hereswhere the supreme balancing act comes in travestying it Eastwood in thisview contains within himself both the myth and the antimyth I think thathes a fine lightweight comic presence at times his scowl is a psychoticversion of a comedians classic slow burn but Schickel goes further He callsEastwood one of the great ironists of the age and a postmodern heroClints gift he writes forever on a firstname basis with his subject isto let us see the dark comedy in the American males contorting distortingattempts to achieve his masteries of the moment while at the same time notentirely discrediting the tradition that makes him bid that effort            Whew Thats some gift Schickel is alternately sycophantictoward Eastwood and pugilistic toward any critic who has ever had unkindwords for the actorparticularly Pauline Kael who did seem to have a missionto make the tall mans Magnum shrivel The book has the breathless indulgenceof a campaign biography Clints lack of selfishness his predilection forthrowing scenes to other actorspartly out of generosity partly out of aserene confidence in the force of his own presence   In the end Schickelseems happiest simply basking in the stars aura preferring the company ofEastwood in the fading light of certain wintry afternoons to trudging aroundand interviewing anyone with a different version of events or a contrastingpoint of view            Thatdoesnt surprise me since contrasting points of view dont make it intoEastwoods movies either which is why I have some trouble accepting thisnotion of the actordirector as an ironist In the Dirty Harry movies or therabidly rightwing  Heartbreak                Ridge which ends with apotencyreclaiming invasion of Grenada theres little irony in Eastwoodssuperiority to the succession of louts prisses and psychopaths whom hischaracter inevitably clobbers or blows away or in the fact that he is ofgreater stature than the actors with whom he surrounds himself Eastwood mightacknowledge the faint absurdity of these heroes but none is ever ultimatelyproved wrong Even the hellbound William Munny in the compellingUnforgiven who does admittedly shoot a rather nice youngcowboy in the gut but instantly regrets itends up killing the sort of peoplewho when all is said and done need killing            When Schickel stops duking it out with Eastwoodsantagonists his analyses can be trenchant Hes especially evocative on thethree spaghetti Westerns that Eastwood made with Sergio Leone for whom theactor forged his amusingly taciturn onscreen persona Leone Schickel writesdeveloped a style that alternated cunningly between extreme wide shots andextreme closeups partly in an effort to monumentalize Eastwoods face thedirectors mise en scne became a landscape of masks But then itsback to the issue of irony and Schickels evasions can make your jaw dropThe rousing Dirty Harry  is inarguably a template for the modernrightwing vigilante picture replete with digs at Miranda rights due processand the burgeoning civilliberties movement Yet here is Schickel quotingEastwoods insistence that the film has no larger political agenda Its justthe story of one particular police officer in a frustrating situation on oneparticular case And Willie Horton is just some guy The author concludesIt is as a rule absurd and utterly unrealistic to see ideological motiveslet alone ideological malevolence in action pictures he is convenientlyomitting any reference here to Eastwoods pal John Milius the gleefulliberalbasher who scripted many of the banner lines in Dirty Harry andMagnum Force  Of The Enforcer   Schickelnotes Certainly today attitudes having radically changed Clint wouldretract the movies casual contempt for homosexuals admittedly a feature ofhis early action films That would be mighty white of him And for thisbiographer one of the most tasteful campaigns in the history of modernAmerican politicsEastwoods run as a propertyrights Republican for mayorof Carmel Califwas one in which the star likened a civic ordinance thatwould ban second kitchens to Adolf Hitler knocking on your door            OK so Eastwoods not a rocket scientist But Schickel doesseem to see him as some sort of Delphic oracle and his attempts to translatethe mans monosyllabic pronouncements make for hilarity  Women Clint saysa sort of sad befuddlement in his tone always want to know what yourethinking  Schickel enlarges It is a mystery to him this desire topenetrate the deepest reserves of his privacy It is equally a mystery to himwhy anyone would think that bringing things up out of this murk and discussingthem would profit either party At our cores he believes for whatever reasonwe are what we are and there is nothing much to be done about thatbeyondsimply accepting the hard facts of personality            We arewhat we are and there is nothing much to be done about that doesnt make fora very interesting aesthetic and Eastwoods dry dodgy movies Schickel toutstheir directness of address their plainspoken psychological realism bearthe stamp of this shrunken worldview A psychiatrist could make the case thatthe stars legendary promiscuity with its attendant insulation and fear ofcommitment has artistic consequences Compare Eastwood with Charlie Parkerfor instance whom Eastwood idolizes and about whom he made the reverent biopicBird  The English writer Daniel OBrien in his modest moreobjective new book Clint Eastwood FilmMaker  suggests that Eastwoodwouldnt actually put up with Parker for a second The saxophonists unrulypassion his commitment to his art is the antithesis of Eastwoods manlyfrugal shootitandmoveon way of working But Schickel is starryeyed Hecompares the films and Eastwoods masculine posing to the modernjazz mannera powerful desirealmost amounting to a moralitynot to woo the audience a profound desire not to make what he does look costly to him emotionally orintellectually            One could argue that Eastwood has merely maskedhis inadequacies as artistic choices But I wouldnt want to go too far Ifrequently enjoy his movies and theres no arguing with the fact that hisstardom has endured for more than three decades There might be a kind ofgenius here but its the genius of a seducer not an artist Eastwood makesuse of the traditional toolshis size his handsomeness the aura of mysteryhe so manifestly cultivates But the seduction also occurs in unexpected waysReading the book I found myself conscious of and moved by the ways in whichSchickel has been drawn in by Eastwood compelled to fill all kinds of sadmoody spaces The author doesnt simply idolize his subject he feels he needsto cover for Eastwoods failures and rationalizations the way one might for anabsent or inadequate father Above all he wants us to see the star asmisunderstood under unfair attack from all sidesthe women who demandsomething more than his sexual favors the liberal media with its shrillfeminists and snobby elitists            In an agewhen Ronald Reagan has slipped into the haze of Alzheimers disease when SusanFaludi writes movingly of males clinging to stereotypical notions of machismoas theyre laid off their factory jobs and symbolically robbed of potency itcan put a lump in your throat to watch Schickel buildinglike the hero inField of Dreams a shrine to the Dad whom so many elements of theculture have come to undervalue Eastwoods decision to play dumb in filmslike The Gauntlet  and Bronco                Billy  was ashrewd one It allows Schickel to write lines like A rude beast has beenperceived slouching toward the Bethlehem of the New Masculinity waiting to bereborn in more cuddlesome form            It also to be fair means that Eastwood can go where theSylvester Stallones and Arnold Schwarzeneggers and Steven Seagals darent Hisperformance as Frank Horrigan an aging Secret Service agent in In The Lineof Fire  was the most affecting he has ever givena fallenstereotype a glimpse of the human caught in the pose But does the filmsubvert Eastwoods onscreen persona as Schickel argues it does How He beststhe bureaucratic fools He outwits the psychotic assassin He beds the youngbeautiful woman Do Eastwoods other movies really subvert the whole actiongenre Compared with Charles Bronsons maybe Munnys assertion inUnforgiven  that its a hell of a thing killing a man You take awayeverything hes got and everything hes ever gonna have was hailed by somecritics as a brave line for Eastwood to utter given that he has dispatched somany anonymous thugs so offhandedly for so many years Brave but hypocriticalEastwood did more to make killing casual than anyone in mainstream cinema Hepaved the way for the Bronsons and Chuck Norrises and Seagals and JeanClaudeVan Dammes and all the other righteous slayers of postmidnightcablemoviechannel programming Will history judge the hero of RichardSchickels Boswellian tome as ironic and postmodern Or as an enlightenedNeanderthal profitably pretending to evolve
