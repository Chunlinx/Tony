Thomas J Bliley Jr Chairman The Honorable JohnD Dingell Ranking Minority Member Committee on Commerce House ofRepresentativesSubject Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives CertificationStandards for Deposit Control Gasoline AdditivesPursuant to section aA of title  United States Codethis is our report on a major rule promulgated by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency entitled Regulation of Fuels and FuelAdditives Certification Standards for Deposit Control GasolineAdditives RIN AG FRL  We received the rule onJune   It was published in the Federal Register as a finalrule on July    Fed Reg This rule establishes a certification program for detergentadditives used to control the formation of deposits in gasolineengines This certification program requires the use of detergentsin most gasolines used in the United States as mandated by theClean Air Act Amendments of  and replaces an interim programwhich began on January   The final rule containsstandardized test procedures and performance standards to ensurethat detergent gasolines provide an effective level of protectionagainst certain engine depositsEnclosed is our assessment of the Environmental ProtectionAgencys compliance with the procedural steps required by sectionsaBi through iv of title GAOOGCwith respect to the rule Our review indicates that theEnvironmental Protection Agency complied with the applicablerequirementsIf you have any questions about this report please contactJames Vickers Senior Attorney at   The officialresponsible for GAO evaluation work relating to the

FUELS AND FUEL ADDITIVES CERTIFICATION STANDARDS FOR DEPOSITCONTROL GASOLINE ADDITIVES RIN AG FRL i Costbenefit analysisAs discussed below the Environmental Protection Agency EPAdetermined that this final rule was a significant regulatoryaction based on an annual economic impact of  million or moreunder Executive Order  and submitted to the Office ofManagement and Budget the required regulatory impact analysis whichcontains an analysis of the costs and benefits of the ruleThe total producer costs estimated by EPA including the costs ofcertification addization of the detergents recordkeeping andenforcement through the year  is almost  million The costto the average consumer if all the cost of the detergent is passedalong to the consumer anew even by those producers who alreadysell fully additized gasoline would be  per yearThe benefits to be gained in air quality were calculated by EPAfor the first six years including the interim program to bereductions of  tons of hydrocarbons  tons ofcarbon monoxide and  tons of nitrogen oxide Increased fueleconomy achieved by a reduction of engine deposits is estimated tobe over  million for the same time period While EPAanticipates there will also be vehicle maintenance benefitssufficient data was not available to quantify the benefitsThis analysis was revised when it was determined that theinterim program which began on January   would last months rather than  months and there were changes in theestimated cost of deposit control testing and the addition in thefinal rule of a required deposit demonstration test to qualifytest fuels for certification testing purposesii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and The impact of this rule on small entities was considered in aregulatory flexibility analysis under section  that wassummarized in the preamble of the interim program  Fed Reg and the entire analysis which was included in theregulatory impact analysis was available for review in EPAspublic docket TheGAOOGCpreamble to the final rule addresses changes made to theregulatory impact analysis as discussed under the costbenefitanalysis section above and the impact on small entitiesFollowing this analysis EPA has concluded and certified thatthe rule will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities The analysis states that theindustry affected by the rule includes numerous business entitiesin the chain of gasoline production and the business sizeconsidered to be a small entity varies from  to  employeesunder the SIC Codes and size standards of the Small BusinessAdministration Therefore the impact of the rule varies based onthe type of business and its place in the chain of production anddistribution However the overall impact is expected to be modesteven for those industries most heavily impacted and for smalladditive and additive injection equipment manufacturers the rulecould result in additional economic opportunities through increasedsales The analysis also discusses alternative approaches whichwere considered by EPA but were found lacking because they did noteither significantly reduce the burden on small entities or wouldhave jeopardized the programs projected air quality benefitsAccording to an official at EPA publication of thecertifications in the Federal Register in connection with theinterim program and the final rule was treated as providing noticeunder section b to the Small Business Administrations SBAChief Counsel for Advocacy The SBA has confirmed that someagencies follow this practice without objection from the SBAiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  According to the EPA the final rule will not impose any Federalmandates as defined in Title II of the Act on State local ortribal governments nor any enforceable duties on those governmentalentities Therefore sections  and  of the Act are notapplicableHowever the rule does contain Federal mandates that will resultin the expenditure of  million or more in any one year for theprivate sector The EPA in the preamble to the final rule statesthat the certification program represents the least costly mostcosteffective approach to achieving the air quality goals byrelying on the costbenefit analysis performed in connection withExecutive Order No  as permitted by section  b and cof the Act  Fed Reg Page  GAOOGCiv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts andExecutive ordersAdministrative Procedure Act  USC   et seqThe rule complied with the notice and comment rulemakingprocedures of the Act  USC   This is the fourthrulemaking action which EPA has undertaken to implement therequirement contained in Section l of the Clean Air ActAmendments of On December   a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking waspublished  Fed Reg  Subsequently on October  the rule for the Interim Detergent Program was published  FedReg  In order to obtain more comments regarding the possiblerequirement for control of combustion chamber deposits in the finalrule and to seek more public input in other areas involving thecertification testing and various implementation and enforcementprovisions a Notice of Reopening of the Comment Period waspublished on December  The EPA received  written comments and six oral presentationswere made at a public hearing held by EPA The EPAs response tothe comments received are summarized in the preamble to the finalrule and a detailed presentation and evaluation of the commentsreceived are contained in a separate Summary and Analysis ofComments EPA Docket Item VB Comments regarding enforcementissues and questions raised by the regulated industry wereaddressed by EPA in four Detergent Rule Question and AnswerDocuments EPA Docket Nos IVC IVC IVC IVCPaperwork Reduction Act  USC  The rule contains information collection requirements which willallow EPA to determine that detergent additives which are effectivein controlling deposits are used and that emission control goalsare realized The information to be submitted is of various typesand complexities depending upon the role of the submitter additivemanufacturers refiners terminals truckers or retailers in themanufacturing and distribution process The preamble to the finalrule sets forth the reasons for collecting the information and theburden estimates for the various partiesThe EPA has certified under section c of the Act andsubmitted the information collection requirement to the Office ofManagement and Budget OMB for approval as required by thePaperwork Reduction Act and has solicited comments regarding theproposed collection requirements to be submitted to both EPA andOMB The collection requirement will not be effective until OMBapproval is obtained Therefore the information collectionrequirements contained in thePage  GAOOGCinterim program already approved by OMB will continue to beeffective until replaced by the requirements contained in the finalruleStatutory authorization for the ruleSection l of the Clean Air Act Amendments of  Pub L provided that the Administrator of EPA shall promulgate arule establishing specifications for detergent additives toimplement the requirement also contained in section l thateffective January   no gasoline may be sold or dispensedwhich does not contain additives to prevent the accumulation ofdeposits in engines or fuel systemsExecutive Order No Based on its economic impact the rule was determined to be asignificant regulatory action within the meaning of ExecutiveOrder No  Consistent with the Executive order the rule wasinitiated through an advance notice of proposed rulemaking and aregulatory impact analysis was included in the Interim Programnotice in the Federal Register The analysis was forwarded to theOffice of Management and Budget Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs OIRA for its consideration and comments ascontemplated by the Order OIRA suggested no changes in the rulebut OIRA had EPA supply more elaboration in the preamble to thefinal rule concerning the deposit control test standards and theretention of a  percent flow loss
