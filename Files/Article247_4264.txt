                                 Analyst Whores Qualcomm Soars                        If theres one thing to hope for after this day on which the Nasdaq leaptover  hardly a month after it crossed  its that three months fromnow no one remembers Walt Piecyks name            Piecyk is the Paine Webber telecom analyst who this morning put a monthprice target of ashare on Qualcomm which closed yesterday at  ashare Piecyks call sent Qualcomms stock back off to the races It opened at and ended the day at  which is a leap of  percent Thatsrespectable by any standard but its especially remarkable when you considerthat Qualcomm before today was already the bestperforming stock in theSP  Index up about  percent for the year Its now up betterthan  percent            I know I know These numbers are effectively gibberish especially since Icould fill this column every day with stories about stocks making incrediblemoves upward So why does it matter or not matter whether in May the mention ofWalt Piecyks name will be greeted with anything other than Who            The simplest answer is that the success of calls like Piecykssuccess heremeaning just that investors buy on the news of your price targetleads to morecalls just like it When Henry Blodget who was then at CIBC Oppenheimer saidthat Amazons shares would hit  within the year he was right itcatapulted him into national attention and in some sense probably got him hisnew job at Merrill Lynch And other analysts noticed When FreeMarkets a hotnew businesstobusiness company went public a few weeks ago an analyst at afirm that wasnt underwriting the deal initiated coverage on the day of the IPOand set a price target of  a share even though the company was goingpublic at  a share Its become almost de rigueur  in fact foranalysts to make audacious calls Otherwise they wont even be noticed            You can see the same phenomenon at work in analysts estimates of thingslike that fabled Internet businesstobusiness market For a while now thenumber everyones been tossing around is  trillion in  But that meansthat if youre an analyst and you cite that number no one will notice you Sonow the numbers are getting ratcheted up to the point where a recent GoldmanSachs study said the market could be as large as  trillion And ofcourse here I am mentioning the report            The phenomenon of number creep is bad because we want analysts to reachconclusions they think are true and not conclusions that they think are goingto get them on CNBC I realize this is incredibly naive but there it is Andthe truth is that there still isnt enough accountability for these kinds offorecasts to make the rewards and punishments for success and failurecommensurate But the phenomenon is also bad because these kinds of calls havebecome marketmoving events which means that its no longer irrational totrade as a result of them at least if youre a trader            According to a traditional definition of information about a stock as ina stocks price reflects all the available information the market has aboutit Piecyks report was not new Moreover when you consider that Qualcomm wasalready up  percent for the year the appropriate question to ask isprobably Why are you just starting to cover this stock now But if webroaden the definition of information to include everything that might affectthat stocks price even in the short term then the report has to beconsidered new information which means that it has to affect the stock priceAnd that means that ignoring it is not necessarily rational even iftheres nothing valuable about Piecyks analysis            The best thing for everyone then will be for Qualcomm to settle back inthe next couple of months or even just rise slightly and for Piecyksforecast to be forgotten In the long run even in this stock marketcompanies stock prices will find their true level But what has becomeincredibly clear in  is that the signaltonoise ratio in the stock marketis degenerating with something like Piecyks report being noise and thatmeans that it will take longer for those true levels to be reached
