        okay i i guess first of all ill just say we havent done much uh gardening we do lawn work all the time but uh our gardening we lost remember the last two freezes i dont know how long youve been here   yeah i do   but we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones and so as far as our bushes we dont have any but we do have some blackberry bushes and and they were really hearty and stayed on and weve done really well with them   oh really did you plant those yourself   umhum yeah and so theyve been really good and the kids i had to  the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries   oh   but uh we go out it its hard to go out when its this hot   uhhuh   and uh but uh keep the weeds out of them and and keep them off the ground so the ants dont eat them and theyre okay   oh   yeah um   thats nice i i love blackberries and we we uh when i was smaller we my family lived in Tennessee and there used to be wild blackberries that wed go out and pick my brother and i   uhhuh   but i dont have any down here   yeah yeah uh we have some flowers that have they just are real hearty also and theyre bulbs and they come up every year but uh theyre getting too thick i need to go thin them out and uh there a i dont know what kind of flowers they are theyre real common around here theyre theyre orange and they look like a lily sort of uh   oh i think i know what they i cant remember what the name of them is are are either   yeah no but i think theyre real pretty when it rains because their petals dont soak the rain in they they keep the the rain on the outside little rain drops and and they look real pretty after the rain   oh   and so i really like them but i need to get out and and um  do that now as far as our grass it grows crazy  it just keeps growing and growing and uh sometimes my husband does it and sometimes my son does it but it just is i dont i dont know ive lived in Utah my whole life and we cant seem to get ours green i dont know yeah   down here the grass well im uh weve had problems with our yard we it was one big weed is what it was it was just horrible and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns and we have this God awful ugly thing and   uhhuh crappy  i know we have that too   and i know they must think  you know i wish those people would do something about their yard but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that that seems to be helping and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but weve got a Great Dane in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there shes eaten my crepe myrtle trees   uhhuh uhhuh oh dear   i know and shes eaten the bushes ive tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there and i barricaded it up so she couldnt get into it     no  uhhuh   and i went and took a shower and looked back out there and she was already in it and i was so mad   had somehow gotten in  yeah yeah   so i cant do anything back there because she just she destroys it but ive tried out in the front but like you said that that freeze that came   uhhuh   i had some bushes that uh some shrubs i put put out front and it killed those too so im just real discouraged with the whole thing i just dont even want to do anything   the the other problem that we have well its funny because the one the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived       and so i dont i dont know   i yeah that that happened to us we have these   uh so like i wanted to go out and kill them too   i know   they had no right to live but anyway       uh under our trees we get a a north sun and uh the it looks like our trees dont have any grass under them you know we just cant grow uh grass underneath there   oh i know ours dont i know we cant either but ive got pretty two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard   umhum   and and theyre big and  theyre real full and everything you know in the summer time but it its killing everything underneath   yeah   where the leaves are shading the tree but toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing but by then its so late then the winter comes and it stops you know its its its a never ending cycle   right its a vicious cycle isnt it its really   yeah it really is so weve been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and and whatnot so   well i dont weve never done anything like this but weve been thinking you know if we built up um you know either a a wood wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers or or some new bushes in there that would live   uhhuh   and so i think that were going to try that i i think the   huh   i think thats pretty much what we have decided now i have two long windows and im trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not you know maybe just halfway up the window or something like that   yeah   so people cant see and hear too much  it just   yeah really and ive cut well i dont really have to worry about that that much because my sons bedrooms are in the front and theyve got miniblinds and stuff but only only one is really like in the flower bed part and the other one is out on the porch   yeah yeah   so theres not really much i can do about that   thats what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows one is a bedroom for our our oldest son and one is um an office that my husband and i work in and so i i really dont like it too much because then the back of our house faces that well the flowers are out by the back of the house so and thats where the front room is so thats not too bad but i like to look at the flowers theyre pretty   yeah i do too thats why i look at my neighbors yard  i dont have anything to look at so i look at theirs   yeah but its funny because uh you try so hard i think sometimes to to anyway i do to do our yard and then its like the wind blows   uhhuh   everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back and   yeah yeah it its really a pain my husband works a lot so um a lot   its hard to get out a lot and do that yard work   yeah im its usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard and   uhhuh   and i just  i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it i hate to mow the yard more than anything else i hate to mow that yard   i know it is its not my favorite thing in the world either im glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now   yeah well mines getting there he helps he does half and i do half so pretty soon though by next year he should be able to do it all by himself   uhhuh yeah   whether he likes it or not   yeah  well that is one chore that we will pay him for if hell go do the yard work out outside so   oh sure ill be more then glad to pay him if hed just go out there and do it and and do it to where i dont have to go back out and redo it that thats my only thing with him   yeah right exactly exactly   thats why im help having him help me now
