        okay     now where do you live   i live in Richardson Texas   oh well were pretty close then   you bet well see our subject was gun control   yes   im sort of uh prejitice prejudiced on this subject because thats my vocation thats what i do for a living       because im a im a manufacturers sales rep and i sell hunting and shooting supplies working working for eighteen different companies so i would guess i would be sort of pro   well  i guess we have something in common then because i dont think its guns   pro pro guns but uh okay   that are the problem its its the people   no i agree one hundred percent   i mean theyre just an inanimate object until they are in the hands of someone who is who is violent or has a a sick warped mind   i agree with you one hundred percent Jean ill tell you that somewhere i saw a bumper sticker years ago id like to see more of them i think uh speaking from my my viewpoint think it read something like uh when guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns   exactly   and i think that sort of speaks for itself i believe uh in some gun control but i think its and i you know in selling to the industry or selling for the industry to dealers i think that its the federal governments stand that should be taken and i think that dealers now or to buy a gun now an individual just has to go in a store and and show his drivers license and if he has a Texas state drivers license and if he lives in Texas he can go to any gun dealer and buy a gun merely by filling out a yellow form and and paying for the firearm and leaving   with it at the time   right it would be it would be handy if they had you know computers being like they are if theyd have some kind of a computer program on a national level where you could just dial an eight hundred number and and run a check on someone   right   i would be for something like that   yes it would uh but then too the people who who have guns already um some of them they may have had this gun for twelve years before they uh become mentally unbalanced and use it   thats true   and otherwise i mean if someone is going to get a gun uh and is determined to get a gun and commit some some act theyre going to get it whether they can walk in a store and buy it or if they have to break into a house across town or something you know theyre going to get one   absolutely   but uh no you and i i think have the same idea that  guns are not the problem   yeah   ive heard a lot of people say why i wouldnt have a gun in my house theyre too dangerous ignorance is whats dangerous   you bet absolutely   uh i have uh many grandchildren and they have all been raised in the house with guns with loaded guns they have been taught the danger of guns how to handle them um from the time  well i had a granddaughter that i raised and from the time that she  was um       three or four she knew that the gun that i had was not to be touched and that it was dangerous and i never had to worry about her   well thats wonderful   but uh anytime that she would have friends come i would put i had a closet that would lock and any gun firearms that were loaded we usually keep a uh twelve gauge shotgun loaded and then my handgun and anytime that there were other children in the house i had i put them in the closet that locked just for safety sake   well thats great weve always done the same thing and being in the business ive sold guns for twenty seven years im fifty two years old and ive sold guns for twenty seven years worked for some major manufacturers like Winchester and people like that and and i always consider a a firearm i know theyre very dangerous but i always consider everything a sporting firearm and i realize that just as you say some people dont think of them as that but thats how i think of them being that im in the business but main thing is just be education and communication on the subject and thats something we have always tried to do and im a strong believer in that   yes i think that these children that find guns and shoot themselves or another child uh if they  if they knew what they were playing with they wouldnt do it   absolutely right   because they would my soninlaw one of the when the boys were just very very small he was educating them about the guns and he took a watermelon out and set it up on uh this little rise out on the desert where they live   right
