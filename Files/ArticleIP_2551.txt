control the computer television and telephonebusinesses think so and they are populating your future with Internetappliances  Already on sale are such Iappliance devices as Webawaretelevisions and email telephones which offer quick and easy Internet accessfor consumers who fear personal computers These appliances are as simple torun as a microwave or a toaster oven Just plug them in and before you knowit youre reading your favorite online magazines ordering Puff Daddy the Family concert tickets and composing email from the comfort of yourNaugahyde couch            TV andtelephone manufacturers are nuts about Iappliances because they view them as away to sell new boxes to a world supersaturated with phones and televisionsMore US homes have a television  percent than have phone service Thecomputer industry sees Iappliances as a way to sell chip and software packagesto what they consider an underPCed world Only  percent of US householdsown a PC and twothirds of all new PC purchases are made by folks who alreadyown one            The vision of a computertelevisiontelephone thingamajigdates back to early episodes of The Jetsons  if not beforeTechnoutopian George Gilder foresaw the convergence of all theseelectronic boxes into one back in his  book Life After Television proposing a simple yet powerful teleputer device Gilder was right aboutconvergence but as well see he was also wrong            Among thefirst entries in the Iappliance market is WebTV  a boxandkeyboard combination built by Sony and Phillips WebTV hooks yourtelevision into your telephone line to provide access to the Web Fulldisclosure I work for the Great Satan that is behind WebTV Think of WebTV asa whipsmart version of the settop box you rent from your cableTVprovider Whats smart about WebTV compared with a settop box WebTVs areessentially tiny simple computers The new model boasts a gigabyte harddrive and a  bitspersecond modem comparable to what youd find in alowend laptop The cable companys settop boxes which couldnt calculate thecube root of  if you gave them a hint merely decode TV signals from the cablepeople A unit of Oracle Corp has developed a similar Webaware product calledEnhanced TV  Sun Microsystems which recently bought Iappliancedesigner Diba Inc is also developing a competing settop standard of its ownOpenTV             Webaware televisions are fantastic becausetheyre cheap and they work But they also suck because theyre slow and theirgraphics are worse than what you find on a PC monitor Only  WebTVs havebeen sold so far but that number is sure to rise WebTV vendor Phillips ispeddling the machine doortodoor Fuller Brushstyle Salesmen will visit yourhome plug you in and explain all the machines wonders to you            Anothereven simpler Iappliance is the EP email telephone by Uniden Thisdevice merges a Caller IDready  MHz cordless phone with email andcalendar systems A tad pricier at  than WebTV the EP is fun for thewhole family allowing multiple users to receive and send email the Internetconnection costs  a month Uniden and others promise Web browsing onfuture email telephones Also flooding the market are cellular phones thatsend and receive email            Not content with being your spreadsheet program wordprocessor Web device game machine and recipe keeper PCs want to be yourhome entertainment center  too A variety of manufacturers build PCsthat connect you to the Web display TV broadcasts play music CDs and screenDVD movies PC maker Gateway  bills the Destination Digital Media Computeras an audiovideo monster that engulfs you in a wall of sound as you playDoom on a inch monitor with a screaming  MHz Intel Pentium IIprocessor Gateway hasnt attached a phone to it Yet            The PCindustry may believe in convergence but the broadcasters dont Broadcasterslike their televisions dumb mostly because theyre afraid that the PC industrywill steal their business if computers and televisions merge Theyre probablyright So the two groups have gone to war over the technical standards forthe next TV technology digital TV  All you need to know about thedigital TV standard proposed by the computer people is that its more flexibleand powerful and offers better resolution and is much more computerfriendlythan the current standard of analog TV or the digital standard pitched bybroadcasters            Cable company spinoff WorldGate alsowants your television to stay as dumb as an eggbeater because its found a wayto offer cheap Internet access through existing cable boxes The cost is a month keyboard rental will set you back an additional  Question Howcan something as stupid as a settop box connect to the Internet AnswerWorldGate keeps all the brains back at the office Its computers recognizeWebpage requests from settop boxes and then ship the pages back to therequesting televisions in a compact single image a bitmap The WorldGatesystem depends on the vertical blanking interval an unused part of each TVchannel to send the bitmap Click for a tidy explanation of the verticalblanking interval Critics say WorldGates computers will choke when thousandsof surfers start demanding Web pages Webhead says dont underestimate thecable companies who have such enormous bandwidth at their disposal that theycan do anything see my piece on bandwidth            Will yourMixmaster ever fulfill its career ambition to become an IapplianceShumans Second Law of Computational Dynamics suggests so This lawstates that wherever computer chips go the Internet will follow Everythingthats powered by electricity will eventually become studded with computerchips And as these dumb devices become smarter manufacturers will exploreways to make them more usefulthat is smarter still which means connectingthem to the Internet so they can share their wisdom with other devices Takethe example of the Internetenabled car currently a pipe dream The modernautomobile is laden with microchips which control fuel intake cruise controlantilock brakes and more Its only a short step from where we are now to theNetwork Vehicle  being developed by Netscape Sun Delco and IBM Itwill be outfitted with voice recognition transparent displays globalpositioning systems and Internet access The Network Vehicle designers leftcar phones off the list I guess because they assume that car phones arepractically standard equipment today            The takehome lesson of this edition of Webhead is that allelectronic devices are converging at a wicked rate But theyre also divergingOur powerful multipurpose computers will continue to become even morepowerful but as they acquire new skillslike voice recognitiontheir appealwill be limited by their price Meanwhile their simpler brethren assignedspecific and narrow tasks look for Internetaware watches biomedicalmonitors and security devices will occupy the price niche of clock radiosand bread makers In the future the way to tell a real computer from anIappliance will be that you tell a real computer what to do and when todo it whereas an Iappliance will tell you what to do and when to doit
