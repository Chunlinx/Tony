        recording   so what kind of animals do you have   well i have two cats   uh   i have two cats because i cant have dogs um where i live i ive wanted a dog i owned a dog we had dogs when i was growing up all the time   uhhuh   and um you know our our cats are are very interesting and we never owned cats when i was growing up so this is a uh its been a really really neat uh neat kind of learning experience for me theyve blown all my uh conceptions preconceptions about cats       so do you do you have pets   yeah i have a dog and a cat   uhoh do they get along   so oh yeah they it was uh a very hairy two weeks there at the beginning uh the dog was a little under a year and the cat was about six weeks old and it it was a hefty break in   uhhuh oh did the dog the dog like uh know that there was a cat and   well it was very it was interesting because it its just you know part of their makeup theyre psyche i mean they just hate each other automatically but after a while they they got to be good friends and uh   hum   luckily its sort of a big cat i mean its about twelve pounds and uh so he can hold his own against the dog and uh but they they i basically got the cat to keep the dog company and uh they they do that     yeah   yeah thats thats actually why we got our second cat i we thought our cat needed a pet   uhhuh   uh you know you tend to personify these things but our our cat thinks our oldest cat thinks that it it should be a person and our youngest cat actually thinks its a cat         so it works out pretty well um   yeah well ill tell you one thing i found with with pets um i i think cats are easier to take care of especially when on a situation like you go off on a trip uh you know its a real pain with a dog because you have to have someone come over and walk them and let them out and that kind of thing   uhhuh yeah feed them and all that   and sometimes i think wow if i had two cats id just you know get a feeder  and   uh yeah you know an interesting story is i i i have a friend who has um a cat that actually knows how to open Tender Vittles bags       so if they go on a trip they just leave the bags on the kitchen floor and the catll go and open one when it wants to eat   oh thats amazing   im i swear to God its like you know the i guess uh it earlier uh earlier time it would have to figure out how to use a can opener but you know now it its pretty self sufficient i just think           you they say you own a dog and you feed a cat and i think that thats pretty much pretty much true   yeah   that is interesting i hadnt ever heard anything like that but uh   yeah i it blew me away   yeah weve been uh weve been pretty lucky too the uh reason we first got the dog to begin with was i lived im in school still and i lived uh closer to campus   umhum   and uh as usual the neighborhoods right near campus arent that nice   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh so we got the dog as protection and i guess it worked because we were never broken into and the but the people on either side of us were  so yeah uh   oh really uh we we usually had rifle cleaning parties on the front porch when you know you move into a bad neighborhood you have your have all your friends over play the Grateful Dead and clean your rifles and they pretty much get the idea           uh but the dog i guess would work too   yeah yeah           well it is a big dog   uh shes uh around fifty pounds shes a a very very skinny shepherd   oh okay   uh well shes not pure and we we tried to figure out what she was crossed with we know the mother was a shepherd but uh she looks like shes crossed with like Greyhound because she is just thin as a rail and uh   oh wow well see they they say that the uh mixed breeds have a better temperament anyway all that inbreeding that they do that they have to do to maintain a pure blood line i guess makes them really weird   yeah definitely and theyre also prone to more diseases and uh skin problems and my sister has a a pure bred gold uh yellow Lab and that dog has every problem you could imagine you know its allergic to fleas its uh got another skin condition and just     the dreaded hip dysplasia   yeah yeah   yeah thats uh   so we we havent really had much problems with her shes uh just extremely hyper and uh i guess that accounts for her her physique and she runs like a gazelle so   umhum   its fun to take her to the park and watch her run rings around all the other dogs         trying to play with them and they look at her like youre crazy you think im going to catch you   shes maybe she is part Greyhound huh   so yeah yeah either     thats thats uh thats interesting i thought about for a while there uh theres a  a movement now to uh adopt exrace dogs and   right
