                                            I am an American who lives in Wales and I havea problem with geographically challenged American friends who confuse Englandjust a part of the whole and the United Kingdom and are constantly sendingmail addressed to me in Wales Englandinstead of Wales UK                                       Should I make a pestof myself and keep telling my friends that I live in Wales not England orshould I just shrug it off                                       Adopted Welshman                        Dear Ad            Ah yes a gray matter issue But you have come tothe right person A geographically challenged American that is Prudie thinksshe was in the bathroom when other people learned these things in gradeschool            In any case speaking asone who

having to tell thesame person more than once then shrug it off  and Prudie hopes youwill be compassionate            Prudie geographically                                             DearPrudence                                                      Just a quick note of support for your reply to regarding forms of address I think your first instinct that childrenshould address adults in the manner in which the adults ask to be addressedis absolutely dead on                                       Not only as a child but even nowwell into myadulthoodthis rule has served me well Not only do people appreciate myrespect for their preferences but I also dont have to choose to whom to caterin mixed situations It is one of those rare cases in which I can pleaseeveryone Best of all though I avoid the hubris of pushing my ideas ofappropriate formality on others even those who agree with me                                       Now I just wish moreforms would allow me to omit Mr from my name                                        Accommodating in Seattle                        Dear Ac            Prudie thanks you for thevote of confidence and doubly so because she was taken to task by some readerswho disagreed We are kindred in another way as well Prudie just likes to useher first and last name and would happily ditch the Ms or the Mrs or theMiss            Prudie gratefully                                             DearPrudence                                                      Does a bridesmaidhave to give the future bride a gift for every shower given                                       The Professor                        Dear Prof            Certainly not Some brides have so many peopleentertaining for them that it would seem to be constantly raining luncheonsand teasand etiquette calls for the attendants to be invited to every suchevent            The bridesmaids may skipgiving shower presents unless they simply feel theyd like to Or a token giftwould be appropriate And since Prudie is living in America in  a smalladdendum about those brides whove previously been up at bat Emily Post wrotethis Those who attended a shower for the bride before she was married thefirst time should not be invited to a second shower unless they are very closerelatives or very dear friends who would want to be present            Prudie graciously                                             DearPrudie                                                      We got to be friends with our neighbors withwhom we had much in common We shared tools went to see Bob Dylan togethercared for each others cats while away on trips They borrowed a bottle of winewhile we were gone and they were doing the cat thing for us It was not a winethat was known to them ie they didnt know if it was a gift or special insome other way But they took it anyway drank it and told us about it assoon as we returned It was not in fact a special or expensive bottle of winebut not to belabor the point they didnt know that They also didnt replaceit in a timely fashion When we let them know we werent happy with the wholething they were offended and have since completely severed thefriendship                                       What do you think about taking something likethis from someones home while youre doing them a favor If it had been a Budor two from the fridge we wouldnt have given it a second thought But a bottleof wine that may have been irreplaceable                                       Thanks                                       Sad in Philly                        Dear Sad            First they told you and second they failed toreplace it This suggests they view things differently than you two and theiridea of correct behavior is different from yours There is a chance that bytheir lights they assumed that had you been home you would have lent themthe wine            Prudie agrees with you that this was not firstratebehavior It could be though that they just didnt know any better Shouldyou feel generous and lonesome for the friendship you might make the firstmove and say you wish to let bygones be bygones because the relationship wasimportant to you I mean you all went to see Bob Dylan together            Their severing tiesbespeaks their embarrassment at having made a social misstep and perhaps angerthat you wouldnt cut them some slack So  Prudie recommends that you patchit up if you wish the whole thing had never happened And she is certainif relations are repaired that the neighbs will never again help themselves toanything in your house            Prudie soothingly
