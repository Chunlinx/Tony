               so okay so what is the subject now      its on the the time that we spend with our children   okay well let me tell you about our our situation um  we have two girls uh one is twelve one is uh   okay   is eleven and ive got uh two sons that are um   umhum   six and three   umhum   and uh between the four uh my two girls play a lot of soccer and we travel a lot with them and theyre either practicing or playing and and it is really tough to fit everything in   umhum   and uh you know im not real sure what your situation is if you you have any kids that are still at home but   uh we just uh well we have the one that uh has left   uhhuh   but he was here a year ago and uh he was involved in wrestling wrestling and along with my three older sons we had six children and our oldest son our second son is uh   oh is that right uhhuh   hes a doctor and he was uh All State in wrestling       and then uh my last son that just left home is All State in wrestling so we had two in our family but we had a lot of participation with them and i know what youre talking about where you its difficult to find time but i   oh   i i feel its very important that you support the kids as much as you can you and uh uh the spouse because uh when uh well both sons uh when they were wrestling uh they would kind of look up   you bet     to see if we were in the audience and the thats the last they pay any attention to us until after the game is over right and the wrestling match   it sure makes a big difference doesnt it     and uh we really enjoyed it uh to be involved with our our uh children and i think its very important thats something that   yeah   the parents today and and and there is so much involvement that it gets pretty difficult but i think with with church and everything else that youre doing     yeah   but uh thats where a family relationship is really built and uh its uh then they have   it sure is we have uh in fact we this this past um Christmas we went out to California we uh both my girls were involved in in tournaments out there so went out there we spent Christmas with uh my wifes family out there in in California and then um   umhum uhhuh   we drove out to or down to Southern California and had the tournament we went to Disneyland as a family and and just kind of you know spent time together that way   well super well those are things that theyll theyll never forget and uh they know theyre loved when when that takes place   yeah   and that youre supporting them there are so many families that i know about today that they just dont take uh time to do anything with their children     you bet my wife just said to tell you that your grandson is beautiful   oh good good well were gonna try to get down to uh hopefully for his uh uh the oldest ones uh       baptism and then the grandsons uh our youngest to get his uh to the blessing but i dont know whether we can make it or not were gonna give it a shot but thats coming up     to be blessed yeah i know that means a youd mean a lot to uh to Brian hes a hes a heck of a nice guy boy i really enjoy uh being friends with him hes     i appreciate that he was a super son and when he was wrestling uh we had two sons wrestling and we one week we went to twelve wrestling matches in one week     is that right   we had one the oldest his older brother was in college and he was in high school and we could uh get to all of those but     when did he find time to learn how to do brakes he just helped me do my brakes   oh he hes very talented in all kinds of things uh hes not like his dad he can do about anything and uh we really miss him being in in Texas     yeah he is   yes uhhuh   so anyway   well thats great yeah um  my work uh uh fortunately my work doesnt take me away from  from this area so i have uh i have some time i own my own business out here so i have some time just just spent with them you know whenever the time uh whenever they need me but um   umhum well thats super   i i know that theres quite a few  people in our family that uh or in our  you know in our area that um that work  outside and and they have a even tougher  time trying to  uh schedule time with  their families   umhum  yep well be sure and tell Brian hello and its been a pleasure talking to you sounds like our times up and uh give him the the best from him his dad   okay im im not sure if our times up or  my phone just  went out of out of whack  i think that was just my phone   oh oh i see okay ive ive this the first call so i dont know what happens when the times up   well theyll come back on and tell us when the time is up yeah it they should be another couple of minutes so   oh i see okay fine and course church involvement i think is very important too uh that with parents uh supporting their children in in taking them to Church and going with them     uhhuh oh yeah   and thats thats another activity that uh time is spent and   well i think thats it thats probably more important than anything else and
