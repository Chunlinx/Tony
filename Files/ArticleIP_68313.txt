                                 Grand Finale            Mike Leighs                  TopsyTurvy                broadly recounts the creation of Gilbertand Sullivans comic opera The Mikado at Londons Savoy Theatre in Perhaps broadly is putting too fine a point on it The first hour in whichArthur Sullivan Allan Corduner attempts to sever his ties with WS GilbertJim Broadbent and the owner of the Savoy Richard DOyly Carte Ron Cook isa mess The order of scenes feels arbitrary and characters pop up and vanishwith bewildering frequency You might be tempted to vanish too Friends ofmine did Be patient Leighs movies born of actors improvisations andloosely shaped always take a while to find their rhythmand frequentlytheir point This one finds everything By the end of its two hours and minutes TopsyTurvy has evolved into something extraordinary amonument to processto the minutiae of making art And to something more thefundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful thingswho soarandthen come down to a notsobeautiful earth            It would be charitableto attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters own lackof focus but it would also be inane As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in                  Slate               s  Leighs opening shot features an usher who movesalong a row of the Savoy Theatre lifting and peering under every seat Thatsevery seat You can almost hear Leigh cackling Hows this for a faststartyou bourgeois slaves to narrative Inevitably something does happenPrincess Ida  one of Gilbert and Sullivans duds has its premiere andGilbert fumes over a review that calls him the monarch of topsyturvydomofformulaic plots involving magical elixirs and coins A heat wave has hitLondon theater attendance is down and Sullivan is itching to go off andbecome the English Mendelssohnto write operas and symphonies instead of comicsouffls Leigh evidently loves the bloodless formality of the scenes betweenGilbert and Sullivan men of opposite tastes and temperaments who only overlapin their work He must also love that those scenes are narrative dead endsHows this for conflictyou bourgeois slaves to melodrama            The wakeup call comes an hour into the movie Gilbertattends a popular exposition of Japanese culture at Knightsbridge and watchesKabuki routines and women in kimonos pouring green tea spinach water Whena Japanese sword he has purchased falls off his wall he hefts it mimes afight while issuing strangled samurailike cries then has a brainstorm Wehear the horns of The Mikado overture then Leigh cuts to the fullyrealized opening scene on stage at the Savoy We are gentlemen of Japan Just that chorus is enough to reanimate the audienceto make people sit up andgrin And Leighs technique of leaping back and forth between the finishedMikado and painstaking scenes of rehearsal has magic in it Yourewatching straw then gold then straw then gold And you see theconnection            A central section of thedrama is missing What exactly fired Sullivan up about doing The Mikado What was different about this collaboration No answerTopsyTurvy turns into something other than the Gilbert and Sullivanstory a portrait of life in the theater A group portrait DOyly Cartebecomes a quiet third protagonist a humane businessman He softly negotiates asalary increase with the companys lead comic Martin Savage a neurasthenicjunkie He gently seeks the assurance of a tipsy ingnue the tremulous ShirleyHenderson that her little weakness will not reemerge In the dressing roomperformers gossip and complain drink and shoot themselves up with drugsLeighs ensemble casts strive to be microcosms of society so issues of classare ever present You see it in Sullivans banter with the workingclassmusicians in the pit and in Gilberts with the uppity actors the moviesposturing middle class whom he drills on pronunciation and poise The chorusis presented as some sort of collective folk conscience when it lobbies Gilbertto restore the rashly cut solo A more humane Mikado never did in Japanexist of the sad fat fellow Timothy Spall in the title role            Who would have predicted that Leigh would make Gilbert andSullivan into Mike Leigh characters Gilbert could be a standin for Leighhimselfa haughty illhumored man with an obsession for tiny details and aglowering dedication to process Gilbert haggles with his actors over smallthings that shouldnt resonate but which somehow add up Leighs small thingsadd up too The joke of The Mikado is that its Japanese lords arethinly disguised English bureaucrats the joke of TopsyTurvy is thatthe operas English performers seem culturally incapable of playing JapaneseThey rehearse in long coats and top hats and some of the women and menexpress horror at appearing on stage without corsets Behind the satirehowever is a reverence for Gilbert and Sullivan The tempos are slower thanmodern audiences are used to and the staging has been stripped of highcampaccretions I saw a DOyly Carte production of The Mikado in the lates It was played fast and to the groundlings and made me never want to see aGS opera again Now I cant wait for the next production            Only a lunatic wouldcall TopsyTurvy  with its lame first hour and host of loose ends amasterpiece but by the finale I was ready to have myself committed The finaleitself must have done it Leighs endings are often wondrous and this one isup there with the rooftop scene in High Hopes  The Mikadois a triumphit would be the Savoys biggest hitbut theres notransformation in the lives of its makers Gilbert cant bring himself to reachout to his brokenhearted wife Lesley Manville and Sullivan has a melancholyinkling that he has reached his artistic peak The ingnue Leonora isdrinking again toasting herself in the mirror and praising the loveliness ofNaturea Nature that will of course destroy her The final image is of ArtLeonora on stage singing YumYums sublime The sun whose rays are all ablaze As Leighs camera pulls back over the orchestra and the audience this moviefeels like one of the saddest and loveliest tributes to the lives of artistsever made TopsyTurvy leaves you upside down and breathless            Like Mike Leigh Errol Morris rarely begins a project witha clear idea of what he wants it to be Sometimes he doesnt end a project witha clear idea of what he wants it to be either His newest documentary                  Mr Death  The Rise and Fall of Fred D LeuchterJr                kicks up all sorts of messy emotions that his coolly ironictechnique cant begin to handle            The director is in hisweird element only in the first halfhour in which he sits his subject downand gets out of his way Leuchter who looks a little like the archetypal moviedweeb Charles Martin Smith and has a heavy exurbsofBoston accent explainshow he became involved in redesigning problematic electric chairs Excesscurrent cooks the tissue he says barely suppressing a smirk at his ownexpertise Thereve been occasions where a great amount of current has beenapplied and the meat actually will come off the executees bone like the meatcoming off a cooked chicken Leuchter set about making capital punishment morehumane He moves on to talking about his redesigns for lethalinjectionsystems gas chambers and even a gallows while underneath Caleb Sampsonprovides macabre funhouse music and wistful calliope waltzes Morris distancefrom his subject implies condescensionLeuchter looks like something in a jarBut thats OK because the man is an interesting specimen Is he a monster or ahumanist committed to eliminating the deplawrable tawchaw of capitalpunishment It could go either way            M r Death gets into deeper waters when it recountsthe trial of Ernst Zundel in Canada for proclaiming that the Holocaust neverhappened Zundel hired Leuchter to go to Auschwitz and examine the allegedgas chambers Footage taken by Zundels cameraman shows the little manchiseling at walls vandalizing what even he admits are international shrinesLeuchter smuggled specimens of rock and concrete back to the United Stateswhere chemical analysis revealed no cyanide gas Furthermore Leuchter cantfigure out how the gas would even have been administered without killing theNazis themselvesproof he argues that mass extermination at Auschwitz nevertook place The subsequent Leuchter Report became the backbone of Zundelsdefense he lost anyway and of the burgeoning revisionist movement led byDavid Irving But if Leuchter became a hero to neoNazis he also became atarget of Jewish groups and a pariah even in the execution business WhenMorris hooks up with him for the last time hes in hiding from creditors            Is Leuchter a ravingantiSemite or a pathetic pawn who thrived on havingfor the first time in hislifea bit of celebrity The film suggests the latter It certainly producesno evidence of malice Plenty of monstrous insensitivity and hubris thoughMorris uses the Dutch historian Robert Jan van Pelt as a counternarrator Hecalls Leuchter a fffool  who didnt have a clue what to look for in aplace that had changed enormously in  years If he had spent time in thearchives says van Pelt he would have found evidence about ventilationsystems ways to introduce Zyclon B into these buildingsbut of course I dontthink he knows German so it wouldnt have helped very much The mostdevastating rebuttal is from the chemist in charge of the Auschwitz analysiswho explains that the gas wouldnt have penetrated more than  microns intothe wall a human hair is  microns thick so by crushing the samplesstandard procedure he had effectively diluted the cyanide  timesAgainst all this Morris shows footage of Leuchter chiseling at Auschwitz andeven adds some of his own along with slowmotion shots of hammers bashingrocks walls floors etc Its an obscenity            After my rage at Leuchter had subsided I began to getangry at Morris for aestheticizing that violationturning it into an ironicart object The directors beautiful detachment suggests a kind of cowardiceHis technique is based on standing backmaintaining a fixed distancewhilehis subjects hang themselves and for a while that works stunningly But at acertain point isnt it only human to want to engage this man You dont needto play Mike Wallace and demolish Leuchter on camera You could just ask himwhat he makes of say van Pelts assertion that the answer to the riddle ofthe gas chambers was all over the archives or what he thought of the chemistsdeclaration that the test performed for cyanide was the wrong test Morris canbe heard asking one question only Have you ever thought you might be wrong orthat you made a mistakesufficiently broad that Leuchter can casually affirmhis own inanity            My concern here isnt so much for Leuchter or eventhe Holocaust revisionists wholl just think he was sandbagged The problem isthat when a documentary filmmaker seems too scared or cool or arty to violatehis own immaculate aesthetic he ends up weakening his case He also providesno emotional release which isnt a small matter when the subject is Holocaustdenial Morris was close enough to Leuchter to have gotten something more tohave gone a little deeper in search of a poison that does penetratesurfaces
