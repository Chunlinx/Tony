                                 The Meaning of the IBM SellOff                        Its hard to tell if this is still the Era of Stock Market Good Feeling orif a combination of YK concerns rising interest rates misreadings of AlanGreenspan and conventional October is a bad month for stocks has brought itto a sudden end What we seem to be living through right now is a strange timein which the market is simultaneously being excoriated as overvalued andhysterical and being described as being in a slump that forebodes badthings ahead Cant win for losing            As evidence of investor hysteria the financial media often point to thingslike the  billion marketcap hit that IBM took at the end of last weekafter it announced that it would have two and perhaps three disappointingquarters in a row because its customers were cutting back on spending in orderto take care of potential YK problems Momentum investors pile into a stockthe narrative goes and then pile out of it without paying any attention to thefundamentals so that good buyandhold investors get whipsawed for no goodreason            But what happened to IBM on Thursday far from being evidence of a flightystock market was instead a sign of just how discriminating investors havebecome If stock prices really were being driven solely by inflated marginbalances and the overconfidence bred by years of  percent plus returns youdexpect investors to be forgiving In fact they are more punitive then everInvestors are willing to pay high prices for companies that deliver consistentaboveaverage cashflow growth But if there are signs that a companys abilityto deliver that kind of growth may be falteringand IBMs announcement was aVegasstyle neon sign to that effectthen the market will pummel a stockquickly            The speed with which a negative earnings report can vaporize a companysmarket cap is also sometimes held up as problematic But here again its nosurprise that in a world in which trading costs are minuscule the diffusion ofinformation nearly instantaneous and trading volume immense prices willchange very fast in the wake of significant news This just means that marketsare more efficient not less in the sense that they establish a newequilibrium priceor as close to it as they can ever getin the space of aday and not a week IBMs stock price bumped up a little bit on Friday butstayed steady today which suggests that Thursdays selloff was not somemassive overreaction            The most important thing about the IBM selloff though was what itwasnt  namely an impetus for a more general selloff in technology Inthe past and even the recent past weve seen announcements like the one thatBig Blue made have a ripple effect on tech stocks across the board as momentumand program traders bailed out of anything that might suffer from associationwith a big names blowup But last week investors rather quickly recognizedthat IBMs problems seemed companyspecific and that companies that hadreported excellent earnings during the weeklike AOLshould be bought notsold In other words investors rewarded the companies that should have beenrewarded and punished those that should have been punished Capital wasallocated sensibly rather than hysterically            There are of course always going to be under and overreactions like theone that victimized Tyco or theone that sent the stock of Cisco which I own shares of plummeting on Fridayafter an unsubstantiated rumor that the company would miss estimates hit theStreet But what last weeks action suggested is that five or  or depending on how youre counting years of a bull market have not madeinvestors careless or blinded by success Eternal vigilance  Well somethinglike that
