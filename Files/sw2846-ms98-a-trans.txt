          do you have some kids getting ready for college   well i have uh uh basically have grown children ive got one thats that is a parttime college student and one thats college age but not attending so uh he did it   youve sort of faced up to the problem then   yeah he he did uh attend a little bit you know they took some classes and then decided it college was not what he wanted to do so   yeah   he went along the the older one the daughter who is older is going parttime and working full time   uhhuh   uh shes attending a community college right now and she would like to go on to a you know to a four year school go ahead and get a degree   yes   and uh thats you know one of her immediate long range objectives   well ive got a bunch of little ones that are still growing up   yeah uh   so im sort of facing putting them through college about the time im also looking to retire   oh yeah so you     and uh   uh   i think my initial thoughts are going to have to sort of grade my advice according to uh you know how much motivation and drive and uh and ability they have when they start facing the college years   right uh i i guess uh one thing from from my own personal experience uh the drive is the important or is i i consider to be the important part of going to college um i i was not an exceptional student by any means in high school i was not a bad student but was not an exceptional student and you know didnt really have uh any strong ambitions that required college but i did want to go to school did want to get the you know go ahead and get the college   uhhuh   and so i worked my way through college and uh you know i think that it was because i really wanted the degree that i you know followed through and went ahead and and went on even finished up going to college after i got married   uhhuh   and uh i like you said i think that uh the ambition and the drive is uh is pretty much key a key there   yeah   uh like i said weve got the one thats not going to college he he just does not have the desire to go at this time are i hope that some day for my benefit i hope that some day he decides he wants to go because it will you know make me feel better but uh whatever makes him feel best is whats important i suppose   yeah well i think my reaction from my experience is that uh i picked a school that was too good   uhhuh   and uh so i had a fairly tough time getting through and they presented me with a lot of material which i just wasnt able to absorb and handle   yeah and i i think that thats   and uh so i think my first advice would be to go to a community college and to a a smaller school for your undergraduate studies maybe a state supported school and then if you have the necessary drive and still need the the intellectual mileage to pick a top of the line school for graduate study   uhhuh i think thats a good idea uh and and too i guess uh looking at at what the the individuals interests are instead of just what uh what the popular degree plans are uh   right   i uh started out in in high school expecting to go into engineering and when i got into the mathematics and science classes i was not a bad student in those in those areas but didnt really have the interest in it so i changed my my career design over into the accounting and business field and uh i am a CPA   uhhuh   and i you know im pretty good at that but i its not it was not something that i really thought long and hard and had a real  you know a real strong drive toward um im not sure what uh what i would have done differently or what i would do differently now but uh i might you know i might go in a different direction if i were to start fresh uh you know think more about what my real interest were instead of what my you know instead of what was available or what sounded like a good money maker uh its not always the important thing   you know i think one its very important to chose a career that uh to do something you enjoy doing   right   because i figure thats part of my compensation is is being able to do something i can take an interest in   yeah   uh i think one of the reactions i had uh was that i underestimated the amount of math that was needed for an engineering degree   right   uh you know my interest uh in high school was you know grabbing up a bunch of vacuum tubes and and building something that worked   uhhuh   and uh you know it was a matter of using cookbook designs and so forth and building up amplifiers or oscillators or making transmitters or receivers and uh you know i didnt face up to the fact that theres a you know an enormous mathematical basis for all of this   right   until i actually got to college and so it was a bit of a slap in the face and an uphill struggle although i didnt have that much trouble with math uh in high school   noise yeah um an i guess another another area that uh in retrospect i would give parents a real strong advice on is the the study habits and preparation that students need   uhhuh   and and they need to start as early as they can you know not wait until theyre a freshman in high school even to start developing good study habits and get the you know get the good basics uh you know the math and the the English and a little science and stuff like that that that uh so they really have a good background for whatever course load theyre going to take   yeah   because uh i know in in my sons case his math background is is not very strong and we tried a lot you know to to help him but i think that the uh i think the educational system   uhhuh   uh the way things are are run in this area anyway it its a little weak and you know as a result he doesnt he doesnt have the math background that he would need in college   right   and uh i think thats one reason that hes not interested he doesnt think he would do well   well i was fairly lucky in uh going to a small town school uh i got a lot of individual attention from the the faculty that was there   uhhuh   they probably werent the most brilliant people in the world but they uh were very personable and took uh a interest in people who were willing to study   yeah uh i agree i think that makes a difference uh   and so i   i went to a small town school also my son went to a school that had like twenty five hundred students in it or something you know   we have yeah yeah you get lost there   and uh its its really well it really makes a difference as to   there were thirty six students in my graduating class   uhhuh     uh but they you know we had a math instructor there and when i asked him questions about calculus and so forth he was incapable of handling it you know algebra was fine but you know if you asked him about differential equations or  or something like that he didnt know what you were talking about   uhhuh   uh and when i went to take solid geometry i had to uh commute to a a larger town to Allentown Pennsylvania to take uh solid geometry an d the instructor there was was sharp enough to know or to realize that i was good at mathematical concepts but i had one lingering flaw left over from grade school and that was that i hadnt learned to add subtract multiply and divide correctly     yeah and that that does make a difference thats what like i was saying you know you get those basics behind you to start with you know get a good foundation in uh those core type courses   right   and it it will carry you a long way if you know the the concepts and the the logic and just understanding what the whats expected of you   uhhuh   really makes a lot of difference in you know what youre capable of doing so   yes all right well its been nice talking to you   yeah its been nice i hope they got what they wanted on it   well at least you have some some words they can parse there     right okay   take care   ill talk to you later maybe thanks   bye
