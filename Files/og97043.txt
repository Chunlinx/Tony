HEALTHINSPECTION SERVICE ENTITLED IMPORTATION OF PORK FROM SONORAMEXICO RIN AABackgroundOn April   the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService APHIS Department of Agriculture published in theFederal Register  Fed Reg  a proposed rule that wasintended to revise six different parts of Title  of the Code ofFederal Regulations These revisions established importationcriteria for certain animal and plant products based on the levelof disease risk in specified geographical locationsThe agency initially solicited comments for a day periodending July   It later extended the period for anadditional  daysBased on its review of the comments received APHIS has decidedthat further analysis of most parts of the proposed rule iswarranted APHIS did determine however that the amendments to theregulations allowing under certain conditions the importation offresh chilled or frozen pork from the State of Sonora Mexicointo the United States could be issued as a final rule at thistime This report addresses only that final rulei Costbenefit analysisAn economic impact analysis is included with the RegulatoryImpact Analysis at  Fed Reg  Because pork production inSonora is a relatively new development and because the UnitedStates has restricted the importation of swine and pork productsfor the last  years APHIS bases its potential impact analysis onsome assumptions regarding the level of pork production in Sonorain the future the percentage of pork production that might beprocessed in Sonora for shipment to the United States and thedemand for pork in the United States APHIS estimates that theimportation of pork from Sonora could cause US pork producers tolose from  to  cents per pound liveweight but could saveconsumers from  to  cents per pound retail weight APHISstates that these estimates are dependent on both the amount offresh pork imported and on consumer reaction to the Mexican porkproductsGAOOGCii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and On April   APHIS published its Initial RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis in the preamble to the proposed rule  FedReg  at  The analysis concluded that because the rulerelaxed the hog cholerarelated restrictions imposed on theimportation of live swine and prepared pork products from SonoraMexico the proposed rule could have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities in the United States Theinitial analysis invited comments on the potential impactsdiscussedAPHIS stated that the precise impacts of porkproduct importswere difficult to predict because of the uncertainty as to how theywould substitute for domestic andor foreign pork products APHISpoints out that commercial pork production in Sonora is relativelynew and that the United States has imposed restrictions on theimportation of swine and fresh pork products from Mexico for over years The analysis does discuss however what APHIS considersto be the anticipated impact on the US livestock sector thefarrowtofinish swine operators the livehogdealerstransporters and the swine slaughterersprimaryprocessorsOn May   APHIS published its Final Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis  Fed Reg  at  In that analysis APHISdiscusses the reason for the final rule and the legal basis for itIt also describes and estimates the number of small entitiesaffected by the rule and discusses the recordkeeping reportingand other compliance requirementsFinally it describes the alternatives considered in thedevelopment of the rule and why it rejected them and adopted therule as proposed The alternatives included not lifting the current importation restrictions for theState of Sonora and  allowing importation under either less ormore stringent mitigating conditions APHIS rejected the firstalternative because it believed scientific evidence permittedimportation of pork products from Sonora and not permitting suchimportation would be contrary to trade agreements entered into bythe United States APHIS rejected the second alternative because itbelieved that less stringent mitigating measures than the onesproposed would increase the risk of the introduction of hog cholerainto the United States and that more stringent mitigatingconditions would be unnecessarily restrictiveAgency actions relevant to sections  of the UnfundedMandates Reform Act of   USC  According to APHIS this rule contains no federal mandatesunder the regulatory provisions of Title II of the UnfundedMandates Reform Act of  that may resultPage  GAOOGCin expenditures by state local and tribal governments in theaggregate

commentperiod be extended it allowed an additional day comment periodAll comments were due by September   During the commentperiod APHIS also held four public hearings at which both oral andwritten comments were received In total  comments werereceived from representatives of state and foreign governmentsinternational economic and political organizations veterinaryassociations state departments of agriculture livestock andexporting and importing industry associations and other interestedparties Based on the number and complexity of the comments APHISdecided to issue only a small portion of
