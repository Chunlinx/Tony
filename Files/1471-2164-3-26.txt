                    Background        The enzymatic cleavage of doublestrandedds RNA        structures is an essential step in the maturation and decay        of many eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNAs Members of the        ribonuclease III superfamily of endoribonucleases    are        the primary agents of dsRNA cleavage     RNase III        orthologues are conserved in eukaryotes and in bacteria        with         Escherichia coli RNase III    as        the best characterized member         E coli RNase III is active as a        homodimer and requires a divalent metal ion preferably Mg         to hydrolyze phosphodiesters creating phosphate        hydroxyl product termini             E coli RNase III cleaves rRNA and        mRNA precursors as part of the respective maturation        pathways         E coli RNase III also initiates mRNA        degradation and participates in antisense RNA action                       Bacterial RNase III orthologues exhibit the simplest        primary structure which includes a Cterminal        dsRNAbinding motif dsRBM and an Nterminal catalytic        nuclease domain Figure  The dsRBM is present in many        other proteins that bind dsRNA     and is important        for RNase III activity in         in vitro     The catalytic        domain contains a number of conserved residues including        an  amino acid signature motif that is a distinguishing        feature of RNase III orthologues The isolated         E coli RNase III catalytic domain        which retains homodimeric behavior can cleave dsRNA        substrates under specific conditions         in vitro     The recently        reported crystal structure of the catalytic domain of         Aquifex aeolicus RNase III reveals an        extensive subunit interface with the cleft between the        subunits predicted to bind dsRNA     The two proposed        active sites are positioned at each end of the intersubunit        cleft and contain conserved residues from each subunit        Several highly conserved carboxylic acids in the active        sites bind a single divalent metal ion     and one of        these residues has been shown to be essential for catalytic        activity of         E coli RNase III            Two mammalian RNase III orthologues have been        identified and exhibit common domains as well as        apparently unique features The RNase III orthologue        Dicer Figure  plays a central role in RNA interference        RNAi by cleaving dsRNAs to  bp fragments termed small        interferingsi RNAs The siRNAs are incorporated into a        macromolecular complex which carries out degradation of        homologous RNA sequences     Dicer action serves to        inhibit viral infection and retroposon movement and also        plays a role in developmental pathways by cleaving        precursors to small regulatory RNAs reviewed in             The predicted sequence of the mouse Dicer polypeptide        exhibits a single dsRBM and tandem catalytic domains In        addition the Nterminal region contains a DExHDEAH RNA        helicase motif and a PAZ PinwheelArgonautZwille domain        which is also present in other proteins involved in RNAi                    The second mammalian RNase III orthologue also exhibits        a single Cterminal dsRBM and tandem catalytic domains but        is otherwise structurally distinct from Dicer as it lacks        the helicase and PAZ domains Figure              Preliminary evidence indicates that this RNase III        orthologue participates in rRNA maturation Thus a        reduction in human RNase III levels         in vivo causes the accumulation of        specific rRNA processing intermediates     Consistent        with this functional role human RNase III localizes to the        nucleolus in a cellcycledependent manner     A        truncated form of human RNase III has been purified and        shown to cleave dsRNA         in vitro     However little        else is known of the functional roles or the mechanistic        features of this enzyme We report here i the        characteristics of the cDNA sequence and predicted        polypeptide of mouse RNase III ii demonstrate transcript        expression patterns and iii report the chromosomal        locations of the mouse and human RNase III genes                    Results and Discussion                  Features of the mouse RNase III cDNA          sequence          The mouse RNase III cDNA structure was determined by          sequence analysis of individual cDNA clones see          Materials and Methods whose sequences relative to the          fulllength sequence are shown in Figure  The length of          the mouse RNase III cDNA is  nt see Additional File           and the predicted initiation codon is at position           This prediction is based on the occurrence of three          inframe stop codons upstream of the indicated ATG          within the  nt untranslated region UTR see          Additional File  It is not firmly established if the          reported  end nucleotide corresponds to the true  end          of the mRNA However several independent partial cDNA          clones see Figure  contain the same  nucleotide          There is no significant sequence similarity of the mouse          UTR with that of human RNase III  nt The UTR          is  nt in size and contains a consensus          polyadenylation signal AAUAAA  nucleotides from the          polyA tail The UTR exhibits  identity with the          human UTR  nt over a  nt region corresponding          to positions  of the mouse UTR and positions           of the human UTR A search of the NCBI mouse          EST database yielded five independent clones which          exhibit  percent sequence identity with the UTR          data not shown The predicted UTR of the mouse RNase          III mRNA and that of the rat RNase III mRNA share           nucleotide identity and have the same lengths data not          shown          Additional File           Mouse RNase III cDNA and amino acid sequences The          proposed translational initiation codon and the

the predicted RNase III          polypeptide                      The dsRBM and catalytic domains            Conceptual translation of the mouse RNase III cDNA            using the AUG at position  as the initiation codon            yields a polypeptide of  amino acids with a            predicted molecular mass of  kDa and a pI of             The polypeptide contains a single dsRBM and two RNase            III catalytic domain elements see Additional File             The RNase III domain ie the two catalytic domains            and dsRBM of the mouse and human sequences exhibit             amino acid identity and  nucleotide sequence            identity Figure provides an alignment of the RNase            III domains of the mouse human             Drosophila and             C elegans RNase III orthologues            The latter two sequences also exhibit strong            conservation of sequence over the entire length of the            region Note also that             Drosophila RNase III has a            serinerich Cterminal extension     There are two            catalytic domain signature sequences present in these            orthologues The single signature sequence of bacterial            RNase III orthologues not only provides residues            essential for catalysis but contributes to the subunit            interface     It is therefore likely that mouse            RNase III is active as a homodimer If so the            holoenzyme may contain four active sites                                The Prolinerich region            A prolinerich region PRR is present in the            Nterminal portion of the polypeptide see Additional            File  Of the  prolines occurring in the PRR              are conserved in the corresponding region of            human RNase III Repetitive proline sequences tend to            adopt a polyproline II PPII helix consisting of an            extended structure with three residues per turn A            proline at every third position serves to stabilize the            structure     and also participates in hydrogen            bonds as well as in hydrophobic interactions                The presence of a PRR in mouse RNase III suggests            proteinprotein interactions important for function            PRRmediated interactions are relatively weak and            reversible and occur with the PPII helix in the            Cterminal domain of RNA polymerase II during            transcription initiation and elongation                                    The ArginineSerine RS domain            The mouse RNase III polypeptide contains an RS            domain adjacent to the PRR see Additional File  The             positions containing the RSSR dipeptide motif are            shared between the mouse and human polypeptides with            an overall  sequence identity with the human            sequence containing an additional SR dipeptide RS            domains participate in proteinprotein interactions            and RS domaincontaining proteins play essential roles            in constitutive or alternative mRNA splicing                  RS proteins bind RNA             via an RNA recognition motif            RRM allowing subsequent recruitment of splicing            components             via RS domain interactions The            presence of this domain in mouse RNase III suggests            similar proteinprotein interactions involved in RNA            maturation which may be functionally associated with            components of the RNA splicing and transport            machinery                                Potential sites of posttranslational            modification            Psort analysis of the predicted mouse RNase III            amino acid sequence indicates three potential nuclear            localization signals positioned at residues              and  see Additional File  A Prosite scan            identified multiple potential phosphorylation sites for            protein kinase C casein kinase II and cAMPdependent            protein kinase data not shown Some of these signals            may be involved in protein localization as it has been            shown that human RNase III localizes to the nucleolus            during the cell cycle S phase                                        Mouse RNase III transcript expression          patterns          The transcript expression patterns were analyzed by          RTPCR and by northern blot Figures AB The analyses          show that the mouse RNase III transcript is expressed in          all adult organs examined as well as in the E          midgestation embryo the extraembryonic yolk sac and the          placenta Northern analysis Figure B reveals a          transcript size of  kb which is consistent with the          predicted length of the cDNA including a polyA tail          The northern analysis also reveals that the transcript is          heavily expressed in brain tissue and perhaps also heart          tissue while only lightly expressed in skeletal muscle          The reasons for the differential levels of expression          is unclear but it is of interest to note that the mouse          Dicer transcript is also prominently expressed in brain          and heart tissue while only lightly expressed in          skeletal muscle     Interestingly an additional          species  kb is present in testis Figure B which          may represent an alternatively processed form of the          transcript This species is not seen in the testis lane          of the RTPCR analysis since the PCR primers are          targeted to the UTR which is most likely the same for          the two transcripts                          Chromosomal locations of the mouse and human          ribonuclease III genes          The mouse RNase III gene was mapped using fluorescent           in situ hybridization FISH          employing a partial cDNA clone as probe The gene is          located in the proximal segment region B of chromosome           Figure A The human ribonuclease III gene was          mapped to chromosome pp Figure B a region that          is syntenic to mouse chromosome B                            Conclusions        Sequence database searches and other studies    have        revealed only two RNase III orthologues Dicer and RNase        III in the mouse and human genomes However the presence        of an additional RNase IIIspecific transcript in at least        one tissue indicates the possibility of alternative forms        of RNase III The broad expression pattern suggests a        conserved cellular function for mouse RNase III In this        regard sequence database searches and a southern zoo        blot data not shown indicate significant conservation of        the RNase III gene among many other vertebrates including        rat rabbit and cow However functional roles for        mammalian RNase III have yet to be fully defined A role in        rRNA maturation is suggested by the observation that        antisense oligodeoxynucleotidemediated reduction in human        RNase III levels also causes a decrease in the amount of         S rRNA and a concomitant increase in the  S precursor            A similar defect in rRNA maturation is seen upon        U snoRNA depletion in         Xenopus oocytes     As U snoRNA        participates in rRNA maturation it is possible that an        RNase IIIdependent step also involves U snoRNA        Alternatively a role for RNase III in the maturation of U        snoRNA as well as other snoRNAs is a possibility In this        regard the         S cerevisiae RNase III orthologue        Rntp not only cleaves the  S rRNA precursor within the        ETS       but also processes snoRNA and snRNA        precursors        Further biochemical studies        are required to identify the RNA targets for mammalian        RNase III and to determine its involvement in RNA        maturation pathways                    Methods

EST database using           E coli RNase III as query          sequence We carried out a similar search against the          NCBI mouse EST database using the           Drosophila and human RNase III
