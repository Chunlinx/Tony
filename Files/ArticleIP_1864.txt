                                 Oscar Wilde            Even Oscar Wilde perhapsthe greatest of all selfpromoters couldnt fault the hype job being done forhim these days The biopic Wilde opened in New York last week Two weeksago The Judas Kiss  a play about Wildes doomed love affair with LordAlfred Douglas debuted on Broadway starring Liam Neeson as Wilde            This isthe Wildean moment In the last year bookstores have been glutted withmassmarket issue Oscar Wildes Guide to Modern Living  Wilde theIrishman  The Oscar Wilde Reader  Andre and Oscar  OscarWilde by his son Vyvyan Holland and The Wilde Album by hisgrandson Merlin Holland Besides The Judas Kiss  Wildes life is thesubject of three other major new plays several oneman shows and an opera Asfor Wildes own work there is the usual spate of theatrical productions aswell as at least four planned films of his plays and novel            Normally this kind of wretched historical excess egWretched Titanic Excess should be deplored and stifled But in OscarWilde the celebrity culture has finally found a subject worthy of thissuperfluity someone complicated and challenging enough to endure the excessand more Wilde once wrote I was a man who stood in symbolic relation to theart and culture of my age He is now a man who stands in symbolic relation tothe art and culture of our age            For mostof this century Wilde was simply a cartoon figure a bonmoting smart aleckI can resist everything except temptation Ha ha ha There is only one thingin the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talkedabout How droll Oscar how very droll Wilde said that he summed up  allexistence in an epigram And that is exactly how he has been perceivedas thecool cruel master of aphorism His plays were produced and his quips wereplagiarized but he himself remained a onedimensional figure in the popularculture            That has changed during the last decade andespecially the last few years The revival ignores the art for the sake of theman recognizing that Wilde himself is at least as interesting as hisoneliners Requisite quote I put my genius into my life I have put only mytalent into my works            So why isthe man suddenly so popular One reason is that this is an age of memoirsWilde who selfconsciously made his own life a work of art is an evocativesymbol for selfinvolved literature Literary nostalgia also explains theobsession with him Between  and  he endured three trials was jailedfor two years published his most famous poem and died The  thanniversary of each event has been or will be much commemorated Wildescombination of stylishness and tragedy lends itself perfectly to overcostumedoverwrought MerchantIvorystyle drama            But there are two more important reasons why this is aWilde time homosexuality and celebrity The rise of gay studies and increasingacceptance of gay themes in popular culture have made a Wilde resurgenceinevitable This decade not his is the gay s Wildes homosexuality wasignored for decades then glossed over When he was first claimed as a gay icona generation ago he was explained too simply as a martyr A vicious Britishsociety destroyed him because it was too intolerant to accepthomosexuality            The sWilde provokes because he is not simple at all In an era obsessed by identitysexuality and ambiguity Wilde is one of the most puzzling cases His liferaises very modern questions about what homosexuality is and how much sexualityshould define identity Wilde is the urhomosexual as scholars put it yethe never saw himself as homosexual In fact it is only after his trialsandpartly because of his trialsthat people began to be classified ashomosexual and heterosexual For more on Wildes enduring role in shapinggay identity click  Wilde was not only not explicitly gay he washappily married and the father of two children He had sex with meninfrequently and only late in life To appreciate the complexity of hissexuality consider the current crop of Wilde plays The Judas Kissfocuses on his love affair with a man Gross Indecency focuses on hisdenials of his love affairs with men and The Secret Fall of ConstanceWilde focuses on his love affair with a woman            Often called the first person famous for beingfamous Wilde foreshadowed our modern celebrity obsession At a time whenrealism and authenticity were in vogue his life was a stylized performancedesigned to grab attention In the early s before he had written anythingworth mentioning he made his name as Londons great young aesthete He moonedaround the city carrying flowers and threw himself at the feet of actressesGilbert and Sullivan parodied him in Patience  He then got himself senton an American lecture tour to drum up publicity for Patience s USproduction He wore outrageous clothes and quipped his way across the StatesOn arrival in New York I have nothing to declare except my genius Hislectures about interior decorating were mobbed He also milked his famebrilliantly after hed achieved commercial success He is undoubtedly the onlycanonical writer to endorse Madame Fontaines Bosom Beautifier abreastenlarging cream            Just ashis rise prefigured modern ideas about celebrity so also did his fall Wildewas the first massmedia celebrity criminal The English gutter press whichwas just developing a wide audience whipped up public hatred toward him overhis sex crimes and made him a pariah Wilde scholars note his sex scandal iscuriously evocative of Clintons A spectacular public figure denies sexualindiscretion in the face of overwhelming evidence rather than riskchallenging conventional morality            One thing is missing from the revival subversivenessWilde himself was endlessly transgressive always finding a new way to jabVictorian complacency He made vicious fun of the English bourgeoisie in playssuch as The Importance of Being Earnest  The same bourgeoisie packedLondon houses and made him a fortune without realizing the joke was on themIts impossible today to realize how shocking The Picture of Dorian Graywas to s readers And even Wildes decision to endure prison rather thanflee was a rebuke to Englands inhumanity            But there is very littlewildness in todays Wilde The books plays and movie are extremely couthextremely respectable Even a decade ago a movie about Wilde and his gayaffair would have been considered remarkable Today its a clich At the endof the  th century gross indecency could not even be describedin court Today you can throw it on the screen and no one even notices Thechallenge for Wilde lovers at the end of the  th century is thisFind a way to appall
