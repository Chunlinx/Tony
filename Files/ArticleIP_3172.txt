                                 How to Delight With Statistics            Etymology the study of word origins often interests people otherwiseuninterested in language The reason surely is that etymology is tethered toordinary life in ways that are easy to grasp Anyone can enjoy knowing how a bill came to be called a sawbuck the Roman numeral X that appeared onearly notes reminded people of the wooden sawbuck used in carpentry or howthe word robot came into English it comes from the Czech word robotameaning drudgery and was part of the title of a widely popular  Czechplay or how the IndoEuropean root for beech tree bhago gave us theword book Germanic tribes used beech staves to carve runes on We likeetymologies because they tell us stories            There would be no telling of stories at all of coursewithout grammar But people uninterested in language issues are content toremain uninterested in grammar Grammar the genetic blueprint of meaningoperates at a level of abstraction Nouns and verbs and other parts of speechare considered not as familiar individuals but as members of different speciesTheir interactions are considered as elements of an ecosystem Grammar is hardto visualize and it is harder to enjoy            Or atleast it was until a man named Edward R Tufte began to publish his work aboutthe display of information in the early s Tufte has produced three booksthat make it possible to see the dynamics of linguistic grammar in abrilliantly synesthetic waybooks that succeed in this task by not havinggrammar as their ostensible subject at all            Edward Tufte is a professor at Yale who teachescourses in statistics and information design In  he produced an elegantbook with the unprepossessing title The Visual Display of QuantitativeInformation  which both explained and demonstrated certain rules forpresenting numerical data in a graphically arresting manner This tour deforcewritten designed and published by Tufte himselfwas immediatelyrecognized as a classic by data wonks and makers of fine books alike It hasnever been out of print            In hisanalysis of such improbably compelling genres as railroad schedules and balancesheets chemical symbols and weather summaries Tufte reprinted numerousgraphic displays that epitomized the statistical draughtsmans conceptual artIn the French engineer Charles Joseph Minards  encapsulation of NapoleonsRussian campaign for example a compact space revealed the diminishing size ofthe army its daytoday geographical location the direction of its route thepassage of time and the gradual drop in the temperature It is a map Tuftenoted that illustrates how multivariate complexity can be subtly integratedinto graphical architecture integrated so gently and unobtrusively thatviewers are hardly aware that they are looking into a world of four or fivedimensions            Tufte did not explicitly spell out his ultimate intentionsin that first volume of his trilogy but it has turned out that the wholeseries has been produced according to a precise schemaas he now indicates inthe introduction to Visual Explanations  which was just published by hiscompany  The Visual Display of Quantitative Information had beendevoted to pictures of numbers he explainshow to depict data and enforcestatistical honesty whether the subject is traffic deaths or the distributionof galaxies The second book in the series Envisioning Information was about pictures of nounsthat is about representational ratherthan numerical reality the depiction of cartographic information diagramsand signage Whats the best way to show sunspot activity for example or theworking of a subway system The third book Visual Explanations  isabout pictures of verbsthat is about displays that illustrate dynamicprocesses and can therefore function as explanatory narratives            These explanatory narratives these pictures ofverbs can offer remarkable insight when properly conceived Tuftes inclusionof John Snows famous map of the  cholera epidemic in London is a case inpoint Snows streetbystreet tracking of cholera deaths pointed unmistakablyto the culpritthe water coming out of the Broad Street pump The pump handlewas removed at once and the epidemic ceased            Incontrast these verb pictures can also smother insight when illconceivedaswere the charts prepared by the manufacturer Morton Thiokol to illustrate thebehavior in cold weather of the Orings on the space shuttle Challenger Thesecharts which failed to convince NASA officials not to launch the shuttle wereconfusingdense with invitations to secondguess even though crucialinformation that would have delayed the launch was undeniably theresomewhere The Oring itself Tufte makes clear was not the only designelement whose malfunction contributed to the Challenger tragedy Afterpresenting his own version of what the charts should have looked likeTufte writes There are right ways and wrong ways to show data there aredisplays that reveal truth and displays that do not            What makes a visual display effective Tufte lays out rulesabout such things as density and emphasis chartjunk and clutter layering andhierarchy color and parallelismall of which have synesthetic grammaticalanalogs in writing Hierarchy for instance is the building of largestructures out of small ones be they nautical charts out of soundings orsentences out of morphemes Aware of the parallels between visual grammar andwritten grammar Tufte frequently makes direct comparisons that enhance onesunderstanding of each In one place he shows how the rhetorical shape of apassage in Gibbons Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire  with itspaired images and a ribbing of parallel verbs finds a visual counterpoint inworks of landscape design and even dance notation To get the full picture soto speak youll have to look at the book yourself An entire chapter isdevoted to the concept of smallest effective difference showing howdistinctions that are subtle but clear two light colors on a map say can befar more powerful visually than any amount of heavyhanded contrastas usefula lesson in writing as it is in graphic design            What one does not expect in a book of thiskinda book that is technical even as it is beautifulis that the author willbe not just fastidious but also an evocative and wonderfully quirky writerTufte is all of these In his discussion of one historic workJean Buchonscomparison of American rivers in his  Atlas Geographique Tuftenotes how the depictions of the Mississippi and the Amazon must curl around thepage since theres no room to show them stretched out like the other riversActually what Tufte says is The two rivers meander boustrophedonicallyaround a tight frame That word boustrophedon describes writing that goes fromleft to right on the first line then right to left on the second then left toright on the third and so on it comes from a Greek word describing theturning in a field of an ox and plow Tufte too likes his etymologies
