                    Background        Major histocompatibility complex class II molecules        MHCII are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that        bind antigenic peptides and present such peptides to CD T        cells Although MHCII are not expressed by the vast        majority of studied mouse and human tumors CD T        lymphocytes specific to MHCIIrestricted tumor antigens        have been found in various cancers     Those        lymphocytes are believed to be generated         in vivo following the recognition of        MHCIItumor peptide complexes expressed by host antigen        presenting cells and can cause regression of MHCIInegative        tumors indirectly via secretion of cytokines such as IL        or IFNg     The released cytokines can recruit and        activate cytotoxic CD T lymphocytes andor accessory        cells eosinophills macrophages which further mediate        tumor destruction        It has been recently appreciated that sufficient        concentrations of secreted IFNg may also induce susceptible        tumors to express the MHCII molecules potentially leading        to increased direct contact with CD T cells     Even        though some reports indicate that tumor sensitivity to IFNg        is not required to elicit tumor regression     it is        conceivable that the IFNginduced MHCII expression on tumor        cells may boost the effector phase of antitumor responses        through additional cytokine release or direct tumor        eradication by CD T cells Indeed the CD T cells that        directly destroy MHCIIpositive tumors were identified            In the clinic the expression of MHCII on colorectal        carcinomas is correlated with more favourable prognosis            Adoptive transfer studies show that         ex vivo activated CD T cells are        able to recognize and to eliminate MHCIIpositive tumors        either by themselves    or in cooperation with CD T        cells     It has been also demonstrated that the        increased MHCII expression on tumor cells and macrophages        following treatment with IFNg         in vivo was associated with enhanced        efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in a mouse model of        metastatic sarcoma            Unfortunately the induction of MHCII on tumor cells by        IFNg         in vivo is difficult     In        fact the reported inducible tumors seem to be limited to        freshly transplanted tumor cells     or malignant        cells present in the ascitic fluid     Many tumors do        not express MHCII after treatment with recombinant IFNg         in vitro either            Given the role that MHCII may play in tumor immunity        further attempts to restore inducibility in IFNgresistant        tumors appear to be warranted In this regard several        substances have recently been tested using         in vitro models of noninducible tumor        cell lines It was reported that some agents eg histone        deacetylase inhibitors    or DNA methylation inhibitors            can rescue the IFNg inducibility of MHCII in        cultured tumor cells        In this study we explored whether the effect can be        achieved by yet another category of modulators the PKC        agonists chosen because PKC has been shown to function as        an upstream regulator of the MAPK pathway    that is        involved in both IFNg signal transduction    and        regulation of gene expression            Specifically the influence of a potent PKC activator        PMA and clinically tested drug Bryostatin  on the        IFNginduced MHCII expression in several IFNgresistant        tumor cell lines was examined Previously PMA was shown to        augment IFNgmediated MHCII expression in MHCIIinducible        tumor cell lines      Here we report that the        presence of PMA in tissue culture restores IFNgdependent        MHCII expression in the poorlyresponding LS colon        carcinoma cell line but fails to produce this effect in two        other IFNgresistant cell lines MSTOH mesothelioma and        HepG hepatocellular carcinoma We also show that the        IFNgdependent MHCII expression in LS cell line can be        rescued by clinically acceptable concentrations of        Bryostatin                     Results                  Induction of MHCII molecules by IFNg in four          different tumor cell lines          We first compared the induction of MHCII molecules in          SW LS MSTOH and HepG tumor cells in          response to different concentrations of IFNg MHCII          antigens were initially undetectable in all cell lines          tested Incubation with as little as  IUml IFNg          induced a fold increase of MHCIIspecific fluorescence          in SW colon carcinoma cell line In contrast LS          demonstrated only weak  to fold increases in          level of MHCII and remained weakly inducible even when          concentration of IFNg was increased to  IUml Figure           MSTOH mesothelioma cell line also showed a weak          induction of MHCII in response to IFNg and HepG          hepatocellular carcinoma was completely noninducible          data not shown          It should be noted however that we observed a small          population of LS cells about  of all cells          that demonstrated a modest  to fold increase in          MHCIIspecific fluorescence after incubation with            IUml IFNg data not shown This could suggest that a          small subset of LS cells might acquire an inducible          phenotype at a certain stage of cell differentiation                          PMA rescues IFNg inducibility of MHCII in low          responding LS colon carcinoma cell line          We next attempted to restore IFNg inducibility of          MHCII in poorly responding tumor cell lines by adding PKC          agonist PMA into culture medium containing variable          concentrations of IFNg PMA did not improve IFNg          inducibility of MHCII in MSTOH and HepG cell lines          data not shown The LS cells on the other hand          demonstrated a robust increase in MHCII expression          The magnitude of response of LS cells varied          greatly from experiment to experiment depending not only          on concentration of IFNg but also on concentration of          PMA and even on type of the PMA agent DMSO or ethanol          Therefore the experiments were arranged in a factorial          design for accurate analysis of possible interactive          effects For each combination of treatments a letter          alphanumeric code was assigned Table  Four dose          levels of IFNg combined with  dose levels of PMA and           dose levels of ethanol generated  groups and the design          was replicated  times          The results demonstrated a substantial increase in          MHCII expression in LS cell line following combined          incubation with PMA and IFNg Figure  Twofactor          analysis of variance revealed that the magnitude of MHCII          induction in LS cells was almost totally determined          by concentration of IFNg F              P    Higher          response to IFNg tended to be associated with higher          concentration of PMA in some experiments but the overall          effect of PMA did not reach a commonly accepted level of          significance F              P   Interestingly          the effect of PMA did reach significance in cultures          supplemented with  mM ethanol F              P   groups bb          bb bb No interaction effect between PMA and          IFNg was found F              P            Since there were no factor interactions several          singlefactor groups were added and data were          reanalysed by using oneway ANOVA Different          combinations of PMA and IFNg were compared to the highest          dose of IFNg used without PMA group a or b          Multiple comparisons were made using Tukeys HSD test and          Scheffes test the latter test is more conservative          Results demonstrate that the expression level of MHCII          reached a plateau at  IUml IFNg in the presence of            ngml PMA and  mM ethanol Further increases in          concentration of IFNg to  IUml did not result in          statistically significant increases of MHCII expression          Figure B          Figure also demonstrates that ethanol was totally          inactive alone compare group a vs b but it          significantly improved the MHCII induction in the          presence of PMA Because of variation between          experiments the effect of EtOH could not be seen clearly          in Figure  For that reason pairwise comparisons were          made between cell cultures incubated either with PMA or          with a combination of PMA and EtOH Specifically group          a was compared to group b etc Data shown in Figure          confirm that EtOH significantly improved PMApotentiated          response to IFNg Linear regression analysis also          revealed that the effect of ethanol was more pronounced          at  IUml IFNg          Taken together the above results showed a strong          potentiating effect of PMA on IFNginduced HLADR          expression in LS cell line and no changes in two          other poorly inducible cell lines                          Expression levels of IFNg receptors in four          different tumor cell lines do not change following          incubation with PMA          It has been previously shown that potentiating effect          of phorbol esters on IFNgdependent MHCII induction in          THP monocytic cell line was associated with the          increase in synthesis of IFNg receptors     For that          reason we questioned whether PMA could produce similar          changes in LS colon carcinoma cells We compared the          expression of alpha and beta chains of IFNg receptor          IFNgR and IFNgR in LS carcinoma and three other          tumor cell lines before and after  hr incubation with           ngml PMA and  mM ethanol Results plotted in          Figure  show that untreated and PMAtreated tumor cells          express about the same levels of IFNgR and IFNgR          Moreover the level of IFNgR in HepG cells actually          drops after exposure to PMA Therefore we conclude that          it is unlikely that PMA action in LS carcinoma is          mediated through increased synthesis of IFNg          receptors                          Expression of the retinoblastoma protein is not          lost in LS MSTOH and HepG cell lines          A substantial percentage of human tumors lose the          expression of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein          Rb important as a necessary condition for          IFNgmediated induction of MHCII     Therefore we          wished to determine whether the poor IFNg inducibility of          MHCII in LS MSTOH and HepG cell lines could be          explained by the loss of Rb Immunofluorescent staining          with a Rbspecific mAb clone G demonstrated that          all cell lines tested expressed Rb Figure           A closer look at Figure reveals that the  cell lines          can be ranked according to their Rb contents in the          following order SW  LS  MSTOH           HepG This ranking would be valid only if fluorescence          intensity correlates closely with the absolute contents          of Rb protein per cell However this may not always be          the case For example the number of epitopes recognized          by G mAb may be reduced if tumor cells express viral          oncoproteins that bind and inactivate Rb              It is important to note that certain mutations greatly          reduce transport of newly synthesized Rb molecules into          the nucleus where Rb performs its function     As          the flow cytometry protocol does not allow us to          discriminate between cytoplasmic and nuclear staining          the question about the presence of functional Rb protein          in the examined cell lines remains open                          Effect of protein kinase inhibitors on          physiological and PMApotentiated response to IFNg          The discovery of novel nonkinase phorbol ester          receptors challenges the use of phorbol esters as          selective PKC activators     Therefore we were          interested in whether a member of the PKC family mediated          the effect of PMA in LS cells or whether some other          proteins could also be involved Specifically we          investigated whether two inhibitors staurosporine and GF          X could abrogate PMApotentiated response of          LS cells to IFNg Staurosporine is a widespectrum          kinase inhibitor and its specificity for PKC isoforms is          limited to the  nanomolar range In the  nM          range staurosporine inhibits more than  different          kinases              Data shown in Figure demonstrate that staurosporine          caused about a  inhibition of PMApotentiated response          in LS cells at a concentration of  nM Complete          inhibition occurred at  nM A much higher          concentration of GF X was required to completely          suppress PMApotentiated response in LS cells          Physiological IFNg response in SW colon carcinoma          cells was resistant to inhibition with  M GF X          and was suppressed only when staurosporine concentration          was increased to  M We conclude that the PMA effect in          LS cell line is most likely mediated by a PKC          isoenzyme but other protein kinases that are sensitive to          inhibition with  M GF X                          Bryostatin  rescues IFNg inducibility of MHCII in          LS colon carcinoma cells          To evaluate potential clinical implications of our          findings we asked whether the IFNgdependent MHCII          expression in LS cells could be restored by          clinically achievable concentrations of PKC agonists          Bryostatin  is a potent PKC activator that has undergone          extensive clinical testing for the treatment of          hematological malignancies and solid tumors              Animal studies show that the concentration of Bryostatin           in various tissues after a single intraveneous          injection stays in a range of  ngg for a period of          more than  hr              Data plotted in Figure  demonstrate that  ngml          Bryostatin added into the culture medium containing            IUml IFNg induced a  to fold increase in          levels of MHCII expression The potentiating effect of          Bryostatin first becomes noticeable at  ngml and then          reaches a plateau at  ngml At low concentration          of IFNg  IUml the effect of Bryostatin was          comparable to that of PMA At a higher concentration of          IFNg  IUml however PMA was much more effective          This may suggest that either the two PKC activators act          through different isoforms of PKC or PMA also activates          enzymes outside the PKC family such as MAPK              Whatever the mechanism it appears possible to restore          the IFNgdependent MHCII expression in LS cell line          by clinically acceptable concentrations of Bryostatin                                      Discussion        The effect of PKC activators PMA and Bryostatin  on        IFNg inducibility of MHCII in three resistant tumor cell        lines of different histological origin has been examined        We found that PKC activators rescued high levels of MHCII        expression in colon carcinoma cells and failed to do so in        mesothelioma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells A poor        response of tumor cells to IFNg is in agreement with        previous observations that many tumors acquire such        resistance upon malignant transformation possibly        important as a mechanism of tumor escape from immune        surveillance     The nature of this phenomenon is        complex and multiple defects that can prevent IFNg        responses in tumor lines have been described        Most frequently poor MHCII inducibility in response to        IFNg has been attributed to alterations in the IFNg        signalling pathway and epigenetic silencing of gene        expression reviewed in Ref     The cascade of IFNg        signalling events leading to transcription activation of        MHCII genes has been characterized in great detail        reviewed in Ref     Binding of IFNg to its receptor        results in JAKmediated phosphorylation of STAT on        Tyrosine  In addition IFNg interaction with the        receptor leads to pMAPKmediated phosphorylation of STAT        on Serine      The phosphorylated STAT dimerizes        and translocates into the nucleus where it activates        transcription of several other factors including CIITA            Although the results of this study do not allow us to        describe the exact mechanism of PMA involvement in IFNg        signalling in LS cell at least two nonmutually        exclusive scenarios can be hypothesized         PMA could act through the JAKSTAT signalling        pathway It has been established that to achieve its        maximal transcriptional activity STAT must be        phosphorylated on both Tyr and Ser            Phosphorylation of STAT on Ser occurs in response to        LPS UV irradiation and other agents that activate the        pMAPK pathway     As phorbol esters can also        stimulate the MAPK cascade through activation of PKC            it is tempting to speculate that combined treatment of        cells with PMA and IFNg could increase the pool of STAT        molecules phosphorylated on both Tyr and Ser This        effect is most likely mediated by PKCdelta isoenzyme as        this particular PKC isoform appears to be critical for        phosphorylation of STAT on Ser and activation of        pMAPK             Alternatively PMA treatment could initiate a cascade        of protein phosphorylation leading to the increase in        transcriptional activity of chromatin at the type IV        promoter of CIITA andor promoter of MHCII genes        Expression of many genes can be modified by treatment with        agents acting at the level of enzymes and nuclear receptors        that modify transcriptional activity of chromatin Thus        histone deacetylase inhibitors  Butyrate and Trichostatin        A  can rescue MHCIIinducibility in bladder carcinoma        cells    and restore constitutive MHCII expression in        plasmacytoma cells     In addition to acetylation        transcriptional activity of chromatin is also regulated        through phosphorylation reviewed in Ref     It has        been shown that treatment of cells with phorbol esters        leads to accumulation of phosphorylated H histones            Therefore it seems possible that in LS cells PMA        could enhance transcriptional activity of chromatin at        promoters of MHCII andor CIITA genes This possibility        appears particularly important since the specific lack of        CIITA inducibility was cited as the most common basis for        lack of IFNginduced MHCII expression among Rbpositive        human tumor lines             Another reported mechanism of IFNg resistance in tumor        cells is associated with downregulation of IFNgreceptors            The relevance of this mechanism to MHCII        inducibility was recently supported by the evidence that        PMA is able to enhance IFNgdependent MHCII expression in        THP human leukemia cells through the upregulation of        IFNg receptors     In our experiments however the        incubation of LS cells with PMA and ethanol did not        lead to any changes in IFNgR expression as determined by        flow cytometry Figure  Therefore it is unlikely that        upregulated IFNgR contributed to the phenomena reported        here It should be emphasized that we determined the        expression of both IFNgR and IFNgR receptor subunits        since it has been shown that in certain experimental        systems an IFNg resistance was due to a lack of cellular        expression of IFNgR chain alone            We also found that the effect of PMA in LS cells can        be significantly augmented by coincubation with  mM        ethanol In certain types of tissues ethanol has been        shown to induce membrane translocation of PKC isoforms        through activation of phospholipase A and release of        diacylglycerol     This mechanism however does not        appear to be significant in our case as ethanol without PMA        failed to potentiate IFNginduced MHCII expression in        LS cells Alternatively ethanol can modulate the        activity of mitogen and stressactivated kinase cascades        It has been shown that hepatocytes exposed to  mM        ethanol for  hr have a higher activity of pMAPK induced        by EGF treatment     If in our experiments PMA did act        through Ser phosphorylation of STAT the potentiating        effect of ethanol can possibly be explained by its ability        to stimulate the MAPK kinase cascade        It remains to be determined whether the restoration of        IFNginduced MHCII expression by PMA is unique to LS        cells A potentiating effect of PMA has been reported in        thyroid carcinoma cells    but in contrast to LS        cells normal IFNg response in those cells was only        partially lost as a result of malignant transformation        Whether or not this phenomenon may be reproduced with other        IFNgresistant colon carcinoma cell lines is of particular        interest since colonic epithelium is physiologically        exposed to PKC activators that enhance cytokine signalling        in enterocytes during inflammatory responses within the        intestinal mucosa            It is well established that besides the MHCII        molecules IFNg can induce susceptible tumors to upregulate        the expression of MHC class I antigens     tumor        associated antigens     costimulatory molecules            and heat shock proteins     In addition IFNg may        have antimetabolic and antiproliferative influence on        certain types of tumor cells     It has also been        suggested that IFNg may cause responding tumor cells to        secrete angiogenesis inhibitors     As it is not known        which of those IFNg effects are missing or restored by PMA        in LS cells a thorough evaluation of the possible        clinical implications of our         in vitro findings is quite difficult        However if clinically tested PKC agonists such as        Bryostatin  are able to rescue the IFNginduced MHCII        expression within the tumor bed it might be appropriate to        consider them for trials to improve the clinical efficacy        of cancer immunotherapy                    Conclusions        In this study we showed that IFNginducibility of MHCII        antigens in weakly inducible LS colorectal carcinoma        cell line can be rescued by concomitant incubation with PKC        agonists Bryostatin  may be considered for further        investigation of IFNgdependent MHCII induction in        resistant tumors         in vivo                     Materials and Methods                  Cell lines          Human tumor

HEPES  fetal calf          serum  mM Lglutamine and  gml Tobramycin When          cells were in exponential growth phase they were removed          from plastic by trypsinization and seeded into the wells          of well trays  cm well at a concentration of           to  cells   ml  well When cell cultures reached           confluency usually on the next day growth          medium was replaced with  ml of fresh medium containing          variable concentrations of IFNg Ten minutes later          another  ml of medium containing variable concentrations          of PMA were added into the wells and the incubation          continued for the next  hr Experiments involving          protein kinase inhibitors were performed in a similar          way except that Staurosporine and GF X were added          first and IFNg or PMA plus IFNg were added  hr later          Staurosporine and GF X were not washed away so the          cells were incubated with IFNgPMA in the constant          presence of inhibitors In a first group of experiments          stock solution of PMA was prepared at  mgml in ethanol          and the final concentration of ethanol in culture medium          was adjusted to  lml  mM In all subsequent          experiments stock solution of PMA was prepared at           mgml in DMSO and the final concentration of DMSO in          culture medium was adjusted to  lml                          Immunofluorescent staining of cell surface          antigens          Cellular monolayers were rinsed  times with          CaMgfree PBS and incubated for  min at C in Hanks          balanced salt solution containing  trypsin  mM          EDTA and  mM HEPES Detached cells were washed twice          with staining buffer PBS containing  FCS  sodium          azide and  mM HEPES pH  and stained as described          previously     Briefly cells were transferred into          the wells of roundbottom well plates the plates were          centrifuged at  g for  seconds the supernatant          removed by shaking and the cell pellets resuspended in           l of staining buffer containing saturating          concentration of antiMHCIIFITC After min incubation

Immediately before analysis  gml propidium          iodide was added to exclude dead cells Matching isotype          control mAb IgGaFITC was used at the same           gwell or a higher  gwell concentration as the          specific antibody The lack of staining of controls          demonstrated that nonspecific binding of IgGaFITC to          PInegative cells was negligible in all experimental          groups Fig BEH Staining for cell surface IFNg          receptors was performed similarly except that cells were          first incubated with biotinconjugated mAbs specific or          isotypematched for  min washed  times and then          stained with SAAlf Staining of fresh and          trypsintreated monocytes demonstrated that epitopes          recognized by the mAbs against MHCII IFNgR and IFNgR          were resistant to  min digestion with           trypsin                          Immunofluorescent staining of cytoplasmic          antigens          Cytoplasmic IFNgR and IFNgR receptor subunits were          detected by using a procedure described for intracellular          cytokine staining     Briefly cells were fixed in          icecold  formaldehyde for  min washed  times          permeabilized in staining buffer containing  saponin          for  min at C incubated with biotinconjugated mAbs          specific or isotypematched for  min washed  times          incubated with SAPE and washed again saponin was          present in staining buffer at all times After the final          wash cells were resuspended in buffer without saponin          and kept on ice until analysis Monocytes expressing high          levels of IFNgR and IFNgR receptor subunits served as a          positive control Expression levels of Rb protein was          measured

mode and          fluorescence of PIstained DNA was collected on the FL          detector  nm log mode Incubation of tumor          cells with PMA or staurosporine dramatically increased          celltocell adherence and number of cell clumps To deal          with this problem the FL detector    nm linear          mode was used to measure area and width of electronic          pulses PMT voltage of the FL detector was set high          enough to minimize the number of FLwidth events          appearing in channel  Regions R R and R were drawn          to exclude debris Fig G dead cells

experiment          performed to assess contribution of each of the three          sources demonstrated that  nonspecific binding of          IgGaFITC was negligible in all experimental groups Fig          H  tumor cells incubated with PMA alone did not          bind antiMHCII mAb above the level of isotype control          and  tumor cells incubated with PMA or with PMAIFNg          demonstrated

combination treatment with IFNg and GMCSF for as long as        weeks failed to induce MHCII on tumor cells in  out of         hepatocellular carcinoma patients However those         patients with
