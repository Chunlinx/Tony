                                 Boys Do Bleed            Fight Club is sillystuff sensationalism that mistakes itself for satire but its also a brashand transporting piece of moviemaking like Raging Bull on acid Thefilm opens withliterallya surge of adrenalin which travels through thebloodstream and into the brain of its protagonist Jack Edward Norton whosviewed as the camera pulls out of his insides with a gun stuck in his mouthHowd he get into this pickle Hes going to tell you breezily and thedirector David Fincher is going to illustrate his narrativeviolentlyFincher  Seven   The Game   is out to bombard you withso much feverish imagery that you have no choice but to succumb to the moviesreeling punchdrunk worldview By the end you might feel as if you too havea mouthful of blood            Not to mention a hole in your head FightClub careers from one resonant satirical idea to the next without quitedeciding whether its characters are full of crap or are Gen X prophets Italways gives you a rush though At first it goofs on the absurd feminizationof an absurdly macho culture An increasingly desperate insomniac Jack findsrelief and release only at meetings for the terminally ill At a testicularcancer group hes enfolded in the ample arms of Bob the singer Meat LoafAday a former bodybuilder who ruined his health with steroids and now hasbitch tits Jack and Bob subscribe to a new form of male bonding They clingto each other and sob But Jacks idyll is rudely disrupted bywouldnt youknow ita woman A darkeyed sepulchral head case named Marla Singer HelenaBonham Carter begins showing up at all the same disparate meetings foressentially the same voyeuristic ends and the presence of this tourist makesit impossible for Jack to emote            Jack finds anotheroutlet though On a plane he meets Tyler Durden Brad Pitt a cryptichipster with a penchant for subversive acts both large he makes highpricedsoaps from liposuctioned human fat and small he splices frames from pornflicks into kiddie movies When Jacks apartment mysteriously explodesalongwith his carefully chosen IKEA furniturehe moves into Tylers squalidwarehouse and helps to found a new religion Fight Club in which young malesgather after hours in the basement of a nightclub to pound one another and bepounded to a bloody pulp That last parenthesis isnt so parenthetical Insome ways its the longing to be beaten into oblivion thats the strongestSelfimprovement explains Tyler is masturbation selfdestruction is thenew way Tylers manifesto calls for an end to consumerism Things you own endup owning you and since society is going down Martha Stewart is polishingbrass on the Titanic  the only creative outlet left is annihilationIts only after weve lost everything that were free to do anything hesays            Fincher and his screenwriter Jim Uhls seem to thinktheyve broken new ground in Fight                Club  that their metaphor forour discontents hits harder than anyone elses Certainly it produces morebloody splatter But  years ago the same impulse was called punk and asGreil Marcus documents in Lipstick Traces  it was other things beforethat Yes the mixture of Johnny Rotten Jake La Motta and Jesus is uniqueand the Faludiesque emasculation themes are more explicit But theressomething deeply movieish about the whole conceit as if the novelist anddirector were weaned on Martin Scorsese pictures and never stopped dreaming ofrecapturing that first masochistic rush            The novel the first byChuck Palahniuk the surname sounds like Eskimo for palookawhich somehowfits walks a line between the straight and ironicit isnt always clear ifits glib sociological pronouncements are meant to be taken straight or as theravings of a delusional mamas boy But onscreen when Pitt announces to theassembled fighters that they are the middle children of history with nopurpose and no placeemasculated on one hand by the lack of a unifying crisisa world war or depression and on the other by lack of material wealth aspromised by televisionhe seems meant to be intoning gospel We are ageneration of men raised by women Tyler announces and adds If our fathersbail what does that tell you about God I give up What            F ight                Club could use a few differentperspectives a womans obviously but also an AfricanAmericanssomeonewhod have a different take on the healing properties of violence Its alsounclear just what has emasculated Jack Is it that hes a materialist or thatthe materials themselves ie IKEAs lacquered particle boards dont measureup to his fantasies of opulence Is he motivated by spiritual hunger or envyTylers subsequent idea of confining his groups mayhem to franchise coffeebars and corporatesubsidized art is a witty oneits like a parody ofneoNazism as reenacted by yuppies It might have been a howl if performed bysay the troupe of artsy German nihilists in Joel and Ethan Coens The BigLebowski  Somehow Brad Pitt doesnt have the same piquancy            Actually Pitt isnt as terrible as usual Hesplaying not a character but a conceit and he can bask in his movieidolarrogance which seems to be the most authentic emotion he has But the filmbelongs to Norton As a ferocious skinhead in last years American HistoryX  Norton was taut and ropy his long torso curled into a sneer here hesskinny and wilting a quivering pansy Even when he fights he doesnttransformhes a raging wimp The performance is marvelous and it makespoetic sense in light of the movies climactic twist But that twist will annoymore people than it will delight if only because it shifts the drama from therealm of the sociological to that of the psychoanalytic The finale scoredwith the Pixies great Where Is My Mind comes off facetiouslyas if Fincheris throwing the movie away            Until then however hehas done a fabulous job of keeping it spinning The most thrilling thing aboutFight Club isnt what it says but how Uhls and Fincher pull you into itsnarrators head and simulate his adrenalin rushes A veteran of rock videosFincher is one of those filmmakers who helps make the case that MTValong withdigital editinghas transformed cinema for better as well as worse The syntaxhas become more intricate Voiceover narration once considered uncinematicis back in style along with novelistic asides digressions fantasies andflashbacks To make a point you can jazzily interject anythingeven as inThree Kings  a shot of a bullet slicing through internal organs Filmslike Fight Club might not gel but they have a breathlessfreeassociational quality that points to new possibilities in storytelling Ormaybe old possibilities The language of movies hasnt seemed this unfetteredsince the presound days of Sergei Eisenstein and Abel Gance            An actress named Hilary Swank gives one of the mostrapturous performances Ive ever seen as the crossdressing Brandon Teena a ka Teena Brandon in Kimberly Peirces stark and astonishingly beautiful debutfeature                   Boys Dont Cry                The movie opens with Teenabeing shorn of her hated female tresses and becoming Brandon who swaggersaround in tight jeans and leather jackets The joy is in watching the actortransform and I dont just mean Swank I mean Teena Brandon playing BrandonTeenathe role she has been longing for her whole life In a redneck Nebraskabar Brandon throws back a shot of whiskey and the gesturea machoclichbecomes an act of selfdiscovery Every gesture does Youre gonnahave a shiner in the morning someone tells Brandon after a barroom brawl andhe takes the news with a glee thats almost mystical I am Oh shithe cries grinning That might be my favorite moment in the picture becauseSwanks ecstatic expression carries us through the next hour as Brandon actsout his urbancowboy fantasiessurfing from the bumper of a pickup truckrolling in the mud and straddling a barstool with one hand on a brewski andthe other on the shoulder of a gorgeous babe            That the people with whom Brandon feels most at homewould kill him if they knew his true gender is the movies most tragicironyand the one that lifts it out of the realm of gaymartyr hagiography andinto something more complex and irreducible a meditation on the irrelevance ofgender Peirces triumph is to make these scenes at once exuberantoccasionally hilarious and foreboding so that all the seeds of Brandonskilling are right there on the screen John Peter Sarsgaard one of hisfuture rapists and murderers calls him little buddy and seems almostattracted to him Sarsgaards performance is a finely chiseled study of howunresolved emotion can suddenly resolve itself into violence            Though harrowing thesecond half of Boys Dont Cry isnt as great as the first The earlyscenes evoke elation and dread simultaneously the later ones just dread andthe last halfhour is unrelieved torture What keeps the movie tantalizing isChlo Sevignys Lana who might or might not know that Brandon is a girl butwhos entranced by him anyway With her lank hair hooded eyes and air ofsleepy sensuality Sevignymaybe even more than Swankembodies the mystery ofsex thats at the core of Boys Dont Cry  Everything she does isdeliberate ironic slightly unreadableand unyielding Shes could be sayingIm in this world but not of it  Youd never dream whatsunderneath            I n                brief If a friend tells youyoull love                   Happy Texas                rethink the friendship Thisclunky mistakenidentity comedy about escaped cons who impersonate gay pageantdirectors doesnt even make sense on its own low farcical terms its mostlyone lame homo joke after another The only bright spot is Steve Zahn who couldbe the offspring of Michael J Fox and Crispin Glover if theyd mated on theset of Back to the Future             Its hard to make a serious case for LawrenceKasdans                   Mumford                which has apparently flopped butwhich you can still catch at second and thirdtier theaters It lookspeculiara Norman Rockwell painting with noir shadows And its tale of a smalltown healed by a depressive Loren Dean posing as a psychologist is full ofdoddering misconceptions about psychotherapy I almost dont know why I lovedit but the relaxed pacing and the witty turns by Martin Short Ted DansonDavid Paymer and Mary McDonnell surely helped I cant decide if the weirdlyaffectless Dean is inspired or inept but my indecision suggests why he worksin the role Theres no doubt however about his even more depressive loveobject Hope Davis who posseses the cinemas most expressive honkingnasalvoice and who slumps through the movie like the worlds most lyricalantiballerina Even her puffy cheeks are eloquent They made me think ofMumford as the home of the psychological mumps
