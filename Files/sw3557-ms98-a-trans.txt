             you think about AIDS research   well AIDS is a nasty terrible disease and you die from it so i think that uh they need to look into it and its kind of like cancer i dont you know how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer i think itll probably be as difficult   umhum   uh how about yourself   um well im certainly in favor of AIDS research and i think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does i think that       because besides the fact that its a deadly disease that its a contagious disease so that its um although it is not killing that many people now it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem   yeah they say a million people are infected with the HIV virus and   umhum   uh yeah i think   thats in the world or in America you   uh in the country America   oh really hm thats whose figure is that   yeah and they they have millions i dont know       uh ive just heard it on the radio sometimes you hear things that on the radio that  you know could be true or couldnt be   okay umhum   uh do you feel like this is a i guess theyre spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research   umhum   uh do you think they should spend more   um i i think they should actually although probably perhaps not a an incredible amount more than what theyre doing and i dont necessarily think that they should  uh fund AIDS AIDS research and you know in the process neglect cancer research or whatever i think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general   what do you think Doug of Mister Johnson   um   magic   what right uh well i am sorry that he has the virus id um i dont know i dont i think its very strange that  the media hasnt um questioned him  more strongly to you know about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that as they probably would for a lot of other people   do you think hes the hero that hes being called by a bunch of other a bunch of the media   um well not not really though i mean i think hes probably doing the right thing for a man in       his position but i dont think its anything exceptional that hes doing its  what many people have done already who are just less famous   you know i took advantage of the opportunity when you know he came out i i talked to my kids about it you know its something that i hadnt done hadnt done before uh   umhum uhhuh well thats good   im glad that Mister Johnsons changed his tune on uh safe sex to abstinence or i i was glad he did that   umhum   for young kids because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting   umhum   uh lets see what are some of the other questions i you dont uh lets see i dont have any friends that have the disease i guess you might might not   um yeah i do my cousin does for instance   is it pretty nasty   and um yeah yeah it is hes actually um he had AIDS related complex for a while and he is now in full blown AIDS and really not doing very well and has various brain tumors and that sort of thing so that its its a very nasty thing   yeah it sound awful is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly and   um yeah thats thats basically it that um the immune system can at first slow down and you know the white blood cell count goes down which is and thats AIDS related complex but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom thats AIDS   and   and in that case you know people are prone to getting any kind of you know weird cancer that only animals got before and yeah that sort of thing   oh really
