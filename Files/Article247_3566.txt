                                 La Rochefoucauld Has the Last Laugh                        Good morning Brent            Well its almost as good as an oldfashioned morality tale isntitsomething from the Grimm brothers or La Rochefoucauld The fox tries to haveit both ways breakfast of chickens maybe and lunch on their eggs Butsomehow the farmer foils the little predators scheme and he ends up withnothingneither chicken nor eggs So now with Hillary The FALN terroristshave accepted Bills clemency offer and she ends up with nothing but egg onher face Downstate liberals and ethnic activists will never forgive her foropposing the commutation deal but she has nothing to show to more conservativeupstate New York voters either The Puerto Rican terrorists go free and notonly is she proven utterly powerless to stop them but most people suspect thatshe was responsible for the clemency offer in the first place            Its a happy ending for people like usand you and I do seem really inagreement on thiswho think that one of the worst things about politics thesedays is all these gutless candidates trying to have it both ways The moral ofthe story  la La Rochefoucauld Trying to have it both ways usually gets youneither But all this brings me back to where I started yesterday I know Icould be gloating but somehow in the end the whole thing is just depressingSurely America deserves politicians who can do better than this            But the truth is when I think about it I wonder if thats so Maybe we getprecisely the politicians we deservebecause after all we usually reward theones who pander to us or try to have it both ways And those who take on thornyissues or take strong stands orworst of alltry to find a truly honorable andprincipled middle ground are usually only punished for their trouble            Think about the presidential  beauty contest Gore and Bradley have gotthemselves into a shameless arms race each one trying to outdo the other inflattering and cajoling minority voters Theyve trooped around to thecivilrights groups annual meetings Theyve sworn emotionally how much therace issue means to themhow searing it was to witness bigotry against fellowKnicks thats Bradley of course or in Gores case to watch his fatherbattling Jim Crow Both have promised to do just about anything Jesse Jacksonasks them and Bradley even paid an homage visit to the Rev Al Sharpton Itspandering of the worst kindand neither man has taken on a single tough issueBut both will be rewarded for their unctuousness by minority voterswhile theywould get absolutely nothing for staking out more thoughtful positions            Surely to take the most obvious example there are better ways to open upopportunity than with preferences Even Clinton claimed he wanted to mendaffirmative action But neither Gore nor Bradley would go near that now Itjust wouldnt pay off with black or white voters Theres more to besaid about thisIm sure you and I could have long discussion of preferencesBut in the end I think we get the politicians we deserve Its easy tocriticize them but really we ought to be looking inward            All bestTamar
