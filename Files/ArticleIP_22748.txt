investigating thestory became a key player in it since news that his article might appearin Newsweek precipitated Independent Counsel Kenneth Starrs hurriedinvestigation into President Clintons dalliance with Monica Lewinsky Thisbeing a book by a player we asked another player to review it LucianneGoldberg is a literary agent in New York City who served as Linda Tripps mainadviser and put many of the key figures involved in Flytrap in touch with oneanother She was also one of Isikoffs mainsources                                                               To read Isikoff on Goldberg and Tripp click                         One of the many amazingthings about Spikey Isikoffs new book Uncovering Clinton  is thedexterity of its execution It must be difficult to type and cover ones buttat the same time            Throughout thisenthralling tale one feels a please dont hit me cringe coming from theauthor Nonetheless he plunges relentlessly ahead as he details his deepinvolvement in the development of the story of Monicagate and the agonizinglyslow revelation of the squalid behavior of President Clinton On virtuallyevery page he risks journalistic scrotal torque as he stiffarms his reluctanteditors and sucks up to his sources who he wants the reader to believe are asduplicitous and sleazy as the president and his sockpuppet mouthpieces            He is particularly savage to the woman the media love tohate a cheap and easy shot in order to provide the book with a villainWithout Linda Tripp and her dogged documentation of the Oval Office goingsonIsikoff would not have had the story of his lifetime and a book that will sendhis kid to college Isikoff and Linda were performing the same task exposingthe president Isikoff had a powerful weekly newsmagazine and all itsresources Linda had a cheap tape recorder a likeminded and determined friendin New York and an iron will It is not sporting of Spikey to dump on hissource to provide cover for his own deep activity as a deep player in thisdrama Click to read Isikoffs doubts about whether he should have used Trippas a source from Pages             I knew of Michael Isikofflong before I met him He was one of my heroes for quitting his job at theWashington Post when his editors would not publish his reporting onPaula Jones When I heard he had gone to Newsweek I was saddened for tome that meant the end of the Bimbo Beat for Isikoff The editors atNewsweek would be no different from his fainthearted Clintonlovingeditors at the Post  No one in those days wanted to publish what theyall knewthat Clinton had a long history of abusing women and threateningpeople to cover it up            Then suddenly newsor more correctly gossip itemsconcerning Kathleen Willeys Oval Office gropesbegan to appear and I sawthat the Sex Beat Columbo was on the job again In those items a name I had allbut forgotten cropped up again Linda R Tripp She was telling a story I hadheard before in a book proposal she submitted to my literary agency in lSubsequently she had withdrawn the project and we parted company a commonoccurrence in the publishing business In August of l Tripp was back on thephone She needed help Michael Isikoff was hounding her about what she knewabout Kathleen Willey Linda wanted to talk to him but not alone In thatfirst phone conversation I learned that she now had far more damaginginformation about the president Would I help her get the story out throughIsikoff and Newsweek  Long a defender of the women I knew Clinton hadabused most particularly Gennifer Flowers I jumped at the chance to beinvolved            Isikoff makes much inthis enthralling tale of the fact that I secretly taped those first callsfrom Linda and how we conspired not only to overthrow Clinton but also toarrange a bigbucks book deal A book was discussed in the first calls Ionly knew her as a possible author and for  years I have looked ateverything and everyone that passes through my life as a possible book AsLindas tale quickly developed talk of doing a book became a moot point that Ican say faded to the vanishing point Note to the Irony Police Linda nevergave me a word on paper regarding Monica and I am at this moment reviewingMichael Isikoffs bigbucks book Note to anyone who calls me after closingtime Expect to be taped Its legal and it saves me pawing around on my nighttable for paper and a pen Click for Isikoffs account of the first call fromTripp to Goldberg about Monica Lewinsky on Pages             A few weeks after that fateful call from Linda I met thecrumpled rumpled and I was soon to learn occasionally hysterical Isikoff Iliked him He had no small talk he barely smiled his shirt was out his tiewas down and he accepted a beer At that meeting Linda produced her first twophone tapes of Monica keening about her soul mate the president and sheoffered to play them for the reporter He declined In UncoveringClinton he protests a bit much on this point for he has been criticized byless biased observers than me He claims he didnt want to become a part of thestory Jeepers I wish I had known that I wouldnt have spent countless hourson the phone with him after that meeting keeping him up to speed as we workedthroughout the fall to expose the goingson in the Oval Office My theory atthe time and now is that Isikoff had a car downstairs that night to take himto a TV appearance I mean first things first Click for Isikoffsexplanation of his abrupt departure that evening on Pages             Further he waits until Page  upon learning thatRevlon had withdrawn its offer of a job for Monica to go all Sally Fields onus and exclaim What do you know Its true Its really true            Huh            Not once in all the often breathlessconversations I had with Isikoff over those weeks did I doubt for a minute thathe believed Lindas story and the facts I was relaying to him regarding herongoing documentation But I should have paid closer attention Right there onPage  he explains In his frantic manipulating to get hold of Lindas tapesof Monica he phoned me in New York and remembers it as follows                           Youvegot to get Moody Lindas lawyer to let me listen to those tapes I shouted atGoldberg Youve got to get Tripp to give him the goahead You dontunderstand how important this is Without that if I cant write that there iscompelling evidence backing up Tripps allegations this is going to blow up inyour faceand Tripps                That at any rate waswhat I was telling them It is the way reporters operate We threaten wecajole we feign sympathy But the truth for me was slightly differentWhatever was on those tapes listening to them and quoting them would makethis a much more compelling and dramatic story for Newsweek                         Ah Spikey your sudden burst of candor like a summersquall comes without warning What he meant of course was that he could puthis hands back on the keyboard His butt was covered            All along MichaelIsikoff was a player in this story and he has written a players book That iswhat makes it so engrossing He guarded the story with the ferocity of a mothertiger hovering over the last shard of an impalas bloody haunch Never mindthat a wily Internet jackal in the form of Matt Drudge leapt out of thejungle of cyberspace and ran off with a juicy chunk of Spikeys hardwon mealThe bulk of it still belongs to Isikoff He worked for it he earned it and inUncovering Clinton he has found a medium where he cant suffer the fatethat gave him his nickname            It is a riveting tale written by someone who gave ittexture as it unfolded and I doubt that any reviewer save this one will takehim to task for his ingratitude to Linda Tripp She is an easy target But itdoes seem a tad mingy for someone as talented and resourceful as Isikoff totake such cheap shots at the messenger            Isikoff ends Uncovering Clinton with a quoteof mine made during a phone call at the end of the whole ordeal He tells methat Clinton thinks we are scum I reply Well we are scum If anyone everdid to me what we did to him I would hate them too            Isikoff writes Whenthat happens  I will plan to be there watching listening and takingnotes            Spikey tell the car youll be right down Neither LindaTripp nor I nor the handful of dedicated Americans who made up thetruthtellers of Hillarys Vast RightWing Conspiracy will ever be electedpresident and proclaim that theirs will be the most ethical administration inhistory None of us will ever take a manipulative young intern into the OvalOffice bathroom and have her perform sex acts about which we will force anentire Cabinet to lie            When not if the nextLinda Tripp comes to me with an amazing story that I know in my heart and gutis true I will simply bypass the agonizing mainstream media the doubtingThomases and whiners and go directly to Matt Drudge
