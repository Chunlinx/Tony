              okay   okay uh so what do you think about the school system   well i think theyre theyre having a lot of trouble right now i know my son goes to a private school but uh i think theyre big city public schools by definition are having a a tough time right now just from uh probably from budget cuts and and everything else going on   uh why why did you choose a private school   well i had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a at a pace a little faster than he was gonna be able to moved be moved in public school so  hes he has been going to private since kindergarten  so   public school oh has he and how does he like it   oh hes loved it hes a senior in high school this year so hes  yeah hes done it the whole twelve and a so many years and its been uh its been really good for him   so hes been there all time how big of a school is it   uh overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper school upper four grades uh about four hundred and something so its maybe a hundred per grade   a hundred per grade thats a good size   yeah it really is   kind of gives them the  you know like  get a little leery of the real small ones  that they dont get much interaction with kids but uh   yeah that was  we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture and   so they dont thats good   hes done hes done really well and just he was just ahead at an early age and i didnt feel like uh in what was available particularly in the first three grades   umhum   and even in the fourth grade when they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program   huh   and i just didnt think that was gonna get it i thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead uh everyday   right   but yet still be with his peers age wise   still enjoy the  right um one thing i think ive noticed is uh my my oldest is in kindergarten so im in a little different ballgame im just starting i   youre just getting started   but uh seems to me that uh kids these days uh can really get away with murder and the teachers dont have as much arent respected as much and uh they have to be some careful of the things they do and say   yeah i know thats thats a big problem   and uh makes me a little nervous that uh students dont seem to show that respect and   we wouldnt have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school wouldnt have thought of it and you know and theyll stand there now with them toe to toe and   no heavens no no you wouldnt and uh the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what i understand uh i think thats wrong i think we need to get back to the  show some respect and course i guess the teacher used to warrant that but   yeah but a lot of times its not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for elders and adults particularly in in responsible positions  have not uh   right for other people and   i dont think its  had that basic  upbringing in a lot of cases and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands   well how do you think thats happened you think our societys just uh stopped talking out or this uh generations just kind of changed a little bit uh   i guess i well the world changes so i mean obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be i mean theyre exposed to a whole lot more things they have a whole lot more   right   uh variety of things that theyre that they see and do at an earlier age so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time but but still i think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to to teach uh basic values and basic uh respectful of uh respectfulness of authority   right   and i just dont think that this doesnt always get emphasized anymore uh   that just isnt coming through is it no i mean i remember uh well it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levis we used to have to wear dresses and then you had to uh go to dresses they had to be a pantsuit and it was polyester and it had to be matching and   yeah had to wear dresses didnt you and when it was skirts it was like get down on the floor and we hold the ruler up here and its no more than so many inches above the knee  because it was mini skirt time back there at one time   yes exactly yes yes so its really changed its uh really kind of gone the rounds so i think think that maybe thats effected it to some degree they say you kind of act how youre dressed a little bit  so i   yeah i think that probably does have have something to do with it that its also   do uh does does this school your son goes to do they uh required required to wear a uniform or   no they do not do uniforms although ones where he was between like second and eighth grade did   uhhuh yeah there are quite a few of your schools
