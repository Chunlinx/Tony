                                 Gamma Burgers            I pretty much ignored thefirst reports this summer that people were getting food poisoning from E coliOH bacteria in hamburgers I might have raised an eyebrow when beefsupplier Hudson Foods recalled  million pounds of hamburger But when therecall caused Burger King to run out of burgers I started to worry Shouldntsomebody do something about this food poisoning thing            The Big Media apparentlyagreed Within days of the recall the New York Times  the WallStreet Journal  Newsweek  and others were proposing a simplesolution Irradiation of food to kill not just E coli but all the nasty germsand parasites that slip into our food supply            Thisrapid blanket approval of irradiation by the establishment naturally stirred mysuspicions We are talking about radioactivity after all On closerinspection however food irradiation turns out to work safely and effectivelyopponents concerns notwithstanding But questions remain about whether foodpoisoning is such a big problem in the first place            Human skin and intestines crawl with ordinary E coli Buta few uncommon strains of the bacteriaespecially the notorious E coliOHproduce toxins Ingest these toxic bacteria and you experience waterydiarrhea and severe abdominal pain at first bloody stools next Youremiserable but these symptoms dont usually require medical attentionatleast in developed countries But in some cases the toxins trigger thedestruction of blood cells and cause renal failure This hemolytic uremicsyndrome can be deadly in children The Centers for Disease Control estimatethat toxic E coli cause  cases of illness and up to  deaths each yearin the United States            Meat isthe most common source of E coli OH but raw milk vegetables and fruitjuice have carried it in recent outbreaks You may recall that toxic E colishowed up in alfalfa sprouts two months ago and in Odwalla apple juice lastyear The bug lives in the guts of about  percent of cattle and contaminatesmeat when digestive contents spill where they shouldnt during slaughter Italso contaminates produce if farm wastewater enters the irrigation supplyToxic E coli are just one of the top seven bacterial food contaminants Morecommon bacteria such as salmonella present in  percent of chicken andcampylobacter the number one cause of food poisoning cause diarrhea for million to  million Americans each year However washing your produce andcooking your meat until well done will almost always remove these bacteria            Burger King terminated its Hudson Foods supplycontract not for safety concerns but for PR reasons Like other fastfoodchains it cooks its burgers to over  degrees killing all bacteria But itfeared that it might earn a reputation for bacteria burgers which has plaguedthe Jack in the Box chain ever since  when four people ate some of itsundercooked tainted beef and died Ironically Hudson Foods primarilychicken suppliers didnt distribute beef until Burger King talked them intothe business a few years ago            Advocatesof food irradiation say that a rare burger doesnt have to be dangerousIrradiators containing cobalt or another radioactive source would bombardhamburger apple juice and other foods with gamma rays killing residentbacteria and parasites The radiation disrupts DNA which germs need tosurvive Meat doesnt need functional DNA since its already dead Lowerdoses will pasteurize foodie kill the diseasecausing organisms Higherdoses of radiation will completely sterilize food            Supporters of irradiation like writer Richard Rhodes arguethat the process is perfectly safe leaves no funny taste or appearance andprevents illness from E coli OH salmonella beef tapeworms fishparasites and trichinae in pork Since fungi are killed radiationpasteurizedfood lasts longer tooup to two weeks in the fridge instead of a few daysFor gamma ray fans food irradiation is the most logical step after heatpasteurization of milk            The Foodand Drug Administration has approved irradiation of produce pork poultry andother foods but industry has not adopted it widely For unclear reasons theFDA has stalled on a  application to allow the industry to irradiate beefand veal Youd think that the poultry industry which has suffered terriblepublicity over salmonella outbreaks would rush to irradiation but it fearsthat the negative public reaction to irradiation would be worse Currentlyastronauts patients in many hospitals and people in  other countries eatirradiated food            Advocates blame slow adoption of irradiation ontechnophobic lobbying groups that ignore the evidence and stir public fearswith outrageous claims that the process makes food radioactive The critics Ispoke to however offered credible arguments Most admit that irradiationworks and some like Michael Jacobson of the Center for Science in the PublicInterest will even concede its safe for consumers But they argue that itsexpensive harmful to workers and the environment and unnecessary if saferfarming methods are practiced They suggest growing livestock under cleanerless confined conditions to prevent contamination of feed and waterslaughtering the animals so bacteriacontaining skin and feces never get onfood and using simpler technologies like steaming to clean raw meat Asenvironmental advocate Michael Colby told reporters Irradiation is a copoutIrradiation is saying we have to have fecal matter in our hamburgers            For therecord gamma rays do not make food radioactive And studies do seem to showits safe In a sixyear study scientists fed dogs and other animalsirradiated chicken and found no evidence of increased cancer or other toxiceffects Other research found no signs of hazard in humans who eat irradiatedfood Also studies showed that at the lower pasteurization doses radiationdoes not degrade nutrients The World Health Organization the American MedicalAssociation and the American Dietetic Association all back the technology assafe            What about the other arguments against irradiation Itdoesnt seem expensivethey use it in Bangladesh after all A Florida companycharges  cents a pound for irradiation and advocates say wider use wouldhalve costs The risks to the environment and to workers seem theoretical Thesame technology is already used safely in hospital radiationtherapy units andplants that sterilize medical products Food irradiators do produce radioactivewaste that must be stored under nuclear regulatory guidelines but the currentregulations governing hospitals and sterilization companies seem to work andthe amount of radwaste generated is far too small to cause Three MileIslandlike effects Advocates like to point out that the waste hasnt killedanyone but kids die every year from food poisoning            Irradiation also seems more costeffective than changing farming andslaughtering practices Its pretty hard to keep feces out of meat Some meatproducers in Sweden do but their meat is double or even triple the usualprice And even with clean practices and technologies like steaming of meatwhich hasnt been tested nearly as much some food would still becontaminated Advocates say thered still be reason to irradiate            So irradiating food seems safe effective andcheap Yet it also seems like a hightech swatter for an overhyped fly ToxicE coli infect just three in  people Thanks to officials who pushed fora recall Hudson hamburgers didnt kill anyone Irradiation backers exaggeratefood poisonings impact claiming the top seven contaminants kill  peopleeach year According to the most recent data though fewer than  peopledie from tainted food each year Compare that with say car accidents whichkill  people a year or smoking which kills over             Food poisoning is a seriousrisk only for vulnerable populations like the very young For the rest of usits an uncommon annoyance caused mainly by inadequately cooked chicken orpork Im not against saving a few hundred lives a year for a few pennies extraon my beef so go ahead and zap my food But irradiated or not Ill stillorder my burgers rare
