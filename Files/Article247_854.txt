                                 President Company Not Excluded                           USAToday  the Los Angeles Times and New York Timeslead with todays anticipated Senate not guilty votes The Washington Post  for the second day in a row gives the topof the paper to something elsetoday to the horrors of North Koreasfamineand tucks impeachment just underneath but festooned by the frontsboldest headline type            The papers spend most of their impeachment ink counting votes and recountingbits of closeddoor speeches pressreleased to them They note that RepublicanSen Olympia Snowes announcement that she will vote to acquit PresidentClinton on both impeachment articles means theres a very good chance theperjury charge wont even get a simple majority and some chance that theobstruction charge wont either Its also reported that Republican SusanCollins might vote no on one or both articles The LAT is most definiteabout this citing sources close to her saying Collins will vote no twice            On the other hand say the papers two other Republicans also widely thoughtto be not guilty voters Sen Gordon Smith and Sen Robert Bennett announcedtheir intention to convict on both articles The LAT quotes Bennett aspredicting that Clinton will become a synonym for an elegant wellcraftedlie But this isnt much worse than the remarks by Sen Dianne Feinsteinquoted by the NYT  The president acted immorally He acted recklesslyHe acted disgracefully He willfully misled the American people the members ofhis Cabinet his staff and his judicial system In doing so he brought shameand dishonor upon the office of the President and especially upon himself Andshes a Clinton supporter             The papers say that after the midday impeachment vote a formal censure ofClinton will fail Then there will be an attempt at an informal censure whichthe LAT explains would be read into the record but not acted on            The NYT says that the days solemn mood was somewhat tarnished byreports that Clinton planned an allout drive to help Democrats win back theHouse Wonder why the Times doesnt mention that it was where thosereports first appeared The papers mention that Clinton plans to address thenation tomorrow after the trials conclusion and that he will be mindful not torepeat the celebratory mood of that postimpeachment South Lawn pep rally TheWP quotes Sen Bob Kerreys response to the question What did he wantto hear from Clinton today As little as possible            A story reefered on the WP front quotes several knowledgeableDemocrats as saying that Hillary Clinton will seriously consider whether torun for the Senate from New York in  once theimpeachment trial is over            The NYT top front features an interview with Linda Tripp complete with a large color photoof the heavily made up and made over stayathome federal bureaucrat Accordingto the story Tripp says she betrayed Monica Lewinsky to save her from beingabused by President Clinton I would hope some other mom would do for mydaughter what I did for Monica despite the fact that it looks horriblethe paper quotes Tripp saying as she broke down in tears Tripp also says thatit was Lucianne Goldbergs idea for her to talk to Ken Starr and for her toreveal Lewinskys affair to Paula Jones lawyers Tripp also tells theTimes that she had her first discussion with the Jones lawyers inOctober  She also admits telling Lewinsky the lie that she was turningover on Monica because Tripp had also been the target of a Ken Starr stingoperation            Everybody fronts the precedentsetting verdict of a Brooklyn federal jury finding thatseveral gun manufacturers were legally responsible for the criminal use offirearms awarding  in damages to a New York teenager wounded in a shooting The decision is likely say the papers to lead more cities and moreshooting victims to mount such liability lawsuits Its a bit curious that theWP  a paper read in a city with its share of shootings chooses to putthe story on the very bottom of the front page below a story about thescandaldriven rise in sex talk and one about the possibility of more flightsbeing added at National Airport Similarly why is the Post waitinguntil page  to tell us that the US has decided to send more than Marines into Kosovo as part of a multinational peacekeeping force And why iseverybody else likewise paying little attention to this            A LAT frontpager claims that despite a stock price and profits thatcontinue to climb Microsofts power in the computing world is beginning towane The story points out that in contrast to a year ago a few computercompanies are now offering PCs not just with Netscape instead of InternetExplorer but even with nonWindows operating systems Also the story noteseven though Internet company consolidation continues to proceed at a furiouspace Microsoft hasnt made a major acquisition since the DOJ brought its caselast year                           Uh like wasnt that the problem in the first place The Wall Street Journal Washington Wire reports that the NewHampshire state Democratic Party chairman says Clinton shouldnt gloat when heattends a fundraiser in his state next week but adds Im not sure anyonethere can control their passion
