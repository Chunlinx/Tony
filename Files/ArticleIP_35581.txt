                                 John McCains War of Attrition            Mondayafternoon Sen John McCain RAriz declared his candidacy for president Hedid everything by the book highlighted favorable issues exploited hispersonal history and portrayed his opponents advantages as vices But McCainalso defied the political playbook by deprecating himself in a shrewd effort topreempt criticism and turn up the heat on his rivals Heres a breakdown ofhis tactics                                           Focus on foreign policy Each candidate hasexpertise in a particular terrain of issues The advantage will go to thecandidate on whose terrain the battle is fought If the election is aboutcultural concerns George W Bush has the advantage If its about economicgrowth Al Gore has the advantage If its about poverty Bill Bradley has theadvantage McCain thanks to his military career owns the terrain of foreignpolicy While Bradley can argue that poverty is the most morally pressingconcern Gore can argue that growth is the most fundamental and Bush can arguethat cultural decay is foremost in the minds of voters McCain can argue thatmilitary issues are the most grave The most solemn responsibility given thepresident is the role of commander in chief he declared Monday Of the timeMcCain spent discussing issues nearly half was devoted to the military andAmericas role in the world                                           Emphasize biography Since the end of the Cold Warit has been difficult to get the public to focus on foreign policy But McCaincan frame the election to his advantage in another way He can bypass thechoice among issues by persuading voters to focus on the candidatesbiographies instead of their platforms Every candidate launches his campaignwith a glossy account of his upbringing and career but McCains heroism inVietnam makes his story a far easier sell than Bushs Gores or BradleysMcCain exploits this advantage by filling his speeches with the word serviceServing my country is an honor indeed the most honorable life an Americancan lead he said Monday I have passed from a young man to an old one in theservice of my country                                           Moralize the issues Once he has convinced voters ofhis superior character McCain exports this advantage by describing everysubject in moral terms In his announcement address as in previous speecheshe framed domestic issues in terms of honor courage strength faithselfishness honesty and respect He called trade protectionistscowards accused the government of swindling taxpayers and denouncedPresident Clinton for breaking his promise to protect Social Security Twomonths ago addressing the National Council of La Raza McCain said of Hispanicvoters Their support is my honor Couching every issue in such languagemaximizes the leverage of McCains heroism                            Stigmatize                wealth The elite pedigrees of Bush andGore make them vulnerable to a populist underdog Auditioning for this rolePat Buchanan uses economic issues Bradley uses Midwestern humility and McCainuses the soldiers ethic of obedience teamwork and selfsacrifice I dontbegin this mission with any sense of entitlement America doesnt owe meanything McCain proclaimed Monday I was born into Americas service  Iwant to return our government back to whom it belongsthe people So thatAmericans can believe once again that public service is a summons to duty andnot a lifetime of privilege                                           Vilify partisanship McCain like Bradley hasgenerated significant interest among independent voters and needs their help inNew Hampshires open primary Moreover unlike Bradley McCain has madenumerous enemies in his own party by promoting legislation that would restrictcampaign contributions and require tobacco companies to pay for health care andantismoking education To convert this adversity into an advantage McCainaccuses his critics of subverting the national interest for the sake ofpartisan ambitions He scolds Congress as well as Clinton Republicans aswell as Democrats and conservatives as well as liberals            Conventional strategy dictates that having framed the election along theselines McCain should emphasize his superiority in each respect Instead heproclaims his own inadequacy McCains favorite words are shame blamefailure and disgrace In every account of his POW ordeal he absurdlyconcludes that he failed to withstand the enemys torture In speeches heaccepts blame for everything Congress does wrong says he failed to preventit and vows to try harder next time He is ashamed ofeverythingpolitical pork unwise military procurements highdollarelectioneering The people whom I serve believe that the means by which I cameto office corrupt me he declared three months ago And that shames me Thatshames me Their contempt is a stain upon my honor and I cannot live with itPundits choked up at McCains words Since then he has repeated them verbatimon at least five occasions Shame has become his shtick            Thisaccomplishes two things First it preempts criticism from the media Its nofun whipping McCain when hes already whipping himself Second it establishesa test no other candidate can survive McCain is the only candidate with abiography of steel When he calls himself weak and corrupt nobody believeshim If Gore were to call himself weak and corrupt his opponents would replayhis confession as a campaign ad            Tobeat Bush McCain has stripped character down to experience Bush speaks thelanguage of character and has plenty of foreign policy counsel on which torely McCain wants to take those assets out of the game reducing thecomparison to what each man has done with his life In military confrontationsMcCain warned Monday there comes a time when our nations leader can nolonger rely on briefing books and talking points  when the sum total ofones life becomes the foundation from which he or she makes the decisions thatdetermine the future of our democracy  The president is a lonely man in adark room when the casualty reports come in I am not afraid of the burden Iknow both the blessing and the price of freedom With that McCain began arefrainI am not afraiddesigned to shame his rivals            McCains ultimate weapon is cynicism He plays it up because it endangers hisopponents more than it endangers him The central line of his speech proclaimeda New Patriotic Challenge It is a challenge to each of us to join in thefight against the pervasive cynicism that is debilitating our democracy Itcorrodes every politician except John McCain We who are currently privilegedto hold public office have ourselves to blame he laments in his stump speechIt is we who have squandered the public trust we who have time and againplaced our personal or partisan interest before the national interest earningthe publics contempt with our polldriven policies our phony posturing thelies we call spin  We are all corrupted            Thefirst politician McCain wants to portray as corrupted is Bush At a time whenAmericans are growing increasingly cynical about public service andincreasingly disillusioned about their political leaders McCain chargedSaturday I was disappointed to see my fellow Republicans reaction to recentcomments and writings by Pat Buchanan concerning our nations role in defeatingNazi Germany By continuing to appease Buchanan several of our candidatesappear to have put politics ahead of our partys principles  Like GovBush I want to see a united Republican Party But no political campaign isworth sacrificing our principles            Somuch for McCains war against cynicism He hates cynicism like the Russiansat Stalingrad hated the snow
