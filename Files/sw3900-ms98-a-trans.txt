        yeah what do you think about our level of funding to Middle East Trust     well i i think we could use a lot of it at home but definitely a hot spot is the poor last year proved       a lot of   yeah i was i was thinking while i was waiting to be connected with uh uh another party you know i got real ambivalent uh kind of mixed feelings about it i mean i agree with you i think you know jeez theres an awful lot of money that we go over there to people that  seem to be  uh shall we say less than appreciative   i agree   and at and and at the same time it uh you know i think its important for us that you know there is some sort of stability in that region but i dont know then again you uh historically there has such a history of uh you know just  being constantly in turmoil that i dont know if we can throw enough dollars at them to you know keep any kind of a lasting  peace over there so i dont its its i i guess bottom line if i had to uh to call the shot i would like to see the the money spent a little more uh judiciously   uh i i agree i like the i like the the peace process spend more money on things like that and especially with um i dont know the Palestinians and the Israelis fighting so much over who is going to go to this peace conference id tie some of the money to those peace conferences if they dont want to go to the peace conference then i guess they dont want the two billion dollars for the next batch of F fifteens or whatever   oh yeah yeah   but which well never do but i i think it is about time especially with the Israelis that we   yep yep right   because many times in the past theyve you know theyre happy to take our money and stuff but they often times fail to give us any support in return   yeah well that was exactly who i i was thinking about whenever i made the comment of uh you know money going to people that seem less than appreciative i mean theyre theyre ready to take it and we set you know have have set uh a precedence over the history with them of always having an open pocket book uh and uh you know theyve just have grown to expect it and uh i dont mind uh helping people that i mean i dont expect somebody to grovel but at the same time dont uh you know take the money and and then uh slap me in the face   right well uh they they seem to do a lot of that stuff the problem i have  in the past at least it was you know they were very strategically strategically important to us but i think thats diminished a lot lately too   yeah yeah   especially with the relationship weve started to develop with Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War and all  and i dont know maybe we could use that to our advantage   right   at least if we are going to be giving them all this money then at least  you know we should get some at least some cooperation or whatever in return   yeah the one good thing about the Gulf War i i mean there was several good things about it but it was  one of the few things that weve ever done as a as a country that i think practically paid for itself   right   and certainly there are countries over there that have the where with all to uh uh foot their fair share of the bill   well thats for sure   yeah   and we built some good friends over there now with uh time when we can use them you know little rut   yeah and and we built we we built some good friends and then weve also built some arch enemies so its you know its one tit for tat sort of   right well most of the large enemies were large enemies to begin with though theres not too many people that went from being our friends to being our enemies but just   thats true thats right thats right i i   quite a few that have been from our enemies to at least tolerating us or whatever   well yeah especially when if you look back at wasnt very you know that many years ago i mean back in the early seventies whenever the the Saudis embargoed uh oil to the US weve certainly come a long way since then   right thats right uh and i dont know Iran Iran now wants them to reestablish more normal relationships with us i dont know if that is in our best interests either but its good that i dont know it it seems slightly more stable now but how long that lasts you know it can history has shown that can just be a lull before the storm   yeah right right well its  you know like i say just as uh as uh a region i dont know of any uh other part of the world that uh is is so prone to change quickly and and i dont know this seems like you know theyre these uh deep seeded hostilities and animosities from that are just uh handed down generation to generation   right well they have the all the religious battles they have the nationalist battle they just seem to have a lot of different cultures and religions nationalisms all packed into that one small geographical area they all believe that they have rights to these lands you know theres two three four groups that all believe that this portion of land rightfully is theirs   youre right   hopefully you know optimistically maybe maybe something you know i dont think its all going to be rosy after this latest round of peace talks but hopefully it can be       a start at least in the right direction   yeah well i do like your idea of tying uh
