                                 The PicturePerfect Fed                        So now the Fed has taken all the rate cuts back Last summer and fall whenit sometimes felt as if the global economy were on the verge of a massivenervous breakdown the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three consecutivetimesincluding one betweenmeetings rate cutto ensure that suddenly panickylenders didnt strangle access to credit The US economy perhaps as aresult didnt even hiccup while the stock market which had plummeted in thewake of Asian turmoil Russian devaluation and the collapse of LongTermCapital Management came roaring back But after todays basispoint ratehike the federal funds rate now stands at  percent exactly where it wasbefore the chaos of last summer            To me this looks like nearly pictureperfect central banking especiallysince the US economy continues to grow at a fast pace unemployment continuesto shrink and inflation at the consumer level remains in check There arevoices of dissent who think that Alan Greenspan is paying too much attention toWall Street and that the continued rise in stock prices is entirely the productof the Feds distribution of easy money But that case has been weakened notonly by the Feds own rate hikes but also by the powerful rally in the bondmarket in recent weeks Thirtyyear interest rates are back down near percent after trading close to  percent and they would not be there ifbond tradersfor whom vigilance about inflation is a cardinal lawthought theFed was letting us all live high on the hog by printing lots of greenbacks            In any case Fedwatching has become so ubiquitous that its harder to saysomething new about Alan Greenspan than about Martha Stewart But there are twoimportant things to keep in mind about this most recent hike The first is thateven if the Feds performance over the past year and a half looks perfect wedont actually know if it was By this I mean something more than just theobvious point which is that history has no control group I also mean that themost important driver of noninflationary growthbusinessproductivityremains something of a mystery to economists            Productivity growth remains very strong at  percent in the most recentquarter though the rate of that growth has slowed slightly very slightlyAnd it seems increasingly clear that the effects on productivity ofcomputerization and the Internet are real and not temporary blips But whythose effects are being felt now how long they will last how much ofproductivity growth is being driven by businesses running leaner than they oncedid These questions dont have firm answers Nor for that matter do wereally understand why productivity growth slowed so rapidly in the s Sowhile the Fed deserves credit for its performance most of whats going on inthis Goldilocks economy is out of its control            The second thing worth noticing is that the popular understanding of therole of the Fed seems to have shifted in the past year and a half arguably asa result of its quick action last year The conventional wisdom was that ittook six months to a year for a Fed rate hike to work its way into the economywhich makes sense since raising or lowering interest rates generally isnt likeslamming a door open or shut Its more like easing it open or closed But whatweve seen more recently is the idea that one of the Feds key roles ispsychological It wasnt the literal opening of the taps last fall thatmattered but rather the symbolic message the Fed sent lenders which was thatit was OK to take on a little risk at a time when the only thing anyone wantedto do was buy year US bonds Similarly no one really believes thatraising the Fed funds rate from  percent to  percent is going to putthe brakes on economic growth although the gradual rise from  percent to percent has to have had some effect But people do believe that it willsend the right message to lenders and borrowers To be sure ultimately themessage carries weight because its backed by the Feds actions But inconcrete terms the Feds actions probably wont have an effect for sixmonths to a year The Feds message though is already at work right now
