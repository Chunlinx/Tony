                    Background        In this investigation we explored the potential        cytotoxic interaction between LPS and CEES using a murine        macrophage cell line RAW CEES is a monofunctional        analog of sulfur mustard bischloroethylsulfide which        a bifunctional vesicant and a chemical warfare agent Both        bischloroethylsulfide and CEES are known to provoke        acute inflammatory responses in skin       The        resulting skin blistering is thought to involve the        stimulation of specific proteases     Apoptosis is        now considered a possible molecular mechanism whereby CEES        induces cytotoxicity             LPS is a major component of the cell wall of        gramnegative bacteria and is known to trigger a variety of        inflammatory reactions in macrophages and other cells        having CD receptors      In particular LPS is known        to stimulate the macrophage secretion of nitric oxide           and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis        factoralpha TNFalpha and interleukinbeta ILbeta            For this reason we also determined if TNFalpha        or ILbeta were capable of enhancing the cytotoxic        effects of CEES        LPS stimulation of macrophages is known to involve the        activation of protein phosphorylation by kinases as well as        the activation of nuclear transcription factors such as        NFkappaB        The activation of protein        kinase C PKC by diacylglycerol is also a key event in LPS        macrophage activation             In vitro experiments have shown that        the secretion of TNFalpha and ILbeta by LPSstimulated        monocytes is dependent upon PKC activation      In        this study we also determined if phorbol myristate acetate        PMA activation of PKC also enhanced CEES toxicity        Evidence suggests that LPS     as well as TNFalpha           stimulate the production of free radicals by        macrophages Our longterm goal is to understand the        molecular mechanism of sulfur mustard toxicity and to        determine if free radical production plays an important        role in this toxicity        In our experiments cytotoxicity was measured by a        decrease in the optical density by the MTT        dimethylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazolium        bromide assay or by an increase in the fluorescence of        propidium iodide PI The MTT assay is based on reduction        of MTT by actively growing cells to produce a blue formazan        product with absorbance at  nm A low MTT absorbance        indicates cell death The PI assay differentiates between        live and dead cells Cells that have lost membrane        integrity cannot exclude PI which emits a red fluorescence        after binding to cellular DNA or double stranded RNA A        high PI indicates cell death                    Results                  Cytotoxic interaction between LPS and CEES as          measured by the MTT assay          RAW  macrophages were incubated with LPS           ngml CEES  M or both agents for  hours and          cell viability then measured by the MTT assay As shown          in Figure  we found that LPSstimulated RAW          macrophages were markedly more susceptible p            to CEES toxicity  hr than resting macrophages as          indicated by the dramatic drop in dehydrogenase activity          In the absence of LPS CEES at a level of  M did not          significantly affect cell viability as measured by the          MTT assay          The characteristics of CEES toxicity to LPSstimulated          RAW  macrophages were further characterized by          varying the concentrations of both LPS and CEES The MTT          data in Figure show that very low levels  ngml of          LPS dramatically enhanced the toxicity of CEES measured          after  hr to macrophages at concentrations            M In general LPS levels beyond  ngml did not          further enhance the toxicity of CEES However LPS level          at a level of  ngml significantly increased the          cytotoxicity of  M CEES compared to LPS activated          RAW cells not treated with CEES Statistical          analyses indicate that cells treated with  M CEES          were not significantly different from control cells not          treated with CEES in the presence of   or  ngml          of LPS However at a LPS level of  ngml cells          treated with  M CEES showed a great MTT optical          density than control cells This might be due to a slight          mitogenic response to low levels of CEES                          Time course for the cytotoxic interaction between          LPS and CEES as measured by the propidium iodide PI          assay          In order to insure that our results could be          reproduced with an alternative assay for cell viability          we also utilized the propidium iodide PI assay In this          assay the percent fluorescence increase over the control          cells ie   PI           treatment PI           control PI           control  indicates cytotoxicity For          each experiment the value for the control cells is zero          and is not therefore shown Figure indicates that the          PI assay provides the same qualitative results as the MTT          assay ie a synergistic toxic interaction between CEES           M and LPS  ngml Moreover the cytotoxic          interaction between LPS and CEES was noticeable after           hours p   and reached a maximum  hours after          exposure After  hours CEES  M was significantly          toxic to RAW  macrophages even in the absence of          LPS LPS alone was never significantly different than          cells with no treatment which always has a zero percent          PI increase                          TNFalpha and ILbeta also enhance the cytotoxic          effect of CEES          LPS from Gramnegative bacteria binds to CD and          initiates a complex signal transduction pathway involving          the Toll receptor family which eventually results in the          synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha          and ILbeta We therefore investigated the potential          roles of TNFalpha and ILbeta in enhancing CEES          cytotoxicity Table shows that ILbeta  ngml and          CEES  M are significantly more cytotoxic after           hours when administered together than when administered          alone In this experiment LPS  ngml and CEES           M combined gave PI and MTT values of    and             respectively These MTT data suggest that          LPS at  ngml is able to enhance the toxicity of CEES          an MTT value of    to a greater extent p            than ILbeta at  ngml an MTT value of             The ternary mixture of LPS  ngml ILbeta           ngml and CEES  M was not found to be more          cytotoxic than LPS  ngml and CEES  M          Table shows completely analogous data with TNFalpha          ie an amplification of CEES toxicity after  hours          in the presence of the inflammatory cytokine In this          experiment LPS at  ngml plus CEES at  M gave          PI and MTT values of    and             respectively This indicates that TNFalpha at  ngml          is not as potent at LPS at  ngml in enhancing the          cytotoxicity of CEES at  M TNFalpha combined with          LPS in the absence of CEES was found to not exert any          cytotoxic effect on the RAW macrophages          Protein kinase C is a nonreceptor serinethreonine          kinase that is maximally active in the presence of          diacylglycerol and calcium ions           In vitro experiments by Coffey et          al    have shown that TNFalpha and ILbeta          secretion and mRNA accumulation by monocytes following          LPS treatment is dependent on PKC activity Phorbol          myristate acetate PMA is a specific activator of          group A and group B protein kinase C We wanted to          determine therefore if protein kinase C activation by          PMA would enhance the toxicity of CEES As shown in Table           the combination of PMA  ngml and CEES  M          was more cytotoxic after  hours toward the RAW          macrophages than LPS or CEES alone However as was the          case with ILbeta and TNFalpha PMA was not as          effective as LPS in enhancing CEES toxicity                            Discussion        We have found that inflammatory agents such as LPS        TNFalpha ILbeta and PMA amplify the cytotoxicity of        CEES to RAW macrophages There is evidence suggesting        that CEES can modulate levels of inflammatory cytokines but        this information is controversial and inconsistent        Cultured monocytes exposed to CEES show a transient        increase in TNFalpha     Similarly cultured normal        human keratinocytes exposed to CEES show a transient        increase in both TNFalpha and ILbeta      In        contrast to the results of Arroyo et al              Ricketts et al    found that ILbeta or TNFalpha        protein did not increase in sulfur mustardexposed mouse        skin Blaha et al     using an         in vitro human skin model found that        CEES treatment resulted in a decreased level of        ILalpha        Sabourin et al    also addressed this issue and        studied the         in vivo temporal sequence of        inflammatory cytokine gene expression in sulfur mustard        exposed mouse skin These investigators found an increase        in ILbeta mRNA levels after  hours that dramatically        increased between  hours post exposure            Moreover immunohistochemical studies showed an increase in        tissue levels of ILbeta     The         in vitro results reported here        support a role for inflammatory cytokines in the mechanism        and kinetics of CEES toxicity Our unique findings with        regards to LPS are significant because they demonstrate        that this bacterial endotoxin enhances CEES toxicity even        when present at extremely low levels ie nanograms of        LPS per ml        LPS is ubiquitous and is present in serum tap water        and dust Military and civilian personnel would indeed        always have some degree of exposure to environmental LPS        which could increase the toxicity of sulfur mustard In        addition there is always the possibility of purposeful LPS        exposure Our primary future goals are to understand the        general mechanism for the enhanced toxicity of CEES in the        presence of inflammatory agents and use this information to        develop effective countermeasures Our experiments with PMA        Table  suggest that the activation of protein kinase C        may play a key role in molecular mechanism whereby LPS        enhances the cytotoxic of CEES        In experiments that will be reported elsewhere we have        found the antioxidants such as RRRalphatocopherol and        Nacetylcysteine are effective in reducing the cytotoxic        effects of CEES on LPSstimulated macrophages We have also        initiated experiments to distinguish the roles of apoptosis        and necrosis in the observation reported here                    Conclusions        Our results suggest that that LPS dramatically enhances        the toxicity of sulfur mustard Since LPS is a ubiquitous        agent in the natural environment its presence is likely to        be an important variable influencing the cytotoxicity of        sulfur mustard toxicity LPS is known to stimulate the        production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFalpha and        ILbeta in human monocytes     We therefore also        determined if these cytokines influenced the cytotoxicity        of CEES The data in Tables and demonstrate that both        these cytokines enhance the cytotoxicity of CEES as        measured by either the MTT assay or the PI assay        Inhibition of protein kinase C is known to block the        secretion of TNFalpha and ILbeta    whereas        stimulation of protein kinase C promotes TNFalpha and        ILbeta production     The data reported in Table        show that stimulation of protein kinase C activity by PMA        also enhances the cytotoxicity of CEES Collectively the        data reported here provide the basis for future experiments        attempting to determine the signal transduction mechanisms        whereby inflammatory agents enhance sulfur mustard

Wasserman et al      Briefly at the          end of each experiment cells cultured in  well plates          with  l of medium per well were incubated with MTT           l of  gml per well at C for
