                    Synopsis                  Introduction          A reduction in the sex ratio male  female is          characteristic of most autoimmune disorders The          increased prevalence in females ranges from a modest           for multiple sclerosis   to approximately  for          systemic lupus erythematosus   This tendency toward          autoimmunity in females is often ascribed to hormonal          differences because in a number of experimental disease          models estrogens exacerbated disease and androgens can          inhibit disease activity    However human studies          have failed to demonstrate a clearcut influence of          hormonal environment on disease susceptibility to lupus          or other autoimmune disorders In addition many          childhood forms of autoimmunity such as juvenile          rheumatoid arthritis exhibit female predominance            Interestingly juvenile type  diabetes is an exception          to this general trend with a sex ratio close to  in          most studies   Therefore it is reasonable to          consider alternative explanations for the increased          prevalence of autoimmune diseases in human females          A unifying feature of autoimmune disorders appears to          be the loss of immunologic tolerance to selfantigens          and in many of these diseases there is evidence that          Tcell tolerance has been broken The most profound form          of Tcell tolerance involves deletion of potentially          selfreactive T cells during thymic selection Thus lack          of exposure to a selfantigen in the thymus may lead to          the presence of autoreactive T cells and may increase the          risk of autoimmunity An elegant example of this has          recently been reported            The existence of Xchromosome inactivation in females          offers a potential mechanism whereby Xlinked          selfantigens may escape presentation in the thymus or in          other peripheral sites that are involved in tolerance          induction Early in female development one of the two X          chromosomes in each cell undergoes an ordered process of          inactivation with subsequent silencing of most genes on          the inactive X chromosome   This phenomenon occurs at          a very early embryonic stage   and thus all females          are mosaic and may occasionally exhibit extreme skewing          towards one or the other parental X chromosome In          theory this may result in a situation in which          polymorphic selfantigens on one X chromosome may fail to          be expressed at sufficiently high levels in a tolerizing          compartment such as the thymus and yet may be expressed          at a considerable frequency in the peripheral soma Thus          females may be predisposed to a situation in which they          can occasionally express Xlinked autoantigens in the          periphery to which they have been inefficiently          tolerized Stewart   has recently speculated that          such a mechanism may play a role in the predisposition to          systemic lupus          This hypothesis predicts that females with          autoimmunity may be particularly prone to this mechanism          of inadequate tolerization by virtue of extremely          skewed Xchromosome inactivation We therefore performed          a comprehensive analysis of Xchromosome inactivation          patterns in populations of females with multiple          sclerosis systemic lupus erythematosus juvenile          rheumatoid arthritis and type  insulindependent          diabetes mellitus and in female control individuals The          results do not provide support for a major role for          skewed Xchromosome inactivation in female predisposition          to autoimmunity however neither is the underlying          hypothesis disproved by the present data                          Materials and method          DNA was obtained from female patients from the          following sources  persons with juvenile diabetes seen          at the Virginia Mason Research Center in Seattle          Washington  multiple sclerosis patients seen at the          New York Hospital Multiple Sclerosis Center  patients          with systemic lupus erythematosus seen at the Hospital          for Special Surgery New York  patients with juvenile          rheumatoid arthritis seen at the Childrens Hospital          Medical Center in Cleveland In addition  healthy          agematched females were studied as normal controls          Employing a modification of previously described          methods   we utilized a fluorescent Hpa IIPCR assay          of the androgen receptor AR locus to assess          Xchromosome inactivation patterns The AR gene contains          a polymorphic CAG repeat which is flanked by Hpa II          sites These Hpa II sites are methylated on the inactive          X chromosome and are unmethylated on the active X          chromosome By performing PCR amplification across this          region after cutting with the methylationsensitive          enzyme Hpa II the relative amounts of the methylated AR          alleles can be quantitatively determined with a high          degree of accuracy variance on repeated assays is          approximately             Skewing of Xchromosome inactivation is expressed as          percentage deviation from equal  inactivation of          the upper and lower AR alleles Therefore the maximal          possible deviation is  in which case all of the X          chromosomes bearing one of the AR alleles are          inactivated                          Results          We examined Xchromosome inactivation patterns in          several different populations The results are summarized          in Fig  A wide range of Xinactivation skewing was          observed in all five groups Approximately  nine out          of  of individuals exhibited extreme skewing greater          than  deviation from a  distribution However          there was no difference between the groups either in the          overall mean skewing or in the fraction of individuals          with extreme skewing           Although the present study was not initiated in order          to examine allelic variation in the AR gene           per se  the data provide an          opportunity to address this question Excessively long          CAG repeats in the AR are a rare cause of spinalbulbar          muscular atrophy   and AR repeat length appears to          have an influence on the biology of certain tumors             In this context it has been shown that          transcription of AR correlates inversely with repeat          length   We therefore compared AR repeat length in          control individuals and patients with autoimmunity No          differences were observed for mean repeat length or for          maximum and minimum repeat length among the five          groups                          Discussion          The reason for the female predominance in most          autoimmune diseases remains obscure The present study          was initiated in order to address the hypothesis that a          nonhormonal mechanism related to X inactivation might be          involved The hypothesis rests on the idea that skewing          of X inactivation might lead to a deficiency of tolerance          induction in the thymus particularly with respect to          polymorphic Xlinked autoantigens The hypothesis          predicts that skewed X inactivation would be more          prevalent in females with autoimmune diseases than in          female control individuals This was not observed          Nevertheless these negative data do not rule out a          role for X inactivation in female predisposition to loss          of tolerance A general model for how this mechanism          might operate is shown in Fig  Thymocytes undergo          selection in the thymic parenchyma and in the case of          negative selection the selecting elements appear to be          derived from the bone marrow and consist mainly of thymic          dendritic cells If the thymic dendritic cell population          exhibits random X inactivation it is highly likely that          differentiating thymocytes will contact dendritic cells          that express selfantigens on both X chromosomes This          situation is outlined schematically on the left side of          Fig  However if there is extremely skewed X          inactivation in the thymic dendritic cell population a          particular thymocyte might not come into contact with          dendritic cells that express one of the two X          chormosomes This would lead to a situation where T cells          may undergo thymic maturation without having been          negatively selected for antigens that are expressed on          the predominantly inactive X chromosome This situation          is shown on the right side of Fig           In order for this mechanism to be physiologically          relevant some assumptions must be made First defective          tolerance from skewed X inactivation should only be          directed at Xlinked antigens that are polymorphic and          for which the individual is heterozygous Thus this          mechanism would not be expected to lead to lack of          tolerance commonly unless there are at least several          highly polymorphic Xlinked autoantigens in the          population that are involved in thymic deletion events          Second if this actually leads to autoimmunity it also          predicts that the initial break in tolerance that leads          to disease should involve an Xlinked autoantigen that is          expressed in a peripheral nontolerizing site or          circumstance          A recent report   has elegantly demonstrated the          importance of thymic deletion events in predisposition to          autoimmune disease The proteolipid protein PLP          autoantigen is expressed in alternatively spliced forms          which exhibit tissue specific expression A nonspliced          variant is expressed in peripheral neural tissue          However in the thymus a splice variant results in the          lack of thymic expression of an immunodominant peptide          This results in loss of tolerace of T cells to this          peptide presumably on the basis of lack of thymic          deletion of thymocytes that are reactive with this          antigen Interestingly PLP is encoded on the X          chromsome However there is no evidence that genetic          polymorphisms control the level splicing of PLP within          the thymus Nevertheless these data illustrate the          potential importance of deficiencies in thymic deletion          for autoimmune Tcell reactivity          The present results suggest that if skewed X          inactivation is relevant to thymic tolerance induction          then the effect does not depend on global skewing of          Xchromosome inactivation at least in the hematopoietic          compartment In this study we examined Xinactivation          patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the          results should reflect the state of X inactivation in all          mesenchymal tissues including dendritic cells X          inactivation occurs at a very early time point in          development and thus the results in one tissue should          reflect the general situation in the rest of the body          However there may be exceptions to this We have          occasionally observed differences in Xinactivation          patterns between buccal mucosa an ectodermally derived          tissue and peripheral blood in the same individiual          unpublished observations This could be a chance event          or it may result from selection for certain Xlinked          alleles during embryonic development as has been          described in carriers of Xlinked immunodeficiencies                     Another consideration is that certain tissue          microenvironments may be derived from very small numbers          of founder cells and thus may exhibit skewed utilization          of one or the other X chromosome even if the tissue as a          whole is not skewed This situation could vary over time          Thus there may be time points at which certain thymic          microenvironments are populated by dendritic cells that          for stochastic reasons all utilize the same X          chromosome This would create a window of opportunity          in which a given thymocyte in a given selecting          location could escape negative selection by antigens on          the inactive X chromosome The likelihood of this          happening would obviously depend on the number of          dendritic cells that are usually contacted by a thymocyte          during thymic selection There is limited information on          this point although Stewart   has theorized that          this number may be as low as  If this is the case          then escape from thymic deletion may still occur in          females who are heterozygous for a relevant Xlinked          antigen even if the hematopoietic cells in general do          not exhibit extreme skewing          In conclusion we suggest that Xchromosome          inactivation needs to be considered as a potential factor          in the predominance of females in most autoimmune          diseases Our inability to show an increase in          Xchromosome skewing in females with autoimmunity does          not eliminate this as an etiologic contributor to loss of          immunologic tolerance Future experiments must be          directed at a detailed analysis of tissue patterns of X          inactivation as well as at a search for potential          Xlinked autoantigens                            Introduction        A reduction in the sex ratio male  female is        characteristic of most autoimmune disorders The increased        prevalence in females ranges from a modest  for multiple        sclerosis   to approximately  for systemic lupus        erythematosus   This tendency towards autoimmunity in        females is often ascribed to hormonal differences because        in a number of experimental disease models estrogens        exacerbate disease and androgens can inhibit disease        activity    However human studies have failed to        demonstrate a clearcut influence of hormonal environment        on disease susceptibility to lupus or other autoimmune        disorders In addition many childhood forms of        autoimmunity such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis        exhibit female predominance   Interestingly juvenile        type  diabetes is an exception to this general trend        with a sex ratio close to  in most studies          Therefore it is reasonable to consider alternative        explanations for the increased prevalence of autoimmune        diseases in human females        A unifying feature of autoimmune disorders appears to be        the loss of immunologic tolerance to selfantigens and in        many of these diseases there is evidence that Tcell        tolerance has been broken The most profound form of Tcell

autoreactive T cells and increase the risk of autoimmunity        An elegant example of this has recently been reported                 The existence of Xchromosome inactivation in females        offers a potential mechanism whereby Xlinked selfantigens        may escape presentation in the thymus or in other        peripheral sites that are involved in tolerance induction        Early in

agematched females were studied as normal controls                          Hpa IIpolymerase chain reaction assay for          Xchromosome inactivation          A modification to a previously described assay for AR          methylation   was used for these studies In the          normal females the AR gene is methylated on the inactive          X chromosome and is undermethylated on the active X          chromosome Furthermore the presence of a highly          polymorphic triplet repeat within the AR gene allows for          the discrimination of each X chromosome in most female          subjects Fig  Thus allelespecific methylation          patterns can be distinguished using this gene          Genomic DNA approximately  ng was digested          overnight using a

was          fluorescence labeled with Fam and TET The FamAR          and the TETAR were used for mock and HpaIIdigested          samples respectively This combination allowed          simultaneous

unlabelled AR and           pmol of unlabeled AR in a  l reaction          The cycling conditions were as follows denaturation          at C min to activate the amplitaq gold followed by           cycles of denaturation at C s annealing at          C s and extension at C s After  cycles          the final extension was done at C min The PCR          products of each sample mock and HpaII were diluted           in the same vial One microliter of the diluted          product was then added to a mixture containing  l          deionized formamide and  l molecular weight standard          GS

inactivation          Two peaks corresponding to two alleles were obtained          from the  Genetic Analyzer for each mock and          HpaIItreated sample The relative intensity of the          larger AR allele higher molecular weight peak  with          respect to the smaller AR allele low molecular weight          peak  was calculated and expressed as the ratio R peak           areapeak  area The ratios in the mockdigested R           M  and HpaIIdigested R           H  samples were calculated          separately and were then averaged for each of the two          sets of duplicate samples For each individual a          normalized ratio R           N  R           H R           M  was calculated to correct for          occasional minor variation in efficiency of amplification          of the two AR alleles This normalized ratio was used to          determine the percentage of inactivation of the X          chromosome bearing the larger AR allele percentage          inactivation  R           N R           N     The degree of skewing          was calculated by subtracting  from the observed degree          of inactivation                            Results                  Fluorescent Hpa IIpolymerase chain reaction assay          for Xchromosome inactivation          Employing a modification of previously described          methods   we utilized a fluorescent Hpa IIPCR assay          of the AR locus to assess Xchromosome inactivation          patterns As shown in Fig  the AR gene contains a          polymorphic CAG repeat that is flanked by Hpa II sites          These Hpa II sites are methylated on the inactive X          chromosome and are unmethylated on the active X          chromosome By performing PCR amplification across this          region after cutting with the methylationsensitive          enzyme Hpa II the relative amounts of the methylated AR          alleles can be quantitatively determined with a high          degree of accuracy variance on repeated assays is          approximately             Two examples of this assay are shown in Fig  In          Fig a an individual with equivalent methylation of          both AR alleles is shown In this case the relative peak          intensity is equivalent in the mockdigested and Hpa          IIdigested samples In Fig b an individual with          extremely skewed X inactivation is shown in whom the          lower allele  bp is relatively overmethylated          compared with the upper  bp allele Thus the X          chromosome bearing the lower allele is preferentially          inactivated As described in the Materials and method          section all assays were normalized to the mock results          and performed in duplicate Skewing of Xchromosome          inactivation is expressed as a percentage deviation from          equal  inactivation of the upper and lower AR          alleles Therefore the maximal possible deviation is           in which case all of the X chromosome bearing one of          the AR alleles are inactivated                          Comparison of Xchromosome inactivation patterns in          normal females and females with autoimmune          diseases          We examined Xchromosome inactivation patterns in          several different populations The results are summarized          in Fig  A wide range of Xinactivation skewing was          observed in all five groups Approximately  nine out          of  of individuals exhibited extreme skewing greater          than  deviation from a  distribution However          there was no difference between the groups either in the          overall mean skewing or in the fraction of individuals          with extreme skewing                           Androgen receptor gene allele size

  opportunity to address this question Excessively long          CAG repeats in the AR gene are a rare cause of          spinalbulbar muscular atrophy   and AR repeat          length appears to have

compared AR          repeat length in control individuals and patients with          autoimmunity No differences were observed for mean          repeat length or for maximum and minimum repeat length          among the five groups                            Discussion        The reason for the female predominance in most        autoimmune diseases remains obscure The present study was        initiated in order to address the hypothesis that a        nonhormonal mechanism related to X inactivation might be        involved The hypothesis rests on the idea that skewing of        X inactivation might lead to a deficiency of tolerance        induction in the thymus particularly with respect to        polymorphic Xlinked autoantigens The hypothesis predicts        that skewed X inactivation would be more prevalent in        females with autoimmune diseases than in female control        individuals This was not observed        Nevertheless these negative data do not rule out a role        for X inactivation in female predisposition to loss of        tolerance A general model for how this mechanism might        operate is shown in Fig  Thymocytes undergo selection in        the thymic parenchyma and in the case of negative        selection the selecting elements appear to be derived from        the bone marrow and consist mainly of thymic dendritic        cells If the thymic dendritic cell population exhibits        random X inactivation it is highly likely that        differentiating thymocytes will contact dendritic cells        that express selfantigens on both X chromosomes This        situation is outlined schematically on the left side of        Fig  However if there is extremely skewed X        inactivation in the thymic dendritic cell population a        particular thymocyte may not come into contact with        dendritic cells that express one of the two X chromosomes        This would lead to a situation where T cells may undergo        thymic maturation without having been negatively selected        for antigens that are expressed on the predominantly        inactive X chromosome This situation is shown on the right        side of Fig         In order for this mechanism to be physiologically        relevant several assumptions must be made First        defective tolerance from skewed X inactivation should only        be directed at Xlinked antigens that are polymorphic and        for which the individual is heterozygous Thus this        mechanism would not be expected to commonly lead to lack of        tolerance unless there are at least several highly        polymorphic Xlinked autoantigens in the population that        are involved in thymic deletion events Second if this        actually leads to autoimmunity it also predicts that the        initial break in tolerance that leads to disease should        involve an Xlinked autoantigen that is expressed in a        peripheral nontolerizing site or circumstance        A recent report   elegantly demonstrated the        importance of thymic deletion events in predisposing to        autoimmune disease The PLP autoantigen is expressed in        alternatively spliced forms which exhibit tissuespecific        expression A nonspliced variant is expressed in periperal        neural tissue However in the thymus a splice variant        results in the lack of thymic expression of an        immunodominant peptide This results in loss of tolerace of        T cells to this peptide presumably on the basis of lack of        thymic deletion of thymocytes that are reactive with this        antigen Interestingly PLP is encoded on the X chromsome        However there is no evidence that genetic polymorphisms        control the level splicing of PLP within the thymus        Nevertheless these data illustrate the potential        importance of deficiencies in thymic deletion for        autoimmune Tcell reactivity        The present results suggest that if skewed X        inactivation is relevant to induction of thymic tolerance        then the effect does not depend on global skewing of        Xchromosome inactivation at least in the hematopoietic        compartment In this study we examined Xinactivation        patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the        results should reflect the state of X inactivation in all        mesenchymal tissues including dendritic cells X        inactivation occurs at a very early time point in        development and thus the results in one tissue should        reflect the general situation in the rest of the body        However there may be exceptions to this We have        occasionally observed differences in X inactivation        patterns between buccal mucosa an ectodermally derived        tissue and peripheral blood mesoderm in the same        individual unpublished observations This could be a        chance event or may result from selection for certain        Xlinked alleles during embryonic development as has been        described in carriers of Xlinked immunodeficiencies          However in general subsets of cells within the        hematopoietic compartment do not display differences in        Xinactivation patterns unpublished observations        Another consideration is that certain tissue        microenvironments may be derived from very small numbers of        founder cells and thus may exhibit skewed utilization of        one or the other X chromosome even if the tissue as a        whole is not skewed This situation could vary over time        Thus there may be time points at which certain thymic        microenvironments are populated by dendritic cells that        for stochastic reasons all utilize the same X chromosome        This would create a window of opportunity in which a        given thymocyte in a given selecting location could        escape negative selection by antigens on the inactive X        chromosome The likelihood of this happening would        obviously depend on the number of dendritic cells that are        usually contacted by a thymocyte during thymic selection        There is limited information on this point although        Stewart   has theorized that this number may be as low        as  If this is the case escape from thymic deletion may        still occur in females who are heterozygous for a relevant        Xlinked antigen even if the hematopoietic cells in        general do not exhibit extreme skewing        If the latter scenario is operative it will be        extremely difficult to document it by studying        Xinactivation patterns One might examine Xinactivation        skewing specifically in thymic dendritic populations but        if the effect is at the level of microenvironment and        varies over time then it will not be possible to detect        this using methods directed at large cell populations as        we have done here Conceivably examination of thymic        tissue sections could provide support for the hypothesis        Another aspect of this is that some thymic deletion events        appear to be mediated by thymic epithelial cells at the        corticomedullary junction Interestingly thymic        epithelial cells appear to be derived from very few founder        cells   and thus should exhibit a rather large degree        of patchiness with respect to X inactivation This again        might lead to local epithelial cell microenvironments that        fail to delete for Xlinked autoantigens        It has recently become apparent that mechanisms of        peripheral tolerance also exist and we have considered the        possibility that skewed X inactivation in a peripheral        tolerizing compartment might also lead to inefficient        tolerance A major mechanism of peripheral tolerance        induction appears to involve the recognition of tolerizing        antigens by T cells in the absence of costimulation          This may specifically occur in the paracortical regions of        lymph nodes without further progression of the tolerized T        cells into lymph node follicles Because this mechanism        presumably involves circulating antigen it is difficult to        invoke a role for Xinactivation skewing in altering this        process unless the skewing were virtually complete        Tolerance induction by parenchymal tissue has also been        described   and may be a multistage process that is        still not entirely understood Conceivably skewed        expression of Xlinked autoantigens could play a role here        but this would require invoking a peripheral tolerizing        compartment that is limiting with respect to the dosage of        tolerizing cells to which peripheral T cells can be        exposed No such compartment has yet been defined        In conclusion we suggest that Xchromosome inactivation        needs to be considered as a potential factor in the        predominance of females in most autoimmune diseases Our        inability to show an increase in Xchromosome skewing in        females with autoimmunity does not eliminate this as an        etiologic contributor to loss of immunologic tolerance        Future experiments must be directed at detailed analysis of        tissue patterns of X inactivation as well as at a search        for potential Xlinked autoantigens
