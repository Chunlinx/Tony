                so um you said you dont have kids but um youre interested in the topic   well yeah and um actually im very interested we are my husband and i are thinking very soon um about having children and i think that i am just um a little bit uh brainwashed or whatever by just thinking that kids are so wonderful and cute and i cant wait to have one and i dont see the real responsibility of it   uhhuh   um and an actually how dramatically your life can change when you do have children   right   do you have kids   yes yes i have one son whos now uh eighteen and hes a sophomore in college   oh oh wow   and it it does but i was very lucky in that i was um teaching at a university and so basically and lived within walking distance   oh   so i was able when he was little just to um leave him with a neighbor in uh one of these carry cots   umhum   and then go up and teach a class and come back   wow   because i could do my work at home and my my students who were working on their masters degrees and stuff would come to my house and i would meet with them there   umhum umhum   so it was really ideal and then later on um when he was gee maybe two and three i actually took him then i changed to a different school but it was still within walking distance   oh thats great   and um he spent a lot of time in my office because i was uh department chairman   umhum   and um you know really didnt interfere because all his life he had sort of been used to there were quiet times     uhhuh yeah   and so and that worked out great   thats wonderful how is it now i imagine you said hes a sophomore   yes   so this is is he living at home   yes hes commuting its um about       gee he commutes forty five minutes a each way but he has to allow an hour and a half going to school because its too too chancy for him to miss classes   umhum but oh really   and so actually we dont i mean we still spend a lot of time together in the sense that we are always together for dinner and and um then you know hes in the house studying in the evening   uhhum   and he also works and so um he usually calls me   umhum umhum   at when he gets home from school at noon i mean not not checking in but more gee you know missed you you know what with this is whats new type of thing and i think we have a very good relationship from that standpoint but i think its   uhhuh umhum yeah   unusual and i think part of it is that that we were abroad for a good part of the time   thats great oh really   until till um six years ago   where what part of Europe   well i was actually in the Middle East   oh my goodness   so   oh how nice was he raised bilingual as a bilingual was he bilingual yeah   yeah bilingual yes yeah actually um he he was more in a sense raised trilingual in that i spoke Spanish to him when he was a baby   oh my goodness   and then but he always answered in Arabic because he heard more Arabic than Spanish   umhum   and then when we first came to visit my mother he picked up English when he was two and a half   oh my gosh   and he had heard me talk English on the phone but you know he hadnt he really didnt use it   uhhuh that is wonderful boy i i   so   i am Arabic actually my background is um my my grandparents are from Syria   oh where are you from oh okay   and um i wish that my parents had taught me Arabic when i was younger it was really a sort of the taboo language   umhum   when i was little um you know there was the whole and and there still is   cause you they were newly in this country   well my parents were born here my grandparents moved here um   ah umhum   and then had my parents shortly after they moved here   where were they where they what village   in Damascus   oh from Damascus okay   umhum from Damascus all of them actually   oh okay   and um i just i think its a real shame because now i dont have the patience and i dont have the ability you know at my age to start learning a foreign language   umhum   but when youre a  kid you just pick it up so naturally   yeah but see theres a big big issue there because my my family spoke German at home so that we couldnt understand   umhum oh really   and and my um nieces and nephews are not learning their mothers language   uhhuh   so that i think this is a a tendency in the States is because its a melting pot so i think my son had the advantage of we were actually living outside the country   yeah   so there was a reason for him to learn it   yeah umhum thats true   yeah its really hard   yeah do you think that your being in academics um helped your son he sounds like he is very responsible and um you know seems to be concerned about his studies   well im not so sure that its the the academics as much as spending time with him   umhum   and ive been concerned in the States since ive been back with the number particularly in the Washington area where i live now   umhum oh   um  with a seeing how many kids come home to empty houses and like in our court we live in our townhouse court   yeah umhum   and theres seven year olds that come home and theyre locked out   oh jeez   and you know some of the neighbors sort of feel sorry sorry for them and and you know would be very responsible if something happened but the parents arent willing to to pay that person to sort of be in charge and and i think this is   yeah umhum   i you know ive just seen so much of it here in this country that you wouldnt see in in certainly not in the Arab culture i mean   uhhuh yeah oh no that for sure   people people are more important than things so   and then everyone wonders why why like you said that seven year old you know why two months from now hes on drugs or something   hes a terror well hes a terror he just you know climbs on cars walks around the court threatening people with sticks   oh really oh jeez oh well he has no discipline i mean no one is there to tell him whats right and whats wrong   yeah it right now would you continue do you work now   yes i do i work full time and my husband actually is going for his PhD and uh would like to teach   oh uhhuh   and be a professor um hopefully somewhere in the south i i im from Boston and i im fed up with the cold weather really between Boston and Rochester   umhum umhum   but um ideally i would um i want to have a child and id like to be able to be home for a year   right   and i really just selfishly dont want to miss that   uhhuh   and um you know my husbands schedule hopefully will be flexible um in that he could do a lot of his work at home   umhum   and um im not sure i i still want to work i think thats very important   right   to keep that up and i dont want to um you know i dont want to go several years without working outside the house     uhhuh   but um but i think that him being um a little bit more flexible with his schedule will really help us out a lot   uhhuh   so that thats nice thing about teaching   right right that you hell be able to spend more time which is so important   right and i imagine that obviously your summers were a lot lighter as far as work load   right actually we traveled extensively because i was doing archeology and so   oh oh wow   you know he was always able to come with me on all my travels because a lot of the places i went by car of course   umhum oh sure   and i mean you know i was living in the middle of it and i took every advantage and and you know he doesnt dislike travel now he might not like it   umhum   uh you know he might not feel compelled to travel because he has seen a lot but hes very comfortable traveling   right uhhuh umhum   and so   well he has done more and seen more than most people do in a lifetime it sounds like thats wonderful and it it sounds like he really appreciates it too   thats right thats right right you know that that remains to be seen but yes i think so i think so     thats great   so   does he have a girlfriend  oh   no no and and and i find that interesting because hes been two years ahead in the schools here   oh wow   and so he always you know was treated like little brother when the band needed transportation theyd say oh he cant drive so   ah   you know when hes a senior he can drive some of the the younger kids around type of thing   umhum   and he didnt he didnt get his license i mean he was just sixteen when he graduated from high school so   umhum   you know he he has friends but he doesnt have any you know he hasnt really gotten into the social thing   uhhuh   and  hes i think thats all right hes going to it looks like finish his degree first before he gets too involved   umhum umhum well thats a good idea   yeah   you know its its i would love when i was little i had friends and they had enormous families and i would love to have a large family it seems so expensive though       to think about raising a child besides just the the essentials you know clothes and food and this and that   right   i really feel like theres this whole um you know you have to keep up with the Jones or whatever they say and uh you know it just seem like when i you know watch   thats right but you dont have to keep up i mean kids appreciate it more if you dont   really   i think if if things are special and are for them they see that their kids are being bought     umhum   that their friends are being bought by their parents   yeah well i hope so i mean i look at these toys on TV and i just think oh my God they didnt have those when i was little     uhhuh and they dont need them and they dont even appreciate them     yeah   i mean thats my feeling i think you know from what i see a lot of people just   uhhuh   its a token you know you dont have me so you have all these material things   umhum yeah thats true well its interesting well i dont know i think im ready for it a couple of years we got married a couple of years ago and i thought oh my God ill never be ready for a kid   umhum   but i i definitely think i am now   oh very good and it sounds like you have good values and   yeah
