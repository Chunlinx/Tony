              June        Dear Friend      This is not newsletter It is a fundraising appeal      But theres no reason why we shouldnt share good news at the same      time Federal state and local governments are freezing or withdrawing      muchneeded funding sources for people who are truly in need In spite of      that Pleasant Run Childrens Homes with the help of hundreds of      volunteers and others who really care continues to make a significant      impact on the futures of families and kids in need of help      We all hear about todays increases in neglect abuse and abandonment      of those who cant fight back children Yet few of us hear enough about      kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade      The positive side These are special children They come into a      Pleasant Run program whether its for therapeutic help in their own      homes which nurtures whole families through foster care families or in      the familial surroundings of our residential homes      For some its a matter of weeks or months for others its years      They leave Pleasant Run generally ready and able to contribute to      society Were proud of our children and all that they overcome      We are a notforprofit multiservice agency We wouldnt exist if      the need werent there The numbers of children who deserve our services      are rising as quickly as our programs can grow to serve them      Please help us help them Pleasant Run Childrens Homes where good      kids get better      Sincerely      Mary Roth Tom Hirschauer
