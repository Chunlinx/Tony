                     This story its uh its happened about two years ago and uh uh my wife Elizabeth I have a son Jack whos ten years old a son Nick whos eight and uh Alex whos five         And were trying to make a decision whether to buy a beach place beach house or a lake house or a mountain house         And wed read this newspaper on a Sunday morning you know you get these articles about um         you know advertisements about these beautiful mountain mountain lake places and we thought Gosh this is great you know its a combination of both its a its a a mountain place with this beautiful lake that surrounds this this mountain         So um we called and uh this guy answered the phone and hes with the development company its up in the mountains its near uh uh Lake Lure         And uh the guy says Come on up and he says Wha what will you be driving         and uh we said Well a a car or a van you know         Do you is the van fourwheel drive         and I said Well no its not and he says Well you know some of this gets real rugged you know up here and uh its not fully developed the you know you can look at some of the lots if you bring your van you can just look at some of the lots that are developed you know so itll be you can drive right up to it         So um we thought about that and we thought Well lets just take the truck because I have a fourwheel drive truck its got the king cab and we put all the kids in the back smashed them in that little king cab part and got in the truck and drove         And we drove about two hours and it was getting pretty hot you know kind of kind of a miserable ride and we get up and uh get up to Lake Lure into this development pull into the development you have to drive like meandering through this this hillside and we get up to this trailer and uh we thought Well this is you know we thought Well wed be able to see houses and uh you know you could tell this development was not that far along         So we talked to the development guy and he he kind of shows us a map a real rough map of the area and uh so tells us Well you know here here are the key key kind of sites and youre looking for what         And we said Well we want a a house thats kind of in the mountains and that looks on a lake like you had in the newspaper         And he goes Well we got we got SOME of those and I said Well in the newspaper it says you have all your houses are overlooking lakes and he goes Well you know and he could tell we had driven a long way just to you know you know just to see some really kind of rugged area and we he knew exactly what we wanted at that point         He says Well heres theres one lot left that actually overlooks this water and its on a hilltop and uh you know kind of drew it out on this paper map and then we drove out there         Well we start driving in this truck you know I have a fairly large truck and were driving and the roads at first paved and then were driving along and then it goes to stone gravel and then pretty much we keep going and its like dirt turns into a dirt road and then at the end of this road probably the last twenty minutes were driving over tree stumps          to get to this location on this map         And uh we finally get up there         It took us twenty minutes of rough driving in fourwheel drive to get to the top of this hill         And we get get there and we literally had to park between trees that theyd just cut         And uh theyd just clearcut I dont know if you know ever heard what clear cutting is         Clear cutting is you cut the trees down but you leave the trees there then you bring a bulldozer and push them off later         Well they hadnt pushed any of these off so theres these trees on top of this hill         And I kind of drove to the peak of this hill and we could see down on the lake and it was kind of neat but the the the lake the hill the grade down to the lake was just unbelievable it was almost like a cliff         And you know you could it was probably an eight per cent grade very steep grade         So Elizabeth                     Like what degree         More than for less than fortyfive degrees I mean                     It was about uh probably thirty degrees so pretty steep         And Elizabeth ah immediately she looks at me and she goes You keep these boys here you know well stay and well kind of look around but you know um just you keep track of these guys         Well Alex the youngest of course hes just so sick of being in this truck he says Get me out of here you know just Let me out         I say OK everybody were going to get out of the truck were going to kind of look around well do some stuff and then well probably eat breakfast and then well go or ea we had our little bag lunches and then well go down to the lake         And uh we get out of the truck and we walk about ten feet and I I was like walking over logs and trying to get over to a fairly clear area and all of a sudden Alex just goes Snake         Snake         screaming at the top of his lungs you know and it it just it was unbelievable how loud he was yelling how and I thought Oh my God he got bit by a snake         Well I turn around and I go Wha whats wrong          and Alex is pointing at me and I look down between my legs and theres this rattlesnake like Id stepped in this rattlesnake nest         And Im standing there         and I go OK everybody just calm down and you know         And I stepped down on the log and then Ja Alex is freaking out just freaking out hes going Jees Dad Jees         you know my go my sons cussing like I do you know I was so scared         So we walk we walk away from that snake I go Oh my God Im lucky Im not dead you know they could have bit me and then you guys would have put me in a truck and hauled me twenty minutes and I I you know I probably would have died         And I Im like God somebodys trying to tell me something         So anyway we kind of we stayed away from the snake and were kind of walking around and then Jack and Nick they Jacks the oldest and Nick you know is eight and uh they want to go down to the lake and Elizabeths going No dont let them go down to the lake just its too steep dont let them go down to the lake         And uh         we you know theyre just saying Well what are we doing         Were just going to get in the truck and then go back         Lets just at least look at the lake         So I said OK guys         You guys can go go down to the lake just be careful         And uh so they kind of walked over to the hill kind of started walking down and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down and the trees were all cut so theyd grab trees as they were going down         And um I was just watching them and I was up at the top and then I started down Id figured let them go first then Id Id go kind of behind them         I was probably um Id say sixty foot behind them         And um Nick was first Jack was in the middle I was at the back                     And Alex was with Elizabeth                     And Alice Alex stayed with Elizabeth and she was mad at us because we were doing this         Shes up at the top of the hill         And um I said Nick everything OK         you know he says Yeah yeah         All of a sudden Nick and we still to this day do not know why he did this he stood up on this grade and started         running down this hill         I mean the hills no human being could catch         that kind of momentum without gravity pulling him down and he starts running and hes running and you could just see it was like theres no way hes going to recover from this         And hes running trying to keep up with gravity so hes going down this hill and literally falling down the hill but instead of falling down hes running         And what we didnt know was this hill came down and then there was a twenty foot cliff with a big terrace in it and then the hill kept going         Theyd cut a terrace into the hill halfway down it you couldnt see it from the top where they drove trucks down and theyd just clear cut this and down at that cliff the bottom of that cliff was twenty foot in the air literally higher than this ceiling and down at the bottom were just these little like bungee where theyd cut all this brush and theres little bungee stuff sticking out         And all of a sudden I just saw Nick just run and disappear off this cliff and hes just flying like the last thing I saw was him flying         I go Oh my God         By that time Im running down the hill just grabbing stuff like falling down the hill grabbing stuff         And as I saw he hit the ground flat like on those bungees and then flipped two times         He hit flat face first flipped three times I mean end over end and landed in the spread eagle backwards and by the time I came down the cliff hes just grabbing his eyes and I looked down and then I saw those bungees and I thought Oh my God he impaled his eyes and his face and his body with these bungee things uh oh my God         I just flew off the cliff you know and by that time I get to him hes just hes not even breathing and I looked at him I go Nick         Are you all right         And I looked at his nose and his mouth and his eyelids and what hed done hed hit the ground and it was a real dusty powdery         Hed missed all those bungee sticks but the dust and dirt had gone in his mouth and like his nose was filled with dirt it backed up in here and under his eyelids were filled with dirt he was he goes he looked at me and he goes Uuuugggghhhh         He couldnt talk         He says Am I alive         Am I alive         I go Nick what were you doing         What did you think         Wha why what were you thinking to run down this hill         And he goes Well I started falling and I couldnt stop myself and I figured Id rather run down hill as fast as I could and I thought that I could I could outrun it and I saw Bugs Bunny do it on T on cartoons                  He thought Bugs Bunny could outrun you know the speeding locomotive or and it I think his whole mind you know like when the house is falling and Bugs Bunny hops out at the last minute and then lives         Thats what he was thinking thats thats science thats kinetic energy in his mind         Bottom line we got him back up the hill and one week later we bought a house at the beach                  No way somebody was trying to tell us not to do that         Snakes killing our kids you know two hours its hot it was the most miserable time         And Elizabeth and I still to this day say We didnt were lucky that we that two of us arent dead          you know from trying to buy the mountain house         But thats my story
