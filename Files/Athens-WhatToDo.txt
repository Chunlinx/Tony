These were a development from the fayum paintings that covered the face of the dead in the sarcophagi of Egyptian mummies Icons lie at the heart of Byzantine or Orthodox worship in both the Greek and Russian churches and they form a focus for prayerthe characteristic gold leaf used in their production symbolized the glory of God For centuries they were popular souvenirs of the grand European Tour or religious pilgrimage However modern production methods including thin artificial canvas and gaudy synthetic colors saw them lose favorIn recent years there has been a rebirth in icon painting using traditional methods both for church renovations and for commercial sale Natural pigments and egg tempura egg yolk and vinegar binding are painstakingly mixed and applied to a canvas bound over wood The gold leaf is then applied and the whole image is given a patina This timeconsuming work is exquisite and correspondingly expensive Pre icons will require an export permitYoull find massproduced icons in many tourist shops but for quality pieces visit a specialist storeIcons are a very particular form of art and if they are not to your taste there is a whole range of art to choose from Scenes of Athens and the classical sites are extremely popular as mementosEdibles Wonderful foods from the Greek countryside include honey olives and olive oil and nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts All can
