                    Background        Highresolution genetic maps are essential to        identifying and characterizing the genes contributing to        diseases that is they are essential for making the        transition from positional cloning to the positional        candidate approach If the physical order of markers used        for linkage analysis is incorrect the position of the        putative locus may at best be incorrect and at worst be        found not to exist in the true interval We were hampered        in our efforts to fine map the gene for the Blau syndrome        because we were faced with an uncertain marker order in        maps that had many inconsistencies        The Blau syndrome MIM  an autosomal dominant        granulomatous disease of childhood is a rare familial        granulomatous disease     Affected individuals        typically display one or more of the following        granulomatous inflammations that have variable        ageatonset acute anterior uveitis arthritis and skin        rash The phenotype of the Blau syndrome resembles another        multisystem granulomatous disorder Crohns disease MIM         and another autoimmune disease psoriasis MIM         These three inflammatory diseases not only share        phenotypic features but a subset of putative risk loci        mapped to an overlapping region on chromosome  Of the        several putative susceptibility loci for Crohns disease                and psoriasis     the Crohns locus on        q between markers DS and DS  cM from        pterminus    and the psoriasis locus on q near        DS    overlap with the locus for the Blau        syndrome Interestingly another autoimmune disease        ankylosing spondylitis MIM  also maps to        chromosome q however it appears to map telomeric to the        Blau syndrome interval             While our studies were in progress other groups        detected mutations in the CARD gene for a subset of        Crohns disease patients and in three small Blau syndrome        families      The lack of accurate maps is reflected        in the position assigned to CARD in consecutive genome        builds in that CARD should map to the q interval for        Blau and Crohns yet in build  it was mapped close to        the ptelomere of chromosome  In the current build         it is located correctly see additional data file

DS            Here we generated a highresolution map extending        from DS near DS to DS and placed four        plausible candidate genes CES MMP MMP and SCYA in        the map We also excluded the four candidate genes as the        genes harbouring mutations causing the Blau syndrome                    Results                  Highresolution RH map          To generate a framework order of markers we used          three RH panels Table  and the RHMAP program package          We typed the GeneBridge  panel for  markers to verify          that they occurred near or in the interval between          DS and DS The G panel was typed for a total          of  markers and the TNG panel for  markers The          markers were clustered into linkage groups by twopoint          analyses using RHPT and a criterion of a lod score          greater than or equal to  Multipoint analyses were          performed on linkage groups as well as sparse linkage          groups together with markers from other linkage groups          Several multipoint maximum likelihood framework maps were          constructed using the RHMAXLIK program of the RHMAP          package and equal retention probabilities and the branch          ordering scheme options which gives the highest          probability of finding the correct order     The G          RH map see additional data file  blaumappdf          provided an order for the construction of the BAC          contigs Although the TNG panel generated a useful map          there were unresolved regions where it appeared that the          panel did not provide sufficient data to differentiate          between alternative marker orders We merged the G and          TNG data by establishing a G framework map that fixed          the order of a subset of markers Clusters of close          markers containing at least two G mapped markers were          then mapped relative to oneanother using the TNG data          By integrating the G and the TNG maps an overall          contiguous RH map of the region between the markers          DS and DS was constructed in which the marker          order of most loci could be determined with a likelihood          ratio of greater than  over the next most likely          order data not shown                          BAC contig construction          We carefully selected STSs from within or around the          Blau candidate interval to screen two BAC libraries More          than  STSs were chosen from those in known genes          ESTs polymorphic microsatellite markers random genomic          sequences and BAC end sequences present in databases          Construction of a BAC clone contig was initiated by          screening the CITB library with all the STS markers The          clone contigs were constructed based on the common BACs          identified by two or more markers using the RH map          described above and the existing framework map resources          as reference for ordering          We initially identified  unique CITB clones with          one or more STS hits from which a subset of  clones          that contained at least two markers was used to construct           contig clusters see additional data file           blaumappdf These  nonredundant CITB clones in the          contigs covered less than  of the broad Blau syndrome          interval The remaining  CITB clones were redundant in          that they either were identified by a single marker or          were identified by the same markers as the           nonredundant clones Gaps in the contigs were closed by          a combination of DNA sequence alignments of BESs with          HTGS data clone walking using RNA probes from end clones          to hybridize to the RPCI gridded filters and          verification of clone positions by PCR for STSs From the          BAC contigs eight clones from both ends of the contig          clusters were selected for sequencing using T and SP          primers Sequence alignments with these  end sequences          revealed that two sequences CITBNT and          CITBMSP identified one common clone from the          online HTGS which was RPCIB Figure           BES alignment was a very feasible and practical          technique for filling in the gaps with the availability          of an everincreasing number of BAC clone sequences in          online databases Using this approach one gap between          marker DS and Cdad was closed STS marker          DS was initially used to search the HTGS data and          one clone RPCIN was retrieved with           identity BES from clone N was then used to repeat          the alignment searches and identified another clone          RPCIJ which overlapped STS markers Cdad and          WI          Two rounds of clone walking were carried out in order          to either close the gaps or verify the order of the clone          contigs All the plasmid DNAs from these clones were          isolated and completely digested by           Hind III into linear fragments for          runoff transcription Since RNA probes were directly          transcribed from human genomic sequence it was necessary          to test the probes for repetitive sequences The presence          of repetitive sequences can hinder the specific          identification of BAC clones from the library filters Of           probes tested three probes produced multiple bands          with the genomic DNA indicating that they contained          repetitive sequences and were therefore excluded from          further analyses We identified more than  clones from          the RPCI library of which  were incorporated see          additional data file  blaumappdf After one round of          clone walking the physical map covered more than  of          the broad Blau syndrome interval A second round          increased coverage to greater than  Three unresolved          gaps remain in the physical map see additional data file           blaumappdf                          Comparison of BAC contig to other maps          We compared our map to the current July            contigs generated by fingerprinting and available from          the FPC database at Washington University Genome          Sequencing Center The FPC database has few clones from          the CITB library and none that corresponded to the clones          on our map see additional data file           blaumappdf          Of  RPCI clones in our contigs  were present          in the FPC database  was not placed on a contig  were

  blaumappdf FPC contig ctg is oriented qtelomere          to centromere ie reversed with respect to our map One          clone D was placed in ctg however our data          suggest it should be in ctg close to K and          I Our data also reversed the order of clones          E K and L in ctg Aside from one          minor difference with respect to clone I that our          data place slightly closer to the q telomere the          remaining  clones of contig ctg that were common          to both maps agreed very well There was a single clone          in ctg J that our data place in ctg near          I Interestingly one of the clones F that          was placed on a contig from a different chromosome was          the clone that contains all or part of CARD          The NCBI build current at the time our map was being          finalized was build  see additional data file           blaumappdf There were a large number of discrepancies          between our map and the build  map The gene          subsequently characterized as having mutations in Blau          syndrome families was not in the interval The          discrepancies largely remained until builds  and           Build  the current build of NCBI agrees very well          with our map see additional data file           blaumappdf                          Candidate genes          Four genes CES MMP MMP and SCYA with          relevant biochemical functions based on the literature          and with map locations in the broad Blau susceptibility          region as defined by our initial DNA linkage study for          the Blau syndrome     were considered as candidates          CES is expressed in mature monocytes and macrophages          and is involved in the degradation of xenobiotics              MMP or MMP or both are connective tissue degrading          enzymes     A hypothetical role for MMP and MMP          in the Blau syndrome is that aberrant expression of MMP          and MMP could inappropriately degrade connective          tissue which in turn could release stored cytokines          and inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor           and interleukins and potentially expose neoepitopes          SCYA is a member of the CC group of chemokines that is          involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes                It is a chemoattractant for T lymphocytes          and is expressed constitutively in thymus and transiently          in stimulated peripheral blood monocytes              Interestingly high levels of expression of SCYA were          observed in lipopolysaccharidestimulated human monocytes              Sekiya et al    showed that SCYA          potentially played a role via a paracrine mechanism in          the development of allergic respiratory diseases Thus          inappropriate topical expression of SCYA could induce a          localized immune or autoimmune response          A total of  sequence variants were identified in the          promoter region of the CES gene Table  by sequencing           members from the Blau families Seven thirteenmarker          haplotypes could be assigned unambiguously Table           using extended pedigree structures data not shown          however none of them was associated with the Blau          syndrome phenotype The CES gene was therefore          excluded as a candidate for the Blau syndrome          RH mapping of CES and MMP placed them close and          centromeric to DS see additional data file           blaumappdf whereas MMP and SCYA mapped telomeric          to DS The MMP locus was placed between DS          and DS using the GeneBridge  RH panel CES and          MMP were mapped to clones in the BAC contigs see          additional data file  blaumappdf whereas SCYA and          the markers Cdajb and R were mapped to the BAC          clones CITBI CITBK and CITBH which          map  Mbp telomeric to DS according to the NCBI          human genomic data data not shown Our own RH distance          estimates also place these markers more than  Mbp          telomeric to DS In our G RH map CES was located          outside a subsequently refined Blau syndrome interval          that excluded several cM centromeric to DS thus          confirming the lack of association between CES          haplotypes and the disease phenotype          Mutations were characterized in the gene CARD for a          few small families with the Blau syndrome      We          have characterized additional mutations in Blau syndrome          families however only five of ten families had          mutations in the exons and flanking sequences X Wang          H Kuivaniemi G Bonavita L Mutkus U Mau E Blau          N Inohara G Nunez G Tromp and CJ

of accurate physical and genetic maps Here we        employed BAC contig and RH mapping to construct a        highresolution physical map which spans approximately         Mbp of chromosome  between markers DS and DS        This map will definitely assist in the refinement of the        Blau syndrome locus as well as other loci mapping to this        region such as Crohns disease     psoriasis    and        possibly ankylosing spondylitis             We constructed a highresolution RH map likelihood        ratio of greater than  over the next likely order        with the mediumresolution G and highresolution TNG        wholegenome RH panels Figure  This map allowed        ordering of the polymorphic markers and estimation of the        distances between them The marker order provided the basis        for construction of the BAC contig The intermarker        distances estimated from RH data were substantiated by the        BAC contig data when the average length of the BAC inserts        was used to estimate intermarker distances Our BAC contig        provides more than  coverage of the entire Blau        susceptibility region The STSbased highresolution        physical contig consists of  BACs and spans        approximately  Mb as estimated from the number of BACs        in the shortest tiling path and the average insert length        of the BACs We have used our map to refine the Blau        syndrome interval X Wang H Kuivaniemi G Bonavita L        Mutkus U Mau E Blau N Inohara G Nunez G Tromp and        CJ Williams in press        Another BAC contig map of chromosome q constructed by        twodimensional overlapping oligonucleotide overgo        hybridization on highdensity BAC filters has been        published     This map consists of  overgo markers        and  BACs providing   coverage of the long arm        of chromosome  This contig map however does not cover        the entire Blau syndrome region it ends at the site of        marker DS in our physical contig see additional data        file  The order for most of the markers is the same on        the two independently generated maps Nevertheless there        are a few differences For example Han et al           mapped the marker DS in the order of DS        DS and DS with the markers equidistant at        approximately  kbp We found the order to be DS        DS and DS with interval of approximately  kbp        and  kbp respectively Also the Han et al    map        has six regions in the Blau susceptibility interval which        are either spanned with tenuous support or none at all Two        are real gaps with no overlapping clones and the other four        are spanned by few clones that have either unusually long        inserts or are missing some of the markers in the interval        or both        Our contig also contains three gaps that we were unable        to close by clone walking One of them corresponds to one        of the six gaps in the Han et al    map The other two        are located in the region between markers DS and        DS which is not covered by Han et al     The        common gap in both physical contigs indicates either a lack        of STS markers in this region or an underrepresentation of        clones even though two libraries were used in our study or        both We estimate from RH data that the three gaps are only          and  kbp in size and will not substantially        affect DNA linkage analyses The first gap see additional        data file  is also present in the FPC contigs between        ctg and ctg whereas the other two have been        filled in                    Conclusions        We generated a highresolution physical map from        DS near DS and DS q to q        because the correct marker order was required for further        linkage studies with Blau syndrome families A physical map        was also necessary to locate or verify the location of        candidate genes Although there were substantial        discrepancies as to the location of markers and genes at        the time we initiated our mapping project and even when        this physical map was assembled into a final draft the        current NCBI map based on build  the FPC contigs and        the map produced here agree remarkably well The        convergence of three independently constructed maps based        on different approaches suggests that the current maps are        reliable will perhaps undergo minor changes and will be        useful for mapping of disease loci to the interval                    Materials and Methods                  PCR of STS markers          Primer pairs for most of the STS markers were          purchased from Research Genetics and some primers were          synthesized by Integrated

     and TNG whole genome RH panels Research Genetics were          used to construct a RH map Before typing the hybrid          panels the PCR conditions for STS markers were          determined using hamster and human genomic DNA as control          templates PCR products were separated on agarose gels          PCRs with a band of appropriate size were considered          positive and scored as  negative PCRs as  and          ambiguous PCRs with bands of unexpected size as  The          GeneBridge  RH map was constructed using a publicly          available server at the Whitehead Institute at the          Massachusetts Institute of Technology The G and TNG          maps were generated using the RHMAP  program package              The RHPT program was used initially to determine          twopoint lod scores and all the markers were divided          into different linkage groups Markers in different          linkage groups were used to carry out maximum likelihood          calculations to estimate breakage probabilities and          distances between markers using another program RHMAXLIK          We established a G framework map of a subset of          approximately evenly spaced markers Additional markers          were mapped in overlapping sets with G panel data until          the likelihood ratio dropped below threshold Clusters of          closely spaced markers around framework markers were then          mapped using the TNG data and RHMAXLIK Map orders were          verified by performing independent estimations of          likelihood but including markers from adjacent          clusters                          Screening of BAC libraries          A BAC library CITB which was generated at the          California Institute of Technology in the form of DNA          pools arranged in microtiter plates was purchased          Research Genetics This library offers approximately          sixfold coverage of the whole genome with an average          insert size of  kbp The library is comprised of           distinct recombinants For rapid screening DNAs          from the clones had been pooled into  superpools each          representing eight well plates that were pooled into          eight plate pools  row pools and  column pools          PCRbased screening consisted of identifying positive          superpools followed by screening of the appropriate          plate row and column pools Typically the          threedimensional screening identified one or more unique          BAC clones from the  BAC clones in a superpool          Occasionally multiple positives in a single plate          plate row column resulted in nonunique positives          these also generated falsepositives PCRs were          performed as described above except that  l of pooled          BAC library DNA was used as template and the annealing          temperature for most markers was raised to C to          achieve greater specificity          Highdensity filters of the Roswell Park Cancer          Institute human RPCI BAC clones were purchased from          BACPAC Resource Center at the Childrens Hospital Oakland          Research Institute in Oakland CA Segments  and  of          RPCI with a total of  colonies corresponding          to approximately twelvefold genomic coverage were used          The filters were screened iteratively by hybridization          with pools of RNA probes prepared from the ends of BAC          clones identified either by PCRscreening or prior rounds          of hybridization Hybridizations were performed using          ULTRAhyb buffer Ambion and components of the StripEZ          RNA kit Ambion          Prior to pooling the probes were tested individually          for the presence of repetitive elements by Southern          hybridization to the parent BAC DNA and complete           Hin d III digests of human DNA          Probes that demonstrated a pattern consistent with the          presence of repetitive elements were excluded                          Fieldinversion gel electrophoresis FIGE          To determine the size of important BAC inserts  g          of

the gel was stained with ethidium bromide visualized          and photographed with a GelPrinti system          BioPhotonics                          Verification of positive BAC clones          Screening for BAC clones either by PCR of pooled DNA          or by hybridisation produced a wide range of signal          intensities Although differences in signal intensity may          be considered as a measure of the evidence for the          clones positions in the contig the variability of input          target DNA made the conclusions unreliable Positive          clones were therefore rescreened by PCR with STS markers          in the vicinity to eliminate false positive          Positive clones were purchased from Research Genetics          and colonyblot filters were prepared using a Biomek           Automated Laboratory Workstation with a pin replicator          Beckman Coulter The gridded colonyblots were screened          with individual RNA probes from the pools above All          positive clones were confirmed by PCR with appropriate          primer pairs                          Preparation of RNA probes from the ends of BAC          clones

other than annealing temperature used          were the same as described above          The physical locations of the four genes studied were          verified by using RH panels as described below Their          locations were further refined by screening a BAC          library as discussed below using genespecific PCR          primers MMP and SCYA were located telomeric to          DS and thus outside the Blau syndrome interval and          were excluded from further studies MMP was placed          outside of a refined Blau syndrome interval that excluded          several cM centromeric
