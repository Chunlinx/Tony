                yeah matter of fact its sort of interesting because they do have uh drug testings at the company i work at   they do all right   yeah umhum   how do you feel about it   uh i dont know i was uh for the most part the people that its effected have not exactly been the most valuable employees so i personally think that you know it doesnt hurt the business center the work atmosphere   umhum are all employees subject subject uh subject to it or just a certain   you know yeah its basically new employees   new employees   yeah um existing employees are too but they for some reason they dont uh uh do anything about it you know they dont uh exercise it   yeah what about random testing   they supposedly have it but ive never heard of anybody getting randomly tested   what what type of industry is it Wayne   um electrical engineer yeah hold on just a second   electrical okay  sure   my ninth month old just got hold of one of my three and a half inch diskettes       i think uh that wont last very long write protection just doesnt uh doesnt have any eat protection on it   oh so uh ive ive never been involved in a company that had the drug testing but have been involved in companies that have discussed it one of them very very hazardous type of uh operation   um   drilling oil and gas wells   right   and theres enough problem with injuries in that area anyway uh without contributing to it through drugs or alcohol and you know it it was encouraged its just a matter of a lot of businesses today i dont believe know how to implement a drug program   yeah umhum   uh how to really really have a good one whether its preemployment or ongoing either one   yeah they they i think the way they figured out with us is basically just they can globally say if anybody comes for you know an application white black educated uneducated everyone has to take it   umhum   and that way you know theyre open um and i guess you know our company has a fairly good turnover so i guess they figure that theyll get the majority of employees that way   eventually have everyone yeah it at least run a spot check and i think maybe the knowledge that they could have random testing uh may have an effect too   now i do know of um two employees that were fired because they they couldnt pass   umhum   and i dont know exactly why they were picked out to do the drug testing because i know i wasnt   yeah     but um   i personally dont its easy to see in some industries you know you dont want uh bus drivers or or pilots to be under the influence of drugs and its easy to see that type but   thats right interesting yeah yeah   it can effect uh almost every every office   oh yeah yeah ours is for security reasons were government contractors and they dont want secrets like leaking out   umhum right and   yeah   are if youre government contractor you probably fall under some type of government supervision on it uh   right yeah there are requirements matter of fact i think  levied upon the company to have some sort of drug testing   umhum yeah   but uh   did uh was there much objection to it prior to implementation or   oh yeah there was a a big thing saying that it was you know invading peoples rights and things like that   umhum which is which   you know and but then again its against the law so its like how can they you know how can they be invading your rights uh verifying that youve just been invading the law you know   and people are confused uh i think too by what is a test you we all know about the uh Olympics and the testing there and how some of them can be wrong and   umhum   uh i i think theyre afraid of appropriate prescription medication showing up some of them are some of the innocent ones are and they   umhum well they you know they said that um i dont know if its ever been proven for sure but they were saying that some prescription drugs could show up as being drugs but   i think they can and uh i think a lot of it uh thats thats why the type of type of test is important   yeah as long as they give you another shot yeah umhum   and we we tend not to know uh we tend to think theoretically but lots of times getting down to the actual method and and results uh being evaluated properly is where we have a short fall   right   where are you located Wayne   um in Virginia   in Virginia okay uh   umhum where are you calling from   North Carolina   oh okay   but ive been in in uh Oklahoma for about twenty years so just got kind of got back to this part of this country originally from Virginia   oh oh okay well up im um up near the
