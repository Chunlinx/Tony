        think about this   uh do you have children in school um i have two that are uh now just about ready to graduate from college but i also have two that are just entering school um   i do oh so you see a big difference then in before and now do you or   uh well uh i think theyre just pushing them much entirely to fast   a lot of testing   um well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade my son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesnt get home until three oclock   uhhuh umhum   and i think thats such a long day for a kindergartner   i do too i oh i think thats awful   and uh i have a preschooler um i was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten and i thought well how mature do you have to be   i know really whats the new criteria huh   and uh there is a do you have the standardized testing now   we have all kinds of testing and its over and over its ITBS or and uh just everything everything and they test test test i live in Plano actually and   yeah   i dont know if youve heard of Plano but its a very transient community a lot of people from everywhere its just north of Dallas   no umhum   and its grown in leaps and bounds i we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now and most of them from other places   oh yeah   uh JC Penneys come down from New York and of course TI and Xerox from Rochester and we just have lots of people from everywhere lots of industry coming in and its a very wealthy community   yeah   uh not that i am but other people seem to be and i would love to know why but i mean they do they have i i would i really would i mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes and they have everything     yeah youd like to know what theyre doing right   the kids only wear name brand things to school and its one of these things well it does you know it really does because im a single mom and i have a thirteen year old now and uh you know it does i mean we do it to a point but um   oh me well that makes it hard for you doesnt it oh me yeah its hard to explain to them why you cant   not to where she feels different but some of them are very rich and so um we just kind of have everything here and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are   right   and so i dont know how much of it is us and how much of it is Texas but the kids are expected to excel in everything   oh dear   and its almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody cant be first and theyre expected to be you know their parents expect it   right   the teachers expect it Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system and if you read national surveys theyre far from it   right   and so theres just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests and   how about the kids how are they coping with it   well not very well they bring home notes that say they have to get a good nights sleep and eat right in the morning before tests i mean they make a big deal to me the paper should just be put on the desk that day and say just do this   hum right   you know i just feel they do better that way and yeah and and i have older children too that now are out of high school and   yeah rather than anticipating   uh theyve always done this you know i mean its always been the same but it is its getting worse and worse theres more pressure for everything and i just think its really awful and i im with you on that you dont hear too many people say this but i think its a very long day   oh it is   and my feeling is that you you know youre only a kid once and you dont wanna spend your whole life in school   thats right my son said that came home and he said he said mom all we do is work we hardly ever play and   umhum umhum and i dont think thats right i think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system   oh likewise   i dont  think i should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano i would like to see those things included in our school system because i think we should have well rounded kids   right wouldnt that be great umhum   not just smart book smart kids   right   and so i just find this a real problem i think if theyre gonna be there all day they should find time one of my daughters once was out of school with Mono in her junior year i think it was and she had a home teacher for like four hours a week and when she went back in six weeks she was ahead   is that right  oh my gosh   so what does that tell you the it tells you theres a whole lot of wasted time   oh my gosh   and they could be using this time better   well for example in my sons kindergarten theyre really finished at lunch time after lunch they have some uh im trying to think if they have recess after lunch and then they have naps or rest period   uhhuh   and uh i think either send them home or do something   thats a very long day for kindergarten but i think that working parents have kind of demanded this   a little more interesting i agree i wouldnt be surprised   you know because they dont they dont wanna send them to day care   i doubt if they would say that it was too long   thats why they want them there because then somebody takes care of them all day  so the   um do you have the before school care at your school and the after school care   we have them at some one school like
