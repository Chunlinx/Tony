                                 A Raspberry for Free Trade            Would President Clinton havesuffered his humiliating rebuff over fasttrack trade legislation if theadministration had not wasted crucial months failing to take the issueseriously I dont know Will that rebuff severely damage the world tradingsystem I dont know Is this the beginning of a more fundamental backlashagainst globalization I dont know that either            What I doknow is that the arguments advanced by fast tracks intellectual opponents arestunningly specious Consider the tale of the tainted berries            Heres the story Last spring there was an outbreak of anasty disease known as cyclosporiasis which was eventually traced toGuatemalan raspberries Together with some other incidents this led to ademand for tougher controls on imported produce A few weeks ago Clinton askedfor legislation that would allow him to ban food imports from countries that donot follow adequate sanitary standards in agriculture Intellectual opponentsof globalization gleefully noted a double standard Were willing to seizeshipments of foreign berries to protect yuppie consumers the sort of peoplewho eat raspberries out of season from inadequate foreign sanitary standardsso why arent we willing to protect US workers from inadequate foreign laborstandards Isnt it the same thing            It isntthe same thing as the example of Kathie Lee Gifford will now demonstrate Afew months back you may remember the infernally perky Gifford got some badpress when it turned out that some of her clothing line was produced in CentralAmerican sweatshops employing child labor Since then she has had otherproblems which are more up Bob Wrights alley than mine But it is useful as a thoughtexperiment to ask how opponents of imports would have reacted had the storybeen slightly different            Imagine that the United States imported a lotof clothing from the nation of Freedonia Without question the growth of theseimports had cost some jobs in the United States and possibly exerted somedownward pressure on American wages Economists might point out in theirtiresome way that the jobs lost in the clothing industry were more thanmatched by jobs gained elsewhere They might point out that trade by allowingeach country to specialize in doing what it does relatively well normallyraises productivity and incomes in both countries But these arguments wouldnot be much consolation to the displaced workers or to the owners of theaffected clothing factories and we would surely see a campaign againstFreedonian productsa campaign that would make the most of stories about thelow wages and terrible working conditions in Freedonian factories            Nowsuppose that an investigative journalist visited Freedonia and discovered thatit was all a sham In reality Freedonia was a hightech highwage economyThe Freedonian government had been faking poverty in order to avoid paying UNdues And Freedonian clothing manufacturers were able to undersell their UScompetitors not because of low wages but because robots and computers made themhighly efficient            Heres the question Would the people demanding limits onFreedonian exports say Oh well I guess thats OK then Whom are wekidding The demands for protection would not abate because for the USindustry competing against imports it doesnt matter how the clothing wasproduced  When the US consumer is offered cheaper shirts from abroad theUnited States loses the same number of shirtmaking jobs regardless of whetherthe shirts were produced by workers making  cents an hour or  an hour            Now I cometo berry seizuresnot to praise them sorry I couldnt help myself but topoint out how different the case is For consumers of berries it doesmatter how the berry was produced If it was watered with sewage eating itwill make you sick And for now the only practical way to enforce healthstandards on the product is to enforce sanitary standards on its productionBut if we impose the Inverted Kathie Lee Gifford testasking how our attitudewould change if it turned out that farmers in Guatemala were actually muchcleaner than rumor had itwe immediately see that our concern about foreignsanitary standards unlike our alleged concern about foreign labor standardsis genuine            Are those who want to impose importrestrictions against countries with low labor standards willing to lift thoserestrictions against countries that start to pay decent wages Circa  Japanwas still a lowwage country accused of keeping its workers in rabbithutches in order to pursue its relentless export drive By the early sJapanese wages were actually higher than those in the United States Did theJapanbashers relent In  South Korean wages were only  percent of thosein the United States by  they had risen to  percent Did opposition toKorean exports dissipate            The realcomplaint against developing countries is not that their exports are based onlow wages and sweatshops The complaint is that they export at all And so thesupposed friends of poor workers abroad are no friends at all If they gottheir way the result for the poor Freedonian would not just be no sweatshopitwould be no job And manufactured exports initially based on low wages arethe only route we know for rapid economic development            As I pointed out in an earlier column in                  Slate                the growth of laborintensive exports from Third Worldcountries a development possible only because those countries are able tooffset their disadvantages by competing on the basis of cheap labor hasbrought about a huge improvement in the human condition even if the wages lookmiserably low by our standards            It is hard to believe thatpeople who have spent years even decades writing about economics are reallyso fuzzyminded that they cannot see the difference between protectingconsumers from tainted produce and protecting workers from competing productsOn the other hand I doubt that they are purely cynical It is more likely thatsome kind of doublethink some convenient ability to stop thinking clearlywhen the situation demands it is at work But the truth is that I dontknowand I dont think it matters
