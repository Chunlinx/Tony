                                 Newt Descending            He was persecutedtormented and crucified But at Easter he rose That at least is what NewtGingrichs apostles are saying about him pointing to their mans successfultrip to the Far East and his return to public visibility following thecongressional spring recess            Newt issounding like his old self again Wednesday he called for abolition of both thecapitalgains tax and the estate tax For more on the capitalgains debatesee this Dialogue between Michael Kinsley and John C Goodman In anhourlong speech to GOPAC Monday night he boasted about the Contract WithAmericas influence in Mongolia Once again the historical pedant he explainedwhy the Clinton campaignfinance scandalwhich he previously called merelyworse than Watergateis actually tantamount to the fall of Rome In ancienttimes sending lobbyists and offering bribes to Rome became the easiest andmost profitable route to wealth and power for many local leaders Gingrichsaid If it is proven that the Chinese Communists were trying to funnel moneyinto a presidential defense fund then the Roman model of foreign corruptionwill indeed be raising its head within the American system            Contrary to the media hype and rumors floating aroundWashington Gingrich will probably not be deposed before the next election Toget rid of him would require not just a few dozen defections but a majorityvote of the House Republican caucus There is still no fully plausiblesuccessor and sacking Gingrich would mean Republicans running in  on arecord of catastrophe rather than mere inaction At the same time theprecariousness of Newts position is making him and other Republican leadersact in weird unpredictable ways The speakers shakiness has turned the Houseinto a strange and somewhat silly place            The mostobvious effect of Gingrichs insecurity is on his own behavior which hasconsisted lately of dramatic lurches first to the left then to the rightBefore his China trip Gingrichs comeback strategy was to show that he was notthe radicalright ogre of Mother Jones direct mail He made nice withJesse Jackson and announced that he was dropping affirmative action as anissue He warmly received Alec Baldwin and other liberal actors who came tolobby on behalf of the National Endowment for the Arts Though Baldwin had beenquoted calling him evil Gingrich invited him and the other thespians backfor dinner and declared that the NEA might not be such a bad thing after allConservatives who were annoyed by Newts niceguy act were truly outraged whenhe suggested that one way to get a balancedbudget agreement might be to putoff tax cuts            This gambit was based on what was at least aplausible political calculation If Republicans could separate their tax cutsin the public mind from the domestic budget cuts necessary to balance thebudget Democrats could no longer accuse them of throwing old people into thesnow in order to save money for Steve Forbes The idea was also to do withtaxes what House Republicans had shrewdly done with welfare reform in holding the presidents feet to the fire by sending him a politically popularstandalone bill But the result of Gingrichs suggestion was blind fury on theright Eleven of the freshman hotheads elected in  openly challenged thespeakers leadership In a short shocking article in the WeeklyStandard  Rep Peter King of New York called Gingrich political roadkill In the last Congress Gingrich didnt have to stand for this kind ofinsubordination Faced with an episode of dissent back then he stripped onenonconformist freshman of a choice committee assignment            Nowhowever Gingrich lacks the power to punish and can do little more than suckup to his conservative critics He apologized profusely for themisunderstanding about his comments on tax cuts His GOPAC speech was filledwith rightwing red meat such as a proposed crackdown on the politicalinfluence of unions and a demand that the Internal Revenue Service be broughtto heel On April  he surprised everyone by proposing a more aggressive taxcut than any of his more conservative GOP colleagues calling for an end to alltaxes on both capital gains and estates changes that would cost the Treasurysome  billion over five years In keeping with conservative newspeakGingrich referred to these as the taxes on savings and job creation and thetax on death benefits            Gingrich is not the only one behaving erratically As hemoves to shore up his rightwing credentials his more authenticallyconservative rivals are trying to establish their own credibility in the eyesof moderate Republicans The first to suggest that going after the NEA againmight not be such a hot idea was not Gingrich but the libertarian MajorityLeader Dick Armey When he came out with his putoffthetaxcuts suggestionGingrich was actually endorsing a proposal by ultracon Republican Whip TomDeLay DeLay has been taking sudden umbrage at accusations that he is a tool ofcorporate lobbyists Armey has been losing weight and restraining hisproclivity toward quasioffensive humor At one press conference earlier thisyear he joked Im happy to be blackI mean back and chided journalistsabout their preference for the Old Testament Gossip swirls about the fourwayrivalry among the top Republicans who rank just below Gingrich Armey DeLayJohn Boehner and Bill Paxon The latest rumor has Armey and Paxon teaming upas speaker and majority leader            All thisjockeying has forestalled any real Republican agenda Compared with thehyperactive  th Congress the  th has been a jokeWhat little time it has actually been in session it has spent on issues like aresolution supporting the Georgia judge who posted the Ten Commandments in hiscourtroom and a congressional gold medal for Frank Sinatra Last week theHouse passed a resolution banning the use of federal funds for assistedsuicide Of course no federal funds go to assisted suicide In a caucusmeeting last week Gingrich reportedly said that Republican critics whocomplained he had no agenda werent smart enough to understand it            The most damaging consequence of Gingrichsweakness is the difficulty of negotiating what might be the GOPs proudestachievementan agreement to balance the budget The paradox is that while adeal would shore up Newts position he hasnt got enough power to negotiateone Though the GOP and the administration are quite close on the numbersthose on Newts right flank are likely to portray any agreement with thepresident as a capitulation born of weakness In  Gingrich had the cloutto make a centrist budget compromise stick Now such an agreement wouldprobably provoke open rebellion divide the House and deprive the speaker of aworking majority            The result is a complexstalemate Republicans face the prospect of running in  with a discreditedunpopular speaker who is nonetheless impossible to dethrone and with no recordof accomplishment As the Democratic National Committee sinks deeper intoscandalrelated debt the Democrats can look forward to running without afunctional party organization to support them The lame vs the destituteitcould be a great race
