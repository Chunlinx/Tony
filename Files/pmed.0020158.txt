                            PLoS was founded in October  not as a publisher but as a grassroots movement of        researchers who believed that the results of the global research enterprise should be a        freely available public resource So why did PLoS become a publisher and what are we doing        in this role to serve the worlds varying biomedical researchers and clinicians        At its inception the first action by PLoS was to encourage scientific and medical        journal publishers to make the archival research literature freely available An open        letter signed by almost  scientists from  countries urged publishers to deposit        copies of their research articles in a full text public repository such as PubMed Central        within six months of publication Sadly the vast majority of publishers declined to        deposit their worksa depressing situation that continues to this day        We concluded that the only way forward was to publish our own journals These would        provide an alternative openaccess venue for important discoveries in science and medicine        and would serve as a model for showing that openaccess publication is viable        The first phase of our life as a publisher involved launching our two flagship journals        PLoS Biology in October  and         PLoS Medicine in October  These two journals provide an openaccess        alternative to the best subscription journals in the life sciences and medicine        respectively        These first journals have helped to put open access on the map In the  months since        we started as a publisher not only have many researchers embraced these fledgling journals        as a top tier home for their work but also there has been growing international support        for openaccess initiatives        For example  institutions worldwide have so far signed the Berlin Declaration on Open        Access to Knowledge in the Science and Humanities Beginning this month researchers who        are funded by the United States National Institutes of Health are being asked by the agency        to deposit a copy of their accepted research papers into PubMed Central And in the United        Kingdom the Wellcome Trust is making it a requirement of its grant conditions that        Wellcome Trustfunded researchers deposit an electronic version of their manuscripts in a        UK portal of PubMed Central within six months of publication        PLoS is now entering its second phase as a publisher in which we launch the first three        PLoS community journals The case for launching these journals was compellingwe wanted to        serve three research communities that had few openaccess alternatives to the subscription        journals in their field As a result we are launching         PLoS Computational Biology wwwploscompbiolorg a collaboration        between PLoS and the International Society for Computational Biology scheduled to start        publishing in June          PLoS Genetics wwwplosgeneticsorg scheduled for July  and         PLoS Pathogens wwwplospathogensorg scheduled for September         With the arrival of the community journals we are providing a greater range of        openaccess venues for researchers who wish to ensure that anyone can read use and build        on their work Unlike         PLoS Biology and         PLoS Medicine  which are run by PLoS editorial staff each community        journal is run by the community itselfthat is by an academic editorinchief and        editorial board with production support from PLoS staff The communityled nature of the        new journals coupled with a business model in which publication costs are borne largely by        publication charges provides an example for other journals that wish to transition to open        access        When submitting their work to PLoS how do researchers and clinicians distinguish        between         PLoS Medicine and the PLoS community journals         PLoS Medicine remains committed to publishing the best medical research        that is relevant to a broad international community of clinicians and researchers The        community journals are aimed at a more specialized audience         PLoS Pathogens  for example will publish basic scientific research that        significantly advances the understanding of pathogens and how they interact with their        host organisms But we also think that         PLoS Medicine readers will find much of interest in the community        journals and vice versa and we will crosslink between articles in the different        journals        The different PLoS journals will be editorially independent and submissions will remain        confidential to each journal But if an author would like a manuscript that is not thought        to be appropriate by one journal to be passed on to another along with the reviewers        reports and their identities we are happy to cooperate subject to the permission of the        reviewers This can help to speed up the review process        As we roll out the new community journals we are already planning the third phase of        our life as a publisherthe creation of an online repository for all technically sound        research reports in both biology and medicine including clinical trial reports It is an        ambitious plan but one that we believe will provide authors with more choices and in the        end an openaccess venue for the widest range of research
