                well i know that uh i have only like two or three favorite television shows   uhhuh   i think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen is it Brochco who does like LA Law uhhuh and uh he also did Hillstreet Blues i like those type of shows   oh yeah uhhuh yes yeah we we really enjoy that too   uhhuh   uh i dont get a lot to watch a whole lot of TV we have a couple of young children and so   uhhuh   were usually outside and so its usually the nine oclock shows shows that if we get them in bed we usually watch that and L A Law is one of my favorites   uhhuh oh yeah me too i know they uh i think theyre different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the reruns in the middle of the season   yeah   and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns they start showing some of their newer stuff   yeah   so i thought that was really interesting the way that they did that       oh and so you must watch a lot of uh Disney or cartoons then   well we have on Sesame Street and Mister Rogers that kind of stuff and i think those programs are really good for children i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there   umhum   its kind of nice to know that theyre just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff and they usually   right   uh show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world so   umhum umhum   my son older son hes going to be five and hes more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now so   oh thats true thats true well i noticed that my kids are uh older now theyre uh getting close to the teenage years but they did we watched all of Mister Rogers and everything but even some of your uh cartoons can be very violent   umhum yeah   and uh you know they they talk about death and we were watching uh  oh gosh that Bugs Bunny just last night   oh yeah   and um uh i think it was on uh i have to remember which channel but anyway uh we were watching that and it was talking about opera and they showed like what they thought an opera would be and one of the things was to kill the rabbit kill the rabbit   oh   and i thought oh how violent you know to kill the rabbit  so he ended up killing the rabbit in the end  uh but then of course the the rabbit comes back to life and says well see this is how an opera is supposed to be and i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even uh for a small child   well yeah and you know they especially boys i mean theyre always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff and i dont think that they really realize that death is forever you know   umhum right   and showing them something like that really doesnt teach them that it is   thats right thats right well i dont think cartoons portray that but like   no and to get them to feel like that thats just pretend i think is the hardest part you know   yeah yeah a cat has nine lives   yeah   but they dont  they just have one like we do         oh so thats really funny  but uh weve gotten uhhuh go ahead   i  i was just going to say i know that at least before our kids were born we used to always enjoy watching the Cosby Show Thursday nights usually had pretty good with that and as far as um very good comedy   umhum umhum   i like to watch Designing Women if the kids are in bed by then   yes yes yeah thats true thats a good show i used to watch uh Dallas i dont i dont know where youre at   were were in Dallas uhhuh   Dallas yeah yeah i used to watch Dallas years years ago  and somewhere in the middle i got uh bored and uh so i in fact i didnt even watch the finale uh you know thats about how disinterested i had become   yes       well i did watch it just to see what it was and wasnt it wasnt really that great so i think after a while they just kind of you know theres no new stuff they can do theyve done everything dirty in the book you know so   uhhuh well actually uhhuh yep yep i know i know was was it actually based on a book   well no i imagine   oh but you were just talking about okay   everything you could think of you know had a hard time and i think maybe with Dallas as far as they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first   okay yeah right thats true thats true   where i dont know i never watched Knots Landing but i think theyve had a lot of their characters stay around   stay umhum umhum yeah in if you notice and if you notice on Dallas they lost all the women   yeah   yes so the men mainly stayed but the women were the ones who left and i thought that was very interesting and wondered kind of wondered about that uh well anyway thats a whole new issue  oh goodness so anyway i dont know if our  five minutes are over yet   yeah  oh   but we uh we also have the paid uh television channels uh the only thing i dont like about it especially with teenagers is that all the violence the sex the nudity and the curse words     uhhuh   you know and so i know they didnt pick up these curse words from me so uh they had to have picked them up from uh the T V   yeah   one nice thing though about the cable company we use they have uh they have that little parental uh uh key yeah yeah umhum  so i i have that at home and i keep the keys with me   where you can lock up the channel or whatever yeah   and thats about the only way that i can that i can do it because their natural curiosity you know to go towards that way and want yeah   yeah and i dont know the way the generations are up growing up now i mean i just think they watch so much more T V i try to limit what they watch they arent sitting in the house watching T V all day   umhum umhum   because i think its good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff too so   yeah   and especially in the summer time we arent in the house very much in the evenings its the only cool time to be outside   thats true well and here lately it hasnt been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high     well true     well it was nice talking to you   well it was nice talking to you too   okay talk with you later goodbye   okay byebye
