                                 Boomer Segregation                        Dear Kara            Believe it or not word of your splendid wedding had spread to the EastCoast even before it took place I heard about it last week from Rick TetzeliFortune magazines hot young technology editor who is also I believea childhood friend of yours In that lovably sardonic way of his he describedyour impending nuptials as the event of the season in Silicon Valley Fromyour sweet account it sounds like he wasnt far off I was deeply impressedby the way with your ability to recall the details of the affairthe mainthing I remember about my wedding is what a blur it was By the next day Icould barely recall who was there much less what they said to me Heres thegood news That was  years ago and Im still very happily married I wishyou the same            It is of course ridiculous that there is political hay to be made bytrying to prevent samesex couples from adopting children It makes sense onlyin the context of Republican presidential politicsthat is such extremepositions can rally the hardcore faithful who vote in primaries and thus helpa candidate gain the nomination but will only be a curse once the generalelection rolls around            But the truth is though Im a white middleaged hetero I dont understandthe antigay forces any better than you do One reason is that I live inNorthampton Mass which has a very large lesbian community and wheretolerance is pretty much taken for granted Though not always We had aterrible murder here last year when a yearold boy stabbed a yearoldboy on a downtown street It later turned out that the killer had been tauntedat school by the older boy because he was gay            But another reason I think is that baby boomers in particular have tendedto segregate themselves along political lines as well as class and raciallines Ive lived for instance in Austin Texas Boston and WashingtonDC as well as Northampton I also lived in Paris for two years but thatsa whole other story Although I was considered something of a lefty inAustinand am now somewhat to the right of many of my liberal NorthamptonneighborsIve always had more in common politically and culturally with myneighbors than not There may well be large pockets of gay hatred in the landbut its not something I can gauge because I rarely see it in my daily life Somy impulse is to think as you do that despite the murder of Matthew Shepherdthat gaybashing is fading The entertainment culture also buttresses thisview But I also have to acknowledge that my isolation could be leading mevery astray After all I am also utterly baffled by the extent to which BillClinton engenders so much rage in so many people But obviously he does            Anyway  before the week is out I hope to engage you on your area ofexpertise AOL the Internet as a business and cultural phenomenon IPO stockmadess and so on Just for fun though check out the story in the New YorkTimes sports section this morning about the Toms River Little League teamwinning its first game in the Little League World Series I realize this is areal story for the Times Toms River is in its circulation area andthe team is a powerhousebut there was something awfully weird about the waythe story was written as if it were a big league game with big leagueballplayers Casey Gaynor again baffled the opposing team with a mix ofcontrol and raw power  Even the quote from star pitcher Gaynor soundedlike something Roger Clemens might say I just wanted to throw strikes andmake them hit the ball he told the man from the Times  Geez The kids years old            BestJoe            ps where are you going on your honeymoon
