she has lied about multiple things since I becamefriends with her The other night she asked my opinion about something andonce I told her she seemed fine The next day however she proceeded to calleveryone and repeat the storyonly her version was different from whathappened                                       I sent her a card tolet her know that if Id hurt her feelings I was sorry but I did notappreciate her telling everyone something untrue My question is Should I waitfor her to respond or go ahead and call to initiate the conversation                                       Rumors

softwarebillionaire Dave Duffield giving  million for homeless dogs and cats Whatabout homeless people heshe asks                                       No offense but people who care about animalsalso care about people Dave Duffield has several adopted children in hisfamily People who really care about people usually care about animals tooMother Teresa cared passionately about animals And in my experience peoplewho complain about people who are helping animals are usually not helpinganyone at all                                       The fact is that thiscountry is practically swimming in abandoned pets These innocent creatures areborn bought and then abandonedby people The fact that anyone can be upsetat someone using his own private money to do something helpful when there arevapid rich people doing nothing whatever to help anyone is strangeindeed                                       MichaelMountain                                       Best Friends Animal Sanctuary                                       PS No Dave is not my uncle                        Dear Mic            Prudie knew when she ran the letter from BurnedUp that animal lovers were a fiercely loyal and vociferous lot and said soThe points you make are sound and Prudies view is just well Prudies viewWhile she does like many of her friends pets she also goes to the zoo andsees fur coats pacing around the cages            Nothing you say isarguable People just have different priorities Prudie salutes you for notonly caring about a public issue but also doing something about it For youPrudie would adapt a famous admonition and tell you to Sharpei diem Seize thewrinkled dog and do what you think is necessary            Prudie agreeably                                             DearPrudie                                                      First I would like to say that I really enjoyyour column Not only do you seem to invariably draw interesting and pertinentquestions but also your advice is more often than not that which I wouldwant to hear or would give if they asked me So  I have a question How toput this I am in a committed monogamous relationship with another woman whomI plan to marry sometime in the near future Weve been together a little lessthan three years My parents have voiced an interest in getting to know herparents and while I am all for it I sense some reluctance on my partnersside Recently my parents asked if I would provide them with my inlaws address so they could send them a holiday card My parents are nominallyChristian hers are Jewish I am stalling on handing it over                                       What is the properway to go about this Should I let the adults work this out among themselvesor should I try to mediate I would appreciate any help you can provide on thisissue                                       Much thanks inadvance                                       Anna Nutt                                       PS Pearl Bailey said What the world really needs is more love and lesspaperwork                        Dear An            It is ironic that your letter asks about initiatinga correspondence while your quotation from Ms Bailey pleads for lesspaperwork But to try to be useful Prudie will offer her thoughts            Some folks are looser than others about theirdaughters marrying other women One assumes your partners understanding of herparents outlook comes from knowledge You might want to wait until she feelsthe time is right for setting up the inlaw connection In the meantimecompliment your own parents on their wish to promote the larger familycircle            Just as a littlesomething to think about look on the bright side of not yet having amotherinlaw to deal with You might be sparing yourself a Dragonlike one ofPrudies mothersinlaw            Prudie sparingly                                             HiPrudie                                                      I have no idea whom to turn to regarding thisproblem and I am not sure if even you would know the answer to this questionI came to America three years ago from Pakistan and started in the th grade Having attended an English middle school fullyEnglishno other language I spoke English very fluently and my compositionand comprehension were so good that I won the district essay contest I haveall kinds of friends both Pakistani and American I speak Urdu with myPakistani friends and family and English with others and I can safely saythat I speak more English than my native tongue                                       This is where the problem arises I have beenhere for almost three years and I still havent developed that Americanaccent In fact I am still speaking like I did when I stepped off the plane Iknow a couple of Arabs and Hispanics who did not speak a word of English whenthey came here but learned English with an American accent within ayear                                       Ive tried everythingeven talking to myself ina closed room and even watching Sesame Street  Nothing worksPlease help because now that I am in college it is very frustrating whenpeople ask me whether Im an international student or their first question isWhere are you from                                       An American accentin my view is the key to my success                                       Extreme Privacy Please                        Dear Ex            Calm yourself Your use of a second language issterling The key to your success is what you say not the accent with whichyou say it            Prudie cannot be alone infinding accents charmingand in fact wishes she had one other thanMidwestern Dont spend another minute worrying about this In time you willundoubtedly sound more American
