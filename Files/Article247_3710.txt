                                 Personalities and Issues                        Dear David            Thank you for the sensational news It is reallybouleversant  I too found our exchanges affectedby daily events in this case Dan Seligmans review of The Big Test in the Wall StreetJournal  On substance he is about where we are except that he raises thedread question of heredity about which I will say a few words later But hereminds me about one point of form in The Big TestI was planning to raise and that I think of as a kind of New Yorker phenomenon the remarkable detail Lemann has onindividuals I know some of themJerry Karabel was a graduate student of mineat Harvard and he appears in the book as a professor of sociology at theUniversity of California Berkeley who tried desperately to get the Democrats togo for a counterproposition to the California CCRI rather than fight it headon and lose On the one hand I am irritated at having to spend all this timeon personal background when I am trying to get at the issues on the otherhand I am fascinated to discover for example that Molly Mungers father is apartner of Warren Buffet and so on It seems as if it has been decided bothby writers and publishers that you cant get people to concentrate on theissues if you dont build up the personalities involved            You raise some interesting questions about changes overthe decades I was involved in the genesis and publishing of some of the booksyou mention and why styles and tastes change over the years is a question itis hard to answer I think one answer is the rise of academia which leads tomore specialized books narrower books reaching small specialized audiencesAlmost none of the people you mention as writing those important books of thepast were professorsI think of Jane Jacobs Edmund Wilson W H Whyteor ifthey were they became professors late in life after having been editors andthe like for example Dan Bell and me too As an editor I dealt with some ofthose books            Yes the story in Lemann is well researched indeedimpressively so but the issues are left hanging without sustained analysiswhich would have been possible            A final point heredity One cannot be conclusive onthis but I am impressed at the degree to which serious peopleamong them forexample Christopher Jencks but also otherswere convinced this is animportant factor When we say that social background determines in largemeasure ones scores and indeed I would say ones tested intelligence how dowe separate out the effect of hereditary factors from income educationetc            I think one cant And yet if these factors play somerole and I am sure they do whatever means we try to get to equalopportunityand we should use all of them in principlewont ensure it            Now that we are reviewing reviews of The Big Test  I wonder how much more there is left to say Any lastwords            Nat Glazer
