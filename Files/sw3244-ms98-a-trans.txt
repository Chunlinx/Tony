              my names Mary Dell and i live in the Dallas Texas area where theres a lot of pollution   okay and im up in Wisconsin uh my name is Terry   oh uhhuh   and uh in the small town we dont but uh were not that far from the city where theres tons of pollution   yes   okay ill go ahead and start recording that   okay           okay um just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations and um im sure theres a lot of pollution we uh before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were um   oh   gravel pits and also where they were making tar and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar and   umhum ooh   it would uh smell the continuous you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs so and it was like miles away but just the idea of having that   right   come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that but     umhum umhum   also um where we also lived too it was very close to a highway so we got a lot of fumes from uh trucks   umhum   and cars and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture i mean it was on your tables you would dust every day and it was dirty um   oh gosh   type of uh dust i mean it wasnt the typical dust that you get way out in the country     umhum umhum   um i live in a small um town now quite a ways from the Twin Cities about an hour away and i may dust once a week and thats all it needs versus every day when i lived in the city   huh id never thought about that being a cause i have to dust a lot as well   so oh yeah it it comes right on through through the screens the only way that you could   yeah   actually live in the in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house   umhum my goodness   and so it was quite a dirty city um if if you were well protected by trees which catch a lot of the pollution   umhum   then youre fine but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution and its just going for miles and miles and miles and its landing somewhere with the wind but   umhum   thats kind of the way Dallas is were so flat and open and i live in a suburb that doesnt have much vegetation trees it was all cotton fields so   sure sure   we dont have that advantage and ours i think is primarily cars where we dont carpool like we should   yes yes   an airport i work in a building im nineteen floors up and i look out toward DFW International and theres just an awful brown haze all the time   uhhuh uhhuh   and i can imagine its even worse for people living over near the airport   oh sure sure yeah its i mean our air quality um in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what weve heard about California and maybe in   umhum   the other areas but um they were always talking about the air quality of today is this you know the ozone or whatever and its kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted   yes   and many people are too busy getting to work not thinking about okay i could have carpooled with a friend even     umhum   my husband was uh talking to some of the guys at work now hes uh fifteen miles away from work but he was talking wouldnt it be nice to carpool and the guy says well its too close it wouldnt pay and so   umhum want to meet my own schedule those are the arguments we hear   yeah and exactly exactly and so my husband says well thats fine you know it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and you know the gas   umhum   and no everybody has their preference to drive by themselves or if they do they they drive with one little buddy uh at least its with one person but most of the time people are saying forget it i dont want to carpool its too much of a hassle its too much involvement but yet   umhum   but were paying for it   yes we are and i think of my daughter and im sure you think of your children and you kind of say to yourself what kind of future will they have when they think back and say well my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference and  i think people are trying   umhum   but they have to change attitudes   and it seems to me that its already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections than we had growing up   umhum sure   you can really see it i i had a chance to go to Bolivia a couple years ago and of course theres no industry   umhum   very little trash they they dont even have that much that they burn because they consume everything down to the thread and it amazed me i i just had totally forgotten how blessed   sure sure well they
