                                 Alpha Zeta            Caper movies can often getby with only one great visual idea in the case of Entrapment  itsCatherine ZetaJones in a black vinyl cat suit doing ballet amid a field oflaser beams Shes supposed to be an undercover insurance operative whos outto catch legendary burglar Sean Connery in the act of stealing a pricelessChinese maskor is she actually a thief herself planning to bag thescrumptious Scotsman along with the motherlode A mystery that In themeantime Connery whisks her to his castle on an Inverness loch where he rigsa cats cradle of red string to represent the lasers that she wont at thesite be able to discern As she practices her moves blindfolded thefirelight casts a golden aureole around her sculpted bottom But shes evenmore alluring when she does the deed for real She begins in the lotusposition then unfolds and sends a long leg sideways in a neatly executedfouett  On point  says Connery peering into his laptop screen atthe beams that only he can see Now lift  The whole sequence has anarchetypal enchantment made even more savory by its naughty underpinnings Theaging master directs his prima ballerina in a sacred dance to larceny                           Entrapmentdoesnt hit the rest of its marks with comparable lan but its bearable Withits featherweight premise casually amoral heroes and exotic locales itconjures up an era the s and s when twisty romantic heist pictureswere routinely ground out as tax sheltersand sometimes cast with theproducers model girlfriends so that expensive vacations could be written offtoo Entrapment is an Alist production but despite Ving Rhames asConnerys enigmatically surly cohort and a bevy of stateoftheart sensorscybergizmos and digital readouts it cant manage to brush off its Bmoviecobwebs or to freshen banter that Rhett would have been too progressive to layon Scarlett Has there ever been anyone you couldnt manipulate beguile orseduce asks Connery after ZetaJones has stretched herself languidly out ona plush fourposter In the climax the pair must walk a fraying tightropebetween the twin towers of the worlds tallest building in Kuala Lumpur whilemillennium fireworks explode around them But the bad guys dialogue remainslaughably mired in the last millennium Theyre rats in a trap            E ntrapment is built around the object that isZetaJones who as the headstrong heroine of last years The Mask ofZorro  did a dazzling job of staring down Antonio Banderas She has almondeyes a luxuriant black mane made for hightoned hair commercials and an upperlip that can flare or pout with silken ease Supple physically she isnevertheless somewhat stolidprobably the upshot of a monotonous untrainedvoice of the sort that brings most goddessy supermodels crashing to earth Itdoesnt help that shes opposite an actor who can do a fouett on everysyllable            Connery is also theembodiment of everything unfair in natureto men but especially to womenbeing one of the few male actors who actually makes a plausible heartthrob fora female nearly half a century his junior Youre the most beautiful crookIve ever seen he tells ZetaJones toasting her with that voice while eatingher up with those banditchieftain eyesand you can picture sundry Golden AgeBond girls clucking I remember when he said that to me  sonnyConnery mocks Father Time by disguising himself as an old guy with glasses anda paunch This he seems say is how men of my age are supposed to look Ofcourse one way that performers assist the aging process is by playing rolesthat give their features and emotions a workout Connerysuperb actor thoughhe ishasnt broken a sweat since The Untouchables             David Mametwho coincidentally wrote Connerys marvelousdialogue in that moviegave the American theater a brusque shove out of theromantic realm of disillusioned lefties such as Eugene ONeill and ArthurMiller into a brutal capitalist realism wherein every encounter was reduced toan attempt by one party to hoodwink psych out or otherwise overpower anotherWhod have thought that Mamet was secretly in love with the wellcarpentereds and s drawingroom plays of the terribly English Terence Rattigan whomthe Angry Young Men of the late s loutishly blew off the boardsthus pavingthe way for Mamets expletivelaced theater games In choosing to adapt anddirect The Winslow Boy  based on one of Rattigans most tidily craftedproblem pieces Mamet points up an aspect of his own work that has increasinglydwarfed all others the drama as a procession of archly formal negotiationsBeat by beat Mamet turns out an immaculately staged crisply paced andelegantly acted movie Its also a tad bloodless but you cant haveeverything            Set in England beforeWorld War I the play based on an actual incident tells the story of anadolescent boy expelled from a military academy for the theft of afiveshilling postal money order and the financially ruinous attempt of hisproper patriarch played in the film by Nigel Hawthorne to clear his sonsname Relativist that he is Mamet clearly loves the fact that young Winslowsguilt or innocence is never satisfactorily resolved What matters is that theWinslow causeat least when viewed from the perspective of the boysincreasingly frail but determined fatherhas its own sterling truth More tothe point Mamet can have himself a whale of a time directing a series ofcivilized confrontations that escalate in importancefrom the young man whoasks Winslow senior for his daughters hand in marriage and the precise amountof her dowry to a cunning barrister Sir Robert Morton Jeremy Northam whouses every rhetorical trick he can think of to wear down a Parliament weary ofa twopenny schoolboy scandal            Hawthorne gives Winslow an air of gorgeously ineffablesadness he seems to carry on his ever shakier shoulders the knowledge thatthis gray way of life this England is doomed If only Rattigan had given hima stronger second act This the playwright ceded to Morton the coldheartedEstablishment lawyer who unexpectedly throws himself into an antiestablishmentcauseand who Northam plays brilliantly as an alert snake increasinglyunsure of where to strike For Mamet however the core of the piece isWinslows daughter a snootily progressive ingnue and a suitable romantic foilfor the conservative Morton She is played by Mamets wife Rebecca Pidgeonwhom he means us to find weirdly irresistibleI find her weird and resistiblebut not unattractive having spent much of my early manhood pursuing similarlysmall darkeyed girls who looked as if they had some lewd secret that wouldonly be divulged after a protracted psychodrama The secret of course wasthat there was no secret Along these lines the saucy Pidgeons chief talentis for looking as if she knows something that you dont andeven afterravishing hernever will Clearly this is what gets Mamet through thenight
