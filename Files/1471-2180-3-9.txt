                    Background        The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in cell        motility movement and morphology The ability of soluble        monomeric Gactin to polymerize into filamentous Factin in        a reversible manner is central to the cellular function of        actin      Rearrangement of actin is promoted rapidly        by extracellular stimuli and is facilitated by sets of        actinassociated proteins one of which is profilin            It is now appreciated that a large number of cellular        parasites coopt actin for their gene expression and        replication in the host cell      Due to its primary        role in pediatric respiratory disease and the enormous        human and economic toll it exacts throughout the world the        respiratory syncytial virus RSV and its interaction with        the host cell have received serious attention RSV is a        member of the         Pneumovirus genus in the         Paramyxoviridae family and contains        a nonsegmented negativestranded RNA genome of about  kb            The minimal viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase        RdRP consists of two virally encoded proteins the large        protein L and the phosphoprotein P       and a third        viral protein M K contributes RNA antitermination        function and optimal processivity     In addition to        these viral proteins the RdRP also requires cellular        actin Biochemical reconstitution studies using purified        recombinant actin         in vitro and studies in RSVinfected        cells          ex vivo  demonstrated that actin        functions as a viral transcription factor in both monomeric        G and filamentous F forms whereas the filamentous form        appeared to be particularly important for viral        morphogenesis     Subsequent studies showed that at        saturating actin concentration profilin stimulated viral        transcription even further whereas profilin by itself had        no transcriptional activity in the absence of actin            These results suggested that the interaction of profilin        with actin may be important for optimal activity of the RSV        transcriptase It remained unknown whether profilin plays a        similar role         in vivo         Fusion of the infected cells is a hallmark of all        Paramyxoviruses     the fused mass of cells is called        syncytium from which RSV derives its middle name        Although multiple viral proteins may be required for        optimal syncytium induction the fusion protein F is the        central mediator of the process     Syncytium most        likely provides an efficient mechanism of celltocell        spread of the virus      however its exact role in        productive RSV infection or in the pathology of the disease        has remained unclear Interestingly RSV infection of HEp        cells also led to the formation of actin stress fibers and        activation of the small cellular GTPase RhoA a modulator        of actin filamentation        Inhibition of RhoA        or its interaction with F resulted in the inhibition of        syncytium as well as stress fiber formation and the second        cycle of infection     Recombinant F also activated        RhoA in the absence of any other viral protein            Based on these results it was inferred that stress fiber        formation might be important in some aspects of RSV        infection such as virus spread elaboration of cytokines        from infected cells and contraction of airway muscles that        promotes asthma        The epithelial A cells of alveolar carcinoma origin        exhibit many properties characteristic of the type II        cells such as the ability to produce surfactants In cell        culture A monolayer also faithfully exhibits various        aspects of RSV infection and RSVhost interaction        including robust virus growth formation of syncytia        activation of NFkappa B NFB and elaboration of a        battery of cytokines in response to virus infection                In this paper we have therefore continued        the use of A cells to elucidate the mechanism of        RSVactin interactions and in particular test the role of        profilin in the pathways that are likely to involve such        interactions                    Results                  Viral partners of cellular profilin          The minimal constituents of a nonsegmented          negativestrand RNA viral RdRP are the viral large          protein L and the phosphoprotein P     While the L          protein is believed to possess the basic RNA polymerase          function the P protein serves as its transcription          factor Together these proteins transcribe the genomic          RNA wrapped with nucleocapsid protein N It is only the          NRNA complex and not the naked RNA that serves as the          functional template for the viral RdRP Because profilin          like P also acts to stimulate viral transcription              we first tested if these two proteins interact directly          in a purified system Recombinant Histagged P protein          was immobilized on a NiNTA column and purified          recombinant human profilin was passed through it Results          Fig  showed that profilin indeed bound to P and the          two proteins were identified by staining as well as          immunoblot analysis No profilin bound to a control          column lacking P When an extract of A cells was          passed through the P column a few additional bands of           kDa size range besides the  kDa profilin were          found to associate to the column The identity of these          bands was not determined but we have previously shown          that the catalytic subunit of human PPA which has a          similar size binds to P     The specific affinity          of all of these proteins for the P protein in the column          was ascertained by the demonstration that preincubation          of the A extract with excess purified P abolished          their binding to the column The reciprocal affinity          experiment was not performed because we did not have a          suitable matrix to immobilize profilin          We then tested whether profilin interacts with viral          proteins in the RSVinfected cell An extract of the          RSVinfected A cells was first subjected to          immunoprecipitation by antiP antibody and the          precipitated proteins probed in immunoblot with profilin          antibody Results Fig  showed that profilin was          indeed present in association with RSV P protein lane           A reciprocal immunoprecipitation of the infected cell          extract was carried out using antiprofilin the          precipitate was found to contain P protein lane  as          well as profilin lane  Interestingly when this          precipitate was probed with a mixture of antibodies          against all RSV proteins in addition to P the          nucleocapsid protein N was detected lane  To further          test the specificity of the interaction of N and P with          profilin another antibody specific for the viral fusion          protein F was used to probe the profilin          immunoprecipitate however no F was detected lane                    As components of the functional viral RdRP N and P          bind each other     It was therefore important to          ask whether they need each other or other viral          proteins in order to interact with profilin or whether          they are individually capable of binding profilin To          answer this question we expressed recombinant N and P          proteins individually by transient transfection of          uninfected A cells     and studied their          association with profilin by coimmunoprecipitation          Results Fig  clearly demonstrate that N and P can          each bind profilin independent of each other and in the          absence of any other viral protein          To investigate the role of profilin in hostvirus          interaction in intact cells we sought to develop a          profilin knockdown cell by using RNA interference          targeted against profilin mRNA as described under          Materials and Methods RNA interference is now an          established tool in knocking down specific intracellular          mRNA in mammalian cell culture     and our          laboratory has pioneered its use in virusinfected cells              Results presented later Fig  panel A show          that cells were substantially depleted of profilin at           nM siRNA In our routine experiments therefore we have          used  nM siRNA to achieve an essentially profilinnull          cell These cells were infected with RSV and the          infected cell lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation          studies As shown in Fig  the antiP immunoprecipitate          obtained from these cells while containing appreciable          quantities of the P protein lane  did not contain any          profilin lane           We note here that no stress fiber or syncytium was          observed in cells expressing N and P data not shown          which is consistent with the notion that these proteins          are primarily involved in viral RNA synthesis                          Profilin plays a minor role in viral gene          expression          Because profilin stimulated RSV transcription           in vitro    and associated with          viral transcriptional proteins N and P the obvious next          question was to ask how important profilin was for viral          gene expression in the intact RSVinfected cell Our          ability to knock down profilin now provided us with an          opportunity to answer this question The          profilindepleted cells were therefore infected with          RSV and virusspecific RNA and proteins were quantified          by appropriate techniques In the very first experiment          of this series we sought to optimize the amount of          siRNA and tested their effects on profilin and viral P          protein in infected A cells As shown in Fig  a          progressive loss of profilin panel A was not          accompanied by any pronounced effect on P panel B          suggesting that profilin may not have a major role in          viral gene expression We then extended these studies to          include two different cell lines and other viral          proteins Use of an antibody mixture allowed us to detect          viral G N P and M proteins panels C D In A          human cells panel C there was a small reduction in          these proteins ranging from  to  reduction at           nM siRNA in rat L cells panel D a somewhat          greater reduction about  was observed To test if          profilin had a role in viral RNA synthesis          representative N and F mRNAs as well as the          negativestranded viral genomic RNA were quantitated by          realtime RTPCR as described under Materials and          Methods Results presented graphically Fig  panel E          show that even at the highest siRNA concentration           nM at which essentially all the profilin was knocked          down data not shown  of viral RNA synthesis          continued in A cells whereas in L cells the effect          was slightly more severe with  RNA synthesis          remaining We conclude that profilin has only a minor          role if any in the expression of RSV macromolecules in          the infected cell although it is impossible to rule out          that small amounts of profilin survived the knockdown          and sufficed for viral transcription                          Induction of actin stress fibers by RSV is          cellspecific and profilindependent          As discussed earlier RSVinfection of HEp cells was          shown to rapidly induce the formation of actin stress          fibers and this process required an interaction between          viral fusion protein F and cellular Gprotein RhoA              To initiate studies of its mechanism we first tested          the universality of this finding Three kinds of          established epithelial cells of lung origin  namely          HEp human A human and L rat  were infected          with RSV at various multiplicities of infection moi          and stress fibers were probed for at various times by          staining as described under Materials and Methods          Representative pictures clearly show that RSVinfection          evoked stress fiber response in HEp cells Fig           compare uninfected cells in panel A with infected cells          in panel B confirming previous findings     A          particularly robust induction of stress fiber was also          observed in the rat L cells Fig  panel B In          contrast stress fibers were completely absent in          RSVinfected A cells Fig  suggesting that the          signaling pathway that leads to stress fiber formation is          missing or nonfunctional in A cells          In order to investigate whether the formation of actin          stress fibers requires profilin we knocked down profilin          in the two cells where stress fibers were seen namely          HEp and L Upon RSV infection the profilindepleted          cells failed to produce stress fibers Panel C in Figs            suggesting that stress fiber formation is a          profilindependent process However the loss of profilin          had no detectable effect on intracellular RSV          replication as determined by immunostaining of the cells          with antiRSV antibody It also did not have any          detrimental effect on growth or morphology of the host          cells eg Panel D in Figs   at least up to           hrs of cell culture          As stress fiber induction is a relatively early event          in virus infection one might wonder whether it plays an          important role in intracellular virus growth especially          in the late phases However the results of Western blot          realtime PCR and immunostaining clearly revealed that          RSV replicated equally well inside all three cells          despite the fact that two of these cells HEp L          evoked stress fibers whereas the third A failed to          do so Moreover all three cell lines elaborated very          similar titers of infectious progeny virus in the range          of    pfu ml eg Table  Combining all these          results with the previous ones        we          conclude that profilin is important for stress fiber          formation which is triggered by an interaction between          viral F protein and cellular RhoA However neither          profilin nor stress fibers may be essential for the          intracellular replication of RSV                          Profilin is essential for syncytium formation and          virion maturation          As stated earlier the syncytium has been considered          important for virus spread and pathology     Because          profilin was obviously important in bringing about          cytoskeletal changes it was logical to ask whether          profilin also contributes to the fusion of cell          membranes To answer this question we knocked down          profilin by siRNA as before infected the cells with RSV          and looked for syncytia at various time points          Representative results at  hr postinfection are          presented in Fig  showing that while syncytia occurred          in all three control cells untreated with the siRNA          there were no syncytia in the profilindepleted cells          However the infected cells still exhibited a general          cytopathic effect because as we had shown earlier eg          Fig  the intracellular growth of the virus occurred          at about  efficiency in the absence of          profilin          The next obvious question was whether profilin is          required for the final steps of the viral life cycle          namely virus maturation and egress To answer this we          measured the titer of infectious virions liberated from          the three kinds of profilindepleted cells infected after           hr of siRNAtreatment A representative set of results          Table  show that such cells produced nearly a          thousandfold less infectious virion Longer          pretreatment with siRNA prior to the addition of the          virus did not lead to further reduction of progeny yield          suggesting that  hr of siRNAtreatment was sufficient          to achieve maximal reduction Virus titers were not          affected in control cells treated with siRNA against          luciferase mRNA              To examine the protein profile of the extracellular          virions released from profilindepleted and undepleted          cells the culture media of the two cells were collected          and the virions were concentrated by sedimentation at            g As expected a much larger volume of the          profilindepleted cell media was needed to produce a          comparable amount of virus pellet However when equal          amounts by protein assay of virus were analyzed by          Western blot the two kinds of virions exhibited an          identical profile of viral proteins including F data          not shown In contrast while the virions from untreated          cells contained substantial amounts of profilin          confirming our previous finding     those from          profilindepleted cells were found to be essentially          devoid of profilin data not shown Thus it appeared          that the small number of profilinfree virus particles          that were released from profilindepleted cells retained          infectivity Clearly a more detailed and quantitative          analysis will be needed to determine the relationship          between the profilin content and infectivity of a virus          particle Nevertheless we can conclude that profilin          plays an essential role in the optimal yield of mature          virions from all cells tested                            Discussion        Results in this communication point to the existence of        a number of potential cellular and viral interactive        pathways in which profilin may play a cardinal role In        fact profilin was found to be essential for all three        effects tested viral maturation cell fusion and stress        fiber formation Based on our findings and relevant        published data we present a working model in Fig  For        the sake of simplicity we have depicted profilin as        functioning through actin in all these pathways This is        certainly true for stress fiber induction as the stress        fibers are physically made of filamentous actin For        syncytium formation and viral maturation however we could        not rule out the possibility that profilin might also have        a direct role Knockdown of actin completely destroyed the        cells architecture     and therefore was not a        meaningful approach in these studies Similarly although        the viral F protein is depicted as an important trigger for        many pathways in this model Fig  other viral proteins        and many cellular entities may act as important mediators        at various steps In the following sections we discuss        these biochemical pathways in some detail        The membrane microdomains shown in Fig have recently        received much attention as gateways of trafficking and        signaling      Also called membrane rafts or lipid        rafts they are specific membrane sites rich in        cholesterol and sphingolipids These microdomains recruit        an impressively large number of cellular proteins and        regulatory molecules such as Rho profilin actin        caveolin CD and phosphotidylinositol biphosphate        PIP and have been shown to be important in a variety of        cellular functions in health and disease              Recently a number of pathogens have been shown to hijack        these sites for their entry exit and assembly such        agents include many RNA viruses such as HIV measles virus        influenza virus and RSV         In a very        recent study     filamentous RSV was confirmed to exit        through membrane microdomains and immunological analysis        placed RSV proteins F N and P at these sites Combining        these findings we propose that the activated RhoA utilizes        profilin to bring about a net polymerization of actin in        the RSVinfected cells Fig  The actin filaments may        anchor to specific membrane microdomains and together        both of them make important contributions to RSV        morphogenesis and hostRSV signaling        The cellular role or significance of stress fibers in        general has remained uncertain In fact stress fibers        could very well be artifacts of adherent growth on glass or        plastic surfaces as they are rarely found in cells in        tissues As we stated earlier the absence of stress fibers        in the A cell suggests that stress fibers per se are not        essential for RSV growth either and that one or more steps        of the Virus F  RhoA  profilin  actin signaling        pathway is perhaps missing or nonfunctional in A We        have not found any obvious difference in the expression of        RSV proteins including F between the stressfiber        responsive and unresponsive cells for example compare the         siRNA lanes of Panel C and D in Fig  The cellular        proteins in this pathway are also evolutionarily conserved        and indeed HEp and A cells express comparable amounts        of RhoA profilin and actin data not shown The        functionality of the RhoA of A cells is substantiated by        a number of previous studies such as the need for RhoA in        bradykininmediated activation of NFkappa B     and        the abrogation of H          O          mediated activation of JNK by RhoA        antisense oligonucleotide     Profilin purified from        A cells is also indistinguishable from HEp cell        profilin in terms its molecular weight pI affinity for        polyproline and ability to stimulate actindependent        transcription of RSV genome         in vitro     Thus the inability        of A cells to elicit actin stress fibers is likely due        to an as yet unidentified factor or pathway that may be        altered or missing in the A cells Evidently a detailed        analysis of the relevant pathways in A and HEp cells        promises to shed light on this difference and lead to the        identification of the missing function        Regarding the syncytium it is well established that the        F protein plays an active role in its formation Based on        the premise described above it is conceivable that the        membrane microdomains may serve as nucleation points for        the initial mixing of the membrane lipids with help from F        and this process may then travel through the membrane        eventually producing a completely fused cell mass        syncytium In this paper we have shown an importance of        profilin in this process If this function of profilin is        mediated through actin results from A cells suggest        that the actin filaments Factin involved in syncytium        must be smaller that stress fibers and not discernible by        light microscopy It is possible that short Factin        polymers anchored at the microdomains trigger syncytium        This is so proposed in Fig         Although syncytium is a common and one of the most        visible morphological outcomes of infection by many        viruses including Paramyxoviruses     its relevance        in virus replication has remained speculative Extrinsic        chemical blockers of the F protein inhibited the very first        step in infection ie attachment of the virus to the        cell     suggesting an important role of F in this        step In another study a different approach was taken to        inhibit the intracellular function of F The domain of RhoA        that binds to F was mapped to RhoA residues             In cell culture a peptide of this sequence inhibited        syncytium and celltocell spread of the virus suggesting        that the two might be related and that syncytium formation        required signaling through RhoA     The same peptide        however also inhibited human parainfluenza virus type         HPIV the reason for which was not obvious Moreover        it remained unclear whether the signals that eventually led        to syncytia had any effect of intracellular virus        replication or maturation To answer these questions we        have taken yet another approach in this paper by targeting        profilin However we observed profilindependence of viral        maturation even in subconfluent monolayers where the cells        were well separated as well as in singleburst experiments        data not shown Thus we suggest that profilin has a        direct role in virus maturation independent of its role in        cell fusion We would like to believe that syncytium is an        outcome of viral infection and as such is unimportant for        viral maturation in single cells We do not rule out        however that cell fusion may accelerate virus spread        through closely packed cells such as in an infected tissue        Again it is quite possible that the microdomainanchored        short actin filaments proposed above may allow the        docking and assembly of subviral particles inside the        infected cell Perhaps the observed interaction of profilin        with N and P facilitates the transfer of the viral        ribonucleoprotein to these filaments In the final phase of        virus replication these same short Factins may also        assist in virus locomotion and exit through the cell        membrane As mentioned recent studies have indeed shown        that budding of progeny RS virions occurs primarily through        the membrane microdomains            To sum up profilin can act as a major liaison between        viral proteins and actin and articulate multiple outcomes        for both the cell and the virus involving signal        transduction as well as cytoskeletal changes Fig         Studies in yeast and         Drosophila indicated that profilin is        generally nonessential for cellular viability although        profilin mutants have phenotypes In yeast profilin null        mutations result in cells that are viable at permissive        temperature but grow more slowly are larger than wild        type and are often multinucleate     The         chickadee          chic  gene encodes         Drosophila profilin and         chic mutations produce sterile female        flies      In both species profilin mutations        resulted in defects in actin polymerization              In addition to regulating actin assembly a large body of         in vitro and         in vivo evidence suggests a role for        profilin in signal transduction mainly involving PIP a        major second messenger that strongly binds to profilin           and localizes to the membrane microdomains described        earlier Thus in addition to the actin pathway the        phospholipase C  PIP pathway may also be involved in        profilins role in hostRSV interaction In either case        the relative nonessentiality of profilin in cellular        viability makes it an attractive drug target for the        intervention of viral pathogenesis over a short window of        time It should be noted that besides profilin there are        many other cellular proteins known to modulate actin        filamentation and cytoskeletal dynamics and profilin        itself binds to a large number proteins many with        polyproline sequences      Clearly identification        of the various members of the cytoskeletal signaling        pathway will constitute an important step in understanding        hostRSV interaction and may lead to additional targets        for pathological intervention In this paper we provide        proofofconcept that RNA interference can be a major tool        in dissecting the pathways of hostvirus interaction                    Conclusions        RNA interference using sequencespecific siRNA can be        successfully used to knock down profilin a major        actinmodulating protein of the eukaryotic cell Detailed        studies of infection of such cells by RSV reveals that        profilin is needed for cell fusion which is a universal        response RSV infection in all cell lines tested Profilin        is also essential for the final stages of viral maturation        as profilindepleted cells fail to release infectious        progeny virus Profilin binds to viral transcriptional        proteins N and P but makes only a small contribution in        viral transcription perhaps these interactions allow        docking of the viral RNP complex to the actin filaments In        contrast RSVinduced actin stress fibers form only in some        cells but not in others suggesting a nonessential role of        stress fibers and an involvement of cellspecific signaling        molecules in this pathway Thus profilin is involved in        virusmediated syncytium formation and stress fiber        induction and in viral morphogenesis It remains to be        seen whether these are due to profilins ability to        reorganize the cytoskeleton or due to a direct        participation of profilin in these processes The        determination of the various interactive domains of        profilin and its partners in these pathways may allow one        to design antiRSV drugs that will disrupt specific        hostvirus interactions without extensive cytotoxicity                    Materials and Methods                  Clones

purified by standard Nichelation          chromatography     Purified recombinant profilin and          antibodies against profilin RSV P protein and F protein          have been described previously      Polyclonal          antibodies to RSV proteins G N and M were purchased          from Chemicon International Temecula CA and the          corresponding rhodamineconjugated secondary antibody          from Sigma The pcDNA clone of RSV P protein has been          described earlier     the N gene was similarly          cloned in this vector In transient transfection          experiments optimal amounts of these DNA were          transfected into monolayersgrown cells using the Fugene           reagent Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis IN All RSV          infections were carried out at an moi of

       The N            core of the sense strand             corresponded to nucleotide  of human profilin I          ORF Accession No NM Transfection of monolayer          cells with the siRNA and subsequent infection of the          cells with RSV were carried out essentially as described              Interestingly after designing the siRNA and          successfully using it to knock down profilin in rat          cells we realized that the rat profilin sequence          Accession No X differs from the human sequence by          one nucleotide the underlined G of human is A in rat          The serendipitous success of the human siRNA against rat          profilin suggested that small mismatches may be          tolerated in RNA interference the details of which will          be published elsewhere Substantial tolerance of one or          two nucleotide mismatch in siRNAmediated silencing of          human coagulation trigger tissue factor mRNA has been          reported
