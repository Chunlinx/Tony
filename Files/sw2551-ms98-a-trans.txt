                how are things in your area in that respect   well um starting with my work um were in a uh aluminum can and paper recycling um i work for TI and theres a uh a lot of paper that gets thrown away here so weve started recycling our uh plain white paper   umhum   and we have a a company that collects it and takes care of that that for us uh in the community um Baltimore County that i thats the county i used to live in um they just started experimenting with uh trash pickup where uh one day a week they pick up recycled items and then another day a week they pick up the other trash and uh theyve uh contracted with a company here that has a special truck that has different containers on the same truck you know one that holds paper one that holds plastic one that holds tin one that holds aluminum and uh so theyve theyve started experimenting with doing it um on a very large scale also in Baltimore City theyve started doing it uh theres been a lot of awareness um especially here on the east coast because our landfills are you know so filled now that uh theres just not enough room for all the garbage that we uh that we create   i think weve all heard about the train load from New Jersey that couldnt find a place to dump or something   thats right and the barge from New York that went around the world and   umhum until the garbage all rotted or something       we uh our town is just five thousand people and ive been very discouraged by the local authorities dragging their heals about getting into a recycling program each politician who comes up from election promises that thats going to be real high on his list of priorities but it just doesnt seem to be working out that way uh one of our local city council members who happens to be a personal friend of ours made the statement the other day that there would always be landfills and we just sort of came unglued at that point because if thats their thinking then i think were definitely in trouble here   umhum   because there just cannot always be landfills uh my we have always saved aluminum just absolutely forever and uh im saving uh paper now and glass our biggest problem is that no one will take the paper it gets really difficult to find someone in fact now im donating it to a local church and by giving it to them they take it in mass and then our junk dealer gives them ten dollars just because theyve theyre a church and he writes it off as a donation but its a real problem with with the paper to find that outlet for it after youve got it stacked up   yeah thats uh its been a problem that ive noticed a lot in print that uh um once you have collected this what do you do with it because theres not a whole lot of companies that are taking it theres a lot of people that want to participate and given the facilities will participate and theyve proven that time and time again   umhum umhum   and uh i was just reading some figures this morning that seventy nine percent of the people polled considered themselves to be environmentalists   umhum   and so uh you know it looks like theres a lot of people there who want to do it theres just not a lot of companies out there that know what to do with it another problem that thats uh is plastic milk cartons   um umhum   theyve got a way to recycle them theyve got places that can recycle them into products no problem the problem is that they cant theres no facility to get it from the people that have the raw material the empty milk cartons   umhum umhum umhum umhum   back to the guy who can do something with it   umhum   and uh in order for this company to survive theyve had to uh in their area start sponsoring their own recycling centers   uh   in order to get the raw goods but they you know of course they can theyre limited with what they can do they can only do so much and uh   sure     you know its its a matter of i i dont think you know i hate to get government involved with anything because it always costs more money but um you know its a matter of theyre going to have to pass stricter laws or start making   i know i know um   the garbage collection um more costly   umhum   and once they do that then people will be more interested right now it doesnt matter how much garbage you put out to the road its a flat fee a month   right   if they started billing people by the pound things might change drastically   umhum as far as well thats one way to force them to recycle is that if they bill them by the pound then theyre going to save it and not not put it out to the trash   thats right   uh it we are in an open rural community and we find more garbage on the roadsides when it starts costing people they simply take a bag and pitch pitch it into a ditch someplace uh my  my biggest concern or one of my biggest concerns is is the tires what theyre going to ever do with used tires my husband uh recently retired after thirty two years in a service station and of course   yeah   originally it was no big deal you could get rid of them but now theres just simply no way to get rid of these things and you see more and more of that around about the country where people have have thrown a tire in the ditch or two tires in the ditch and   well actually theres a gentleman down in Atlanta who has invented a process using a certain acid and he can take a tire and turn it into immediately burnable oil   will the will the EPA allow this   it has less sulfur in it than processed fuel oil for the house   umhum   it does nothing to hurt the environment and the heat generated by the process is in turn used to run the machine so its selfsufficient   umhum   and very efficient i mean it it control you know it it  controls its own process it burns it reduces the amount of fuel thats required in order to get out the fuel at the other end um so far theyve demonstrated it on a uh garage size unit that this guy invented theyre currently looking for funding to build a larger scale and i saw this about three months ago   umhum uhhum a lot of these things can be placed in your area because of the density in population and yet they would be  just frightfully expensive to put in our area because of the scarcity of population   well if you think about it if um uh i remember that when they used to take uh they used to pay you to take the tire you know get the turn in your tire when you got your   umhum umhum   and your your husband probably remembers that better than i do i remember there was a time when theyd give you one or two dollars for your used tire now they charge you two dollars for your used tire   umhum right  well he was at the point where if if the customer did not want to take the tire with them he charged them a dollar to dispose of them and still there wasnt really a way to dispose of them this was just to sort of encourage them to take them uh at one time uh not too long ago uh farmers could use uh tires to start a fire burning fence rows which of course was an air pollutant and theyve put a stop to any open burning of any kind and they are fining   umhum yeah   people now i mean it used to be the law was and no one enforced it but they are enforcing it now and and im glad they are however one solution presents another problem well i would like certainly like to see this you know if this is true with this fellow in Atlanta it sounds wonderful   yes i saw it on the evening news and um the guy actually took the oil that came out from the process in a measuring cup turned around and poured it right back into the uh tank   umhum   that he was using to fire the process in order to run it   hum   and you actually um with this process by putting in the tires end up with more energy from the oil   umhum   than you put into the process so its a way of of making a profit off the tires   umhum   and when you stop and look at the you know something like eight million tires a month that are you know discarded you know theres a lot of tires out there that that could go through this process   umhum well i youve certainly hit on the key to any of it whatever were going to do there has to be a profit there doesnt there the fellow who recycles the paper and the plastic and the aluminum hes got to be able to make a profit or he just isnt going to do it   theres not a profit i think the the problem is that theres theres always a payoff to recycling but its hard for people to see it   umhum   because its hard for them its hard to explain to someone that look its costing us you know umpteen thousand dollars a year to bury this stuff in the ground   umhum   and then what is the longterm effect of us burying that in the ground if that stuff   its costing us a lot more than money isnt it   yeah it its going to leak into our water and then were going to have problems with our water and then its going to cause health problems and so there is a longterm   umhum umhum umhum umhum   effect and when you stop and think about it every just about every single thing thats produced can be recycled   umhum um   i mean if its if its uh food you know if its stuff you scraped off your plate it can go into the compost and you know and so its i mean   umhum   it theres a way to recycle everything and and um if your husband just retired then ive got to believe that youve got to be old enough to remember that back during the wars hey recycling was the thing to do i mean you didnt   umhum we didnt throw away anything did we   thats right if you if you didnt recycle you were unAmerican and and that was the bottom line   umhum umhum well we have to come to that now thats all there is to it you do see a lot of positive things uh i saw a printout sheet the other day that im going to to copy and take to the girls at sorority
