                                 Living in a SecondBest World            Attention all shoppers Amarvelous new marketplace is opening its doors Soon thanks to the next greatwave of deregulation due to arrive in neighborhoods across the nation you willbe able to haggle over your electricity rates Whats that you say You are notthrilled at the prospect of a new bunch of utility companies calling you atdinner time to offer you their special onetimeonly package of cutrate pricesfor customers who turn on their air conditioning only after  pm never runthe clothes dryer except between  am and noon and use only fluorescentbulbs            Are youworried perhaps that when most of your neighbors are buying their kilowattsfrom elsewhere your local utility will no longer gladly send crews to restoreyour power in an ice storm Or that competing electricity producers wontinvest in cleaner generatorsor that they will switch to the cheapest anddirtiest coal they can find Or that average prices wont really fall aftertheyve paid for all the new executives and middlemen and advertisingcopywriters and telemarketers they will need in order to compete            If youre suffering such qualms youre probably the sortof person who doesnt appreciate the ample benefits telephone and airlinederegulation have brought            Youresomeone who still thinks it wouldnt be such an awful thing to have a singlephone company reaching from coast to coast because it means you need only onephone card to call anywhere in the country who would willingly relinquishexciting new features such as dialing  extra digits in order to protectyourself against surprise charges by no name telephone companies a funservice my local carrier recently introduced You would just as soon avoid allthose arguments about being slammed for charges by a phone company you didntchoose or being crammed for special services you didnt order            Youre also probably one of those people whoneeds to make flight reservations at the last moment who has better things todo than search the Internet for bargain rates and hates feeling the personnext to you paid only half as much for a ticket You long for leg room andsemiedible meals in coach class You remember when confirmed reservationsmeant the airline would a hold your seat and b feel obliged to find you asubstituteon another carrier if necessaryif for some reason your flightdidnt take off            In otherwords youre someone like me Whats the matter with us Surely we know fromboth economic theory and concrete example that open competition is the bestassurance of consumer satisfaction Companies shielded from market pressures bymonopoly position or government intervention grow fat lazy and indifferent totheir customers Why are we so dubious about the benefits that freely competingtelephone companies and airlines shower upon us            Well partly its because the world keeps offering us moreand more choicesexcept the choice of lengthening the day Weve already gotour hands full doing our jobs and caring for our families and shopping for theeveryday things of life in malls and catalogs and now the Internet We are notwrong to suspect that many of the corporate efficiency gains the economistsextol come at the usually uncounted expense of our own time and convenienceWhen airlines overbook to minimize the chance they might fly with empty seatsthe value of the hours we waste doesnt get counted in their costs Unless itcuts our own employers productivitywhich in hardtotrack ways it may welldoit doesnt even get subtracted from the GDP Ditto the time we spend tryingto figure out whom to call when our phone is out of order In other wordsthese companies are improving their bottom lines by shifting costs frommeasurable cash to immeasurable hassle            Whatsmore there are theoretical as well as practical reasons why deregulation maynot always produce net gains Thats because for much of our day we live inthe world of the second best            Popular economists dont like to talk muchabout the world of the second best because its such a messy place It inhabitsthose sectors of the economy where one or more requirements of purelycompetitive marketsmany suppliers a relatively homogeneous product easyaccess for new companies to the market enough information for consumers tomake the best buyscannot be met to a substantial degree            Sometimesthe operative constraint is physicalyou cant build airports just any oldplace Or entry costs are so high that no one will pay them unless guaranteed areturn at least initiallyas when cable TV was new Sometimes it arises fromthe nature of the enterpriseyou wouldnt want to have to have dozens ofdifferent telephone lines in your house just so you could connect with all thedifferent phone companies your friends might select Sometimes its becausethere are nonmarket goods involvedthe high value people place on personalsafety national security a clean environment or social welfare Sometimesthe products being soldsuch as sophisticated medical carereally are toocomplex for anyone but a specialist to understand fully            Of course no markets are really perfect in this imperfectworld and you want to be careful not to let suppliers exaggerate theconstraints to buttress an unwarranted case for de facto or legislatedmonopoly But secondbest situations abound and heres the upsetting thingthat economic theory tells us about them In the world of the second best itis not guaranteed that a move toward eliminating the market imperfections willmake the market more efficient  In such a situation for example cuttingregulations and increasing competition might make consumers better offor itmight make them worse off There are no guarantees            This of course is not avery satisfactory state of affairs for theoretical economistsor for thatmatter policymakers or speech writers It means that instead of blandlyassuming less regulation is better than more or more competition is better thanless you have to study the specifics of each case very carefully And you haveto keep experimenting with alterations and examining the results as externalconditions change over time And this can be very tiresome for everyoneinvolved            So I cant tell you ifderegulating utilities will necessarily lead to lowercost more efficientelectricity service Or whether the recent move to consolidation among theregional companies created in the federal breakup of ATT will maketelephone service better or worse But a priori neither can anyone else
