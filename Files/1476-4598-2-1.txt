                    Background        Lung cancer is the leading killer of all cancer        patients It is generally classified as small cell        carcinoma and nonsmall cell carcinoma Treatment of lung        cancer is less than optimal and the mean survival for        advanced lung cancer patient is less than one year        regardless what treatment regimen was used     A new        approach other than conventional chemoradiation therapy is        needed for prolonged survival of lung cancer Emerging new        treatment modalities are generally targeted to specific        tyrosine kinases of the tumor cells through basically two        independent approaches     One is to use highly        specific monoclonal antibody to target the membrane        receptors of growth factors important for tumor cell        growth and the antibodyantigen complex evokes host immune        system to kill the tumor cells This approach is        exemplified by Herneu receptor in breast cancer patients        and Herceptin     The second approach is to develop        small organic molecules targeting the specific tyrosine        kinases in the signaling pathway in the tumor cells that        can easily gain access into the tumor cells This approach        is best exemplified by Gleevec and BCRABL fusion kinase in        chronic myelogenous leukemia            Gleevec also known as STI Imatinib from Novartis        Pharmaceutical Inc a recently FDA approved drug for        chronic myelogenous leukemia is an ATP analogue and it        competitively binds to and inhibits BCRABL tyrosine        kinase resulted from the chromosomal translocation t         Gleevec has been shown to induce clinical        hematological and molecular remissions for CML patients            It crossreacts with two other important growth factor        receptors containing tyrosine kinase domains ckit and        PDGF receptors that play important roles in growth and        proliferation of a variety of cell types     Ckit        also known as CD is frequently mutated in        gastrointestinal stromal tumor GIST and the mutated        ckit shows higher tyrosine kinase activity Gleevec has        been demonstrated to inhibit the growth and proliferation        of GIST and induce complete or partial clinical remission        in GIST patients      Recently Gleevec was showed to        inhibit the growth of dermatofibrosarcma protuberans DFSP        through inhibiting the PDGF receptor             As a part of effort to evaluate the newly emerging drugs        for lung cancer we studied the role of Gleevec on        nonsmall cell lung cancer We previously showed that        nonsmall cell lung cancers express minimal negligible        level of ckit Zhang P unpublished Therefore it is        unlikely that Gleevec exerts the effect if any through        ckit on nonsmall cell lung cancer We reported here a        study of inhibitory effect of Gleevec on lung cancer cells        A cells in vitro We showed that Gleevec alone can        inhibit the growth and proliferation of A cells at the        known therapeutic concentration for CML Addition of        Gleevec to A cells with cisplatin induced cell death        synergistically suggesting Gleevec can potentiate the        cisplatin effect on A cells We have demonstrated that        A cells express PDGFR  one of the known potential        targets for Gleevec effect The inhibitory effect of        Gleevec on the A cells is likely mediated through        inhibition of PDGF receptor  phosphorylation We further        tested  lung cancer patients tumor specimens and showed        that most of the lung cancer tumor specimens expressed        PDGFR These results provided important in vitro data to        support the notion that Gleevec can inhibit the A cell        growth and proliferation and may potentially offer a        treatment option for lung cancer either alone or in        conjunction with chemotherapy drug cisplatin                    Results                  Gleevec inhibited the A cell growth in a          dosedependent manner          We first test to see if Gleevec can inhibit the growth          of A cells under the culture conditions We have          chosen to perform the experiments under the normal          culture condition since we reasoned that the effect of          Gleevec on tumor cells if any should be under the          normal not serum free condition Therefore we chose to          add the drug directly into the culture medium containing           fetal calf serum A lung cancer cells were plated          at two cell densities into the  well plates and          Gleevec was added to the culture medium We used the MTT          assays to assess the viability of the tumor cells treated          with or without the drug It was evident that increasing          concentrations of Gleevec in the culture medium inhibited          the growth of A cells in a dose dependent manner The          concentration of Gleevec to inhibit  cell growth          IC was estimated to be around  M Figure           whereas the IC of cisplatin on A cells was estimated          to be  M Figure  We have also seen that Gleevec          can inhibit the growth of human  kidney cells but at          slightly higher concentration  M The IC          concentration for A cells didnt appear to have          inhibitory effects on human  cells Figure  These          results showed that Gleevec alone can indeed inhibit the          growth of A lung carcinoma cells The inhibitory          effect of Gleevec on the A cells appeared to be in a          therapeutic range of the drug as demonstrated in chronic          myelogenous leukemia cells from the patients                          Gleevec potentiated the cellkilling effect of          cisplatin          One of the major reasons of testing Gleevec for          treatment of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma is to see if          the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gleevec and other          potential small molecules currently on clinical trials          can be used as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in          combination with conventional chemotherapy We sought to          see if Gleevec can potentiate the cell killing effects of          cisplatin the leading chemotherapeutic drug for almost          all advanced cancer patients We used the IC          concentrations for both Gleevec and cisplatin to treat          A cells in culture and assessed the viability of the          cells by MTT assays at the different time points Figure           Gleevec  M and cisplatin  M both inhibited          the growth of the tumor cells individually after          treatment of the cells for  hour Combination of          Gleevec and cisplatin synergistically inhibited the          growth of A cells Figure  This synergistic effect          of Gleevec and cisplatin on A lung cancer cells were          not seen for human  kidney cells Figure                           Expression of PDGFR in the A lung cancer          cells          Since the effect of Gleevec is mediated through          inhibiting BCRABL tyrosine kinase ckit and PDGF          receptors we are interested in the potential target for          Gleevec effect in the lung cancer cells We have          previously showed by immunohistochemical staining that in           primary nonsmall cell lung carcinoma specimens          expression of ckit was weak and minimal if any Tang          and Zhang unpublished observation We sought to          determine the expression levels of PDGF receptors  and           in A cells and the primary nonsmall cell lung          carcinoma by immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical          staining methods In A cells expression of PDGFR          not PDGFR was detected with strong cytoplasmic and          membrane staining patterns Figure and  There was no          demonstrable nuclear staining signal We further detected          the presence of PDGFR in the whole cell lysates of A          cells by Western blotting analysis Figure  A cells          were cultured under the condition described and the          cells were lysed and the whole cell proteins were          separated on  SDSPAGE The proteins were transferred          onto nitrocellulose membrane and the PDGFR was          detected with antiPDGFR antibody Santa Cruz          Biotechnologies Inc Treatment of the cells with          Gleevec at two concentrations did not influence the          expression of PDGFR expression in the cells PDGFR          was not detected in A cells using both          immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analyses          Data not shown                          Microarrays and immunohistochemical staining          Existing data suggest that Gleevec can exert its          inhibitory effect on tumor cells through inhibiting PDGF          receptor function and we have shown that the primary          nonsmall cells lung cancer expressed minimal cKit We          would like to see if PDGF receptor expression in lung          cancer patients is frequent finding and this could          potentially provide a cellular mechanism by which Gleevec          inhibits the lung cancer tumor growth We used the tumor          tissue microarray technique using the highdensity lung          tissue arrays from Clinomic Biosciences Inc MA Lung          tissue microarray slides containing  primary lung          cancer tumor specimens with the corresponding normal lung          tissues were used for immunohistochemical staining using          antiPDGFR and  antibodies as described The clinical          diagnoses of lung cancers were reviewed and confirmed          Using clinical diagnostic criteria the immunostaining          patterns and intensities were verified by two independent          board certified surgical pathologists Since          immunohistochemical staining is a semiquantitative          method we scored the staining intensities arbitrarily as            and  Figure  There were  cases of squamous          carcinomas of the lung within the tissue array slide and           of the  cases were positive for PDGFR   of          the  cases were scored    cases   and           cases  positivity  Table  There were  of the           adenocarcinoma specimens that were positive for          PDGFR   cases    cases             cases   respectively Small cell carcinomas were          also positive expression of PDGFR  cases            Two cases of malignant mesotheliomas were negative for          PDGFR The corresponding normal lung tissues were found          to be negative for PDGFR Although there were some          interstitial staining signals for PDGFR the tumor          tissues were negative for PDGFR Figure  microarray          data not shown These results demonstrated that PDGFR          expression is elevated in the tumor tissues compared to          normal lung parenchyma and the expression of PDGFR in          tumor tissue may play important roles in tumor growth and          progression                            Discussion                  Gleevec effects vs drug toxicity          We have shown in this study that Gleevec alone can          inhibit the growth of A cells at the concentration of           M IC This is within the known therapeutic          ranges for patients with CML since the plasma levels of          Gleevec inducing hematologic and cytogenetic response in          patients with CML were reported to be in the range of           gml  M after treatment with           mg day     In our system the level of Gleevec at          the tested concentration was in the low micromolar          ranges and the inhibitory effect of Gleevec on A          cells is likely to be genuine through binding to the          receptor not due to the toxic effects of the drug This          inhibitory effect can also be seen with the human kidney           cells with slight higher IC At the concentration          of  M or higher the inhibitory effect of Gleevec on          both A and  cells were found to be identical          Figure and  Higher concentration than  M in the          cell culture condition is unlikely to be translated to          clinical patients since the adverse effects of the drug          will become intolerable for the patients                          Potential target of Gleevec in lung cancers          Gleevec was designed to inhibit the BCRABL tyrosine          kinase and it crossreacts with ckit and PDGFR              In nonsmall cell lung cancer BCRABL expression has          never been reported and it is unlikely that BCRABL          fusion protein plays any role in lung cancer There has          been no report to link cellular ABL kinase mutation to          any cancer patients except BCRABL in CML although the          detailed cAbl function has not been extensively studied          in lung cancer patients CAbl is a tyrosine kinase that          plays important roles in cell growth differentiation and          apoptosis Although cAbl mutations have not been          reported in human cancers cAbl related protein ARG or          Abl was shown to be regulated in nonsmall cell lung          cancers by hypermethylation Dr Steven Reynolds          National Institute of Occupational and Safety Health          Morgantown WV personal communication ARG shares          significant homology with cAbl throughout the amino acid          sequences Gleevec has been shown to inhibit ARG tyrosine          kinase    Dr Jean Wang Biology University of          California San Diego personal communication although          the functional significance of ARG kinase in lung cancer          is yet to be elucidated          We have studied the expression of ckit CD in the          nonsmall cell lung cancer patients and we found that          approximately  of the tumor specimens were weakly          positive for ckit The level of expression is generally          weak  These results lead us to find an alternative          target for Gleevec because of the low expression level          and low frequency of expression of ckit in the lung          cancer patients                          PDGFR expression in lung cancer          We have shown convincingly that lung cancer cell A          expressed PDGFR both by immunostaining the cells and by          Western blot analysis PDGF receptors are widely          expressed in a variety of tissues and the levels of          expression in normal tissues are minimal Overexpression          of PDGFR has been reported in a variety of human tumors          including glioma and glioblastoma pancreatic and colonic          cancers breast bone and ovarian tumors     In          normal cells expression of PDGFR can be seen in the          fibroblasts and the smooth muscle cells in the lung and          airway     There is so far to our knowledge no          report to link the expression of PDGFR to lung cancer          Since it has been reported that Gleevec can inhibit the          function of PDGFR under the cell culture conditions it          is likely that Gleevec exerts its inhibitory effects on          A lung cancer cells through inhibiting the PDGFR          function                          Synergistic effect of Gleevec and cisplatin on A          cells          We have shown that Gleevec can exert its effect          synergistically with cisplatin Cisplatin causes two          types of DNA damage DNA adducts and interstranded          crosslinking resulting in activation of apoptosis          pathway in the target tumor cells      Our results          suggest that inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of          the potential targets by Gleevec appear to potentiate the          effect of cisplatin in DNAdamage induced apoptosis in          A cells Although the underlying mechanism of such          synergism is unclear it is of great interest to combine          the two drugs in clinical lung cancer patients to see if          the synergy of the two drugs exists under the          physiological conditions It has been widely thought but          never been proven that the specific tyrosine kinase          inhibitors such as Gleevec can be used as adjuvant          therapy in combination with conventional chemotherapy          because the limited clinical trial data suggests only a          marginal benefits using this kind of drug to treat the          cancer alone John Rogers WVU Cancer center ECOG trial          member personal communication Current study results          suggests that Gleevec can potentiate the cisplatin effect          on A lung cancer cells and these findings provide          important in vitro data for further testing the          possibility of using Gleevec as adjuvant therapy for          clinical lung cancer patients                            Methods                  Cell culture and drug testing          Lung cancer cell line A cells were cultured in DMEM          with  fetal calf serum as described The cells are          seeded in well plate at the cell density of             per well as indicated and the tumor cells were cultured          in the medium containing serum Cisplatin was purchased          from Sigma Chemicals St Louis MO and dissolved in          water at the concentration of  mM The Gleevec          Novartis Pharmaceuticals Inc NJ was purchased from          the outpatient pharmacy at West Virginia University and          dissolved in water at the concentration of  mM The          experimental procedure for the cisplatin and Gleevec          treatment was the following The A cells and human           cells were plated into the  well plates at the cell          density indicated and the cells were allowed to attach          overnight The attached cells in the plates were washed          once with PBS and replaced with fresh medium containing          various concentrations of drugs indicated The MTT assays          were performed after  hours of continuous incubation          with medium containing the drugs The values shown in the          figures are mean readings from five wells in each          experiments and representative of three independent          experiments                          MTT assays          We have performed a series of MTT assays to determine          the effects of the antitumor drug STI on the number          of A lung cancer cells and human  kidney cells The          assay is based upon the cleavage of the yellow          tetrazolium salt MTT          dimethylthiazolyldiphenyl tetrazolium          bromide to purple formazan crystals by metabolically          active cells     The tested concentration of Gleevec          ranged from  to  M The tumor cells were seeded into          well culture plate and maintained for culture for           hours before the first compound was added to the medium          The cultured cells were incubated in a medium containing           serum and treated with Gleevec for  hours After          treatment  l of MTT labeling reagent were added to          each well and plates were incubated at C for  h          Following MTT incubation the cultures were solublized          and the spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples was          detected by using a microtiter plate reader The          wavelength to measure absorbance of formazan product is           nm with a reference wavelength of  nm                          Immunofluorescent staining of the cultured          cells          The A cells were cultured as described on the          coverslips and fixed with  paraformaldehyde for           minutes at room temperature The fixed cells were          permeablized with  Triton X in PBS and directly          used for immunofluorescent and immunocytochemical          stainings The primary antiPDGFR antibody was          purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc Santa          Cruz CA The secondary antibody for immunofluorescent          labeling was from Molecular Probe Inc Portland          OR                          Lung tumor tissue microarrays and          immunohistochemical staining          The highdensity lung cancer tissue microarray slides          were made in Clinomics Bisciences Inc MA and was used          for immunohistochemical staining for PDGFRa Briefly          the tissue microarray slides were sectioned at  micron          in thickness and heated to C for  minutes to          deparafinize the tissues The slides were washed three          times in xylene then dehydrated and rehydrated in            and  ethanol The tissue sections were finally          washed with PBS once before going through the antigen          retrieval process The antigen retrieval was performed          using

patterns were reviewed by          two independent practicing surgical pathologists and the          signal intensities were scored at   and  The          staining characteristics of all tumors were summarized in          Table I                          Western blotting          The A cells were maintained in the culture          condition as described above Western blotting analyses          of PDGF receptors were performed using a previously          described method     Briefly the tumor cells were          treated with Gleevec at the various concentrations for           hours The whole
