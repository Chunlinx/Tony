        okay well what are your hobbies   oh they range from from needlepoint to uh anything in the hobby field as far as um needlework is concerned ive had to give it up recently because um ive got problems with uh nerves in my right hand but basically its anything in that hobby line ill try anything including making uh earrings   hum that sounds interesting   i have no love of yard work for hobby work though how about you   well uh my ive got some fairly bizarre but uh i do a lot of flying aerobatics for one   oh fantastic   which a lot of people dont do and uh woodworking i do i do enjoy doing landscaping some landscaping type stuff i build i like i enjoy working with wood and stuff like that building decks gazebos those types of things   oh   so but uh probably if i had to say my most favorite one was probably be uh flying   ive been in a uh glider which as a student piot pilot i loved it immensely   did you oh you actually tried it before   as a student pilot yeah   as a student pilot how long did you do it   uh i was only in one one trip       it was something i would have liked to have kept up but we moved out of Colorado so that was you know that ended that point       but yeah that ill try as far as you could say hobby then ill try anything thats unusual that ive never done once   hum   just to find out what its like the experience oh as       but thats not a constant hobby you know like ill do uh oh ill pick up normally a petit point or anything in stitchery type of line       and if im really bored ill even pick up something and color it but i do a lot of designing also   hum well needlepoint looks pretty i i think you know if its done real nice real you know if its done right it looks really good   well ive done a petit point which is really extremely hard       and uh that was very difficult for me it took me oh i think that almost took me a year and a half to finish that     hum   and petit point is like if youve seen regular needlepoint its one half of that in the stitches and it goes down like real small little tiny its exactly what it says petit point     boy thats tedious   yes it was tedious i dropped it as i said it took me about a year and a half because its not something i could continuously do but now im into more uh taking something that i like and trying to actually put it onto paper myself   hum   which i find more enjoyment thats got a lot of math to it at that point   what type of scenes do you do   uh this last one im trying to do a house theres a house here in Plano actually its a real estate office but it has its oh i would say it every section of this real estate office is a different type of a structure its oh i would say it every section of this real estate office is a different type of a structure it goes from almost um castle looking on one side to a very old fashioned look on the other side and it just varies in each little section of this real estate office and i think they did it because of that purpose it is a real estate office but it fascinates me the way theyve done it and its it looks good its all done in brick the windows even vary on it and thats it really fascinates me so ive sat across the street from it and ive tried to put it down on the paper now   hum ive been over to Plano quite a few times my brother lives over there and ive yet to see anything like that over there   its on um       lets see fifteenth and uh Park   oh okay so its its on the other side   well i live right around here but its not if you drive by it you dont notice it because its all brick theres no difference in the front except you can see the little difference if you actually stop and take a look at it   hum   thats why it fascinates me but uh again you know id like to be able to go ahead and take that someday and actually make a house of my own   well thats pretty neat though i would i mean i wish i had that that much patience to sit down and do something tedious like that but after a while it would just drive me nuts   well see youre doing the same thing when youre doing your gazebo youre playing with numbers thats all this is you putting it on paper so youre just playing with numbers   yeah   its like i would love to play with work but i dont have the strength in my hands   hum   anymore to do anything like that but ive put up uh like um a wall board fixed a bedroom and put in a bath   i like things i like i like building furniture probably the best that that sort of thing when i had the equipment and and the place to set it up i like things that are difficult to do i like to see if i can do it back when when i was in college i took lots of wood courses and then i i even did it after i was out of college i continued to do it and i built just about every stick of furniture in my house everything from dining furniture to armoire to the whole nine yards takes a long long time to do all that stuff   yeah i have a small miter box uh for hobby mitering     umhum   and it does the same thing what youre saying but id like to which ive been trying to find to go into as far as a permanent hobby which because im having difficulties with this is to go into uh im sure youve seen it is those wood uh oh theyre theyre wood pictures on the wall but if one move if one part moves it counterparts the other parts and so like its a continuous counterpart around it and its all made out of wood   hum   and i have as i said i have a miniature uh miter box which is made for hobby works and ive had that for quite a few years now but i havent really gone into that part ive been thinking about making um oh ladders and everything for my uh pocket parrot because theyre hard to find toys for a pocket parrot they make them for parrots and they make them for cockatiels and a pocket parrots between the two   umhum   and so i need rings that are exactly between those two sizes so im going to ive got some designs for i go into the pet stores but you can say again another hobby ive got is my birds so   birds   hum   birds   i have a cockatiel and a pocket parrot   oh those are interesting   but um other than that   see which ones talk do do the do they talk   uh Sam uh cockatiel talks he whistles at me and says good morning uh he picked up most of his sayings from the other cockatiel i had the pocket parrot is a very quiet bird its an extremely tame bird its uh if youre real gentle with it when you buy it itll come out and sit on your shoulder with no problem   hum   yeah theyre a very very tender bird   about the only thing i had when i was growing up was probably a parakeet and canary and uh we could let it out and fly around the house a little bit and uh oh you they wouldnt really you know didnt really want you to pick them up per se but you know when i did they didnt they didnt give me a lot of trouble   well see when i was oh about i guess about ten years ago fifteen years ago i dont know if its been that long i took my dog my cat and my bird into the vet at the same time and he was just sitting there he goes Carol youre the only one i know of that does this and i go whats the problem because i never thought about it i had never thought one thing at all about it and of course the dog and the cat and the bird are all out of the cage   boy i bet that was interesting   and uh my my bird at that time was picking the feathers out from underneath his wing       and uh he finally said well you ought to get it a mate but the bird turned around and bit him he was furious he was so mad at me but yeah he had a picture of my birds sitting on top of the cage with one tail inside of a front of a cats face and the tail of another cat walking underneath the cage so he just loved it he just absolutely adored it   thats unbelievable i would never have thought that you know that they would leave you alone without trying to attack each other   well the one large cat that i still have uh he took claw marks and put it down my drapes going after the birds sitting out on a bird rack that we set up outside for birds   umhum   going after the birds and then hed get down and jump back up on the table and sit next to a cage that had two cockatiels out on top of the cage id get so mad at that cat because i didnt realize what he was doing until i saw these big claw marks going down my       drapes from his back claws   yeah that nice nice expensive   yeah i didnt think i didnt appreciate it too much i mean its rather i thought it was rather funny heres a bird doing this and two birds sitting right next to him but       i mean the birds were out they werent in the cage they were out i never left them in so but i thought but i still have that cat in fact i have both cats which are my kids cats but the birds are in here with the cats they dont care   yeah huh   they keep an eye on any cat that walks outside but they dont care about these cats   well they get used to each other   i dont know what it is ive seen   guess they know they have to live together so they may as well make the best of it   ive heard a lot of people that doesnt work that way i mean ive seen that dog my sons dog open up its mouth and absolutely put it totally around the cats head and the
