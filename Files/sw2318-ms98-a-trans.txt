        yeah so its got to be the most controversial thing if you could pick on the list   thats true   oh we dont have capital punishment i believe you do   yes we do   oh   we we have uh the death by lethal uh by injection   yeah the the only thing about capital punishment is the i i remember someone saying i think it was a chief justice in this state he goes if you make a mistake how do you get the person back thats the whole his whole basis was if you do have that error you know some people have been in jail for years and years and years and theyre finally exonerated and then you know if if there if you killed the person and its like oops too bad       i mean i think ive heard of cases where someone did they uh the they were uh it was capital punishment they were killed and they found out years later that the he really didnt kill the person   what   i believe there was one case i dont i dont know where i read it or anything but i think there there has to they have to have put innocent men or women to death before i mean   im sure that that that have to has happened but  then theres also the um number of people who have created or committed murders etcetera that have not been put to death even though they were sentenced to death row like like look at Charles Manson i mean he just happened to have the right timing     yes   and yet he although he may never be free to kill again there are a lot of people like him that are free to kill again     im the type of person who sits you know its the same thing about the war im this type person you you know you need it but youre the one who you cant you cant make the decision and go yes or no id be a terrible president because i would you know i knew we had to go to war and i knew you know it was the best thing but i didnt i would not want to be responsible for people getting hurt if you know if i dont know     but i didnt want to do it huhuh i dont think that i could sit on a jury and be part of sentencing someone to death   well uh like   i i i would find that too difficult   yes but like you say there theres people out there that do such terrible things well i had one of the subjects was uh crime and it was talked about the the way society has worked out theres some people that economically trapped   umhum   and they really their parents dont bring them up properly they have absolutely no morals because no one taught them   correct   i mean morals isnt something thats just in your heart and youre born with it youre   something thats taught   its something thats taught its something on the streets that you see so if its a dog eat dog world it its just really too bad that we have to have something like capital punishment   umhum   but i i dont know how much of a deterrent it really is   i dont think its a deterrent at all i dont think that anyone that uh commits a murder actually thinks that they will ever   you dont think its a deterrent   even uh be punished let alone put to death for it i mean look at the mentality  of your average person who smokes cigarettes they dont think theyre ever going to get cancer and yet its written on every single package most people who murder someone dont even get caught let alone prosecuted to the to the extent of the law   so even though even though you dont think its a deterrent which i have a tendency to agree agree i mean its a deterrent its its the ones like carefully thinking it out and stuff they think about it but a lot of the street crime that goes on and stuff they dont really care and they dont really care what happens to them i can see where its not a deterrent   right right i think for probably possibly the premeditated murders i think its possibly a deterrent but   yes   for the for the gang violence the uh the street murders so to speak i dont think it is   does it matter to you do you have a lot of violence where you live   not where i live uh but i live outside of Dallas   where where you work so is Dallas a bad city i talked to someone from San Antonio and the Barrio she said it was very bad   the San Antonio has much more gang violence than Dallas Dallas does have um an area of town however the   Dallas   young men i mean sixteen to nineteen year old boys  are shot and killed or shot at least shot frequently the uh the county hospital that handles all the gunshot wounds here   yeah   handles fifteen gunshot wounds a day   oh jeez   i mean a day   and thats relatively calm city     yeah it it obviously is not a DC you know     yes   it it i understand that Vermonts relatively calm   oh its very calm i mean you can  our uh bad district i wouldnt advise going walking in there alone at night but you could and if anyone was bothering you you could make such a fuss where people would come to your aid even though youre in the worst part of the city um the only difference is that every street light is lit instead of every other street light so were were a really were uh pampered up here   umhum   um and when they do have a crime a murder lets we had quite a few years ago a young two young men they were sixteen years old um raped and beat and beat these two twelve year old girls really bad it just shocked the whole state   goodness   just how can anything happen like this and the guys that did it were so ignorant they didnt even remorse they didnt they didnt have any remorse for what they were doing but they were just so ignorant that one of them says well i didnt realize that was because i was beating her in the head that she was really going to die on me you know its like although why did you do it she was screaming all i wanted to do was shut her up he he acted like he didnt even think that this was going to kill her i the kids were really quite ignorant about it and it it was a tragedy on both sides but it just shocked the uh the state that something like this could happen   umhum yeah   i mean usually if something if someone robs in the night or something and uh a home owner confronts him i mean its not a blaze of guns and stuff you know the guy might hit the guy over the head and people start running i mean if this happened in the city the im sure the youth would be armed and just take the family out   umhum   i mean were really fortunate to live here but doing these conversations it makes me feel really bad that there are kids that cant cant get out of the situation theyre in and theyre theyll eventually end up even if they want to be good kids theyll eventually end up uh more or less victims of crimes even though theyre doing the crimes theyre more or less a victim   umhum yeah yes theyre the theyre the victims of neglect and and uh many years of of perpetuated nonconcern for human life   yes its its really sad   yeah its just its its just a lack of concern they dont have you know these kids the ones that are involved in you know gangs i think are searching for selfesteem and they find som ething like that in uh their gang activities and they never had this at home and their parents dont have it if they happen to know their parents   yes its its its bad sometimes the kids have no choice because the parents are are worse i mean it theyll do drugs in front of their kids they bring this boyfriends and girlfriends home in front of kids they they treat them like little slaves they holler at they hit them   the other   and they go they go to the gangs more or l ess for uh family oh this guys nice to me he doesnt hit me   yeah the uh the we were shocked two mornings ago with uh the news that a forty year old man had sold his three year old son for forty dollars worth of crack   oh jeez   and they found the boy and the boy had been unharmed but they were trying to sell him you know they were trying to sell the baby or the boy and hes three years old they were trying to sell him on the black market   thats stupid   i mean it can you that that just repulsed me and it repulsed everybody that i work with i mean it you know we   we sit up here on our pedestals judging but were not there but its just it is totally unheard of that you you you even think it would happen   and it was just you know twenty twenty miles from me   oh jeez yeah i know   but its its its its real strange uh its its a world that um is the drugs are the drugs are going to get us all i mean drugs actually i think were doing capital punishment to the wrong people i think we ought to have capital punishment for the true importers of drugs not the kids that are selling it on the street that dont know any better im talking about the people you know who are bringing it to our country i think they deserve capital punishment because they kill   oh yeah well   they kill a lot   well then they wouldnt do this for the drug kingpin that they were going to um institute the death penalty other or was it life in prison or whatever for the drug kingpins i dont   yeah   its its so full of bullshit the the drug war is just terrible you cant trace it because a lot of the authorities are probably tied up into it i mean you know months ago it was the the military   thats true
