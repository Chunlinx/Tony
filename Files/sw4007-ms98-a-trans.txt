        okay um well why dont you go ahead and start because you have more experience it sounds like     well ive got two kids one of them s a year old and one of them s going on three   umhum   and in California anyways where im located my husbands in the Navy its really hard to find child care around here because most people that are around here   umhum   theyre either Mexican or Filipino and they dont speak English so its like my kids pick up really funny words       and they come home and say something to me and i dont understand what theyre saying   oh   and its like i mean day care is really expensive it costs like three hundred dollars   oh goodness   for day care for two kids for a month and when they come home i dont even understand half the stuff theyre saying   uhhuh oh goodness so do they know what theyre saying though do they seem to know the words that theyre saying   um sometimes   because theyre theyre real young   yeah   yeah because that could be a blessing further down the road but it can also be a problem now   like one day he came home and said something and i asked him what he was saying i told him to point to it so i could understand what he was saying and he was talking about the cartoon you know Peter Pan   uhhuh oh uhhuh   but he said it you know in i i dont even remember i dont i dont even know which one it was it was either Spanish or Filipino im not even sure which language it was   oh goodness   but he knew it was Peter Pan its just he didnt say Peter Pan   hm   and so its kind of hard to understand what theyre saying   umhum   but i dont wanna tell him not to say it because theres nothing wrong with it   umhum   its just  makes it hard to understand   yeah yeah theyll be because at this age theyre real real young and they could pick up any kind of language it its amazing how easy they can learn   yeah   well ive uh i got two children as well my oldest is eight and my youngest is four and i used to teach and when my first one was born i was lucky enough to be able to choose whether i wanted to work or not and even though i had just gotten my Masters degree i chose to stay home just because i worried a lot about child care and really wanted to be able to be that person that raised my children and   yeah   i like youre feeling the frustration of what theyre picking up on thats exactly the worries that i had is that i worried about what kind of things they might be exposed to or pick up on and i was just really paranoid and i guess just decided to be my own childs caregiver and at times ive regretted it just because i miss working with adults and uh       you know speaking regular language more than the the childrens you know kind of language   yeah and actually having conversations instead of one line sentences   right right and as a cartoon once said i would like to have dinner with someone who can cut their own meat and that kind of thing um   really   but now im getting up at the at the stage where i will need to go back to work and so im looking at this issue and my four year old is just at the point where shell be starting kindergarten next year which is still only half day so well still have to look at that kind of of set up for her so   yeah my husband and i made a deal when our second son was born because we had i had to work   umhum   there was after our second son was born there wasnt any choice i had to work   umhum   so we made a deal hes in the Navy and six months out of the year hes gone on a ship   oh   so for those six months i dont work i stay home with the kids   uhhuh   but while hes in dock and hes you know on shore duty for six months then i work in the daytime   umhum   and we have child care for them its only six months out of the year but still it its just its kind of weird because the quality of day care is different than what im used to because im im originally from Arizona yeah really   oh are you so am i yeah what part oh okay i was in the Phoenix uh Mesa area   Mayer yeah a little tiny dinky town up by Prescott   oh okay   but um its really strange because im used to just going to my next door neighbor and she babysat me and you know when i first had when we first had our first son she babysat him until we moved and   umhum   its really different here   oh yeah because now youre depending on other people that you dont know   yeah moneywise and you dont know them and youre worried you know   uhhuh   i mean i know a lot of people say well it never happens to you it just happens to other people when children disappear but its still scary when you have to look for day care   yeah yeah   you know you always have that fear   yeah   i got to find somebody really you know really that i can depend on   thats right yeah and even if you have someone there right at your own house doing that kind of day care you still always have that little worry im sure   yeah   so thats that is a problem what kind of criteria do you look for when you are shopping around   well i have a notebook and in it i have the top thirty questions  and that may sound kind of strange but   uhhuh   its im just kind of paranoid as a mother its like  i want my child safe
