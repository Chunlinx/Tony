        okay well do you have any pets     yes i do uh uh in fact im living with three cats at the moment uh one of them is mine one of them is my daughters and one of them is um partially mine and partially hers i guess       ah           uh so um i im and im an absolute nut about cats um i didnt i used to have dogs and cats um and uh the dogs have died and those original cats have died and weve taken these on and uh i i just love them i think theyre wonderful what about you   we have uh one dog no kids and one dog so um we   uhhuh what what kind of dog   we have a Golden Retriever   oh we thats what we had yeah we loved them yeah   oh really yeah shes a mess   yeah they uh we had as i say two and then uh gave uh the kids grandparents one and they got another one and so i mean thereve been four sort of in the family around theyre sweet dogs   wow yeah they i mean they go through a a terror a time   yeah how old   um shes lets see i guess shes about eleven months   oh well yes you still youre still at the puppy stage yeah   so shes yeah and they say they stay puppies for a couple of years so   yes youre right   um but she you know we took her through obedience school back when at four four or five months   uhhuh   and then we had her fixed at around seven months because i couldnt handle her   umhum being in heat and all that yeah   yes i was so worried the whole time that you know a dog was going to jump the fence and   yeah right   and we decided that we werent going to breed her and and stuff because there we felt there were enough dogs and   right and thats true all ours are fixed too   and uh so um we went ahead and had her fixed while she was in heat and um   yeah yeah yeah   but shes shes pretty smart although she you know she gets angry and shes just like a child when she um oh if shes so into what shes doing you know she wont listen to you listen to a command listen to a command well like um   oh really   okay im trying to think of an example if were sitting on the couch and she wants to play with you and you say no you know off   uhhuh   and then shell shell come and stick one paw up and then you take her paw and set it off well she starts doing it and she gets frustrated that youre telling her no so it turns into this this uh almost a fight you know its like you cant tell me that you know so she starts losing her patience and then we lose our patience   yeah yeah what does she do when she loses her patience   um   i mean does she bite or bark or   um no she bites a lot but i mean its sometimes its its not angry but sometimes it is   oh thats unusual because they dont usually bite   yeah yeah they well shes real mouthy you know and thats one thing i think with being retrievers is um   uhhuh   you know everything goes into their mouth and and she just wants attention but she gets angry that youre not giving her the attention   right uhhuh uhhuh   and then when you you know like like she goes and steals things um  oh we have to keep the doors to our bedrooms closed and shell go in and if she gets in there shell go in and pick a teddy bear off this little rocking chair   uhhuh oh really   and shell bring it in and shell kind of show it to shell stand there until you see her and then as soon as you see her she takes off and its like come get me     oh my goodness well ours didnt do that ours were much quieter but i had i did have a child at the time and so it may be that the child was sort of all this other stuff for them i dont know   yeah yeah i think so and also having other dogs or having other animals   uh yes we we we have found that with with all of our pets is that we weve never had just one because we somehow feel like they need another one i dont know if thats a human thought and not an animal thought or what but   no i think its a animal thought too because they do tend to be pack dogs you know   yeah umhum umhum   and they because she loves uh we have a neighbor down the street that has a dog and um we theres lots of dogs in our neighborhood but the one down the street she just goes crazy over i mean youd think that that dog was Elvis or something she just goes hog wild over that dog and   yeah yeah   and um they have a lot of fun together but she doesnt do that with other dogs its just that one one friend   yeah yeah well and i i think they they can be territorial so you you know have to maybe some of them theyre more comfortable with than others but   but we did get her though because wed heard that they were good with kids so   oh they and then they are i mean my son would just you know and and youve heard the stories im sure but you know everything from using his little wooden hammer on her head to all sorts of things and um she would just move over you know i mean and that was that was the worst that ever happened   yeah
