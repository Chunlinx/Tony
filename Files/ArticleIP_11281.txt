                                 A Question of Character            If Bill Clinton didnt exist would it be possible to invent him Of allmodern political leaders he seems the least likely as a character A HenryJames or a Joseph Conrad might do justice to the tensions in Clintonspolitical careerthe tug of war between idealism and cynicism the empathy forothers and the calculating selfinterest Sinclair Lewis or Theodore Dreisermight depict his climb from provincial obscurity But who could concoct thejuxtapositions of the presidents personality It is hard to think of a figurefrom English or American literature who combines for instanceselfdestructive sexual interests with an insatiable appetite for domesticpolicy or Clintons mix of high intelligence and low taste Has anyonescripted him Let us consider the writers whose inventions capture aspects ofthe presidential personality                           WilliamShakespeare When you think of political tragedy you thinkimmediately of Shakespeare Richard Nixon the last president to faceimpeachment was clearly a Shakespearean character To be precise the Nixon ofWatergate was Richard III the selfpitying monster The Clinton of Flytrap isnot half so dark a figureunderhanded perhaps but not purely malevolent IfClinton exists in Shakespeare it might be as an amalgamation of the badqualities of Falstaff and Henry V He has Falstaffs appetites for food andfornication without his humor or ironic wisdom He has Prince Hals politicalambition and disloyalty to his old friends without his heroism or rhetoricaleloquence But Shakespeare isnt right for Bill Clinton who even in collapselacks the grandeur of the Bards tragic heroes and the absurdity of his comicones Shakespeare may provide more models for the first lady She thinks ofherself as Portia the clever lawyer in The Merchant of Venice Republicans think of her as a scheming Lady Macbeth Lately the public seesher as that unfortunate victim of her husband Othello s Desdemona            W illiam Faulkner Our general image ofClintons pastSouthern poverty with overtones of alcoholism andinbreedingcomes mostly from Faulkner In the Snopes trilogy  TheHamlet  The Town  and The Mansion  we find the models forClintons father Will Blythe in the ramblin bigamist IO Snopes VirginiaKelley the chunky child bride Eula Varner and Roger Clinton the nogoodnikByron Snopes Bill Clinton is apparently based on the main protagonist of thethree books Flem Snopes Flem rises from rural squalor getting a job as aclerk at Varners store in Frenchmans Bend then taking over the store thenmoving to the town of Jefferson He aspires to become president of theJefferson Bank and succeeds Alas Faulkner captures the milieu of Gothicdysfunction from which Clinton emerged but describes Flems rise only in termsof venality missing the allimportant element of idealism                           PhilipRoth A closer match is found surprisingly enough in Philips Rothsportrait of a middleaged Jewish intellectual Portnoys complaint is definedon the first page of the novel of that name as A disorder in whichstronglyfelt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring withextreme sexual longings often of a perverse nature Sound familiar AlexanderPortnoy after he outgrows his autoerotic obsession works for the liberal JohnLindsay administration in New York City and does his best to demonstrate hisconcern for the poor and the oppressed Meanwhile however he is shacked upwith a girlfriend he calls the Monkey who fulfills his sexual fantasies butleaves him living in fear of tabloid scandal Like Clinton Portnoy is highlyintelligent motherobsessed and pretty much out of control Anothersimilarity Portnoy flees to Israel when faced with crisis Drawbacks Portnoyis more of a neurotic and less of a liar            M ark Twain My colleague Walter ShapiroChatterbox suggests that Clinton is a Tom Sawyer figure Hes thinking ofthe famous fencepainting scene in which Tom tricks his friends into payinghim for the right to do his chore Tom Sawyer does capture rather nicely Ithink Clintons gift for talking his way out of trouble that better sensemight have kept him out of in the first place Tom is as Bob Kerrey once saidof Clinton an unusually good liar Theres also the great scene where Tomand Huck Finn who are thought to have drowned watch their own funerals asspectators Thats a bit like what Clinton seems to be doing now We know thathell pop up at the end Sawyerlike to announce that contrary to popularbelief he is not in fact finished Bonus Hillary as Aunt Polly who isdriven to distraction by Toms deceptions but always forgives him in theend                           CharlesDickens The great artist of character types is Dickens but he seemsnever to have drawn anyone much like Bill Clinton Republicans might proposeUriah Heep in David Copperfield  Heep synonymous with unctuousness isa fawning fellow who worms his way up through oozing manipulation He does havesome Clintonlike traits such as his obsession with his mother hissmarminess and his flattering blather Theres a scene in the novel whereCopperfield sees Heep asleep with his mouth open like a post office Thephrase fits Clinton beautifully But Heep is repellant Clinton though hatedby many is seductively charming Newt Gingrich as he was getting clobbered inbudget negotiations in  said he had to go through detox to preventhimself from being overcome by Clintons winning ways Heep is however a finestandin for the House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas            H erman Melville At an antiimpeachmentrally this week the novelist Mary Gordon suggested that Clinton was in factBilly Budd There is something about a kind of accusation that takes on a lifeof its own in which a punishment is completely incommensurate with the natureof the crime that comes from a sort of sexual madness that I believe is at theroot of a lot of the otherwise incomprehensible opposition to Clinton Gordonnoted This is a clever nomination but it doesnt transcend the immediatecircumstances of the scandal Melvilles Budd is a naive good man who ispunished unfairly for an accidental murder he is provoked into committing bysomeone who tried to frame him for a crime Clintons impending punishment maybe unjust but as a character he lacks Billys innocence and forthrightnessBilly steps up to take his undeserved punishment declining to let others risktheir necks by trying to help him Clinton has consistently done pretty muchthe opposite Gordon may be on to something with the issue of sexual jealousybut neglects the key difference Budd is lusted after Clinton lusts Howevertheres a silver lining in this one too In Claggart the officer who tries toframe Billy for the crime of mutiny we find a nautical version of KennethStarr                           F ScottFitzgerald While were considering unlikely comparisons from Americanliterature we have a proposal from Joe Klein the author of a fine fictionalportrait of ClintonJack Stanton in Primary Colors  Klein once wrote ofBill and Hillary They are the Tom and Daisy Buchanan of the Baby BoomPolitical Elite The Buchanans you may recall were F Scott Fitzgeraldsbrilliant crystallization of flapper fecklessness in The Great Gatsby They were careless people They smashed up lives and didnt notice Thereare some surprisingly good parallels here Tom Buchanan avoided service inWorld War I and is a reckless adulterer But as a personality hes allwronghes a bully and a racist who doesnt care what anyone else thinks abouthim And Tom and Daisy are aristocrats their miserable behavior is theoutgrowth of his having too much money the one thing Clinton has never had andhas never seemed to care
