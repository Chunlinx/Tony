                    Background        In the course of studies involving intravenous        adenoviral gene transfer we observed a  fold difference        in plasma levels of the encoded proteins between two of the        rat strains employed the Wag Rij and the Brown Norway        These differences were observed for several vector encoded        proteins as soon as  days after gene delivery and were        maintained for one month after which the levels declined        slowly to background Other investigators described        differences of the same order of magnitude between mouse        strains in expression of transgenes encoding antitrypsin            interleukin     and human endostatin            These differences in transgene expression between inbred        species may have clinical implications as differences        between inbred strains are considered to reflect        differences between individuals of an outbred species        Consequently the therapeutic efficiency of a transgene        could drastically vary from one patient to another So far        a satisfactory explanation for such strain differences has        not been provided Most authors have attributed the        difference of plasma levels of vector encoded protein to        immune reactions against the protein or against the vector             However the kinetics of the vector encoded        proteins in the plasma do not support regulation by an        adaptive immune reaction as the strain difference is        manifest as early as  days after administration of the        vector Innate humoral immunity eg the presence of        neutralising antibodies against the vector can also be        excluded as the cause of the difference because such        antibodies are not present in nave rats An innate        cellular immune reaction directed against the infected        liver cells is also an unlikely explanation because plasma        transaminase levels     a marker of hepatolysis         though somewhat elevated are not different in the two        strains        The main organ infected by an adenovirus following iv        injection is the liver      Others and we find that        the liver is producing  of the vector encoded protein        after intravenous delivery of recombinant adenoviral        vectors The global process from liver cell infection to        protein production is commonly described as adenoviral        permissiveness of the liver In this study we investigated        which one of these three processes transfection        transcription translation is pivotal for the strain        difference in transgene expression        Secreted vector encoded proteins are not suitable to        interpret the early manifestation of transgene expression        as plasma levels are highly dependent on the        pharmacokinetic properties of the encoded proteins        Therefore we employed adenoviral encoded marker genes the        intracellular Luciferase Luc and the nuclear        Galactosidase LacZ The luciferase activity of the        whole liver is a measure of vector encoded protein        expression in that organ while the LacZ staining of        hepatocytes provides information on the proportion of liver        cells infected Furthermore we determined the amount of        Ad DNA and of transgene mRNA in the liver as measures of        the adenoviral infection of hepatic cells and of transgene        transcription respectively                    Results                  Intravenous injection of Ad vectors in different          rat strains results in different levels of early          transgene expression          Intravenous administration of a fixed dose of Ad          vector either expressing the human endostatin gene or          the gene for mhATFBPTI resulted in clear fold          difference in the plasma levels of both proteins between          Brown Norway and WagRij rats Fig and  This          difference was detected as soon as  days after the          vector administration and persisted during the first           weeks subsequently the plasma levels of both proteins          slowly decreased to undetectable levels in  to  months          To investigate whether the livers of the  rat strains          differ in their permissiveness for Ad or if this          phenomenon could be explained by differences in the          hepatocyte secretion capacity we administrated Ad          vector carrying the gene for Luciferase Ad Adapt Luc          a protein that is not secreted          Measurements of Luciferase transgene activity in          various organs following iv administration of the          vector confirmed the observations from other research          groups     that in rodents  of virus infection          and subsequent transgene expression occurs in the liver          Table           Next we determined luciferase activity in the liver          of Brown Norway and WagRij rats  days after intravenous          injection of  iu  iu or  infectious units          iu of Ad Adapt Luc The results depicted in the Fig          seem to reflect those observed with ATFBPTI and          endostatin naming a fold difference between WagRij          and Brown Norway rats These experiments with the          nonsecreted luciferase vector encoded protein confirmed          that the two rat strains have a very different liver          response to the recombinant adenovirus Since the levels          of mhATFBPTI and endostatin reached a plateau about           days after vector delivery both in the Brown Norway and          in the WagRij rats we also determined the luciferase          activity in the liver  days post intravenous          administration of the Ad Adapt Luc As shown in figure           roughly the same values were obtained at the  time          points which reflect the kinetics of the plasma          concentrations of the secreted proteins ATFBPTI and          endostatine                          Galactosidase expression in hepatocytes from          Brown Norway and WagRij rats          To explore whether differences in the number of          transduced hepatocytes could account for the observed          differences in transgene expression levels we injected          different doses  iu  iu and  iu of Ad          Adapt LacZ into the tail vein of the rats Histological          inspection of the stained sections allowed an estimation          of the proportion of transduced liver cells Animals were          sacrificed after  days liver sections were prepared and          stained with Xgal The liver sections revealed an          inhomogeneous distribution of transduced cells In both          rat strains hepatocytes were the sole cell type          expressing the Galactosidase Both the number of          stained cells and the staining intensity was highest near          the interlobular portal vein and declined gradually          towards the centro lobular area Fig  The percentage          of blue nuclei was roughly proportional to the amount of          infectious units administered and did not differ          significantly between the two strains Table  However          overall the intensity of the nuclear LacZ stain was  to           times higher in the Brown Norway than in WagRij liver          sections as determined by computerassisted analysis of          the histological section Fig  These findings suggest          that although the protein production is significantly          higher in the Brown Norway rats the number of infected          cells is roughly similar for both rat strains Still the          number of infectious particles per hepatocytes might be          higher in the Brown Norway rats However the number of iu          can never be  time higher because that would require at          least   the number of hepatocytes                 and the dose administered was  iu                          The number of recombinant adenovirus copies in the          liver          Realtime PCR was employed to quantify the copy number          of the adenoviral genome in the hepatocytes of rats from          the previously described experiments that received graded          doses of Ad Adapt Luc or of Ad Adapt LacZ As listed          in Table  the number of adenoviral copies per liver was          similar in the Brown Norway and WagRij rats for both          vectors Roughly there is a linear relation between the          Ad DNA detected and the dose of adenoviral vector          administered In the case of LacZ the deviation from the          linearity is not statistically significant          These results shows that recombinant Ad infect          hepatocytes of both rat strains with similar          efficiencies Thus the observed differences in levels of          vector encoded protein must be due to differences in          transcription CMVpromoter activity RNA stability RNA          translation or post translational processes                          Liver damage          Considering that the local inflammation of the liver          may significantly increase the synthesis of certain          proteins it could be that the difference in transgene          expression observed is a consequence of different          inflammatory reactions in the two strains To eliminate          the possibility that the difference found in the Brown          Norway rats in encoded protein is due to a global          increase in protein synthesis the total amount of liver          protein was determined after different vector doses and          time points It was found to be similar in both strains          and not significantly elevated from the basal line Table                    Adenovirus particles in apoptotic hepatocytes or          phagocytosed by immune cells would not contribute to the          luciferase production However to exclude that a massive          hepatitis or a severe inflammatory infiltrate in the          liver is causing the difference of luciferase expression          the inflammatory infiltration and pathological changes          were determined in the liver of the two rat strains          Table  The damage scoring shows that there is no          difference of toxicity or infiltration  days after          vector delivery and that the difference in transgene          expression persisted even when a low dose of adenovirus          that caused hardly any inflammation was injected At           days after the injection the Brown Norway rats showed a          significant higher liver damage and infiltration than the          WagRij rats However this deviation of the toxicity          between the two strains was not accompanied by an          increase in the difference of transgene expression          Seemingly the difference in transgene expression seen           days as well as  days after vector administration is          due to processes that occur after the penetration of the          virus into the cells                          Northern Blotting of the Luciferase          transcript          To investigate whether an intrinsic difference exists          in transcription efficiency or in translation efficiency          the amount of the luciferase mRNA present in the liver of          rats was determined after administration of  iu Ad          Adapt Luc intravenously As depicted in Fig  the          northern blot of the liver RNA shows about  times more          luciferase mRNA in the liver of the Brown Norway rats          than in the Wag  Rij rats These findings leave open          only two options to explain the difference in protein          levels observed namely an intrinsic difference in          transcription efficiency under the CMV promoter or a          difference in RNA stability                            Discussion        It has been suggested that after iv administration low        dose intravenous adenoviral vectors are taken up by Kupffer        cells and degraded quickly within a few hours            whereas higher doses saturate these cells and the surplus        productively transduce hepatocytes Therefore we used        doses  iu   iu that are in the linear part of the        dose response curve and well above the threshold effect In        both rat strains  days after intravenous delivery of the        vector the Galactosidase was observed only in the        hepatocytes Consequently it may be concluded that the        bulk of the adenoviral genomes in the liver is localized in        the hepatocytes        After correction for the extraction efficiency of DNA        an average of   copies of vector genome were detected        in the livers following administration of  iu Ad Adapt        LacZ At this dose  of the hepatocytes stained positive        for Galactosidase It is estimated that the liver of a         g rat contains about   hepatocytes     Thus        the average number of infectious units per hepatocyte is        about  It is assumed that the infection of hepatocytes        by the adenoviruses is a random event following the Poisson        distribution Then this event will occur at least one time        in  of the cases when the expected number of occurrences        is  As about  of the hepatocytes stained blue        following injection of  iu an hepatocyte will stain        blue if it has incorporated one copy of the vector Poisson        probability calculations show also that under these        conditions the infection occurs twice in  and three        times in  of the hepatocytes This variation in the        number of adenoviral copies per cell can explain the        variation of the staining intensity per cell within one        liver from light to dark blue        In each of the vectors used in this study the transgene        was under the control of the CMV immediate early promoter        It was determined by Norther Blots that the amount of        transgenic mRNA was also different in both rat strains        Thus the difference in vector encoded protein production        found is due to difference in transgene transcription or        difference in RNA stability        As expected a difference in protein levels was observed        following  different doses of the vector     and         iu However the lower the dose the smaller is the        difference of protein expression between the two rat        strains This might be explained by a saturation of the        transgene expression machinery in the Wag  Rij hepatocytes        at the higher doses        The different protein expression in Wag  Rij and Brown        Norway rats was observed with  different transgenes        Luciferase Galactosidase endostatin and mhATFBPTI        and at several different doses Our experiments localised        the mechanism of this difference at the transcriptional        level and disqualified the hypothesis based on        immunological induced death of the infected cells        Nevertheless the differences of transcription efficiency        observed between the two rat strains might be due to        different cytokine production following the adenoviral        infection It was shown that the adenoviral infection of        the liver activates the innate immunity with increase NK        cells and cytokines production INF TNF IL IL               Further differences of this activation        between mouse strains were associated with variation in        adenovirus transgene expression      However it was        demonstrated that no activation of the innate immunity and        that no difference of transgene expression could be        observed before the seventh day after the adenoviral        administration     Furthermore the decrease of        transgene expression after activation of the innate        immunity following iv administration of adenovirus was        due to decrease of the number of infected cells and a        corresponding diminution of the viral DNA in the liver            Our results do not show such results However in such        perspective we measured the serum level of INF in both        rat strains  days after the vector administration and no        difference could be observed    pg  ml in the        WagRij rats versus    pg  ml in the Brown Norway        rats Nevertheless difference of intracellular cytokine        response to the adenoviral infection might explain the        difference in transcription efficiency        In general differences between inbred strains are        considered to reflect differences between individual        members of outbred species If the variation observed in        the rat strains described here would hold for individual        humans the therapeutic efficiency of gene transfer could        drastically vary from one patient to another after systemic        administration of adenoviral vectors                    Methods                  Animals          Pathogenfree inbred male WagRij and Brown Norway          rats weighing  to  gr were purchased from Harlan          The Netherlands All animals were fed ad libitum with          laboratory chow and water and were kept under standard          laboratory conditions For assay of plasma transaminase          ALT hEndostatin and mhATFBPTI rats were          anaesthetised with isoflurane and bled by tail vein          puncture and the blood was collected in EDTA tubes All          animal procedures were performed in accordance with the          official guidelines after obtaining permission of the          animal welfare committee Measurements of ALT were          performed according to standard clinical procedures                          Adenoviral vectors          Recombinant adenovirus vectors were generated in          PERC cells by homologous recombination between an          adapter plasmid pAdapt and the E deleted Ad  DNA          plasmid as described elsewhere     The expression          cassette contains a CMV promoter and SV poly A signal          As a result of the absence of sequence overlap between          the Adapt plasmid and the Ad E sequences integrated          into the genome of PERC the vector stocks used in this          study did not contain replicative competent adenovirus          RCA              The Ad Adapt mhAB encodes for a murinised form of the          human ATFBPTI mhAB     In this construct the          mhATFBPTI is preceded by the native secretion signal          peptide of the human urokinase The human endostatin          coding sequence InvivoGen CA USA was cloned in the          Ad Adapt shuttle vector The encoded endostatin          corresponds to the  residue of the human endostatin          described by OReilly et al  with an intact          Nterminus HSHRDFQ preceded by the secretion signal          peptide of the human IL The AdAdaptLuc and the          AdAdaptLacZ are recombinant adenoviral vectors in which          the E region of Ad is retained and the gene of interest          luciferase or LacZ replaces the E region The Ad          Adapt empty is identical to Ad Adapt mhAB except that it          does not encode any transgene          All vectors were produced on PERC using standard          procedures     Infectious units iuml were          determined by end point cytopathogenic effect CPE assay          on  cells     Viral particles were determined by          HPLC     The particle to infectious unit ratio was          always lower than  A single batch per vector was used          in all experiments                          Liver lysate and Luciferase activity assay          Rats were sacrificed by an overdose of isoflurane and          whole organs were dissected out frozen in liquid          nitrogen and stored at C Organs were homogenised in          phosphate buffered saline pH  using a

Bradford     The level of luciferase activity in the          tissue homogenates was expressed in RLU  mg protein The          background level of this assay is  RLUmg protein          and was defined by measuring luciferase activity in          organs of non treated rats                          LacZ expression assay          Fortyeight hours after Ad Adapt LacZ administration          rats were sacrificed and organs were removed and cut in           mm sections Sections were fixed in  phosphate          buffered formalin pH  for  min at room temperature          and incubated overnight in  M sucrose The samples          were subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen Ten m thick          frozen sections were prepared and stained with          bromochloroindolylgalactopyranoside Xgal          solution Molecular Probes The Netherlands overnight at          C Finally sections were counterstained with          HematoxylinPhloxinSafran The number of blue nuclei in          each section was determined on digitalised photographs of          four   magnification fields with the interlobular vein          in the centre designated portal area and of four fields          centred on the central vein called centrolobular area          These two areas were slightly overlapping The resolution          of the photographs which were processed in Adobe          Photoshop  was  dots per inch dpi Cells were          considered positive when a blue staining was seen in the          nucleus The total number of hepatocytes per field was          determined by dividing the surface of the tissue section          by the average surface of a hepatocyte The surface of          the lumen of large vessels was subtracted from the total          surface of the tissue section The average surface of the          hepatocytes was determined by ten measurements of          mononuclear hepatocytes per field The surface          measurements were performed with the NIH Image           software It was shown in rats that binuclear hepatocytes          have double the volume of mononuclear hepatocytes and          that the extrahepatocytic space volume was  of the          total liver volume              To compare Galactosidase expression levels in the          livers of WagRij and Brown Norway rats frozen livers          were cut into sections with a thickness of                   and  m Whole sections were scanned          at  dpi under TIFF format and analysed in Adobe          Photoshop  We quantified the blue staining intensity          by performing the histogram of the luminosity and of the          four colours on the whole liver section Matching the          histograms of a Brown Norway section to a WagRij section          with different thickness determine the relative liver          Galactosidase intensity of the two strains                          Elisa assays          An mhATFBPTI enzymelinked immunoabsorbent assay          ELISA was developed by Dr P Quax Toegepast          Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek institute using a          monoclonal antibody specific for the ATF as the capture          antibody and a polyclonal antibody directed against BPTI          as the detector antibody     As a standard we used          medium of Ad Adapt mhAB infected CHO cell culture in          which the mhATFBPTI concentration was determined by an          urokinase ELISA Secretion of human endostatin in plasma          was routinely determined using a commercial ELISA kit          InvivoGen CA USA according to the manufacturer          procedure INF

per cell was          determined by a multiplex realtime polymerase chain          reaction     Realtime PCR is based on the           nuclease activity of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase which          allows it to cleave fluorogenic probes resulting in          fluorescence The amount of fluorescence obtained during          the PCR reaction is representative to the amount of          amplified DNA          Total DNA of transduced rat organs was extracted by          using a DNeasy Tissue Kit Qiagen The kit efficiency          was verified by measuring the recovery of plasmid DNA          mixed from a liver lysate We confirmed that  of the          total DNA can be extracted from liver samples as          described by the manufacturer To amplify the adenoviral          DNA specific primers

  and cellular DNA a plasmid containing approximately           bp of the left part of the Ad genome pAdapt was mixed          with cellular DNA extracted from A cells The PCR          reaction was initiated with a hot start at C for           min and involved  cycles of  s at C and  min at          C                          Northern Blotting          The animals were sacrificed  days after vector          administration and the liver was immediately collected          and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen The liver samples          were cut and homogenised in Trizol reagent Gibco Life          Technologies using a blender Total RNA was isolated          from the liver tissue homogenate by using the method          developed by Chomoczynski and Sacchi     Briefly          chloroform was added and the aqueous phase containing the          RNA was recovered RNA was precipitated with isopropyl          alcohol and the pellet was resuspended in RNase free          water The RNA and DNA content were measured by          spectrophotometric analysis          The quantity of RNA loaded was  g as determined by          spectrophotometry The RNA loaded represents a similar          proportion of luciferase mRNA in both strains as the          total concentrations of RNA are similar in the WagRij             ggr and in the Brown Norway rats             ggr The RNA was run on a  agarose gel and          transferred onto Hybond N membrane by overnight          transfer The RNA was then fixed by UV irradiation The          hybridisation was performed overnight with one stranded           PdATF Luciferase probe  bp The membrane was          exposed to a Xray film Kodak for  h and afterwards          the membrane was scanned in a phosphorimager for          quantification Then the membrane was stripped  min at          C and prehybridised with salmon sperm DNA Then a          second hybridisation procedure was performed with the           PdATF actine probe                          Pathology          The scoring of the liver damage was performed in          WagRij and Brown Norway rats  and  days after the          intravenous injection of adenoviral vectors The liver          pieces were fixed in formalin  embedded in paraffin          and sections of  m were stained with haematoxylin and          eosin The total damage score is a compilation of scores          of apoptosis vacuolar changes nuclear condensation          anisonucleosis megalocytosis mitosis and inflammation          Table                             List of abbreviations        ALAT Alanin Amino
