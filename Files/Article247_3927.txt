                                 Hong Kong Airport Better Than Disneyland                        Eshopping Cell phones You love all technology in any form and what youare glossing over is that this stuff is homogenizing the world Its turningHong Kong into some sort of New York City with its highly refined versions ofsuch Western paraphernalia as Nine West shoe stores everywhere Of coursepeople in Hong Kong will shop on online Why Because its there And now HongKong is even getting a Disneyland the last thing it needs in the year So in five years well be able to ask ourselves if wed rather travel toOrlando or Hong Kong  and if wed be able to tell the difference once we gotthere Oh wait Florida is the place with the palm trees right I canunderstand why Hong Kong feels as if it needs a shot of something to revive itsflagging tourism industry But really the problem is not that the city lacks aMagic Kingdom This is simply not a city that screams vacation destinationTry instead Money More money How about going up in a skyscraper andmaking some money today Apparently the Chinese governments decision a fewmonths ago to import the movie Mulan unleashed a mighty appetite for allthings Disney So were going to get another of those infamous theme parks onLantau Islandnear the brandnew Hong Kong Airport While the last thing anyplace in the world needs is a Disneyland I think there are specialcircumstances here that make the incursion even more distasteful PuttingDisneyland on Lantau Island can only distract us from the airport itself whichseems to me to be the perfect iteration of a modernday theme park with itsbrilliantly modern design that effortlessly propels travelers to their gatestheir luggage a brandnew rail link to downtown Hong Kong            The airport already offers everything that Disney is promising excellentpublic restrooms Theme restaurants that serve dim sum A lack of litterHarrowing rides on airplanes It even has entertainmentin the form oftrendy shopping The airport houses an outpost of the itscooltobeChineseShanghai Tang department store with its trademark teddy bearswhich are farcuter than any Disney character that Ive come across while eating themed fastfood In fact if I were running the Bureau of Tourism for the Chinesegovernment I would bill the Hong Kong airport as a destination in itself
