                                 DotCom Minimalism                        By now were all familiar with the avalanche of dotcom advertising thatburied us last year boosting the revenues of both Madison Avenue and the TVnetworks while bringing more than a few Internet companies to the verge ofnonexistence since they burned huge amounts of cash in just a few months Andsome of us at least are still looking forward to the myriad dotcom ads thatwill be unveiled at this years Super Bowl But while the story of these ads ismainly one of a desperate grab for market share and brand identity via thefamiliar techniques of jittery cameras hyperbolic humor and some measure ofassociation with that ineffable quality we now call extremeness the mostinteresting new Internet ad campaign offers none of these            That campaign which debuted a couple of weeks ago and has yet to attractmuch notice is advertising Internet discount retailer buycom And that ispretty much all the campaign advertises In contrast to the frenetic style ofmost dotcom ads which have produced some true gems including most obviouslyOutpostcoms pack of ravenous wolves and flying gerbils and the ETrade andAmeritrade campaigns the buycom TV ad features the companys name in smallwhite lowercase letters on a black background Thats it No music novoiceover no sound Just  seconds of a name and silence The company isalso doing print and outdoor ads following the same motif but no radio adsIt seems hard to believe a radio station would accept an ad that consisted ofjust saying buycom followed by  seconds of silence            The new campaign is an attempt to cut through all of the noisevisual andsonicaround dotcom advertising and its visual distinctiveness willundoubtedly make people notice it The buycom marketing people also suggestthat the simplicity of the ads convey an implicit message that buycom offersconvenience simplicity and freedom from higher prices Its certainlypretty to think so but the onetoone connection there seems a bit overdrawnunless were meant to assume that products at buycom must be cheap since thecompany isnt making enough profit to pay for real advertising If anythingwhat really conveys those values of convenience and frugality is the companysname and in that sense the ads take advantage of one of buycoms realstrengths strength here being entirely a relative term            For all this though you have to stop short of calling the new campaignbrilliant mainly because its hard to see what kind of legs it will have atleast on television Watching the ad the first two or even three times wasfascinating in part because even after having seen it once I kept expectingsomething anything  to happen at the end of the ad In fact theletters just fade out And theres also something compelling about the way thead makes you aware of how long  seconds can be The problem is that you canonly be made aware of that so many times before you get bored The next time Isee this ad Im sure Ill change the channel            In some sense the buycom campaign reminds me of a stunt pulled by theshoegazer band My Bloody Valentine during its last US tour At some pointduring most perhaps all of the shows on that tour the band would in themiddle of a song begin playing two notes and just continue playing them overand over for close to  minutes with the sound gradually getting louderuntil as a friend of mine put it then it sounded like you were in an airplanehangar It may have been longer than  minutes or it may have been shorterWhile it was happening it seemed like an eternity Listening to this wasntenjoyable in any conventional sense or in any sense for that matter But therewas something incredibly interesting about being in the middle of it and aboutthe way your reactions to what was happening changed the longer the noisecontinued And the way the stunt exposed the conventions of the typical rockshow was adept            This wasnt anything you needed to listen to more than once though I knewpeople who did Once you got the idea reexperiencing it seemed beside thepoint and in the same way watching the buycom ads again now seems beside thepoint But perhaps this is one campaign that doesnt depend on repetition ondriving a jingle so deep into your skull that you cant forget it Perhaps theidea of the ad is enough to make you remember buycom Of course if it workswere going to have a flood of these campaigns in which case you wont be ableto remember any of them Heres one place where the firstmover advantage isactually real
