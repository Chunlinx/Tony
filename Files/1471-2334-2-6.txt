                    Background        Cellulose acetate phthalate CAP is a promising        microbicide candidate for prevention of infection by        sexually transmitted disease STD pathogens including        HIV           CAP inactivates HIV and blocks        the coreceptor binding site on the virus envelope        glycoprotein gp while leaving the site for the primary        cellular receptor CD accessible     Soluble CD sCD        was shown to inhibit HIV infection by two mechanisms        reversible blockage of virus binding to receptors and        irreversible inactivation of virus infectivity            Since CAP and sCD bind to distinct domains on the HIV        envelope it was of interest to determine whether or not        these two ligands affect virus infectivity synergistically        as do other combinations of antiHIV drugs and sCD            Binding of sCD leads to conformational changes in        gp         Binding of gp to coreceptors        CXCR and CCR respectively triggers additional        conformational changes in HIV envelope glycoproteins            For these reasons it was of interest to determine        whether a pretreatment of HIV with sCD would affect        subsequent binding of CAP to virus particles and b CAP        binding to virus particles in the presence or absence of        sCD would elicit conformational changes which could affect        HIV infectivity Such studies were expected to elucidate        further the mechanisms involved in the antiviralvirucidal        activity of CAP and to contribute to the potential        development of microbicides combining two or more        antiHIV compounds with distinct target sites                    Methods                  Reagents          The following monoclonal antibodies

absence of          graded concentrations of virus inhibitors CAP and sCD          respectively in RPMI medium containing  fetal          bovine serum FBS were mixed with MT cells           cellswell and placed into well polystyrene plates          The mixtures were incubated at C overnight On the           ndday culture supernatants were removed from each well          and fresh medium was added On the  thday culture          supernatants were collected and tested for p antigen by          ELISA Similar experiments were done with HIV BaL             virus particles except that PM cells    were          used instead of MT cells          The inhibitory activity of CAP and sCD in          combination against HIV infection was determined as          described above The CAPsCD weight ratios in the          combinations were  and  for HIV IIIB and HIV          BaL respectively The  inhibitory concentrations IC             and the combination index values          CI were calculated as previously described    using          a computer program CalcuSyn kindly provided by Dr T          C Chou SloanKettering Cancer Center New York A CI          value   indicates synergy and that of            indicates antagonism The compound dose reductions were          calculated based on the IC            value for CAP and sCD used alone          or in combination              To measure the virucidal activity of CAPsCD          combinations treated and untreated purified HIV IIIB             virus particles unlike in the experiments          described in an earlier report    where

instead of          MT cells The percentage of residual infectivity after          CAPsCD treatment was calculated from calibration curves          relating absorbance to virus dilutions of untreated

  Chantilly VA were coated either with CAP  gwell          or with mAb NC      For coating with CAP a          solution of CAP  l  gml in  M acetate pH           was added to the wells After incubation overnight          at C the wells were washed and postcoated for  h at          C with bovine serum albumin BSA and gelatin  and           mgml in  M acetate pH  For coating with          antibodies wells were first coated with protein AG           gwell in  M Tris buffer pH  for  h at C          followed by mAb NC or normal mouse IgG  control          wells  gwell diluted in phosphate buffered saline          PBS for  h at C Coating with the NC peptide          complexes  to  M was done under conditions          described for protein AG Subsequently the wells were          washed and postcoated with BSA and gelatin as described          above except that these proteins were dissolved in           M NaCl  M Tris pH  TS Chicken serum  in          PBS ChPBS was used instead in experiments with HIV          BaL to suppress binding of this virus to control wells          The wells were washed with TS and stored at C HIV          virus particles suspended in diluents and treated as          indicated in legends to Figs   were added to the          wells for  h at C Subsequently the wells were washed           with ice cold PBS or  antip mAb in ChPBS for          HIV BaL to minimize the contribution of p antigen not          associated with virus particles to absorbance readings          corresponding to p antigen released from detergent          treated virus The washed wells with bound virus          particles were then treated with lysis buffer  Nonidet          P NP  gml BSA in PBS for  min at C The          supernatants were removed and tested for p antigen          using ELISA kits from Beckman Coulter Inc following the          manufacturers protocol          To measure the binding of biotinylsCD and          biotinylgp in the presence and absence of sCD          respectively to CAP the biotinylated proteins were          added to CAP and control postcoated wells without CAP          respectively at dilutions shown in Fig  The binding          of these biotinylated proteins to the wells after          washing with TS was determined by adding          HRPstreptavidin  gml in TS containing  gelatin          and   Tween  for  min at C The wells were          washed and bound HRP was detected using the test kit from          Kirkegaard  Perry following the manufacturers          protocol and the absorbance was read at  nm          The sandwich ELISA for the gp sixhelix bundle was          performed as described     Treated and control virus          preparations were incubated with lysis buffer for  min          at C and then added to wells coated with rabbit          polyclonal antibodies to the gp core In control          experiments CAP alone  mgml in lysis buffer was          added to the wells After incubation at C overnight          binding of sixhelix bundles was determined from          subsequent binding of mAb NC which was added at           gml in PBS BSA gelatin  lwell for  h at          C Subsequently the wells were washed three times with          PBS Tween  and biotin labeled antimouse IgG           lwell  ngml diluted in PBS containing  dry          fatfree milk was added After incubation for  h at          C the wells were washed as described above and          HRPstreptavidin  ngml in PBS containing  goat          serum  lwell was added After incubation for  h          at C the wells were washed six times with PBS          Tween  HRP was quantitated as described above          To exclude the remote possibility that mAb NC          reacted with CAP serial twofold dilutions  to           gml of the mAb and of control mouse IgG respectively          each at  gml in PBSBG were added to CAP coated or          CAPgp coated wells for  h at C The wells were          washed and bound IgG was quantitated as described above          for the sandwich ELISA CAPgp wells were prepared by          coating first with HIV IIIB gp under conditions          described above for protein AG except that the pH was           instead of  Subsequently CAP was added to the          wells as described above In control experiments serial          dilutions  to  of rabbit antiphthalate          antiserum and of normal rabbit serum respectively each          diluted fold in PBSBG were added to the wells          Bound rabbit IgG was quantitated using biotinylated goat          antirabbit IgG                          Shedding of gp from virus particles          Preparations of purified HIV IIIB and BaL          respectively were incubated for  min at C in the          presence or absence of CAP final concentration  mgml          Control preparations were not exposed to C Virus          particles and released gp were separated by          centrifugation as described     The virus containing          pellets and supernatant fluids were assayed by an ELISA          allowing gp determination in the presence of CAP          Wells of polystyrene plates were coated with protein AG          followed by polyclonal rabbit antigp diluted          fold under conditions described above for virus          capture assays Serial twofold dilutions in PBSBG of          preparations containing gp were added to the wells          After  h at C the wells were washed and bound gp          was detected by addition of biotinylsCD  g followed          by HRPstreptavidin as described above The amount of          gp in the virus pellets and the supernatant fluids was          calculated from calibration curves relating absorbance          readings to gp dilutions All determinations were done          in triplicate                          Molecular modeling Docking of CAP on the gpcore          structure          The acetylated and phthaloylated cellotetraose unit          CTAP composed of four linked Dglucose units          which is a representative part of CAP was created in          Quanta     as described before     CTAP was          minimized by the steepest descent method followed by the          adopted basis NewtonRaphson ABNR method The energy          difference of  Kcalmol between two successive          structures during both minimization steps was used as the          termination criterion          The docking simulations of CTAP were performed using          the DockVision program    on the entire surface of          the gp core structure The Xray crystal structure of          the gp core aik was retrieved from the protein          databank httpwwwrcsborg A grid box                 was created to cover the entire gp core surface          for CTAP to dock The default forcefield Research          Potential Function was used to perform  Monte Carlo          runs for docking simulations Both CTAP and the gp core          structure were kept rigid during docking Intermolecular          energy criteria were used to select the lowest energy          docked CTAP                          Electrostatic potential maps of gp and the          gpCD complex          Electrostatic potentials were calculated using a          PoissonBoltzmann solver included in the GRASP program              All default parameters were used The          electrostatic potential maps are shown on the accessible          surface of gp and the gpCD complex                            Results                  Enhancement of CAPHIV binding by CD          Earlier studies    indicated that CAP binding to          the envelope glycoprotein gp and to HIV virus          particles respectively did not interfere with their          subsequent association with sCD Thus it would be          expected that CAP would not inhibit the attachment of          HIV to target cells and would block only subsequent          steps obligatory for HIV infection initiated by          engagement of CXCR and CCR coreceptors respectively          The latter event was shown to be blocked by CAP    and          has been considered the basis for the virus inhibitory          and virus inactivating properties of CAP at neutral pH          However it has not been determined whether or not          occupancy of CD binding sites within gp would affect          subsequent interactions with CAP To answer this          question the binding of gp and gpsCD complexes          respectively to immobilized CAP was studied Results          shown in Fig indicated that sCD enhanced gpCAP          binding Maximum enhancement was observed at sCDgp          weight ratios of   Fig insert corresponding to a          molar ratio of       in agreement with the          observation that gpCD complexes consist of one          molecule each of CD and gp     BiotinylsCD in          the absence of gp did not bind to CAP Similarly          pretreatment of HIV with sCD resulted in subsequent          increased binding of virus with CAP the effect being          much more pronounced with HIV BaL in comparison with          HIV IIIB Fig                           Synergism between CAP and sCD in inhibiting HIV          infection          Since HIV can bind CAP and sCD simultaneously and          the binding of CAP is enhanced in the presence of sCD          it was of interest to determine whether these two ligands          act on HIV cooperatively resulting in synergism of          their antiviral effects This indeed was observed Table          and  Fig  CAP and sCD synergistically inhibited          infection by HIV IIIB Table  and HIV BaL Table           A similar synergism was observed for virucidal          activity against HIV IIIB Fig  but only additive          effects were found for HIV BaL in the absence of sCD          ED            for CAP     mgml in the          presence of sCD  gml which caused an fold          decrease of infectivity ED                mgml for residual          infectivity                          Treatment of HIV with CAP leads to induction of          gp sixhelix bundles          Earlier studies     in which the binding of CAP          treated and untreated virus with antibodies specific for          distinct regions on the envelope glycoproteins gp and          gp was studied indicated that CAP had either no effect          or caused decreased binding with antibodies against          several peptides from gp but only against a single          peptide  from gp see Discussion It was          intended to expand these studies to mAb NC specific          for the gp sixhelix bundle     Results of          preliminary studies indicated that CAP did not interfere          with the sixhelix bundle formation from constituent          peptides derived from near the N and Cterminus of the          gp ectodomain     own unpublished data          Surprisingly and unlike with mAb F    specific for          the Cterminal region of the gp ectodomain     CAP          treatment enhanced the binding of both HIV IIIB and          HIV BaL to mAb NC reacting with gp sixhelix          bundles from both HIV IIIB and BaL Fig  suggesting          the formation of these structures within virus particles          as a result of CAP treatment Fig  Treatment with          both CAP and sCD further enhanced the expression of the          sixhelix bundles in the case of HIV Bal Fig B but          not in the case of HIV IIIB Fig A sCD alone was          less effective in enhancing the expression of the          sixhelix bundles Treatment of neither recombinant gp          or the gp Cpeptide with CAP resulted in generation of          epitopes recognized by mAb NC data not shown          To exclude the remote possibility that mAb NC          reacted with CAP or proteinbound CAP and that this          rather than binding to sixhelix bundles would lead to          results shown in Fig  the binding of the mAb to CAP          coated wells was investigated No significant binding of          mAb NC and of control mouse IgG respectively to wells          coated by CAP directly or to CAP bound to HIV IIIB          gp was observed On the other hand antiphthalate          antibodies reacted with both forms of immobilized CAP          Fig  These results support the conclusions from          results in Fig           Engagement of the gp coreceptor binding site with a          tyrosine sulfated peptide from the Nterminus of the          coreceptor CCR     shown to inhibit infection by          CCRdependent but not CXCRdependent HIV isolates          was sufficient to increase the expression of the gp          sixhelix bundles in HIV BaL virus particles Fig           A CCR control peptide the tyrosines of which were not          sulfated did not have this effect Analogous experiments          with HIV IIIB were not performed since there are no          published data concerning the biological properties of          tyrosine sulfated peptides from the Nterminus of          CXCR          In the experiments described above evidence for the          formation of gp sixhelix bundles was obtained from          capture of CAP CD and CCR Speptide treated virus          particles respectively onto wells coated with mAb NC          This assay is equivalent to an immunoprecipitation assay          with solid phase mAb NC In order to provide further          evidence for the induction of the gp sixhelix bundles          by the distinct ligands binding to the HIV envelope the          newly formed structures in virus lysates were also          quantitated by a sandwich ELISA     The results not          only unequivocally confirmed the induction of gp          sixhelix bundle structures by sCD CAP and the          Speptide from CCR but also provided evidence that          these structures were undetectable in untreated virus          particles Fig  CAP  to  mgml in the          absence of virus particles provided negative results in          this assay The CCR peptide lacking sulfated tyrosines          did not induce the sixhelix bundles Thus it seems          likely that the detection of gp sixhelix bundles in          untreated HIV using the virion capture assay was due to          their spontaneous formation during prolonged incubation          of HIV in these tests The sixhelix bundles were also          induced by heating  min at C HIV virus particles          Fig           In summary blocking by CAP of the coreceptor binding          sites on the virus envelope glycoprotein gp within          HIV virus particles appears to induce conformational          changes in gp leading to the formation of sixhelix          bundle structures                          Shedding of gp from virus particles          It was reported that treatment of HIV gpgp          envelope glycoprotein oligomers with sCD lead to          shedding of gpsCD complexes concomitant with          increased exposure of some cryptic epitopes on gp                Therefore it was of interest to determine          whether or not shedding of gp from virus particles was          required for the CAP induced exposure of binding sites          for mAb NC on gp Treatment of HIV IIIB and BaL          with CAP did not decrease the level of virusassociated          gp in comparison with control virus preparations          Table  The results agree with the half life of  h          for virus associated gp in the course of spontaneous          gp shedding from HIV HXB at C    and the          small sCD induced release of gp within  min at C              Thus gp shedding was not a prerequisite for          the formation of gp sixhelix bundles                            Discussion        Earlier studies    indicated that CAP treated HIV        particles have their coreceptor ie CXCR and CCR        binding sites obstructed while sites involved in        association with CD appeared unaffected This suggested        that HIV could bind CD and CAP at the same time        independently Since association with CD induces        conformational changes in the HIV envelope glycoprotein        gp       it was of interest to determine a        whether CD binding to HIV would affect subsequent        association of the virus with CAP and b the consequences        of both CD and CAP binding to virus particles First it        was found that pretreatment of gp with sCD enhanced        subsequent binding with CAP Fig  This could be        ascribed to conformational changes in gp to the        concealment of surface areas with the greatest negative        charge on gp by CD     Fig  which could        diminish the electrostatic attraction between gp and        negatively charged CAP or to additional CAP binding sites        on the CD portion of gpsCD complexes The binding of        HIV with CAP was similarly enhanced by pretreatment with        sCD Fig  the effect being much more pronounced with        the R virus HIV BaL in comparison with the X virus        HIV IIIB These observations may be related to the        recognized role of CD in inducing conformational changes        in gp that contribute to the exposure of binding sites        for CXCR and CCR              Furthermore it seemed important to determine whether        simultaneous CD and enhanced CAP binding to HIV would        result in synergistic effects for inhibition of HIV        infection Evidence for such synergism was indeed        established Table and  Fig         Earlier studies     in which the binding of CAP        treated and untreated virus to antibodies specific for        distinct regions on the envelope glycoproteins gp and        gp was studied indicated that CAP caused decreased        binding with antibodies against several peptides from gp        but only with a single antibody against peptide         from gp for numbering of amino acid residues see our        earlier publication     Thus there are fewer binding        sites for CAP on gp than on gp Interestingly        molecular docking studies revealed that phthalic and acetic        acid anhydride modified cellotetratose a subunit of CAP        docked to a single site on the gp core structure        overlapping the peptide  Fig  This region is        in the vicinity of the most prominent positively charged        areas on the surface of the gp core which has an overall        negative charge Since CAP blocks coreceptor binding sites        on gp    it was of interest to determine whether this        blockade would lead to conformational changes in HIV        gp similar to those elicited by CD or coreceptor        binding to gp        The occupancy of CD and coreceptor binding sites by        their respective ligands elicits downstream conformational        changes in the envelope glycoprotein gp rendering it        competent for fusion between virus and target cell        membranes          Shedding of gp from        virus particles is not required for subsequent membrane        fusion events     The induction of gp sixhelix        bundles detectable by mAb NC by CAP in the absence of        gp shedding is consistent with this conclusion The        conformational changes lead to the formation of a        coiledcoil in gp consisting of three NH          terminal leucineisoleucine zipper        regions each contributed by one of the three subunits of        the envelope glycoprotein trimer In the presence of target        cell membranes the NH          terminal fusion peptide is displaced        in the direction of the target cell membrane into which it        inserts Thus the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp becomes        an integral component of two membranes the viral membrane        and the cellular membrane The outer surface of the        coiledcoil contains grooves into which three heptad repeat        regions from the Cterminal part of the gp ectodomain        pack resulting in a stable sixhelix bundle                      The sixhelix bundle structure can        be detected by specific antibodies               Results presented here indicate that purified HIV        particles do not contain detectable sixhelix bundle        structures Their expression is induced by CAP treatment of        the virus Fig and  Prior engagement of CD binding        sites is not required for the induction of the sixhelix        bundles by CAP but increases their expression Fig and         The apparent cooperativity between CAP and sCD in        induction of the gp sixhelix bundle structures may        possibly be related to the observed synergism between these        two ligands for inhibition of HIV infection Table and         Fig  The hypothesis that engagement of coreceptor        binding sites on gp by CAP leads to the expression of        gp sixhelix bundle structures is supported by the        finding that a tyrosine sulfated Speptide but not the        nonsulfated peptide from the Nterminus of CCR             has an effect similar to that of CAP Fig  The        helixbundles were also induced by heating HIV virus        particles at C in agreement with the irreversible        induction of the fusogenic conformation in influenza virus        hemagglutinin by heat            In summary the results presented here suggest that        treatment of HIV with CAP leads to conformational changes        in the envelope glycoproteins ultimately resulting in the        absence of target cell membranes in the formation of gp        sixhelix bundles These structures are extremely stable        and represent a terminal functionally inactive viral        constituent      Fig  analogous to that of        inactivated influenza virus hemagglutinin HA exposed to        low pH in the absence of cell membranes                                   Conclusions        Earlier studies describing the underlying molecular        mechanisms involved in the HIV inhibitory effect of the        candidate microbicide CAP indicated that this compound        remains bound to HIV impairing virus infectivity by        blockade of binding sites for cellular coreceptors CXCR        and CCR     Results reported here further extend these        findings and show that  there is synergism between sCD        and CAP for inhibition of virus infectivity  CAP binding        to HIV leads to conformational changes in viral envelope        glycoproteins resulting in the expression of functionally        inert sixhelix bundle structures        To the best of our knowledge results reported here and        earlier    represent the most detailed study on the        mechanism of action of a polymeric antiHIV compound and        offer new opportunities for microbicide research including        the design of combined microbicides with distinct target        sites on HIV and acting synergistically
