           yeah so um what do you feel about the universal health insurance issue   well well im im not really very much in favor of it at all uh i i feel like uh the the government gets involved in in a little bit too much of our life anyway and health insurance is is one thing that im im not sure that they have the expertise to to run it anyway and i i just kind i kind of feel like like i say weve got too much government already   umhum i guess my my initial reaction would be that that i would be for it mainly from the standpoint that that i find um my health insurance not very effective and very expensive   umhum yeah   and so i you know am am probably being very naive im hoping that that by by centralizing it it might get better and be cheaper   yeah well i guess i i i i guess my my my my own opinion of of uh government programs in general  especially those that are centralized type you know centralizing type of programs i have not seen one yet that that that i i felt like really worked the way it should i think that uh the private sector has uh a lot more expertise available and has the incentives to make a program work whereas a a bureaucracy uh people that work in in a bureaucracy are just there to keep the bureaucracy going   umhum   so uh im   what about uh things like in Sweden isnt isnt that sort of a centralized or in lots of places in Europe   yeah well i guess uh uh like i said i i i dont really know that much about it i ive uh uh mine may be more prejudice than opinion you know i i guess ive got uh uh prejudice against the government you you know uh   umhum umhum   i i feel like i feel like too much government is too much government   right i you know i guess i can certainly agree with that but um you know like i said i feel im being uh being stung every time   yeah yeah i i know that uh the British like i say i know i understand that the British system uh which is you know centralized medical program does not work very well or at least the people are not real real happy with it   oh i see   and and uh i i thats my understanding anyway   umhum umhum yeah i knew they had one but i just i guess i assumed it worked which is is uh not a good   and uh you know yeah yeah you know when when you when you read uh uh uh see the some of the articles or or watch in particular watch some of the British made television shows you get the impression that its its more or less a joke uh you know a lot of people use it because they dont have an alternative uh an affordable affordable alternative   umhum umhum   but theyre you know they still it doesnt work very well i know in here in Texas in in the Dallas area we have a uh a county run hospital   umhum   you know the county furnishes the hospital and people that dont have uh access to to insurance and stuff are able to go to that hospital but if you go there if youre you know if youve got an emergency you have to be almost dead before you can get in like you know in a timely manner because there are so many people sitting there waiting all the time   uhhuh uhhuh   for medical services that you know if you may be there five or six hours you know for just normal treatment   umhum umhum   and and  i guess im not uh im not too keen on having to go to a to a some kind of a location like that on on a routine basis   right umhum maybe i dont know much about HMOs but my impression is maybe maybe some uh HMOs are sort of a low form of centralization   well i guess uh to some extent uh an HMO i i have been involved have have been a member of an HMO before for a short period of time and and that did work very well   umhum   but it was you know the company it was a company sponsored plan and and it it is you know individual doctors that do own or have a you know have a a shareholders in an HMO   um umhum   and uh so its not  i i guess uh its not a its not a government run operation and thats thats you know thats my main objection i you know i dont care how they finance it   right umhum   you know  they could they could put a tax on me and say this is for medical insurance and then hire a you know some kind of private company thats not run by a government to you know to run the program   umhum   and and that might work but if its if its going to be run you know and supervised at at at a government level by a bureaucratic type you know operation   umhum   uh i dont think its going to work myself   umhum   i do i do think that were headed that way i think that theres a strong possibility that in in my lifetime i will see uh you know  see one in operation so   umhum is that because of of the the cost or or government wants it you think   well i think i think that uh i think there only that want it uh   umhum   and i think the government will respond you know to when i say a lot of people im not saying a majority of people but i think the government will respond to that group that does want it   umhum umhum   you know so you know you know i guess i i   well   im a im a pessimist in that in that respect     well but thats interesting because you know its its i dont know that much about it but my initial response would be more favorable and and perhaps i need to to learn more about it so that im not so naive on it   yeah yeah well i guess and and and and perhaps mine too you know perhaps i i need to know       have stronger arguments for why are are or find out the the arguments in favor of you know so but uh     uhhuh   but thats i guess thats  i had not thought about before so   right well it was nice talking to you okay okay um umhum byebye   yeah it was nice talking to you too okay thanks bye
