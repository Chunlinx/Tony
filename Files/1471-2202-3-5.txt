                    Background        Circadian clocks located within metazoan brains have        been a focus of investigation for decades               Such clocks are compelling in part because they influence        timing across many levels of analysis they are driven by        molecular elements whose concerted output in the form of        neuronal signaling controls physiology and behavior            Recently the presence of circadian clocks in peripheral        tissues has been established in the fruitfly as well as in        lower vertebrates and mammals        For example in                Drosophila such clock functions have        been demonstrated in antennae wings legs a neurohumoral        gland and internal excretory structures       But        it is unknown whether timekeeping mechanisms are identical        wherever clocks are found within an animal While it        appears that the same molecules previously identified as        clock components in the brain give rise to clock function        in the periphery it is not yet known whether clock genes        and their encoded proteins act and interact in the same        manner wherever they are expressed Similarly although        circadian pacemaker cells in the         Drosophila brain have been        characterized anatomically as discrete clusters of cells        called the Lateral Neurons      the identity of        clock cells in the tissues we studied is unknown The same        can be said about the function of these clocks while        circadian clock cells in the brain control behavioral        rhythms the biological functions of clocks in peripheral        tissues are minimally understood except perhaps in the        case of the antenna            Analysis of genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying        circadian clocks in whole animals or isolated tissues is        facilitated by the use of molecular reporters such as        firefly         luciferase          luc  The use of firefly         luciferase          luc  as a realtime molecular        reporter of gene expression has been illustrated in a        variety of model systems including cyanobacteria plants         Drosophila  and mammals               This method has proved especially valuable in        studies about molecular rhythms because realtime        expression of clock genes and other chronobiological        factors may be monitored over many daily cycles         in vivo                Applications of this technique are varied For example         luc reporters have been employed to        identify previously unappreciated genes that are involved        in circadian timing     as well as to demonstrate the        presence of circadian clocks in isolated         Drosophila tissues        We previously employed         luc reporting to study the effects of        a         cryptochrome mutation          cry         b  concentrating on clock gene        expression in isolated antennal pairs from         Drosophila     Earlier studies        established that         cry encodes a deepbrain element of        the photoreceptive pathway to the circadian clock              But our study suggested a different role for         cry in the periphery because        antennal rhythmicity in mutant specimens was dramatically        reduced in constant darkness     an effect that is not        consistent with the idea that the encoded protein CRY        functions solely as a photoreceptor for the circadian        system             While carrying out those studies we became aware that        there are interesting features of these peripheral rhythms        like the phase of peak expression for example that we        were unable to compare rigorously amongst body parts Such        concerns motivated us to develop a set of tools for the        analysis of circadian rhythms     Here we apply two        key features of this analytic package that were unavailable        for our earlier report on the effects of         cry         b in the periphery     First is        a method to eliminate nonlinear trends in the data a        potential source of artifact that could affect whether         luciferase activity is scored as        rhythmic or arrhythmic Figure illustrates how rhythmicity        generated by one antennal pair is extracted from rather        weak output by the application of appropriate analytic        tools In addition the normalization procedure facilitates        comparisons between rhythms from different tissues by        reducing the scale of the output to a mean of one for each        case see Results Second we were not previously able to        examine effects of a given variable genotype body part        on circadian phase The application of circular statistics        to these data allows us to evaluate such effects        Our earlier conclusions    have been substantially        buttressed by the new features of these timeseries        analyses With respect to its effects on clockgene        cyclings the         cry         b mutation significantly reduces the        number of rhythmic antennal pairs heads bodies and        forelegs but not wings compared with         cry controls Moreover we have        intensified the analysis of the rhythmic specimens and thus        observed that parameters of rhythmicity are altered in the        subset of rhythmic mutant specimens Among the new findings        that have emerged from the current analyses the most        salient are that          cry         b has a significant effect on the        phase of clock gene expression in rhythmic peripheral        tissues and  in isolated         cry tissues the relationship        between the peak phase time of         luc reported expression from         per and         tim genes respectively varies such        that the peaks are indistinguishable in antennae and they        differ significantly in wings or forelegs for example The        findings reported here strengthen the hypothesis that clock        mechanisms in the periphery differ from each other as well        as from those operating in the central nervous system of         Drosophila                        Results                  Effects of cry b on rhythms in isolated clock          tissues under lightdark cycles          We evaluated these various isolated tissues under a          series of successive hrlighthrdark cycles LD           These environmental conditions are the least          likely to reveal deficits in the pattern of clock gene          expression because the lightdark cycle provides a          dominant stimulus to the clock clock time is normally          synchronized to this environmental cue and is thought to          increase the amplitude of clock gene cycling                Rhythmicity was assessed for each specimen by          autocorrelation analysis      This analysis          provides a quantitative estimate of rhythmicity with          statistical confidence whereas the confidence interval          is based solely on the number of data points used in the          analysis without relying on the variability in the data          set or any other feature of the measured values the          criterion for statistical confidence is the same for all          individual or group analyses within an experiment see             for more detail In addition the autocorrelation          readouts may be used in a less stringent and more          subjective manner to evaluate rhythmicity based on the          shape of a given plot  even when statistical          significance is not achieved see    for discussion          of this feature of applying autocorrelation This          qualitative criterion is conservative from at least one          perspective If we imagine that           cry           b s effect might be an elimination          of           perluc and           timluc cyclings given the          mutants isolation phenotype     elementary          scrutiny of correlogram plots increases the chance that          data from a given specimen could be judged rhythmic          thereby decreasing the likelihood that we would go          overboard in evaluating mutationally induced damage to          the clock system Figure provides an example of why we          use a system of qualitative criteria to assess          rhythmicity while the correlogram of a pair of forelegs          shown on the top row indicates a statistically          significant rhythm the foreleg pair shown on the bottom          row is tabulated as rhythmic even though the correlogram          does not achieve statistical significance In an effort          to include any specimen that could be judiciously          apprehended as rhythmic we applied this conservative          criterion to obtain the data shown in Tables and  We          also show our analysis in graphic form for data averaged          from each tissue of a given type to illustrate effects of                    cry           b in cases for which only the          rhythmic specimens were included Figures and  also          see Materials and Methods          The           cry           b mutation significantly reduced          the number of rhythmic specimens for each of the body          parts we assayed as measured by both reporters in LD           with the exception of the wing see Table and          Table  Moreover whereas on average all of the           luc reported cycles were          significantly rhythmic in a           cry background the minor fraction          of           cry           b specimens that appeared rhythmic          based on the shape of the correlogram were not always          significantly rhythmic on average Mutant rhythmicity          that passed muster in that manner was evident for both          reporters only in the wing and antennal pairs In          addition           BGluc cry           b but not           timluc cry           b  cycles were significantly          rhythmic in the forelegs Otherwise the mutation          eliminated significant rhythmicity          We were interested in whether the mutant specimens          that retained rhythmicity appeared normal In this          regard a potentially more informative indication of the           cry           b effect was provided by the          Rhythmicity Index RI an estimate of a rhythms          strength that draws on the autocorrelation readouts see          Tables and  see Materials and Methods as well as              for further discussion of this parameter RI values          indicated that the strengths of rhythmicity from the LD           monitorings were significantly lowered by           cry           b for both reporters and in all of          the body parts Table and Table  Thus the           cry           b mutation reduces the strength of          cycling in these body parts in other words these          rhythms are less robust than in the           cry controls          In Figures     plots of average counts for          each tissue are presented based on the rhythmic subset          of specimens tabulated in Tables and for LD           These average signals indicate once again that           cry           b impinges on clockgene cyclings          For example with the exception of the           BGluc reported wing data shown in          Figure d simple inspection of the raw data column          suggests that           cry           b reduces or eliminates such          cyclings under LD  compare the raw data for           cry v           cry           b for example in Figure a b or          c The appearance of rhythmicity in the           cry           b specimens is mostly revealed          after detrending and normalization see Figures             the second column labeled normalized However in the          case of heads and bodies  for which there were very few          rhythmic           cry           b samples Table   no          rhythmicity is evident in the averaged plots One          explanation for this could be that the separate rhythms          are not in phase with one another or are noisy thus the          average may not appear to be rhythmic Nevertheless          applying autocorrelation to the averaged timecourses          revealed daily cyclings to have occurred in all cases          except for the average taken from the rhythmic subset of           BGluc cry           b bodies These results show that          rhythmicity is evident in the mean signal as well as when          it was initially tabulated on a specimen by specimen          basis see Materials and Methods Nevertheless there          might not have been agreement between these two views of          rhythmicity for any of the tissues or between different          approaches to the analysis of phase as described below          Although it is unlikely that arrhythmic specimens would          give rise to a mean rhythm it is conceivable that          rhythmic specimens might give rise to an arrhythmic          mean                          Output from phase analysis          We measured the time of peak luciferase activity for          each of the five daily cycles included in the monitoring          and analysis of a given specimen see Materials and          Methods A mean peak time per day was thereby          calculated for each specimen with such a value taken as          the representative phase for that specimen One goal of          quantifying the molecular phases was to compare the          normal           timluc timecourse values to the           BGluc ones for each tissue in a           cry genetic background For this          we used circular statistics      Briefly the          phase of each specimen is plotted as a time point          Figures   An average vector is calculated based on          the distribution of phase points around the unit circle          The angle of the vector corresponds to the mean phase for          the group of points and the magnitude of the vector          represents the variability in the phase estimates              The WatsonWilliamsStevens statistic was applied to          evaluate whether two such vectors are significantly          different from one another     Significant          differences were evident in the phase of these two clock          genes cyclical expression under a lightdark cycle for          all tissues except isolated antennal pairs and the heads          see Figure  and           From similar analyses performed on the           BGluc data in a           cry vs a           cry           b background the mutation was          revealed to affect the phase of           BGluc reported cycling in all          tissues except bodies see Figure  and note that there          were only  or  rhythmic           BGluc cry           b samples for analysis of heads and          bodies respectively and that neither one of the mean          vectors representing these samples is significant by          Rayleighs test Thus           cry           b s effect on the phase of these          molecular rhythms is as potent as the effect on cycling          as such          The analysis of phase presented in Figure and Figure          relies on an average estimate of phase for each specimen          and it neglects any variability in the occurrence of          peaktime associated with the daily rhythm in          bioluminescence As noted above the mean vectors          depicted within each panel of Figures  represent a          vector average of the individual phase estimates with the          direction of the vector indicating the mean time and the          length of the vector indicating the variability          dispersion of the estimates An alternative analysis          presented in Figures   preserves the intraspecimen          variability This analysis called a bivariate analysis              represents an individual specimen as a vector in          the xy plane The position of each point plotted as an          asterisk or an open circle is determined by the          variability of the occurrence of the peak for that          individual record Thus the points that fall on the          diameter of the circle are precisely consistent from day          to day while those falling closer to the origin indicate          greater variability The position of the point within the          circle describes the mean peak time for each specimen In          this way each point indicates the head of a vector that          summarizes the phase for a particular specimen The tail          of the vector would connect the point to the origin but          we do not plot the vectors this way because the figure          would be difficult to interpret A statistical comparison          between the two groups in this case           perluc v           timluc or           perluc cry v           perluc cry           b  is obtained by first          calculating a mean vector that connects the origin to the          center of the cloud of points defined by the respective          group and then testing whether or not these          representative vectors are different from one          another          The results shown in Figures and are consistent          with those in Figure and  but the interpretation of          the figures is different For example Figure eon the          right shows that the           cry           b mutation affects the mean peak          phase significantly this difference is evident in the          distribution of the mean phase estimates estimates          plotted outside the circle on the right in Figures            When these same           luc records are plotted using the          bivariate method as shown in Figures   both the          temporal distribution and the intraspecimen variability          determine the placement of individual points within the          circle on the right in Figure e The plot in Figure          eshows much more detail about the rhythmic output          generated by each specimen it is clear that the           cry forelegs produced a stable          rhythm in nearly all of the  cases as indicated by the          presence of the asterisks on or near the edge of the          circle On the other hand it is readily apparent from          this plot that the  rhythmic           cry           b specimens are more variable in          the daily timing of peak phase because more than half of          the points representing this group are plotted within the          circle relatively closer to the origin than the           cry points Nevertheless the          statistical test that corresponds to the treatment of          data depicted in Figures  only tells us that the          phases are different it is not possible to determine          whether this difference comes from the temporal          distribution or the variability or a combination of the          two Therefore the interpretation of these two different          phase analyses is that there is a significant effect of           cry           b on the peak phase of the clock in          the foreleg Figures   and that there is also an          effect of this variant on the mean occurrence of peak          phase Figures and                           Effects of cry b on antennal rhythms in constant          darkness and constant temperature          Temporally varying LUC activity was examined for          antennal pairs in constant darkness DD to assess          whether           cry           b affects freerunning rhythmicity          As noted above these rhythms may appear to be weaker in          constant conditions than under LD  see Table           Earlier studies have shown that the amplitude of rhythms          in DD is reduced compared to LD     These          observations could reflect a weakening of synchrony          between for example the two antennae within a well or          between multiple clock cells within a specimen But the          method for monitoring           luc activity can also contribute to          the appearance of damping within a record          Linear as well as nonlinear trends in the data come          into play in experiments using luciferase reporter          technology      Such artifacts were shown in one          substrate replenishment experiment to be the result of          inevitable depletion of luciferin from the medium          surrounding the tissues over time     Removal of          these trends quantitatively clarifies the record of          bioluminescent activity with regard to any rhythmicity          that might be present     The normalization          procedure we use see Figure and    for more detail          exposes the rhythm if one is present in a manner that          is quantifiable without reference to the type of          measurement that has been employed for example          countspersecond metric on the ordinate of the relevant          plots becomes dimensionless One salutary consequence is          that comparisons between groups  differing for example          by body partare based on the nature of the rhythmicity          per se independent of tissuedependent levels of overall          reporter expression Therefore the use of computational          techniques to detrend and normalize the signals permitted          us to extract and characterize rhythms for comparative          analysis  clearing out other features that were deemed          relatively unimportant in terms of the manner by which          tissuetype background genotype or transgene type would          influence the appreciation of these clockgene          cyclings          As indicated in Table  the effects of           cry           b in DD are consistent with its          effects in LD  In constant conditions the mutation          significantly reduced the number of rhythmic antennal          pairs for both reporters However degrees of rhythmicity          were also impinged on by the conditions alone in that          only the           BGluc cry cycles were          significantly rhythmic on average          From a more quantitative perspective the mean RI          value resulting from the DD monitorings was decreased by          an order of magnitude in the           cry           b mutation compared to           cry for           timluc as well as           BGluc activity see Table  This          effect of           cry           b is further underscored by an          analogous effect on rhythm amplitude The measures of          mean amplitudes given in Tables and stem from computing          the distances as graphed from the peak or trough to          the mean line running through plots of the detrended          and normalized signals           cry           b caused amplitude decrements for          the timecourses mediated by expression of both           luc fusion transgene types Table                    This           cryptochrome mutation produced          dramatic effects on the phase of both reporters in DD          The meanphase values were estimated to occur more than           hours earlier for           cry           b antennae compared to the           cry appendages This effect of           cry           b indicates that the gene may          contribute to regulation of the endogenous phase for the          antennal clock Alternatively the extreme difference in          phase could indicate the loss of synchrony between          multiple clock cells within the antennae consistent with          the large decrease seen in the RI value These results          suggest that           cry may normally play a role in the          determination of clock time or alternatively that it          may act to synchronize clock time between individual          clock cells          Previous studies of cryptochromes chronobiological          role in           Drosophila emphasized that CRY may          function as a deep brain photoreceptor involved in          mediating resetting of the clock by light              Support for this hypothesis came from the observation          that locomotoractivity rhythms in           cry           b flies are unaffected in constant          darkness and also maintain rhythmicity under constant          light a condition that causes behavioral arrhythmicity          in the wild type     While antennal rhythms of gene          expression and of odor sensitivity in DD are          significantly attenuated in           cry           b tissues      unlike          locomotor rhythmicity     it remained possible that          such effects are due to an altered role of light on the          developing clock To address this possibility we reared          experimental subjects and prepared antennal samples in a          temperature cycle CC in DD and then tested the          antennal samples in constant darkness at a constant warm          temperature  here called HH  for constant high          temperature  to distinguish this experiment from the          standard LD rearingDD tests described above          As shown in Table  the effects of           cry           b on molecular rhythmicity in HH          are similar to what was observed in the LD and standard          DD monitorings The number of rhythmic specimens was          significantly reduced by the mutation for both           BGluc and           timluc reported rhythms However          very few of the rhythmic specimens among either           cry or           cry           b antennal pairs was significantly          periodic see Table  Further unlike what was found in          the other conditions the RI values stemming from the HH          test were similar across genotypes and reporters          Similiarly there was no effect of the           cry           b mutant on the amplitude of the          normalized rhythmic output of our reporters in these          experiments Table           A combined effect of the temperature regimen together          with that of           cry           b was detected on the phase of          molecular cycling A mutationally induced difference of           hours was observed in HH as opposed to  hours in DD          The direction of the           cry           b induced phase modification was          the same as that observed in DD at a lower temperature          More generally and aside from the genotypic effect          highlow entrainment followed by subjecting these          isolated appendages to a constant high temperature          caused a phase effect Peak times of LUCreported          cyclings were shifted  or  hours earlier in the HH          tests  respectively for           BGluc cry and           timluc cry antennae  compared          with the results of LD rearing and DD monitoring                            Discussion        We have developed a tool kit for the analysis of        cyclical data    and here have applied it to molecular        data involving circadian clocks in isolated tissues of         Drosophila Two features of this        approach the evaluation of rhythmicity and the evaluation        of phase have been emphasized        The first prominent feature is the application of        filters for normalizing and detrending the raw timecourse        data Such a preparation may indicate whether or not a        rhythmic signal is present as shown in Figure         Subsequent criteria are evaluated by means of the        autocorrelation function to determine whether a rhythm is        present in the data and if so whether it is statistically        significant However we do not rely on statistical        significance as an absolute test of rhythmicity On the one        hand statistical confidence provides a quantitative        standard that removes investigator bias on the other hand        biological signals can fail this test while still        displaying the features of rhythmicity We have adopted a        strategy for addressing this complexity based on several        criteria as discussed in the companion paper     The        overall approach is somewhat subjective yet it is        systematic and does not rely on an arbitrary decision about        periodicity in the data We evaluate each record  blind to        treatment or genotype  as raw data or normalizeddetrended        data If the shape of the autocorrelation function displays        periodicity a sinusoidal pattern in the circadian range        we accept the presence of rhythmicity and quantify the        strength of the rhythm using the RI value In addition we        keep track of which samples are significantly rhythmic and        which samples are not with the RS metric see Tables and        for examples Although we go into this matter more        thoroughly in the companion paper we reiterate here that        this subjective use of the autocorrelation function to        establish rhythmicity is not unprecedented in fact it has        been recommended as a valid approach to situations like our        experiments where the number of data points is relatively        small     In general it must be noted that the use of        both tabulated and averaged data also supports this        approach For example the average of the RI values given        for the rhythmic         perluc antennal samples in LD as        indicated in Table is lower than the RI values shown for        the mean signal presented in Figure a This difference        occurs because the rhythmicity expressed by individual        samples within the respective groups is similar and the        averaging process portrayed in the plotted data shown in        Figure a tends to strengthen the rhythms in question and        to eliminate idiosyncracies within a given record        Thus we have quantified how the         cry         b mutation affects molecular        rhythmicity in two ways First it reduces the number of        rhythmic peripheraltissue specimens in all cases except         and most intriguing  for the wing Second even when only        the rhythmic         cry         b versus         cry specimens are considered the        former genotype causes a significant reduction of RI        values with the exception of antennal pairs whose        molecular timecourses were monitored at constant        temperature        A variety of claims have been made about the phase of        clock gene expression in various tissues and cell types        While immunohistochemical studies have suggested that the        course of wildtype         per cycling may differ between        photoreceptors and neurons in the central brain            molecular studies have suggested that there is no        difference between the phase of         per mRNA cycling in photoreceptors        vs the rest of the head  The interpretation of such        studies is complicated by the inability to assess phase        over several cycles within a specimen However even when        such measurements have been facilitated by the use of        realtime monitoring of         luc reporters there has been an        assertion that phase is essentially the same amongst        isolated tissues     Nevertheless given our        observation that the effects of the         cry         b variant may be tissuespecific as        well as the use of both         perluc and         timluc reporters we reexamined        this question quantitatively        Thus the second analytic feature we emphasize is the        analysis of phase We have applied two complementary        approaches The first approach uses circular statistics to        evaluate the distribution of peak phase estimates The        second approach uses a bivariate analysis that reveals        intraspecimen variability as well as mean peak time to test        differences in phase Specifically we applied these        methods to ask whether the two         luc reporters          BGluc and         timluc  peak at the same time in a         cry and otherwise clocknormal        genetic background and also whether the         cry         b mutation influences peak phase of        the         BGluc reporter        The observation of tissuespecific phase relationships        between         perluc and         timluc along with the apparent        difference in the absolute timing of phase is not        surprising Such differences could be explained both on the        basis of differences in cell types and differences in        function Whereas peripheral clocks are not necessarily        neuronal     it is conceivable that tissue specific        differences in the intracellular environment would force        different peak times on the clock mechanism Further based        on the tissue specific effects of         cry         b it is possible that the        configuration of a clock mechanism may vary between        different cell types For example the full ensemble of        clock factors present within these various tissues is not        yet known                    Conclusions        Following our previous development of a collection of        analytical tools for the study of molecular and behavioral        cycles     we now provide intensively performed        examples of the analysis of molecular rhythms in isolated        tissues from         Drosophila In the main but by no        means exclusively the current analyses were applied to        published data revolving round effects of the         cryptochrome gene as it functions in         Drosophilas circadian system            The results of the present study show that procedures for        detrending and normalizing the data clarify the presence        versus absence of rhythmicity  which tend strongly to be        associated with         cry functioning versus that        putatively remaining in the         cry         b mutant  as well as permitting a        more detailed understanding of the features accompanying a        given molecular timecourse Our conclusions from extended        and deepened analyses of these clockgene cyclings are        consistent with those in the earlier report            including the matter of peripheraltissue rhythms being        dependent in part on CRYmediated functions Moreover        current applications of our phase analysis uncovered new        phenomena These components of the toolkit reveal that         cry         b alters the phase of         period and         timeless gene expressions suggesting        further that  at least in the periphery  CRY plays a        quasicentral role in molecular timekeeping More broadly        in peripheral tissues whose genotype was clocknormal        phase differences that were evident among the different        body parts strengthen the notion that overall features of        the timekeeping mechanisms vary according to the local        molecular milieu This is perhaps as it should be  because        why would a structure such as the antenna necessarily wish        to exhibit a maximum or mininim value for a given piece of        clockoutput that might be the same as those elaborated        within the flys legs        The development of analytical strategies for analyzing        biological timeseries will continue to be important as new        realtime methods potentially including images of tissues        provide greater access to molecular and physiological        cycles Such strategies add depth as well as detail to the        study of biological timekeeping mechanisms                    Materials and Methods        Peripheral tissues were dissected from         D melanogaster adults as described        in Krishnan et al     The         perluc BGluc and         timluc transgenic strains were        originally described elsewhere      Automated        monitorings of luciferase LUC activity were the same        previously described      All of the data from        lightdark cycles LD  and from constant darkness        DD were from the LUC monitorings reported in Krishnan et        al     although most of the pertinent data were not        separated as to         perluc versus         timluc expressions and many of the        results were included as supplementary material Additional                cry specimens in Table  which did        not appear in the earlier report have been included here        substantially to augment the appreciation of normal        clockgene cycling in isolated tissues We also include        data from additional experiments collected under constant        high temperature C     These data were collected        after the submission of the earlier report        In these new experiments flies were reared in DD and in        temperature cycles hr C hr C Onetothree        dayold etheranesthetized males were collected and housed        for  days in these same conditions before the antennal        pairs were dissected The antennal pairs were placed        immediately in luciferincontaining medium in well        plates and transferred to the luminometer as described in            where they were exposed to  additional days of        the temperaturecycle in DD before being maintained at a        constant temperature of C for the duration of the        LUCmonitoring runs        The basic flowchart for handling data from a given        specimen and from an ensemble of like ones was as follows        Each record was evaluated for an adequate level of        expression above nospecimen background to insure that        the tissue had survived and was producing valid data cf            If expression levels were adequate the specimen        was assessed for rhythmicity Temporally varying LUC        activity was detrended and normalized as described in        Figure  Next autocorrelation analysis    was        performed to look for a rhythmic pattern of activity The        correlogram is a plot that reports correlationcoefficient        values on the vertical axis versus timelags plotted on the        horizontal axis Zero lag always provides a value of         because the correlation is perfect between the activity        record and a copy of itself at each point However as one        copy of the activity record is shifted along the time axis        in either direction by one point in other words a lag        of  hour the correlation falls off This process is        repeated and a correlation coefficient is calculated for        the activity record against itself for each lag shown in        the correlogram see bottom row of Figure for an example        If the correlation coefficients fall and rise in a periodic        fashion resembling a sinusoidal curve the record of LUC        activity is rhythmic As to whether such periodicity is        significant a  confidence interval is calculated based        on the number of observations in the experiment Rhythmic        activity is statistically significant if the peaks and        troughs of the autocorrelation function cross the boundary        set by the confidence interval centered at  on the        correlogram for further detail see    and references        therein As noted above in Results text we do not require        statistical significance to score a record as rhythmic The        appearance of rhythmicity in the correlogram is applied as        a qualitative criterion so that we do not treat weakly        rhythmic data as arrhythmic data The justification for        this strategy is given in Levine et al     In        addition we keep track of the number of specimens that        generated statistically significant rhythms as indicated in        Table and Table         We quantify the strength of a rhythm with the        aforementioned Rhythmicity Index RI is the height of the        third peak of the correlogram      Whereas the        confidence interval for the correlogram is based solely on        the number of observations the RI value is based on the        robustness of any regular fluctuations in the data For        example we record LUC activity every hour If we increased        the sampling frequency from once every  minutes to once        every  or  minutes the confidence interval would        become smaller while the shape and amplitude of the        correlogram would presumably remain unchanged from the        curve obtained by  minute sampling The RI value        however would not vary while the estimates of statistical        significance would vary according to the sampling        frequency        It is nevertheless informative to monitor the        statistical significance of periodicities for this we        devised a ratio that allows us to track whether or not a        specimen is significantly rhythmic the socalled        Rhythmicity Statistic RS An RS value is a ratio of the        RI value to the absolute value of the  confidence line        If RI is equal to or greater than the numerical height of        the confidence line then the rhythm is significant by        definition the height of the peak is  the height of the        confidence interval used to determine statistical        significance Alternatively if RI is less than the        confidence line the rhythm is not statistically        significant Thus RS provides a numerical accounting of        significance for an individual specimen or an average        signal        We define the amplitude of a rhythmic LUC timecourse as        the plotted distance in arbitrary units from the mean        peak or mean trough of the normalized activity record to         the latter is always the mean value of detrended and        normalized data as exemplified in Figure  The complete        range of the rhythm is twice the amplitude        Most of the analyses applied in the current study were        described in detail in the companion paper     We        augmented such treatments of the data by developing two        additional parameters the Rhythmicity Statistic RS and a        metric that allows specification of cycling amplitude        Analyses leading to the rhythmic parameters were applied to        individual samples their averages appear in Tables and         In addition averages of the LUC data computed across all        records within a given group which varied as to body part                luc reporter type and         cry allele were obtained and such        averaged timecourses were formally analyzed as shown in        Figures  and Figures   Consequently there are        differences between the Tables and Figures in values of        parameters such as the Rhythmicity Index RI see below        because the tables specify the means determined from        individualspecimen analyses while the figures provide        parameters determined after computing the average        timecourses        Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis MESA was employed to        estimate the period of a rhythm ie for a given        timecourse previously determined to be significantly        periodic by correlogram This method is presented in detail        elsewhere             We have discussed the analysis of phase using circular        statistics in the companion paper     Briefly an        average estimate of peak phase obtained for each specimen        is plotted as a point on a unit circle A mean vector        extending from the center of the unit circle towards the        diameter is calculated for each group of points the        direction of the vector indicates mean peak phase for the        group and the length of the vector represents the        variability or dispersion between the points phase        estimates for each specimen The WatsonWilliamsStevens        test returns an Fstatistic for the comparison of vectors        between two groups to determine whether they represent        significantly different estimates of phase see Figures         and     for further detail        One disadvantage of this phase analysis is the loss of        information about the variability of phase across cycles        for each specimen Therefore we have also introduced        another approach using bivariate statistics to represent        the molecular cycles more completely     In this        approach the record of each specimen is represented as the        tip of a vector whose direction indicates the mean phase        estimate as above and whose distance from the origin in        the xy plane represents intraspecimen variability see        Figures   Each group appears as a distribution of        points A mean vector extending from the origin to the        center of the distribution is calculated to describe the        overall mean peak phase and variability of the group of        points see Figures   for example Finally the two        groups are compared using Hotellings twosample test to        determine whether the respective vectors are different If        a significant difference between vectors is obtained this        method does not specify whether the difference is due to        the variability the peak phase estimate or some        combination of the two        All of the analyses described above as well as the        subsequent output the figures come from programs written        for the current study and the justprevious one           using Matlab Mathworks This software is available on        request
