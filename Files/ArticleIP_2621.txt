                                 Culture Wars            The only freight train thatcounts these days says former Reaganaut and current cyberguru George Gilderis the Internet with Java Java of course is the computerprogramminglanguage created by Sun Microsystems It promises to revolutionize personalcomputing making obsolete the proprietarysoftwarerunning desktop andshifting the center of gravity in the computer world toward the network thelargest part of which is the World Wide Web Heady claims indeed What exactlyis Java Click here to find out And yet if Java were called Oakits originalnameits a safe bet this column would never have been written            Thatsbecause the history of Java since its introduction in May of  isfundamentally one of cultural conflict in which symbols and rhetoric haveplayed as important a role as underlying technological differences Theconflict is between Javas supportersmost notably Gilder Sun CEO ScottMcNealy and Oracle CEO Larry Ellisonon the one hand and  well Microsofton the other As McNealy puts it in typically blunt terms Theres two campsthose in Redmond who live on the Death Star and the rest of us the rebelforces And in this struggle Java is the rebels supposed ace in the holethe tsunami that will sweep through the economy in Gilders words changingthe landscape forever and probably putting Slateout of business            Now McNealy and Gilder certainly think that Java is infact a technological transformation so important that those who do not adaptwill be left in the dust But the intensity of Suns evangelical efforttestifies to the overwhelming importance of marketing and name recognition intodays economy Its hard to know whether Javawhich in theory can run on anyplatformreally is superior to proprietary systems like Windows But even ifit is the history of technology is littered with superior products that neverattained mass appeal Technology does not in that sense speak for itself Ifit did Sun could have simply launched Java and waited for the inevitable tooccur Whether someone announces a tidal wave is coming after all isirrelevant to the waves arrival It crashes on the beach regardless What wesee with Java though is that in the business world a tidal wave can onlyexist if someone announces that its coming            Sun hasalready been remarkably successful in making Java into a brand name Oddlythough where Coke and Pepsi fight for consumers at the moment the realstruggle over Java is for the hearts and minds of developers In that senseinstead of focusing on the demand for Java Sun is emphasizing its supply Itsthe build it and they will come approach to business            Of course since Suns revenue from Java comesfrom licensing feesto among other companies Microsoftsoftware developersare its customers But theres a more important reason for the emphasison getting people to program with Java namely that its impossible to getcomputer users to abandon their current operating systems if they dont thinkthe alternative will be around five years from now Apple has run into thisproblem in recent years as Mac users have defected to Windows because fewerand fewer companies are writing Maccompatible versions of their programs Thequickest way to assure users that your alternative is viable is to show themthe plethora of programs being written for it or in the case of Java in itIn that sense you do have to build it before they will come            Thishelps explain for example why McNealy so often cites the  programmersincluding  IBMers who are programming in Java It also helps explain whythe Wall Street Journal s report that most of the  startup companiesfunded by Doerrs Java Fund are writing their software in languages other thanJava stung so much as did Corels abandonment of its plan to make its entireOffice suite of programs Javacompatible You never hear about how many peopleare actually downloading Java applets You only hear about how many companiesare making them For the Microsoft view of this marketing strategy click            There are a few things to keep in mind about Suns strategyfor Java with regard to the consumer market The first obviously is thatcreating a critical mass of developers turning out programs that work and thatpeople want is the crucial task The second thing is that Sun makes relativelyspeaking a minuscule amount of money from Java licensing To be sure itsalmost all pure profit but in relation to the companys workstation and serverbusiness the revenue is nearly irrelevant Whats most relevant for Sun is therole Java may play in eroding the desktop market and the proprietary authorityof Windows and Windows NT Insofar as Java makes the network is the computerseem true it helps Sun            Finallyits possible to see Suns approach to Java as an embodiment of whats calledJoys Law after Sun cofounder Bill Joy Lets be truthful Joy said Mostof the bright people dont work for youno matter who you are You need astrategy that allows for innovation occurring elsewhere Accordingly thefirst Sun workstations were assembled from offtheshelf components And whilethe companys most important product of the late s the SPARCstationfeatured a highspeed processor of Suns own devising throughout its historySun has done an impressive job of keeping pace with technological change byrefusing to remain locked into one vision of the future Suns genius as acompany in fact has always been its adaptability And it has done best whenit has remained committed to open standards            Now one could argue that by insisting oncontrolling the standards for Java Sun is violating Joys Law A recent letterthat Microsoft and Intel wrote asking the company to give up that control to aninternational body suggested as much But Sun has made Javas specs and thesource code freely available to developers in the hope that a hundred flowerswill bloom As Joy counseled if Java works it wont be because of Sun Itllbe because of what happens everywhere else            What will happen everywhereelse though is still uncertain Programmers do seem to find it easier to workin Java than in C and certainly the prospect of being able to download aspreadsheet document and read it without having to download the spreadsheetprogram is enticing But Java programs are still considerably slower than thosewritten for a particular operating system just as amphibious creatures are notas good on land as mammals or as good in water as fish And even the promise ofuniversal compatibility has not been completely realized            That ofcourse is precisely why Java has become such fertile ground forcyberevangelism To be sure George Gilder needs no excuse to writeblockthatmetaphor prose like this Java opens doors and shatters WindowsIt builds market cap as if by magic It raises the sun and illumines the roadahead to a new computer architecture Give poor Bill a break But the reallyinteresting thing about Java is that Gilder isnt the only one using this kindof language Everyone speaks as if the stakes are monumental Certainly withthe hype surrounding Windows  and with the introduction of the Mac in the relationship between cultural hegemony and business success was hinted atBut with Java Sun seems to be staking everything on that relationship If youwant to know where the real culture wars are forget the academy and thinkSilicon Valley and Redmond
