                    Background        The mammalian tachykinin peptides include neurokinin A        NKA neurokinin B NKB and substance P SP     It        is known that these three neuropeptides have a common        Cterminal amino acid sequence and that NKA and SP are        derived from the preprotachykinin A gene whereas NKB is        derived from the preprotachykinin B gene It is also known        that the biological actions of NKA NKB and SP are mediated        by three receptors named neurokinin NK NK and NK            Thus the tachykinins have been implicated in        several physiological actions such as salivation the        regulation of smooth muscle contraction depolarization of        central neurons hyperactivity interaction with        dopaminergic A neurons mediating behavioral activation        regulation of blood pressure and the transmission of the        baroreceptor reflex         In addition a loss of        tachykinincontaining neurons has been described in        neurodegenerative diseases     suggesting that the        decrease in the amount of tachykinins could be involved in        these and other diseases             Several inmunocytochemical  in situ  hybridization        and radioimmunoassay studies have demonstrated the        distribution of tachykinins in the rat the cat and the        monkey CNS              In the human        brainstem the presence of SP has been widely studied                  Moreover in humans the neurokinin B        system has been studied in the cerebral cortex hippocampus        and the hypothalamus     However no data are        available in the literature concerning the distribution of        neurokininimmunoreactive structures in the human        brainstem Thus in the present work we attempted to study        in detail the distribution of fibers and cell bodies        containing neurokinin in the human brainstem using an        immunoperoxidase technique and to compare our findings        with the distribution of other tachykinins previously        described in the human brainstem        Finally        we report here a widespread distribution of fibers and cell        bodies containing neurokinin in the human brainstem                    Results                  Distribution of NKir structures in the human          medulla oblongata                      NKir cell

of          NKir structures in the cat brainstem     Although          the presence of NKir fibers is widely distributed in          both cat and human brainstems it seems that the          distribution is a little more widespread in humans than          in cats Thus for example in the former we found NKir          fibers in the superior colliculus the restiform body          the pyramidal tract and in the pontine nuclei in which          in the cat no immunoreactive fibers were found              Comparing the distribution of cell bodies containing NK          in both cat and human brainstems it seems that the          distribution is widespread in the feline see              In both species NKir perikarya were found in the          periaqueductal gray and in the inferior colliculus          However in the cat cell bodies containing NK were          observed in the superior colliculus the interpeduncular          nucleus the lateral reticular nucleus and in the          nucleus of the solitary tract as well as in other          brainstem localizations in which we did not observe          NKir cell bodies in the same brainstem regions of          humans By contrast in humans we found NKir perikarya          located in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in          which in the cat no immunoreactive cell bodies were found              The differences observed in both species          concerning the distribution of cell bodies containing NK          could be due to technical considerations since in the          cat colchicine was administered in the fourth ventricle          in order to accumulate the peptide in cell bodies                       Our data are in agreement with previous results          described in the rat brainstem using radioimmunoassay          techniques      Thus these latter authors found          higher levels of NKA and lower levels of NKB in both the          midbrain and the medulla oblongata of the rat     In          both regions of the human brainstem we observed a high          density of NKir structures Moreover in the midbrain of          the rat those authors described NKA in the substantia          nigra the interpeduncular nucleus and the periaqueductal          gray     just as we found NKir structures in these          nuclei of the human brainstem when using          immunocytochemical techniques          Several studies have shown the distribution of NKA          preprotachykinin A mRNA    and NKB peptide          preprotachykinin B mRNA       in the CNS of          the rat The work of Harlan et al    revealed a more          widespread distribution of neurons encoding SP and NKA          preprotachykinin mRNA in the rat brainstem than the          distribution of NKir cell bodies observed in the human          brainstem In addition taking together the results of          the other four works        it also seems that          neurons expressing NKB are more widely distributed in the          rat brainstem than those observed containing NK in the          human brainstem However in the rat those authors did          not find either NKA nor NKB in the dorsal motor nucleus          of the vagus and in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi in          which in humans we observed NKir structures Future          works must address the issue of whether the discrepancies          observed in the distribution of neurokinin in both          species are due to technical andor species          differences                          Distribution of tachykinins in the human          brainstem          In comparison with previous works in which the          distribution of SP was described in the human brainstem                 it seems that in general taking together          the results obtained from the four abovementioned works          the distribution of NKir structures in this region of          the human CNS is quite similar Thus for example SP and          NKir structures have been observed in the same human          brainstem areas such as the periaqueductal gray          substantia nigra parabrachial nucleus inferior and          superior colliculi reticular formation nucleus of the          solitary tract red nucleus interpeduncular nucleus          medial vestibular nucleus cuneate nucleus spinal          trigeminal nucleus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the          vagus However for example we found NKir structures          the antibody used in this study principally recognizes          NKAsee specificity of the antiserum in Methods in the          human brainstem in the lateral cuneate nucleus and in the          pyramidal tract in which no SPir structure has been          described in humans        It is known that          both neuropeptides SP and NKA are derived from the same          precursor Thus the differences found in the          distribution of both neuroactive substances in the human          brainstem could be due to the intraneuronal segregation          transport of the peptides andor the different processing          of the precursor see     Another possibility could          be that the immunoreactivity observed in those nuclei of          the human brainstem in which NKir structures but not          SP are found is due to NKB the antibody used here also          recognizes NKB As is known this latter tachykinin          derives from the preprotachykinin B gene whereas SP and          NKA derive from another precursor the preprotachykinin          A gene Finally SPimmunoreactive cell bodies have been          found in the human brainstem for example in the          superior colliculus and in the spinal trigeminal nucleus               in which we did not find NKir perikarya                          Possible physiological actions of the NK in the          human brainstem          The widespread distribution of NKir structures in the          human brainstem suggests that the peptide might be          involved in several physiological actions acting as a          neurotransmitter andor neuromodulator Thus for          example the presence of NK in the nucleus of the          solitary tract the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus          the periaqueductal gray the spinal trigeminal nucleus          the interpeduncular nucleus the substantia nigra the          parabrachial nucleus and the superior and inferior          colliculi indicates that NK could be involved in a broad          range of physiological functions such as in          cardiovascular antinociceptive nociceptive motor          respiratory visual and auditory mechanisms Moreover a          possible interaction between NK and other neuropeptides          eg neurotensin and somatostatin in the human          brainstem could be suggested since in almost all the          nuclei located in the dorsal brainstem of humans          immunoreactive fibers containing NK neurotensin and          somatostatin have been observed      This          observation is in agreement with the results found in the          cat brainstem in which a clear anatomical relationship          between the three abovementioned neuropeptides has been          indicated     Finally we hope that our study will          serve to compare the distribution of NKir structures          found in normal human brainstems with those observed in          the future in brainstems showing a given pathology          eg Parkinson or Alzheimer disease since for          example the loss of SPcontaining neurons has been          described in the brainstem of people with Parkinsons          disease                                Conclusions         There is a widespread distribution of immunoreactive        structures containing neurokinin in the human        brainstem         The highest density of fibers and cell bodies        containing neurokinin was generally observed in the dorsal        part of the human brainstem         The widespread distribution of        neurokininimmunoreactive fibers and cell bodies indicates        that neurokinin might be involved in several physiological        functions acting as a neurotransmitter andor        neuromodulator                    Methods                  Immunocytochemistry          In order to avoid possible interference by endogenous          peroxidase freefloating sections were treated with          distilled water containing NH             H            O             and NaOH  for  min              Then the sections were washed for  min in PBS and          preincubated for  min in PBS containing  normal horse          serum and  Triton X The sections were then          washed for  min in the last solution containing caseine           and were incubated overnight at C in PBS          containing Triton X  and normal horse serum           as well as antineurokinin antiserum and diluted             The sections were then washed in PBS           min and incubated for  min at room temperature          with biotinylated antirabbit immunogamma globulin diluted           in PBS After a  min wash with PBS the sections          were incubated for  h with avidinbiotinperoxidase          complex Vectastain diluted  Finally after          washing the sections in PBS  min and TrisHCl buffer          pH  min the tissuebound peroxidase was          developed by H            O            using   diaminobenzidine as          chromogen The sections were rinsed with PBS and          coverslipped with PBSGlycerol                           Specificity of the antiserum          Polyclonal antineurokinin antibody was raised in          rabbits against immunogens prepared by coupling the          synthetic NKA peptide Bachem Switzerland to a carrier          protein human serum albumin with glutaraldehyde The          specificity of the immunostaining was controlled by          omission of the neurokinin antibody in the first          incubation bath No immunoreactivity was found Moreover          control sections were incubated in the primary antiserum          previously absorbed by neurokinin A or neurokinin B          Inhibition of staining was obtained after preincubation          of the first antiserum with neurokinin A  and           M or with neurokinin B  M Moreover no          significant reduction in immunoreactivity was observed on          incubating the first antiserum with an excess of SP          eledoisin or kassinin Thus the antibody used in the          present work principally recognizes NKA but shows some          crossreactivity with NKB For this reason the term           neurokininlike immunoreactive  NKir is used to          described the staining results in our material However          we have to indicate that the immunoreactivity found in          this study is mainly due to NKA see and compare Figs          B A AB since the distribution of NKB is much          less widespread in the human brainstem in comparison          with the distribution found for NKApersonal observation          obtained after using a very specific rabbit antiNKB          antibody from Peninsula Thus the antiNKB antibody          IHC  showed the following crossreactivities           for NKB  for physalaemin  for eledoisin  for          kassinin  for substance P  for NKA and  for          neuropeptide K Moreover in the nuclei of the human          brainstem in which NKB was observed the density of the          immunoreactivity for NKB was lesser than that found in          the same nuclei for NKA see and compare Figs B A          AB                          Mapping          Mapping was carried out according to the atlas of the          human brain of Haines     and the same atlas was          used for the terminology of the brainstem nuclei In          addition the atlas of Paxinos et al    was          consulted          The number of immunostained cell bodies appearing in          each section from each person was counted a high density          of NKir perikarya was considered when we found more than           cell bodiessection a moderate density when we found           cell bodiessection and a low density when we          found fewer than  cell bodiessection The density of          the immunopositive fibers was graded under microscopic          observation into four categories high moderate low and          single This was accomplished by viewing the sections          under brightfield illumination at a constant          magnification with reference to photographs of defined          series of densities              Finally photomicrographs were obtained with a          CoolSNAP digital camera attached to a Zeiss Axiophot          microscope To improve the visualization of the results          only the brightness and contrast of the images were          adjusted without any further
