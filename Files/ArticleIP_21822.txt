                                 A Message to My Enemies            Theres a wellknown onlinestock maven who calls himself TokyoMex Like me he manages money for clientsand also writes publicly about stocks As we reported last week inTheStreetcom TokyoMex is concerned the Securities and Exchange Commission isbuilding a case against him for pump and dump That means hyping a stock heowns so the price goes up and then dumping his shares on the public            Unlike me TokyoMex hasno formal disclosure policy about stocks he is writing about In other waysinmy opinion based on press reportshe is clearly less responsible than I amabout the hazards of writing about smallcapitalization stocks which he canmove Yet not a single newspaper magazine or broadcast entity picked upTheStreetcoms scoop that the SEC is investigating him His online followingjudging from press accounts is much bigger than mine And my record of givinggood financial guidance publicly and privately is better than his So why thefuss over me while other portfolio managers write every day about their stockpicks and get no heat            Lets establish some things up front First there is nodifference between a portfolio manager who recommends stocks in an interview toa reporterwhich is the meat and potatoes of financial journalismand aportfolio manager who recommends stocks in a column of his ownwhich isconsidered controversialexcept that the second portfolio manager reveals hisholdings while the first one doesnt have to            Second the public would much rather hear frommanagers with real money on the line than it would from journalists who aretrying to talk about a market that they are actually forbidden to invest inThe success of Squawk Box on CNBCthe toprated business show whichhas real live managers as daily cohoststells us this            Third journalists whotake an oath never to invest cant possibly be as good about the inner workingsof the market as those who do invest I am in the trenches every dayJournalists arent allowed in the trenches If you think the trenches matterand believe me they matter as much in business as they do in war and in theNFL then you want me to write You arent going to get it another way            On the Net there are hundreds of money managers writingevery day But in the offline press there are very few Why The heat theintense anger felt by the traditional offline press as we invade their turfis searing One look at the horrible press I get from other business writerswho are not portfolio managers would scare off almost anybody            The offline writerssincerely want to see me fail They want to drive a wedge between my partnersand me They write with glee about my poor year last yearI was up  percentvs much higher SP results What can I say For  years I trounce theaverages and I blow it one year But I can tell you this They dont take yourprevious years gains away and that is where my credibility comes from Iwasnt the only hedge fund manager who did poorly last year I was just theonly one who was out front about it constantly writing about how I blew theOctober bottom in an endless series in TheStreetcom            The offline journalists want me to stop writing andtrading OK lets say I stop trading Would I be as good at writing about themarket as I am now No way I would just be another journalist scrounging infoTo these folks the fact that I was editor in chief of my college paper morethan two decades ago might be considered a plus but the fact that I amactually doing this stuff is a big minus Especially because in the thirdquarter of  I lost money Holy cow            OK then how about if Istop writing My wife and kids would like it My legions of enemies would loveit because it would leave them the playing field to themselves Ah but thereis a problem I dont write for the money and I dont write for the notorietyso giving them up wouldnt hurt So why not            Because I believe that the public needs to know more aboutits own money Because until recently with online trading the whole industryI work in was predicated on the ignorance of the client The industry wantspeople to be kept in the dark so it can charge more for its services Thejournalists who would stop me are complicit with that ignorance and are willingtools of those that would like the reader to have to rely on those who chargehigh commissions or high fees to unknowing worried consumers of finance Iwant to use my successful background as an insider to change that In otherwords I write because I think it is right            Unless the established business journalistcommunity wants to repeal my First Amendment rights they are stuck with me Iam not going away on my own accord Ultimately what I say in my defense iscompletely meaningless If my comments or reports from the trenches areworthless nobody will read them and I will disappear from the writingfirmament            So then whats behindall the brouhaha about my writings See Alan Abelsons column in the current Barrons  I believeit is because of their popularity that I draw such heat and it is the fear ofthe marketplace that drives my journalist opponents to such distorted attacksagainst me They could care less about my ethics                           Conflict alert Theeditor of Slate is an investor in Cramers fund The amount is small forCramer but large for the editor of Slate  TheStreetcom competes tosome extent with Slate s sister MSN site MoneyCentral and even to alesser extent with Slate itself Etc Etc Etc
