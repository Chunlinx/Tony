                                 I Was a TeenAger for the New York Times            There is a gruesome StephenKing story called Survivor Type in which a heroinaddicted surgeon maroonedon a desert island successively amputates each of his limbs in order tosurvive Horrid last line tastes like ladyfingers  This story alwaysreminds me of my Yale classmate Joyce Maynard Ever since she turned  Joycehas been selling off tiny portions of her life and successfully enough to makemany of us envious Her first coup was perhaps her greatest the  NewYork Times Magazine cover story that set a

with herself Enthralled by celebrity culture enthronedby the New York Times  for the past quartercentury she has worked as areporter on my lifes beat From The Embarrassment of Virginity Mademoiselle   to Changing My Breast Size  Again Self   she has hacked her way through three decades wrapped in adelusion torn from the Oliver Sacks casebook The Woman Who Mistook Herself forSomeone Interesting The Millennium and Me Im sure the rough draft issitting in Joyces laptop            Joyce recently announced that she will be looking backagain this time at her ninemonth love affair with reclusive New Hampshirewriter JD Salinger Her announcement prompted by the untimely leak of herbook proposal came as a surprise The Salinger story was always Joycesliterary high ground a museum piece of integrity not included in the ongoingfire sale of her life experiences It was a story she had promised repeatedlynot to tell I will always respect his privacy she told an interviewer in I made that promise a long time ago When a Salinger biographerapproached her earlier this year she hung up on him            TheSalinger story resembles the ladyfingers in the Stephen King tale It was thelast item on the shelf Everything else has already been shipped out The lateteens went to Looking Back which was expanded into a book She told thestory of the halcyon years of her marriage in two childrens books and in asyndicated newspaper column Her divorce which was not amicable proved to beedgy fodder for copy Several newspapers canceled her column which latermorphed into a subscribersonly newsletter called Domestic               Affairs  Its a publication unlike any other Ive seen says  JoyceMaynard full of very honest writing by me and the men and women whosubscribe who send me extraordinarily moving letters about their ownlives            After her marriage folded Joyce startedmerchandising ghoulish oddball dating stories some of them prompted by thispersonal ad she placed in Boston magazine The truth is Im gorgeousslender talented and passionate My academic credentials and creativeachievements are impeccable Theres some fiction here Joyce dropped out ofYale before collecting her impeccable academic credentials But also sometruth Joyce was an extraordinarily attractive woman Before the breastimplants that is                           Now were talking Stephen King In a desperate commingling ofselfabasement and selfinterest rivaled only by Kathryn Harrisons memoir ofFrenchlicking her father Joyce sold the story of her  breastaugmentationsurgery to Self magazine Well OK The problem was the new boobs weretoo big My breasts were a size  D cup Joyce wrote They stood out likea pair of headlights So what does a girl journalist do Whip out thenotebook Declaring herself to be a researcher investigating the world ofbigbreasted women Joyce belched forth a word screed in Selfthis summer reporting on the implants removal  Someone floated thenotion that postop Joyce might pose topless for the photo spread Instead sheis seen grasping the silicone sacs in two separate fullpage photos onecaptioned The nostalgic author holds on to her old implants            Oddly none of these adventures crops up in the recentadvertising campaign for Scholastic magazine which features Joyce as aposter girl for youth literacy Nor are they to be found on her astonishingCallingAllLonelyhearts Web site wwwjoycemaynardcom where one can buypast books a package of the famous divorce columns and of course subscribeto the Domestic                Affairs newsletter Lately Joyce has beenposting tales of her recent move to the Bay Area and commenting upon the datinghabits of the few other Type A personalities in laidback Marin County            It was onthe Web site that Joyce first informed her fans that she would tell a storyIve never told beforeabout Salinger A cynic might suggest that byheretofore honoring the yearold Salingers privacy Joyce has shrewdlyprotected her investment The literary marketplace has assigned a huge premiumto truelife tales of Salinger and Thomas Pynchon two great American writerswho quit the publicity mainstream decades ago A friend who has seen her bookproposal reports that it is classic Joyce gossipy unprudish andselfindulgent with very little information about Salingers literarypursuits But we do learn that he is into homeopathy Small matter that oneof Salingers lawyers has branded Joyces project unconscionable The wheelsof commercesorry literatureare aturning            With Joycean aplomb my former classmate islooking to score a twofer Not only will her book generate interest among littypes but she is also aiming for the vast selfregarding victim audienceThats rightJoyce now sees herself as a victim of Salingers romanticintrigue Sparring with a critic at her Web site Joyce styled herself a womansought out at  by a man  years her senior who promised to love her foreverand asked her to forswear all else to come and live with him blah blah blahThis represents a turnaround from previous characterizations of the Salingerinterlude After I left Salinger it seemed like Id been in Lost Horizon Joyce told the Boston                Globe in  There was no place onearth for me to go            But contradictions abound inJoyces latest outing A few weeks ago she informed the New York Timesthat she decided to tell the Salinger story now because her daughter recentlyturned  That was Joyces age when JD summoned her to his hilltop aerie inCornish NH Yet when I sought her out for comment shortly before sheconcocted her sob story for the Times  Joyce told me she whipped up theSalinger submission to fulfill a contractual obligation to St Martins Andshe complained about the size of the advance            Forced by a cruel publishinghouse to give up her last cherished family jewel at a firesale price Doesntthat just say everything about the times we live in I think theres a piecethere Joyce
