                                 Chief Justice William Rehnquist            Washington enjoys nothing somuch as a cat fight between friends and last weeks spat between Supreme CourtChief Justice William Rehnquist and the Republican Senate was a doozy In hisannual report on the judiciaryusually a highly unmemorable documentthechief justice criticized the Senate for stonewalling President Clintonsjudicial nominees Noting that  percent of federal judgeships are vacant andcaseloads are rising Rehnquist warned that the Senate should act within areasonable time to confirm or reject nominees Some current nominees havebeen waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or afinal floor vote By Rehnquist standards those were fighting words            SenateJudiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch tried to shift the blame to PresidentClinton for nominating liberal activists but he was too late The spin hadbeen spun Editorial pages and pundits agreed If a conservativeideologue like Rehnquist says the Senate is crippling the federal courtsthen Something Must Be Done            The reaction to Rehnquists comments highlights a commonmisunderstanding about the chief justice Rehnquist is popularly viewed as aconservative soldier first and last a partisan in the service of theRepublican revolution But what really defines Rehnquist in his role as chiefjustice is not conservatismthough hes certainly very conservativeitsTaylorism Like Frederick Winslow Taylor the apostle of scientificmanagement Rehnquist champions rationality and efficiency above all            Once upona time Rehnquist was a real bomb thrower The chief justice is aRepublican to his bones Raised in a Republican home in an allRepublicanWisconsin town Rehnquist eventually settled in Republican Arizona where heallied early and avidly with Barry Goldwater In  after  years inprivate practice Rehnquist came to Washington to serve Nixon as an assistantattorney general Two years later Nixon appointed him associate justice            From an early age Rehnquist believedpassionately in states rights This principle has haunted him Click to readwhy He was appalled by the way federal courts were intervening in state andlocal governance coddling criminals and expanding individual rights He wasan early convert to judicial restraint concluding that federal courts shouldbutt out and let elected governments do their job Rehnquist was the Burgercourts outlier writing lonely sclerotic dissents and preaching aconservative legal philosophy long before it became popular Rehnquist is asupreme rationalist and even his critics admired the analytical force of hisdissents            TheSupreme Court slowly began to catch up to Rehnquist and in  Reaganelevated him to chief justice But after  years its still hard tocharacterize the Rehnquist court There isnt a consistent conservativemajority and philosophically the court is a muddlea pudding without atheme says Yale law Professor Akhil Reed Amar quoting the old saw Its moreconservative than its predecessors especially on race and crime but most ofits major decisions on abortion gay rights Internet free speech have beenmoderate or liberal Instead what seems to define the Rehnquist court isRehnquists style His success on the court is a success of process Rehnquisthas made the Supreme Court do less and do it more rationally He has not grownin office He has shrunk in it            One of Rehnquists proudest achievements as chief justicehas been to pare the courts docket The Burger court heard oral arguments in or more cases every term Rehnquist and his colleagues hear half as manycases The result wonderfully satisfying to Rehnquist is less judicialmeddling His great contribution as chief justice is that the role of theSupreme Court today is smaller than it was  years ago says a formerRehnquist clerk Rehnquist has pushed to minimize federal jurisprudence atevery level He may have requested more judges but only because the courts areclogged and slow He has urged Congress repeatedly to stop federalizing crimesFundamentally Rehnquist doesnt want more federal judges he wants fewerfederal laws            The twoareas of law that matter most to Rehnquist are habeas corpus reform andcriminalprocedure reform He campaigned vigorously and successfully torestrict the number of habeas appeals for death row inmates This has limitedfederal involvement in state cases and more importantly sped up the judicialprocess He has intense anger about convicts who after  years are on theirseventh appeal He thinks that things should not be chewed on endlessly saysEmory University legal scholar David Garrow In criminal procedure Rehnquistsdecisions have weakened the Miranda rights nibbled away at the exclusionaryrule and granted cops more leeway to conduct warrantless searches Theseprocedural reforms remove the technicalities that Rehnquist believes clutterand pollute the legal system            Rehnquists decisions too are becomingincreasingly streamlined Associate Justice Rehnquist was famed for his wittyexplosive writing Chief Justice Rehnquist leaves the verbal pyrotechnics toAntonin Scalia Today Rehnquists opinions are skeletal Scholars complainthat his reasoning is almost nonexistent Rehnquists pithiness is thepithiness of the victor Two decades ago he wrote extensively because he hadto explain his unfamiliar views to a liberal world Now his views aremainstream law He doesnt need to elaborate on them            Even the courts operationsare evidence of Rehnquists efficiency Under Burger the conferencethemeeting where justices discuss caseswas a notoriously windy affairRehnquists conferences are nononsense He permits little discussionhedoesnt think it changes anyones mindand races through votes He prodsfellow justices to turn in draft decisions promptly and penalizes tardycolleagues by withholding new assignments The justices who disagree withRehnquist politically love him as a colleague Hes fair agreeable andfast            Until two years ago it wasritual among Supreme Courtwatchers to speculate that this term would beRehnquists last He was too old his back hurt too much he had too manyoutside interests  But recently the speculation has subsided There are twoexplanations for why the yearold Rehnquist is staying put One ispolitical Hes enough of a Republican not to quit until Clinton is out ofoffice I favor the second explanation Why would he bother to retire Everyyear he has less work to do Hes made sure of that The efficient justicearrives at the court around  and leaves by what other job in Washington hassuch sweet hours
