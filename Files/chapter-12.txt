                        WHAT TO DO A GLOBAL STRATEGY            REFLECTING ON A GENERATIONAL CHALLENGE            Three years after  Americans are still thinking and talking about how to protect                our nation in this new era The national debate continues Countering terrorism has                become beyond any doubt the top national security priority for the United States                This shift has occurred with the full support of the Congress both major political                parties the media and the American people            The nation has committed enormous resources to national security and to countering                terrorism Between fiscal year  the last budget adopted before  and the                present fiscal year  total federal spending on defense including expenditures                on both Iraq and Afghanistan homeland security and international affairs rose                more than  percent from  billion to about  billion The United States has                not experienced such a rapid surge in national security spending since the Korean                    War                        This pattern has occurred before in American history The United States faces a                sudden crisis and summons a tremendous exertion of national energy Then as that                surge transforms the landscape comes a time for reflection and reevaluation Some                programs and even agencies are discarded others are invented or redesigned Private                firms and engaged citizens redefine their relationships with government working                through the processes of the American republic            Now is the time for that reflection and reevaluation The United States should                consider what to dothe shape and objectives of a strategy Americans should also                consider how to do itorganizing their government in a different way Defining the                Threat In the post world threats are defined more by the fault lines within                societies than by the territorial boundaries between them From terrorism to global                disease or environmental degradation the challenges have become transnational                rather than international That is the defining quality of world politics in the                twentyfirst century            National security used to be considered by studying foreign frontiers weighing                opposing groups of states and measuring industrial might To be dangerous an enemy                had to muster large armies Threats emerged slowly often visibly as weapons were                forged armies conscripted and units trained and moved into place Because large                states were more powerful they also had more to lose They could be deterred            Now threats can emerge quickly An organization like al Qaeda headquartered in a                country on the other side of the earth in a region so poor that electricity or                telephones were scarce could nonetheless scheme to wield weapons of unprecedented                destructive power in the largest cities of the United States In this sense                 has taught us that terrorism against American interests over there should be                regarded just as we regard terrorism against America over here In this same                sense the American homeland is the planet But the enemy is not just terrorism                some generic evil                        This vagueness blurs the strategy The catastrophic threat at this moment in history                is more specific It is the threat posed by Islamist terrorismespecially the al                Qaeda network its affiliates and its ideology                        As we mentioned in chapter  Usama Bin Ladin and other Islamist terrorist leaders                draw on a long tradition of extreme intolerance within one stream of Islam a                minority tradition from at least Ibn Taimiyyah through the founders of Wahhabism                through the Muslim Brotherhood to Sayyid Qutb That stream is motivated by religion                and does not distinguish politics from religion thus distorting both It is further                fed by grievances stressed by Bin Ladin and widely felt throughout the Muslim                worldagainst the US military presence in the Middle East policies perceived as                antiArab and antiMuslim and support of Israel Bin Ladin and Islamist terrorists                mean exactly what they say to them America is the font of all evil the head of                the snake and it must be converted or destroyed            It is not a position with which Americans can bargain or negotiate With it there is                no common groundnot even respect for lifeon which to begin a dialogue It can only                be destroyed or utterly isolated            Because the Muslim world has fallen behind the West politically economically and                militarily for the past three centuries and because few tolerant or secular Muslim                democracies provide alternative models for the future Bin Ladins message finds                receptive ears It has attracted active support from thousands of disaffected young                Muslims and resonates powerfully with a far larger number who do not actively                support his methods The resentment of America and the West is deep even among                leaders of relatively successful Muslim states                        Tolerance the rule of law political and economic openness the extension of greater                opportunities to womenthese cures must come from within Muslim societies                themselves The United States must support such developments But this process is                likely to be measured in decades not years It is a process that will be violently                opposed by Islamist terrorist organizations both inside Muslim countries and in                attacks on the United States and other Western nations The United States finds                itself caught up in a clash within a civilization That clash arises from particular                conditions in the Muslim world conditions that spill over into expatriate Muslim                communities in nonMuslim countries Our enemy is twofold al Qaeda a stateless                network of terrorists that struck us on  and a radical ideological movement in                the Islamic world inspired in part by al Qaeda which has spawned terrorist groups                and violence across the globe The first enemy is weakened but continues to pose a                grave threat The second enemy is gathering and will menace Americans and American                interests long after Usama Bin Ladin and his cohorts are killed or captured Thus                our strategy must match our means to two ends dismantling the al Qaeda network and                prevailing in the longer term over the ideology that gives rise to Islamist                terrorism            Islam is not the enemy It is not synonymous with terror Nor does Islam teach                terror America and its friends oppose a perversion of Islam not the great world                faith itself Lives guided by religious faith including literal beliefs in holy                scriptures are common to every religion and represent no threat to us Other                religions have experienced violent internal struggles With so many diverse                adherents every major religion will spawn violent zealots Yet understanding and                tolerance among people of different faiths can and must prevail The present                transnational danger is Islamist terrorism What is needed is a broad                politicalmilitary strategy that rests on a firm tripod of policies to                            attack terrorists and their organizations                prevent the continued growth of Islamist terrorism and                protect against and prepare for terrorist attacks                        More Than a War on Terrorism            Terrorism is a tactic used by individuals and organizations to kill and destroy Our                efforts should be directed at those individuals and organizations Calling this                struggle a war accurately describes the use of American and allied armed forces to                find and destroy terrorist groups and their allies in the field notably in                Afghanistan The language of war also evokes the mobilization for a national effort                Yet the strategy should be balanced            The first phase of our post efforts rightly included military action to topple                the Taliban and pursue al Qaeda This work continues But longterm success demands                the use of all elements of national power diplomacy intelligence covert action                law enforcement economic policy foreign aid public diplomacy and homeland                defense If we favor one tool while neglecting others we leave ourselves vulnerable                and weaken our national effort            Certainly the strategy should include offensive operations to counter terrorism                Terrorists should no longer find safe haven where their organizations can grow and                flourish Americas strategy should be a coalition strategy that includes Muslim                nations as partners in its development and implementation Our effort should be                accompanied by a preventive strategy that is as much or more political as it is                military The strategy must focus clearly on the Arab and Muslim world in all its                variety            Our strategy should also include defenses America can be attacked in many ways and                has many vulnerabilities No defenses are perfect But risks must be calculated                hard choices must be made about allocating resources Responsibilities for Americas                defense should be clearly defined Planning does make a difference identifying                where a little money might have a large effect Defenses also complicate the plans                of attackers increasing their risks of discovery and failure Finally the nation                must prepare to deal with attacks that are not stopped            Measuring Success            What should Americans expect from their government in the struggle against Islamist                terrorism The goals seem unlimited Defeat terrorism anywhere in the world But                Americans have also been told to expect the worst An attack is probably coming it                may be terrible            With such benchmarks the justifications for action and spending seem limitless                Goals are good Yet effective public policies also need concrete objectives                Agencies need to be able to measure success            These measurements do not need to be quantitative government cannot measure success                in the ways that private firms can But the targets should be specific enough so                that reasonable observersin the White House the Congress the media or the                general publiccan judge whether or not the objectives have been attained            Vague goals match an amorphous picture of the enemy Al Qaeda and its affiliates are                popularly described as being all over the world adaptable resilient needing                little higherlevel organization and capable of anything The American people are                thus given the picture of an omnipotent unslayable hydra of destruction This image                lowers expectations for government effectiveness It should not lower them too far                Our report shows a determined and capable group of plotters Yet the group was                fragile dependent on a few key personalities and occasionally left vulnerable by                the marginal unstable people often attracted to such causes The enemy made                mistakeslike Khalid al Mihdhars unauthorized departure from the United States that                required him to enter the country again in July  or the selection of Zacarias                Moussaoui as a participant and Ramzi Binalshibhs transfer of money to him The US                government was not able to capitalize on those mistakes in time to prevent  We                do not believe it is possible to defeat all terrorist attacks against Americans                every time and everywhere A president should tell the American people                            No president can promise that a catastrophic attack like that of  will not                    happen again History has shown that even the most vigilant and expert agencies                    cannot always prevent determined suicidal attackers from reaching a target                But the American people are entitled to expect their government to do its very                    best They should expect that officials will have realistic objectives clear                    guidance and effective organization They are entitled to see some standards                    for performance so they can judge with the help of their elected                    representatives whether the objectives are being met                        ATTACK TERRORISTS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS            The USgovernment joined by other governments around the world is working through                intelligence law enforcement military financial and diplomatic channels to                identify disrupt capture or kill individual terrorists This effort was going on                before  and it continues on a vastly enlarged scale But to catch terrorists a                US or foreign agency needs to be able to find and reach them            No Sanctuaries            The  attack was a complex international operation the product of years of                planning Bombings like those in Bali in  or Madrid in  while able to take                hundreds of lives can be mounted locally Their requirements are far more modest in                size and complexity They are more difficult to thwart But the US government must                build the capacities to prevent a scale plot from succeeding and those                capabilities will help greatly to cope with lesser but still devastating attacks            A complex international terrorist operation aimed at launching a catastrophic attack                cannot be mounted by just anyone in any place Such operations appear to require                            time space and ability to perform competent planning and staff work                a command structure able to make necessary decisions and possessing the                    authority and contacts to assemble needed people money and materials                opportunity and space to recruit train and select operatives with the needed                    skills and dedication providing the time and structure required to socialize                    them into the terrorist cause judge their trustworthiness and hone their                    skills                a logistics network able to securely manage the travel of operatives move                    money and transport resources like explosives where they need to go                access in the case of certain weapons to the special materials needed for a                    nuclear chemical radiological or biological attack                reliable communications between coordinators and operatives and                opportunity to test the workability of the plan                        Many details in chapters   and  illustrate the direct and indirect value of the                Afghan sanctuary to al Qaeda in preparing the  attack and other operations The                organization cemented personal ties among veteran jihadists working together there                for years It had the operational space to gather and sift recruits indoctrinating                them in isolated desert camps It built up logistical networks running through                Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates            Al Qaeda also exploited relatively lax internal security environments in Western                countries especially Germany It considered the environment in the United States so                hospitable that the  operatives used America as their staging area for further                training and exercisestraveling into out of and around the country and                complacently using their real names with little fear of capture To find sanctuary                terrorist organizations have fled to some of the least governed most lawless places                in the world The intelligence community has prepared a world map that highlights                possible terrorist havens using no secret intelligencejust indicating areas that                combine rugged terrain weak governance room to hide or receive supplies and low                population density with a town or city near enough to allow necessary interaction                with the outside world Large areas scattered around the world meet these                    criteria                        In talking with American and foreign government officials and military officers on                the front lines fighting terrorists today we asked them If you were a terrorist                leader today where would you locate your base Some of the same places come up                again and again on their lists                            western Pakistan and the PakistanAfghanistan border region                southern or western Afghanistan                the Arabian Peninsula especially Saudi Arabia and Yemen and the nearby Horn                    of Africa including Somalia and extending southwest into Kenya                Southeast Asia from Thailand to the southern Philippines to Indonesia                West Africa including Nigeria and Mali                European cities with expatriate Muslim communities especially cities in                    central and eastern Europe where security forces and border controls are less                    effective                        In the twentieth century strategists focused on the worlds great industrial                heartlands In the twentyfirst the focus is in the opposite direction toward                remote regions and failing states The United States has had to find ways to extend                its reach straining the limits of its influence            Every policy decision we make needs to be seen through this lens If for example                Iraq becomes a failed state it will go to the top of the list of places that are                breeding grounds for attacks against Americans at home Similarly if we are paying                insufficient attention to Afghanistan the rule of the Taliban or warlords and                narcotraffickers may reemerge and its countryside could once again offer refuge to                al Qaeda or its successor                            Recommendation The US government must identify and prioritize                    actual or potential terrorist sanctuaries For each it should have a realistic                    strategy to keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run using all elements                    of national power We should reach out listen to and work with other countries                    that can help                        We offer three illustrations that are particularly applicable today in                 Pakistan Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia            Pakistan            Pakistans endemic poverty widespread corruption and often ineffective government                create opportunities for Islamist recruitment Poor education is a particular                concern Millions of families especially those with little money send their                children to religious schools or madrassahs Many of these schools are the only                opportunity available for an education but some have been used as incubators for                violent extremism According to Karachis police commander there are  madrassahs                teaching more than  youngsters in his city alone                        It is hard to overstate the importance of Pakistan in the struggle against Islamist                terrorism Within Pakistans borders are  million Muslims scores of al Qaeda                terrorists many Taliban fighters andperhapsUsama Bin Ladin Pakistan possesses                nuclear weapons and has come frighteningly close to war with nucleararmed India                over the disputed territory of Kashmir A political battle among antiAmerican                Islamic fundamentalists the Pakistani military and more moderate mainstream                political forces has already spilled over into violence and there have been                repeated recent attempts to kill Pakistans president Pervez Musharraf            In recent years the United States has had three basic problems in its relationship                with Pakistan                            On terrorism Pakistan helped nurture theTaliban The Pakistani army and                    intelligence services especially below the top ranks have long been ambivalent                    about confronting Islamist extremists Many in the government have sympathized                    with or provided support to the extremists Musharraf agreed that Bin Ladin was                    bad But before  preserving good relations with the Taliban took                    precedence                On proliferation Musharraf has repeatedly said that Pakistan does not barter                    with its nuclear technology But proliferation concerns have been longstanding                    and very serious Most recently the Pakistani government has claimed not to                    have known that one of its nuclear weapons developers a national figure was                    leading the most dangerous nuclear smuggling ring ever disclosed                Finally Pakistan has made little progress toward the return of democratic                    rule at the national level although that turbulent process does continue to                    function at the provincial level and the Pakistani press remains relatively                    free                        Immediately after  confronted by the United States with a stark choice Pakistan                made a strategic decision Its government stood aside and allowed the USled                coalition to destroy theTaliban regime In other ways Pakistan actively assisted                its authorities arrested more than  al Qaeda operatives and Taliban members and                Pakistani forces played a leading part in tracking down KSM Abu Zubaydah and other                key al Qaeda figures                        In the following two years the Pakistani government tried to walk the fence helping                against al Qaeda while seeking to avoid a larger confrontation withTaliban remnants                and other Islamic extremists When al Qaeda and its Pakistani allies repeatedly                tried to assassinate Musharraf almost succeeding the battle came home            The countrys vast unpoliced regions make Pakistan attractive to extremists seeking                refuge and recruits and also provide a base for operations against coalition forces                in Afghanistan Almost all the  attackers traveled the northsouth nexus of                KandaharQuettaKarachi The Baluchistan region of Pakistan KSMs ethnic home and                the sprawling city of Karachi remain centers of Islamist extremism where the US                and Pakistani security and intelligence presence has been weak The US consulate                in Karachi is a makeshift fortress reflecting the gravity of the surrounding                    threat                        During the winter of  Musharraf made another strategic decision He ordered                the Pakistani army into the frontier provinces of northwest Pakistan along the                Afghan border where Bin Ladin and Ayman al Zawahiri have reportedly taken refuge                The army is confronting groups of al Qaeda fighters and their local allies in very                difficult terrain On the other side of the frontier US forces in Afghanistan                have found it challenging to organize effective joint operations given Pakistans                limited capabilities and reluctance to permit US military operations on its soil                Yet in  it is clear that the Pakistani government is trying harder than ever                before in the battle against Islamist terrorists                        Acknowledging these problems and Musharraf s own part in the story we believe that                Musharraf s government represents the best hope for stability in Pakistan and                Afghanistan                            In an extraordinary public essay asking how Muslims can drag ourselves out of                    the pit we find ourselves in to raise ourselves up Musharraf has called for a                    strategy of enlightened moderation The Muslim world he said should shun                    militancy and extremism the Westand the United States in particularshould                    seek to resolve disputes with justice and help better the Muslim world                                Having come close to war in  and  Pakistan and India have recently                    made significant progress in peacefully discussing their longstanding                    differences The United States has been and should remain a key supporter of                    that process                The constant refrain of Pakistanis is that the United States long treated them                    as allies of convenience As the United States makes fresh commitments now it                    should make promises it is prepared to keep for years to come                                        Recommendation If Musharraf stands for enlightened moderation in a                    fight for his life and for the life of his country the United States should be                    willing to make hard choices too and make the difficult longterm commitment to                    the future of Pakistan Sustaining the current scale of aid to Pakistan the                    United States should support Pakistans government in its struggle against                    extremists with a comprehensive effort that extends from military aid to support                    for better education so long as Pakistans leaders remain willing to make                    difficult choices of their own                        Afghanistan            Afghanistan was the incubator for al Qaeda and for the  attacks In the fall of                 the USled international coalition and its Afghan allies toppled the Taliban                and ended the regimes protection of al Qaeda Notable progress has been made                International cooperation has been strong with a clear UN mandate and a NATOled                peacekeeping force the International Security Assistance Force or ISAF More than                 American soldiers are deployed today in Afghanistan joined by soldiers from                NATO allies and Muslim states A central government has been established in Kabul                with a democratic constitution new currency and a new army Most Afghans enjoy                greater freedom women and girls are emerging from subjugation and  million                children have returned to school For the first time in many years Afghans have                reason to hope                        But grave challenges remain Taliban and al Qaeda fighters have regrouped in the                south and southeast Warlords control much of the country beyond Kabul and the land                is awash in weapons Economic development remains a distant hope The narcotics                tradelong a massive sector of the Afghan economy is again booming Even the most                hardened aid workers refuse to operate in many regions and some warn that                Afghanistan is near the brink of chaos                        Battered Afghanistan has a chance Elections are being prepared It is revealing that                in June  Taliban fighters resorted to slaughtering  Afghans on a bus                apparently for no reason other than their boldness in carrying an unprecedented                Afghan weapon a voter registration card            Afghanistans president Hamid Karzai is brave and committed He is trying to build                genuinely national institutions that can overcome the tradition of allocating powers                among ethnic communities Yet even if his efforts are successful and elections bring                a democratic government to Afghanistan the United States faces some difficult                choices            After paying relatively little attention to rebuilding Afghanistan during the                military campaign US policies changed noticeably during  Greater                consideration of the political dimension and congressional support for a substantial                package of assistance signaled a longerterm commitment to Afghanistans future One                Afghan regional official plaintively told us the country finally has a good                government He begged the United States to keep its promise and not abandon                Afghanistan again as it had in the s Another Afghan leader noted that if the                United States leaves we will lose all that we have gained                        Most difficult is to define the security mission in Afghanistan There is continuing                political controversy about whether military operations in Iraq have had any effect                on the scale of Americas commitment to the future of Afghanistan The United States                has largely stayed out of the central governments struggles with dissident warlords                and it has largely avoided confronting the related problem of narcotrafficking                                        Recommendation The President and the Congress deserve praise for                    their efforts in Afghanistan so far Now the United States and the international                    community should make a longterm commitment to a secure and stable Afghanistan                    in order to give the government a reasonable opportunity to improve the life of                    the Afghan people Afghanistan must not again become a sanctuary for                    international crime and terrorism The United States and the international                    community should help the Afghan government extend its authority over the                    country with a strategy and nationbynation commitments to achieve their                    objectives                                        This is an ambitious recommendation It would mean a redoubled effort to                    secure the country disarm militias and curtail the age of warlord rule But                    the United States and NATO have already committed themselves to the future of                    this regionwisely as the  story showsand failed halfmeasures could be                    worse than useless                NATO in particular has made Afghanistan a test of the Alliances ability to                    adapt to current security challenges of the future NATO must pass this test                    Currently the United States and the international community envision enough                    support so that the central government can build a truly national army and                    extend essential infrastructure and minimum public services to major towns and                    regions The effort relies in part on foreign civilmilitary teams arranged                    under various national flags The institutional commitments of NATO and the                    United Nations to these enterprises are weak NATO member states are not                    following through some of the other states around the world that have pledged                    assistance to Afghanistan are not fulfilling their pledges                The US presence in Afghanistan is overwhelmingly oriented toward military                    and security work The State Department presence is woefully understaffed and                    the military mission is narrowly focused on al Qaeda andTaliban remnants in the                    south and southeast The USgovernment can do its part if the international                    community decides on a joint effort to restore the rule of law and contain                    rampant crime and narcotics trafficking in this crossroads of Central Asia                                        We heard again and again that the money for assistance is allocated so rigidly that                on the ground one US agency often cannot improvise or pitch in to help another                agency even in small ways when a few thousand dollars could make a great                difference            The US government should allocate money so that lowerlevel officials have more                flexibility to get the job done across agency lines adjusting to the circumstances                they find in the field This should include discretionary funds for expenditures by                military units that often encounter opportunities to help the local population            Saudi Arabia            Saudi Arabia has been a problematic ally in combating Islamic extremism At the level                of high policy Saudi Arabias leaders cooperated with American diplomatic                initiatives aimed at theTaliban or Pakistan before  At the same time Saudi                Arabias society was a place where al Qaeda raised money directly from individuals                and through charities It was the society that produced  of the  hijackers            The Kingdom is one of the worlds most religiously conservative societies and its                identity is closely bound to its religious links especially its position as the                guardian of Islams two holiest sites Charitable giving or zakat is one of the                five pillars of Islam It is broader and more pervasive than Western ideas of                charity functioning also as a form of income tax educational assistance foreign                aid and a source of political influence The Western notion of the separation of                civic and religious duty does not exist in Islamic cultures Funding charitable                works is an integral function of the governments in the Islamic world It is so                ingrained in Islamic culture that in Saudi Arabia for example a department within                the Saudi Ministry of Finance and National Economy collects zakat directly much as                the US Internal Revenue Service collects payroll withholding tax Closely tied to                zakat is the dedication of the government to propagating the Islamic faith                particularly the Wahhabi sect that flourishes in Saudi Arabia            Traditionally throughout the Muslim world there is no formal oversight mechanism                for donations As Saudi wealth increased the amounts contributed by individuals and                the state grew dramatically Substantial sums went to finance Islamic charities of                every kind            While Saudi domestic charities are regulated by the Ministry of Labor and Social                Welfare charities and international relief agencies such as the World Assembly of                Muslim Youth WAMY are currently regulated by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs                This ministry uses zakat and government funds to spread Wahhabi beliefs throughout                the world including in mosques and schools Often these schools provide the only                education available even in affluent countries Saudifunded Wahhabi schools are                often the only Islamic schools Some Wahhabifunded organizations have been                exploited by extremists to further their goal of violent jihad against nonMuslims                One such organization has been the al Haramain Islamic Foundation the assets of                some branch offices have been frozen by the US and Saudi governments            Until  few Saudis would have considered government oversight of charitable                donations necessary many would have perceived it as interference in the exercise of                their faith At the same time the governments ability to finance most state                expenditures with energy revenues has delayed the need for a modern income tax                system As a result there have been strong religious cultural and administrative                barriers to monitoring charitable spending That appears to be changing however                now that the goal of violent jihad also extends to overthrowing Sunni governments                such as the House of Saud that are not living up to the ideals of the Islamist                    extremists                        The leaders of the United States and the rulers of Saudi Arabia have long had                friendly relations rooted in fundamentally common interests against the Soviet                Union during the Cold War in American hopes that Saudi oil supplies would stabilize                the supply and price of oil in world markets and in Saudi hopes that America could                help protect the Kingdom against foreign threats In  the Kingdom hosted US                armed forces before the first USled war WHAT TO DO A GLOBAL STRATEGY  against                Iraq American soldiers and airmen have given their lives to help protect Saudi                Arabia The Saudi government has difficulty acknowledging this American military                bases remained there until  as part of an international commitment to contain                Iraq            For many years leaders on both sides preferred to keep their ties quiet and behind                the scenes As a result neither the US nor the Saudi people appreciated all the                dimensions of the bilateral relationship including the Saudi role in US                strategies to promote the Middle East peace process In each country political                figures find it difficult to publicly defend good relations with the other Today                mutual recriminations flow Many Americans see Saudi Arabia as an enemy not as an                embattled ally They perceive an autocratic government that oppresses women                dominated by a wealthy and indolent elite Saudi contacts with American politicians                are frequently invoked as accusations in partisan political arguments Americans are                often appalled by the intolerance antiSemitism and antiAmerican arguments taught                in schools and preached in mosques Saudis are angry too Many educated Saudis who                were sympathetic to America now perceive the United States as an unfriendly state                One Saudi reformer noted to us that the demonization of Saudi Arabia in the US                media gives ammunition to radicals who accuse reformers of being US lackeys Tens                of thousands of Saudis who once regularly traveled to and often had homes in the                United States now go elsewhere                        Among Saudis the United States is seen as aligned with Israel in its conflict with                the Palestinians with whom Saudis ardently sympathize Although Saudi Arabias                cooperation against terrorism improved to some extent after the September                 attacks significant problems remained Many in the Kingdom initially reacted with                disbelief and denial In the following months as the truth became clear some                leading Saudis quietly acknowledged the problem but still did not see their own                regime as threatened and thus often did not respond promptly to US requests for                help Though Saddam Hussein was widely detested many Saudis are sympathetic to the                antiUS insurgents in Iraq although majorities also condemn jihadist attacks in                the Kingdom                        As in Pakistan Yemen and other countries attitudes changed when the terrorism came                home Cooperation had already become significant but after the bombings in Riyadh                on May   it improved much more The Kingdom openly discussed the problem of                radicalism criticized the terrorists as religiously deviant reduced official                support for religious activity overseas closed suspect charitable foundations and                publicized arrestsvery public moves for a government that has preferred to keep                internal problems quiet The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is now locked in mortal combat                with al Qaeda Saudi police are regularly being killed in shootouts with terrorists                In June  the Saudi ambassador to the United States called publiclyin the Saudi                pressfor his government to wage a jihad of its own against the terrorists We must                all as a state and as a people recognize the truth about these criminals he                declared if we do not declare a general mobilizationwe will lose this war on                    terrorism                        Saudi Arabia is a troubled country Although regarded as very wealthy in fact per                capita income has dropped from  at its height to the present level of about                 Social and religious traditions complicate adjustment to modern economic                activity and limit employment opportunities for young Saudis Women find their                education and employment sharply limited President Clinton offered us a perceptive                analysis of Saudi Arabia contending that fundamentally friendly rulers have been                constrained by their desire to preserve the status quo He like others made the                case for pragmatic reform instead He hopes the rulers will envision what they want                their Kingdom to become in  or  years and start a process in which their                friends can help them change                        There are signs that Saudi Arabias royal family is trying to build a consensus for                political reform though uncertain about how fast and how far to go Crown Prince                Abdullah wants the Kingdom to join the World Trade Organization to accelerate                economic liberalization He has embraced the Arab Human Development Report which                was highly critical of the Arab worlds political economic and social failings and                called for greater economic and political reform                        Cooperation with Saudi Arabia against Islamist terrorism is very much in the US                interest Such cooperation can exist for a time largely in secret as it does now                but it cannot grow and thrive there Nor on either side can friendship be                unconditional                            Recommendation The problems in the USSaudi relationship must be                    confronted openly The United States and Saudi Arabia must determine if they                    can build a relationship that political leaders on both sides are prepared to                    publicly defenda relationship about more than oil It should include a shared                    commitment to political and economic reform as Saudis make common cause with                    the outside world It should include a shared interest in greater tolerance and                    cultural respect translating into a commitment to fight the violent extremists                    who foment hatred                        PREVENT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF ISLAMIST TERRORISM            In October  reflecting on progress after two years of waging the global war on                terrorism Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld asked his advisersAre we capturing                killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and                the radical clerics are recruiting training and deploying against us Does the US                need to fashion a broad integrated plan to stop the next generation of terrorists                The US is putting relatively little effort into a longrange plan but we are                putting a great deal of effort into trying to stop terrorists The costbenefit                ratio is against us Our cost is billions against the terrorists costs of                    millions                        These are the right questions Our answer is that we need shortterm action on a                longrange strategy one that invigorates our foreign policy with the attention that                the President and Congress have given to the military and intelligence parts of the                conflict against Islamist terrorism            Engage the Struggle of Ideas            The United States is heavily engaged in the Muslim world and will be for many years                to come This American engagement is resented Polls in  found that among                Americas friends like Egyptthe recipient of more US aid for the past  years                than any other Muslim countryonly  percent of the population had a favorable                opinion of the United States In Saudi Arabia the number was  percent And                twothirds of those surveyed in  in countries from Indonesia to Turkey a NATO                ally were very or somewhat fearful that the United States may attack them                        Support for the United States has plummeted Polls taken in Islamic countries after                 suggested that many or most people thought the United States was doing the                right thing in its fight against terrorism few people saw popular support for al                Qaeda half of those surveyed said that ordinary people had a favorable view of the                United States By  polls showed that the bottom has fallen out of support for                America in most of the Muslim world Negative views of the US among Muslims which                had been largely limited to countries in the Middle East have spread    Since                last summer favorable ratings for the US have fallen from  to  in Indonesia                and from  to  among Muslims in Nigeria                        Many of these views are at best uninformed about the United States and at worst                informed by cartoonish stereotypes the coarse expression of a fashionable                Occidentalism among intellectuals who caricature US values and policies Local                newspapers and the few influential satellite broadcasterslike al Jazeeraoften                reinforce the jihadist theme that portrays the United States as antiMuslim                        The small percentage of Muslims who are fully committed to Usama Bin Ladins version                of Islam are impervious to persuasion It is among the large majority of Arabs and                Muslims that we must encourage reform freedom democracy and opportunity even                though our own promotion of these messages is limited in its effectiveness simply                because we are its carriers Muslims themselves will have to reflect upon such basic                issues as the concept of jihad the position of women and the place of nonMuslim                minorities The United States can promote moderation but cannot ensure its                ascendancy Only Muslims can do this            The setting is difficult The combined gross domestic product of the  countries in                the Arab League is less than the GDP of Spain Forty percent of adult Arabs are                illiterate twothirds of them women Onethird of the broader Middle East lives on                less than two dollars a day Less than  percent of the population has access to the                Internet The majority of older Arab youths have expressed a desire to emigrate to                other countries particularly those in Europe                        In short the United States has to help defeat an ideology not just a group of                people and we must do so under difficult circumstances How can the United States                and its friends help moderate Muslims combat the extremist ideas                            Recommendation The US government must define what the message is                    what it stands for We should offer an example of moral leadership in the world                    committed to treat people humanely abide by the rule of law and be generous                    and caring to our neighbors America and Muslim friends can agree on respect for                    human dignity and opportunity To Muslim parents terrorists like Bin Ladin have                    nothing to offer their children but visions of violence and death America and                    its friends have a crucial advantagewe can offer these parents a vision that                    might give their children a better future If we heed the views of thoughtful                    leaders in the Arab and Muslim world a moderate consensus can be found                        That vision of the future should stress life over death individual educational and                economic opportunity This vision includes widespread political participation and                contempt for indiscriminate violence It includes respect for the rule of law                openness in discussing differences and tolerance for opposing points of view                            Recommendation Where Muslim governments even those who are                    friends do not respect these principles the United States must stand for a                    better future One of the lessons of the long Cold War was that shortterm gains                    in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal governments were too often                    outweighed by longterm setbacks for Americas stature and interests                        American foreign policy is part of the message Americas policy choices have                consequences Right or wrong it is simply a fact that American policy regarding the                IsraeliPalestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of                popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world That does not mean US choices                have been wrong It means those choices must be integrated with Americas message of                opportunity to the Arab and Muslim world Neither Israel nor the new Iraq will be                safer if worldwide Islamist terrorism grows stronger            The United States must do more to communicate its message Reflecting on Bin Ladins                success in reaching Muslim audiences Richard Holbrooke wondered  How can a man in                a cave outcommunicate the worlds leading communications society Deputy Secretary                of State Richard Armitage worried to us that Americans have been exporting our                fears and our angernot our vision of opportunity and hope                                        Recommendation Just as we did in the Cold War we need to defend                    our ideals abroad vigorously America does stand up for its values The United                    States defended and still defends Muslims against tyrants and criminals in                    Somalia Bosnia Kosovo Afghanistan and Iraq If the United States does not                    act aggressively to define itself in the Islamic world the extremists will                    gladly do the job for us                                                            Recognizing that Arab and Muslim audiences rely on satellite                        television and radio the government has begun some promising initiatives in                        television and radio broadcasting to the Arab world Iran and Afghanistan                        These efforts are beginning to reach large audiences The Broadcasting Board                        of Governors has asked for much larger resources It should get them                                                    The United States should rebuild the scholarship exchange and                        library programs that reach out to young people and offer them knowledge and                        hope Where such assistance is provided it should be identified as coming                        from the citizens of the United States                                        An Agenda of Opportunity            The United States and its friends can stress educational and economic opportunity                The United Nations has rightly equated literacy as freedom                            The international community is moving toward setting a concrete goalto cut                    the Middle East regions illiteracy rate in half by  targeting women and                    girls and supporting programs for adult literacy                Unglamorous help is needed to support the basics such as textbooks that                    translate more of the worlds knowledge into local languages and libraries to                    house such materials Education about the outside world or other cultures is                    weak                More vocational education is needed too in trades and business skills The                    Middle East can also benefit from some of the programs to bridge the digital                    divide and increase Internet access that have already been developed for other                    regions of the world                        Education that teaches tolerance the dignity and value of each individual and                respect for different beliefs is a key element in any global strategy to eliminate                Islamist terrorism                            Recommendation The US government should offer to join with other                    nations in generously supporting a new International Youth Opportunity Fund                    Funds will be spent directly for building and operating primary and secondary                    schools in those Muslim states that commit to sensibly investing their own money                    in public education                        Economic openness is essential Terrorism is not caused by poverty Indeed many                terrorists come from relatively welloff families Yet when people lose hope when                societies break down when countries fragment the breeding grounds for terrorism                are created Backward economic policies and repressive political regimes slip into                societies that are without hope where ambition and passions have no constructive                outlet            The policies that support economic development and reform also have political                implications Economic and political liberties tend to be linked Commerce                especially international commerce requires ongoing cooperation and compromise the                exchange of ideas across cultures and the peaceful resolution of differences                through negotiation or the rule of law Economic growth expands the middle class a                constituency for further reform Successful economies rely on vibrant private                sectors which have an interest in curbing indiscriminate government power Those                who develop the practice of controlling their own economic destiny soon desire a                voice in their communities and political societies            The US government has announced the goal of working toward a Middle East Free Trade                Area or MEFTA by  The United States has been seeking comprehensive free trade                agreements FTAs with the Middle Eastern nations most firmly on the path to reform                The USIsraeli FTA was enacted in  and Congress implemented an FTA with                Jordan in  Both agreements have expanded trade and investment thereby                supporting domestic economic reform In  new FTAs were signed with Morocco and                Bahrain and are awaiting congressional approval These models are drawing the                interest of their neighbors Muslim countries can become full participants in the                rulesbased global trading system as the United States considers lowering its trade                barriers with the poorest Arab nations                            Recommendation A comprehensive US strategy to counter terrorism                    should include economic policies that encourage development more open                    societies and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families                    and to enhance prospects for their childrens future                        Turning a National Strategy into a Coalition Strategy            Practically every aspect of UScounterterrorism strategy relies on international                cooperation Since  these contacts concerning military law enforcement                intelligence travel and customs and financial matters have expanded so                dramatically and often in an ad hoc way that it is difficult to track these                efforts much less integrate them                            Recommendation The United States should engage other nations in                    developing a comprehensive coalition strategy against Islamist terrorism There                    are several multilateral institutions in which such issues should be addressed                    But the most important policies should be discussed and coordinated in a                    flexible contact group of leading coalition governments This is a good place                    for example to develop joint strategies for targeting terrorist travel or for                    hammering out a common strategy for the places where terrorists may be finding                    sanctuary                        Presently the Muslim and Arab states meet with each other in organizations such as                the Islamic Conference and the Arab League The Western states meet with each other                in organizations such as NATO and the Group of Eight summit of leading industrial                nations A recent G summit initiative to begin a dialogue about reform may be a                start toward finding a place where leading Muslim states can discussand be seen to                discusscritical policy issues with the leading Western powers committed to the                future of the Arab and Muslim world These new international efforts can create                durable habits of visible cooperation as states willing to step up to their                responsibilities join together in constructive efforts to direct assistance and                coordinate action            Coalition warfare also requires coalition policies on what to do with enemy captives                Allegations that the United States abused prisoners in its custody make it harder to                build the diplomatic political and military alliances the government will need                The United States should work with friends to develop mutually agreedon principles                for the detention and humane treatment of captured international terrorists who are                not being held under a particular countrys criminal laws Countries such as                Britain Australia and Muslim friends are committed to fighting terrorists                America should be able to reconcile its views on how to balance humanity and                security with our nations commitment to these same goals The United States and                some of its allies do not accept the application of full Geneva Convention treatment                of prisoners of war to captured terrorists Those Conventions establish a minimum                set of standards for prisoners in internal conflicts Since the international                struggle against Islamist terrorism is not internal those provisions do not                formally apply but they are commonly accepted as basic standards for humane                treatment                            Recommendation The United States should engage its friends to                    develop a common coalition approach toward the detention and humane treatment of                    captured terrorists New principles might draw upon Article  of the Geneva                    Conventions on the law of armed conflict That article was specifically designed                    for those cases in which the usual laws of war did not apply Its minimum                    standards are generally accepted throughout the world as customary international                    law                        Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction            The greatest danger of another catastrophic attack in the United States will                materialize if the worlds most dangerous terrorists acquire the worlds most                dangerous weapons As we note in chapter  al Qaeda has tried to acquire or make                nuclear weapons for at least ten years In chapter  we mentioned officials                worriedly discussing in  reports that Bin Ladins associates thought their                leader was intent on carrying out a Hiroshima These ambitions continue In the                public portion of his February  worldwide threat assessment to Congress                DCITenet noted that Bin Ladin considered the acquisition of weapons of mass                destruction to be a religious obligation He warned that al Qaeda continues to                pursue its strategic goal of obtaining a nuclear capability Tenet added that more                than two dozen other terrorist groups are pursuing CBRN chemical biological                radiological and nuclear materials                        A nuclear bomb can be built with a relatively small amount of nuclear material A                trained nuclear engineer with an amount of highly enriched uranium or plutonium                about the size of a grapefruit or an orange together with commercially available                material could fashion a nuclear device that would fit in a van like the one Ramzi                Yousef parked in the garage of the World Trade Center in  Such a bomb would                level Lower Manhattan                        The coalition strategies we have discussed to combat Islamist terrorism should                therefore be combined with a parallel vital effort to prevent and counter the                proliferation of weapons of mass destruction WMD We recommend several initiatives                in this area            Strengthen Counterproliferation Efforts                        While efforts to shut down Libyas illegal nuclear program have been generally                successful Pakistans illicit trade and the nuclear smuggling networks of Pakistani                scientist AQ Khan have revealed that the spread of nuclear weapons is a problem of                global dimensions Attempts to deal with Irans nuclear program are still underway                Therefore the United States should work with the international community to develop                laws and an international legal regime with universal jurisdiction to enable the                capture interdiction and prosecution of such smugglers by any state in the world                where they do not disclose their activities            Expand the Proliferation Security Initiative                        In May  the Bush administration announced the Proliferation Security Initiative                PSI nations in a willing partnership combining their national capabilities to use                military economic and diplomatic tools to interdict threatening shipments of WMD                and missilerelated technology            The PSI can be more effective if it uses intelligence and planning resources of the                NATO alliance Moreover PSI membership should be open to non NATO countries                Russia and China should be encouraged to participate            Support the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program                        Outside experts are deeply worried about the US governments commitment and                approach to securing the weapons and highly dangerous materials still scattered in                Russia and other countries of the Soviet Union The governments main instrument in                this area the CooperativeThreat Reduction Program usually referred to as                NunnLugar after the senators who sponsored the legislation in  is now in                need of expansion improvement and resources The US government has recently                redoubled its international commitments to support this program and we recommend                that the United States do all it can if Russia and other countries will do their                part The government should weigh the value of this investment against the                catastrophic cost America would face should such weapons find their way to the                terrorists who are so anxious to acquire them                            Recommendation Our report shows that al Qaeda has tried to acquire                    or make weapons of mass destruction for at least ten years There is no doubt                    the United States would be a prime target Preventing the proliferation of these                    weapons warrants a maximum effortby strengthening counterproliferation efforts                    expanding the Proliferation Security Initiative and supporting the Cooperative                    Threat Reduction program                        Targeting Terrorist Money            The general public sees attacks on terrorist finance as a way to starve the                terrorists of money So initially did the US government After  the United                States took aggressive actions to designate terrorist financiers and freeze their                money in the United States and through resolutions of the United Nations These                actions appeared to have little effect and when confronted by legal challenges the                United States and the United Nations were often forced to unfreeze assets            The difficulty understood later was that even if the intelligence community might                link someone to a terrorist group through acquaintances or communications the                task of tracing the money from that individual to the terrorist group or otherwise                showing complicity was far more difficult It was harder still to do so without                disclosing secrets            These early missteps made other countries unwilling to freeze assets or otherwise act                merely on the basis of a US action Multilateral freezing mechanisms now require                waiting periods before being put into effect eliminating the element of surprise                and thus virtually ensuring that little money is actually frozen Worldwide asset                freezes have not been adequately enforced and have been easily circumvented often                within weeks by simple methods But trying to starve the terrorists of money is                like trying to catch one kind of fish by draining the ocean A better strategy has                evolved since those early months as the government learned more about how al Qaeda                raises moves and spends money                            Recommendation Vigorous efforts to track terrorist financing must                    remain front and center in US counterterrorism efforts The government has                    recognized that information about terrorist money helps us to understand their                    networks search them out and disrupt their operations Intelligence and law                    enforcement have targeted the relatively small number of financial                    facilitatorsindividuals al Qaeda relied on for their ability to raise and                    deliver moneyat the core of al Qaedas revenue stream These efforts have                    worked The death or capture of several important facilitators has decreased the                    amount of money available to al Qaeda and has increased its costs and difficulty                    in raising and moving that money Captures have additionally provided a windfall                    of intelligence that can be used to continue the cycle of disruption                        The US financial community and some international financial institutions have                generally provided law enforcement and intelligence agencies with extraordinary                cooperation particularly in supplying information to support quickly developing                investigations Obvious vulnerabilities in the US financial system have been                corrected The United States has been less successful in persuading other countries                to adopt financial regulations that would permit the tracing of financial                transactions            Public designation of terrorist financiers and organizations is still part of the                fight but it is not the primary weapon Designations are instead a form of                diplomacy as governments join together to identify named individuals and groups as                terrorists They also prevent open fundraising Some charities that have been                identified as likely avenues for terrorist financing have seen their donations WHAT                TO DO A GLOBAL STRATEGY  diminish and their activities come under more scrutiny                and others have been put out of business although controlling overseas branches of                Gulfarea charities remains a challenge The Saudi crackdown after the May                 terrorist attacks in Riyadh has apparently reduced the funds available to al                Qaedaperhaps drasticallybut it is too soon to know if this reduction will last                Though progress apparently has been made terrorists have shown considerable                creativity in their methods of moving money If al Qaeda is replaced by smaller                decentralized terrorist groups the premise behind the governments effortsthat                terrorists need a financial support networkmay become outdated Moreover some                terrorist operations do not rely on outside sources of money and may now be                selffunding either through legitimate employment or lowlevel criminal                    activity                        PROTECT AGAINST AND PREPARE FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS            In the nearly three years since  Americans have become better protected against                terrorist attack Some of the changes are due to government action such as new                precautions to protect aircraft A portion can be attributed to the sheer scale of                spending and effort Publicity and the vigilance of ordinary Americans also make a                difference            But the President and other officials acknowledge that although Americans may be                safer they are not safe Our report shows that the terrorists analyze defenses                They plan accordingly            Defenses cannot achieve perfect safety They make targets harder to attack                successfully and they deter attacks by making capture more likely Just increasing                the attackers odds of failure may make the difference between a plan attempted or                a plan discarded The enemy also may have to develop more elaborate plans thereby                increasing the danger of exposure or defeat            Protective measures also prepare for the attacks that may get through containing the                damage and saving lives            Terrorist Travel            More than  million people annually cross US borders at legal entry points about                 million of them noncitizens Another  or more enter illegally without                inspection across Americas thousands of miles of land borders or remain in the                country past the expiration of their permitted stay The challenge for national                security in an age of terrorism is to prevent the very few people who may pose                overwhelming risks from entering or remaining in the United States undetected                        In the decade before September   border securityencompassing travel entry                and immigrationwas not seen as a national security matter Public figures voiced                concern about the war on drugs the right level and kind of immigration problems                along the southwest border migration crises originating in the Caribbean and                elsewhere or the growing criminal traffic in humans The immigration system as a                whole was widely viewed as increasingly dysfunctional and badly in need of reform                In national security circles however only smuggling of weapons of mass destruction                carried weight not the entry of terrorists who might use such weapons or the                presence of associated foreignborn terrorists            For terrorists travel documents are as important as weapons Terrorists must travel                clandestinely to meet train plan case targets and gain access to attack To                them international travel presents great danger because they must surface to pass                through regulated channels present themselves to border security officials or                attempt to circumvent inspection points            In their travels terrorists use evasive methods such as altered and counterfeit                passports and visas specific travel methods and routes liaisons with corrupt                government officials human smuggling networks supportive travel agencies and                immigration and identity fraud These can sometimes be detected            Before  no agency of the US government systematically analyzed terrorists                travel strategies Had they done so they could have discovered the ways in which                the terrorist predecessors to al Qaeda had been systematically but detectably                exploiting weaknesses in our border security since the early s            We found that as many as  of the  hijackers were potentially vulnerable to                interception by border authorities Analyzing their characteristic travel documents                and travel patterns could have allowed authorities to intercept  to  hijackers                and more effective use of information available in US government databases could                have identified up to  hijackers                        Looking back we can also see that the routine operations of our immigration                lawsthat is aspects of those laws not specifically aimed at protecting against                terrorisminevitably shaped al Qaedas planning and opportunities Because they were                deemed not to be bona fide tourists or students as they claimed five conspirators                that we know of tried to get visas and failed and one was denied entry by an                inspector We also found that had the immigration system set a higher bar for                determining whether individuals are who or what they claim to beand ensuring                routine consequences for violationsit could potentially have excluded removed or                come into further contact with several hijackers who did not appear to meet the                terms for admitting shortterm visitors                        Our investigation showed that two systemic weaknesses came together in our border                systems inability to contribute to an effective defense against the  attacks a                lack of welldeveloped counterterrorism measures as a part of border security and an                immigration system not able to deliver on its basic commitments much less support                counterterrorism These weaknesses have been reduced but are far from being                overcome                            Recommendation Targeting travel is at least as powerful a weapon                    against terrorists as targeting their money The United States should combine                    terrorist travel intelligence operations and law enforcement in a strategy to                    intercept terrorists find terrorist travel facilitators and constrain                    terrorist mobility                        Since  significant improvements have been made to create an integrated watchlist                that makes terrorist name information available to border and law enforcement                authorities However in the already difficult process of merging border agencies in                the new Department of Homeland Securitychanging the engine while flying as one                official put itnew insights into terrorist travel have not yet been integrated                into the front lines of border security The small terrorist travel intelligence                collection and analysis program currently in place has produced disproportionately                useful results It should be expanded Since officials at the borders encounter                travelers and their documents first and investigate travel facilitators they must                work closely with intelligence officials            Internationally and in the United States constraining terrorist travel should become                a vital part of counterterrorism strategy Better technology and training to detect                terrorist travel documents are the most important immediate steps to reduce                Americas vulnerability to clandestine entry Every stage of our border and                immigration system should have as a part of its operations the detection of                terrorist indicators on travel documents Information systems able to authenticate                travel documents and detect potential terrorist indicators should be used at                consulates at primary border inspection lines in immigration services offices and                in intelligence and enforcement units All frontline personnel should receive some                training Dedicated specialists and ongoing linkages with the intelligence community                are also required The Homeland Security Departments Directorate of Information                Analysis and Infrastructure Protection should receive more resources to accomplish                its mission as the bridge between the frontline border agencies and the rest of the                government counterterrorism community            A Biometric Screening System            When people travel internationally they usually move through defined channels or                portals They may seek to acquire a passport They may apply for a visa They stop                at ticket counters gates and exit controls at airports and seaports Upon arrival                they pass through inspection points They may transit to another gate to get on an                airplane Once inside the country they may seek another form of identification and                try to enter a government or private facility They may seek to change immigration                status in order to remain            Each of these checkpoints or portals is a screeninga chance to establish that people                are who they say they are and are seeking access for their stated purpose to                intercept identifiable suspects and to take effective action The job of protection                is shared among these many defined checkpoints By taking advantage of them all we                need not depend on any one point in the system to do the whole job The challenge is                to see the common problem across agencies and functions and develop a conceptual                frameworkan architecture for an effective screening system                        Throughout government and indeed in private enterprise agencies and firms at these                portals confront recurring judgments that balance security efficiency and civil                liberties These problems should be addressed systemically not in an ad hoc                fragmented way For example            What information is an individual required to present and in what form                        A fundamental problem now beginning to be addressed is the lack of standardized                information in feeder documents used in identifying individuals Biometric                identifiers that measure unique physical characteristics such as facial features                fingerprints or iris scans and reduce them to digitized numerical statements                called algorithms are just beginning to be used Travel history however is still                recorded in passports with entryexit stamps called cachets which al Qaeda has                trained its operatives to forge and use to conceal their terrorist activities            How will the individual and the information be checked             There are many databases just in the United Statesfor terrorist criminal and                immigration history as well as financial information for instance Each is set up                for different purposes and stores different kinds of data under varying rules of                access Nor is access always guaranteed Acquiring information held by foreign                governments may require painstaking negotiations and records that are not yet                digitized are difficult to search or analyze The development of terrorist                indicators has hardly begun and behavioral cues remain important            Who will screen individuals and what will they be trained to do             A wide range of border immigration and law enforcement officials encounter                visitors and immigrants and they are given little training in terrorist travel                intelligence Fraudulent travel documents for instance are usually returned to                travelers who are denied entry without further examination for terrorist trademarks                investigation as to their source or legal process            What are the consequences of finding a suspicious indicator and who                will take action             One risk is that responses may be ineffective or produce no further information                Four of the  attackers were pulled into secondary border inspection but then                admitted More than half of the  hijackers were flagged by the Federal Aviation                Administrations profiling system when they arrived for their flights but the                consequence was that bags not people were checked Competing risks include false                positivesor the danger that rules may be applied with insufficient training or                judgment Overreactions can impose high costs tooon individuals our economy and                our beliefs about justice                            A special note on the importance of trusting subjective judgment One                    potential hijacker was turned back by an immigration inspector as he tried to                    enter the United States The inspector relied on intuitive experience to ask                    questions more than he relied on any objective factor that could be detected by                    scores or a machine Good people who have worked in such jobs for a long time                    understand this phenomenon well Other evidence we obtained confirmed the                    importance of letting experienced gate agents or security screeners ask                    questions and use their judgment This is not an invitation to arbitrary                    exclusions But any effective system has to grant some scope perhaps in a                    little extra inspection or one more check to the instincts and discretion of                    well trained human beings                                        Recommendation The US border security system should be integrated                    into a larger network of screening points that includes our transportation                    system and access to vital facilities such as nuclear reactors The President                    should direct the Department of Homeland Security to lead the effort to design a                    comprehensive screening system addressing common problems and setting common                    standards with systemwide goals in mind Extending those standards among other                    governments could dramatically strengthen America and the worlds collective                    ability to intercept individuals who pose catastrophic threats                        We advocate a system for screening not categorical profiling A screening system                looks for particular identifiable suspects or indicators of risk It does not                involve guesswork about who might be dangerous It requires frontline border                officials who have the tools and resources to establish that people are who they say                they are intercept identifiable suspects and disrupt terrorist operations            The US Border Screening System            The border and immigration system of the United States must remain a visible                manifestation of our belief in freedom democracy global economic growth and the                rule of law yet serve equally well as a vital element of counterterrorism                Integrating terrorist travel information in the ways we have described is the most                immediate need But the underlying system must also be sound            Since September  the United States has built the first phase of a biometric                screening program called US VISIT the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status                Indicator Technology program It takes two biometric identifiersdigital                photographs and prints of two index fingersfrom travelers False identities are                used by terrorists to avoid being detected on a watchlist These biometric                identifiers make such evasions far more difficult So far however only visitors                who acquire visas to travel to the United States are covered While visitors from                visa waiver countries will be added to the program beginning this year covered                travelers will still constitute only about  percent of all noncitizens crossing                US borders Moreover exit data are not uniformly collected and entry data are not                fully automated It is not clear the system can be installed before  but even                this timetable may be too slow given the possible security dangers                                        Americans should not be exempt from carrying biometric passports or otherwise                    enabling their identities to be securely verified when they enter the United                    States nor should Canadians or Mexicans Currently US persons are exempt from                    carrying passports when returning from Canada Mexico and the Caribbean The                    current system enables nonUS citizens to gain entry by showing minimal                    identification The  experience shows that terrorists study and exploit                    Americas vulnerabilities                To balance this measure programs to speed known travelers should be a higher                    priority permitting inspectors to focus on greater risks The daily commuter                    should not be subject to the same measures as firsttime travelers An                    individual should be able to preenroll with his or her identity verified in                    passage Updates of database information and other checks can ensure ongoing                    reliability The solution requiring more research and development is likely to                    combine radio frequency technology with biometric identifiers                                The current patchwork of border screening systems including several frequent                    traveler programs should be consolidated with the USVISIT system to enable the                    development of an integrated system which in turn can become part of the wider                    screening plan we suggest                The program allowing individuals to travel from foreign countries through the                    United States to a third country without having to obtain a US visa has been                    suspended Because transit without visa can be exploited by terrorists to                    enter the United States the program should not be reinstated unless and until                    transit passage areas can be fully secured to prevent passengers from illegally                    exiting the airport                        Inspectors adjudicating entries of the  hijackers lacked adequate information and                knowledge of the rules All points in the border systemfrom consular offices to                immigration services officeswill need appropriate electronic access to an                individuals file Scattered units at Homeland Security and the State Department                perform screening and data mining instead a governmentwide team of border and                transportation officials should be working together A modern border and immigration                system should combine a biometric entryexit system with accessible files on                visitors and immigrants along with intelligence on indicators of terrorist travel            Our border screening system should check people efficiently and welcome friends                Admitting large numbers of students scholars businesspeople and tourists fuels                our economy cultural vitality and political reach There is evidence that the                present system is disrupting travel to the United States Overall visa applications                in  were down over  percent since  In the Middle East they declined                about  percent Training and the design of security measures should be                continuously adjusted                                        Recommendation The Department of Homeland Security properly                    supported by the Congress should complete as quickly as possible a biometric                    entryexit screening system including a single system for speeding qualified                    travelers It should be integrated with the system that provides benefits to                    foreigners seeking to stay in the United States Linking biometric passports to                    good data systems and decisionmaking is a fundamental goal No one can hide his                    or her debt by acquiring a credit card with a slightly different name Yet                    today a terrorist can defeat the link to electronic records by tossing away an                    old passport and slightly altering the name in the new one                        Completion of the entryexit system is a major and expensive challenge Biometrics                have been introduced into an antiquated computer environment Replacement of these                systems and improved biometric systems will be required Nonetheless funding and                completing a biometricsbased entryexit system is an essential investment in our                national security            Exchanging terrorist information with other countries consistent with privacy                requirements along with listings of lost and stolen passports will have immediate                security benefits We should move toward realtime verification of passports with                issuing authorities The further away from our borders that screening occurs the                more security benefits we gain At least some screening should occur before a                passenger departs on a flight destined for the United States We should also work                with other countries to ensure effective inspection regimes at all airports                        The international community arrives at international standards for the design of                passports through the International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO The global                standard for identification is a digital photograph fingerprints are optional We                must work with others to improve passport standards and provide foreign assistance                to countries that need help in making the transition                                        Recommendation The US government cannot meet its own obligations                    to the American people to prevent the entry of terrorists without a major effort                    to collaborate with other governments We should do more to exchange terrorist                    information with trusted allies and raise US and global border security                    standards for travel and border crossing over the medium and long term through                    extensive international cooperation                        Immigration Law and Enforcement            Our borders and immigration system including law enforcement ought to send a                message of welcome tolerance and justice to members of immigrant communities in                the United States and in their countries of origin We should reach out to immigrant                communities Good immigration services are one way of doing so that is valuable in                every wayincluding intelligence It is elemental to border security to know who is                coming into the country Today more than  million people are in the United States                outside the legal immigration system We must also be able to monitor and respond to                entrances between our ports of entry working with Canada and Mexico as much as                possible There is a growing role for state and local law enforcement agencies They                need more training and work with federal agencies so that they can cooperate more                effectively with those federal authorities in identifying terrorist suspects All                but one of the  hijackers acquired some form of US identification document                some by fraud Acquisition of these forms of identification would have assisted them                in boarding commercial flights renting cars and other necessary activities                            Recommendation Secure identification should begin in the United                    States The federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth                    certificates and sources of identification such as drivers licenses Fraud in                    identification documents is no longer just a problem of theft At many entry                    points to vulnerable facilities including gates for boarding aircraft sources                    of identification are the last opportunity to ensure that people are who they                    say they are and to check whether they are terrorists                                        Strategies for Aviation and Transportation Security            The US transportation system is vast and in an open society impossible to secure                completely against terrorist attacks There are hundreds of commercial airports                thousands of planes and tens of thousands of daily flights carrying more than half                a billion passengers a year Millions of containers are imported annually through                more than  sea and river ports served by more than  cargo and passenger                terminals About  agencies provide transit services through buses subways                ferries and lightrail service to about  million Americans each weekday                        In November  Congress passed and the President signed the Aviation and                Transportation Security Act This act created the Transportation Security                Administration TSA which is now part of the Homeland Security Department In                November  both the Homeland Security Act and the Maritime Transportation                Security Act followed These laws required the development of strategic plans to                describe how the new department and TSA would provide security for critical parts of                the US transportation sector Over  percent of the nations  billion annual                investment in the TSA goes to aviationto fight the last war The money has been                spent mainly to meet congressional mandates to federalize the security checkpoint                screeners and to deploy existing security methods and technologies at airports The                current efforts do not yet reflect a forwardlooking strategic plan systematically                analyzing assets risks costs and benefits Lacking such a plan we are not                convinced that our transportation security resources are being allocated to the                greatest risks in a costeffective way                            Major vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general aviation security                    These together with inadequate screening and access controls continue to                    present aviation security challenges                While commercial aviation remains a possible target terrorists may turn their                    attention to other modes Opportunities to do harm are as great or greater in                    maritime or surface transportation Initiatives to secure shipping containers                    have just begun Surface transportation systems such as railroads and mass                    transit remain hard to protect because they are so accessible and                extensive                        Despite congressional deadlines the TSA has developed neither an integrated                strategic plan for the transportation sector nor specific plans for the various                modesair sea and ground                            Recommendation Hard choices must be made in allocating limited                    resources The US government should identify and evaluate the transportation                    assets that need to be protected set riskbased priorities for defending them                    select the most practical and costeffective ways of doing so and then develop                    a plan budget and funding to implement the effort The plan should assign                    roles and missions to the relevant authorities federal state regional and                    local and to private stakeholders In measuring effectiveness perfection is                    unattainable But terrorists should perceive that potential targets are                    defended They may be deterred by a significant chance of failure Congress                    should set a specific date for the completion of these plans and hold the                    Department of Homeland Security and TSA accountable for achieving them                        The most powerful investments may be for improvements in technologies with                applications across the transportation modes such as scanning technologies designed                to screen containers that can be transported by plane ship truck or rail Though                such technologies are becoming available now widespread deployment is still years                away            In the meantime the best protective measures may be to combine improved methods of                identifying and tracking the highrisk containers operators and facilities that                require added scrutiny with further efforts to integrate intelligence analysis                effective procedures for transmitting threat information to transportation                authorities and vigilance by transportation authorities and the public            A Layered Security System            No single security measure is foolproof Accordingly the TSA must have multiple                layers of security in place to defeat the more plausible and dangerous forms of                attack against public transportation                            The plan must take into consideration the full array of possible enemy                    tactics such as use of insiders suicide terrorism or standoff attack Each                    layer must be effective in its own right Each must be supported by other layers                    that are redundant and coordinated                The TSA should be able to identify for Congress the array of potential                    terrorist attacks the layers of security in place and the reliability provided                    by each layer TSA must develop a plan as described above to improve weak                    individual layers and the effectiveness of the layered systems it                deploys                        On  the  hijackers were screened by a computerassisted screening system                called CAPPS More than half were identified for further inspection which applied                only to their checked luggage            Under current practices air carriers enforce government orders to stop certain known                and suspected terrorists from boarding commercial flights and to apply secondary                screening procedures to others The nofly and automatic selectee lists include                only those individuals who the US government believes pose a direct threat of                attacking aviation            Because air carriers implement the program concerns about sharing intelligence                information with private firms and foreign countries keep the USgovernment from                listing all terrorist and terrorist suspects who should be included The TSA has                planned to take over this function when it deploys a new screening system to take                the place of CAPPS The deployment of this system has been delayed because of claims                it may violate civil liberties                            Recommendation Improved use of nofly and automatic selectee                    lists should not be delayed while the argument about a successor to CAPPS                    continues This screening function should be performed by the TSA and it should                    utilize the larger set of watchlists maintained by the federal government Air                    carriers should be required to supply the information needed to test and                    implement this new system                        CAPPS is still part of the screening process still profiling passengers with the                consequences of selection now including personal searches of the individual and                carryon bags TheTSA is dealing with the kind of screening issues that are being                encountered by other agencies As we mentioned earlier these screening issues need                to be elevated for highlevel attention and addressed promptly by the government                Working through these problems can help clear the way for theTSAs screening                improvements and would help many other agencies too The next layer is the screening                checkpoint itself As the screening system tries to stop dangerous people the                checkpoint needs to be able to find dangerous items Two reforms are needed soon                 screening people for explosives not just their carryon bags and  improving                screener performance                            Recommendation The TSA and the Congress must give priority                    attention to improving the ability of screening checkpoints to detect explosives                    on passengers As a start each individual selected for special screening should                    be screened for explosives Further the TSA should conduct a human factors                    study a method often used in the private sector to understand problems in                    screener performance and set attainable objectives for individual screeners and                    for the checkpoints where screening takes place                        Concerns also remain regarding the screening and transport of checked bags and cargo                More attention and resources should be directed to reducing or mitigating the threat                posed by explosives in vessels cargo holds The TSA should expedite the                installation of advanced inline baggagescreening equipment Because the aviation                industry will derive substantial benefits from this deployment it should pay a fair                share of the costs The TSA should require that every passenger aircraft carrying                cargo must deploy at least one hardened container to carry any suspect cargo TSA                also needs to intensify its efforts to identify track and appropriately screen                potentially dangerous cargo in both the aviation and maritime sectors            The Protection of Civil Liberties            Many of our recommendations call for the government to increase its presence in our                livesfor example by creating standards for the issuance of forms of                identification by better securing our borders by sharing information gathered by                many different agencies We also recommend the consolidation of authority over the                now farflung entities constituting the intelligence community The Patriot Act                vests substantial powers in our federal government We have seen the government use                the immigration laws as a tool in its counterterrorism effort Even without the                changes we recommend the American public has vested enormous authority in the US                government            At our first public hearing on March   we noted the need for balance as our                government responds to the real and ongoing threat of terrorist attacks The                terrorists have used our open society against us In wartime government calls for                greater powers and then the need for those powers recedes after the war ends This                struggle will go on Therefore while protecting our homeland Americans should be                mindful of threats to vital personal and civil liberties This balancing is no easy                task but we must constantly strive to keep it right            This shift of power and authority to the government calls for an enhanced system of                checks and balances to protect the precious liberties that are vital to our way of                life We therefore make three recommendations            First as we will discuss in chapter  to open up the sharing of information across                so many agencies and with the private sector the President should take                responsibility for determining what information can be shared by which agencies and                under what conditions Protection of privacy rights should be one key element of                this determination                            Recommendation As the President determines the guidelines for                    information sharing among government agencies and by those agencies with the                    private sector he should safeguard the privacy of individuals about whom                    information is shared                        Second Congress responded in the immediate aftermath of  with the Patriot Act                which vested substantial new powers in the investigative agencies of the government                Some of the most controversial provisions of the Patriot Act are to sunset at the                end of  Many of the acts provisions are relatively noncontroversial updating                Americas surveillance laws to reflect technological developments in a digital age                Some executive actions that have been criticized are unrelated to the Patriot Act                The provisions in the act that facilitate the sharing of information among                intelligence agencies and between law enforcement and intelligence appear on                balance to be beneficial Because of concerns regarding the shifting balance of                power to the government we think that a full and informed debate on the Patriot Act                would be healthy                            Recommendation The burden of proof for retaining a particular                    governmental power should be on the executive to explain a that the power                    actually materially enhances security and b that there is adequate supervision                    of the executives use of the powers to ensure protection of civil liberties If                    the power is granted there must be adequate guidelines and oversight to                    properly confine its use                        Third during the course of our inquiry we were told that there is no office within                the government whose job it is to look across the government at the actions we are                taking to protect ourselves to ensure that liberty concerns are appropriately                considered If as we recommend there is substantial change in the way we collect                and share intelligence there should be a voice within the executive branch for                those concerns Many agencies have privacy offices albeit of limited scope The                Intelligence Oversight Board of the Presidents Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board                has in the past had the job of overseeing certain activities of the intelligence                community                            Recommendation At this time of increased and consolidated                    government authority there should be a board within the executive branch to                    oversee adherence to the guidelines we recommend and the commitment the                    government makes to defend our civil liberties                        We must find ways of reconciling security with liberty since the success of one                helps protect the other The choice between security and liberty is a false choice                as nothing is more likely to endanger Americas liberties than the success of a                terrorist attack at home Our history has shown us that insecurity threatens                liberty Yet if our liberties are curtailed we lose the values that we are                struggling to defend            Setting Priorities for National Preparedness            Before  no executive department had as its first priority the job of defending                America from domestic attack That changed with the  creation of the Department                of Homeland Security This department now has the lead responsibility for problems                that feature so prominently in the  story such as protecting borders securing                transportation and other parts of our critical infrastructure organizing emergency                assistance and working with the private sector to assess vulnerabilities            Throughout the government nothing has been harder for officialsexecutive or                legislativethan to set priorities making hard choices in allocating limited                resources These difficulties have certainly afflicted the Department of Homeland                Security hamstrung by its many congressional overseers In delivering assistance to                state and local governments we heardespecially in New Yorkabout imbalances in the                allocation of money The argument concentrates on two questions            First how much money should be set aside for criteria not directly related to risk                Currently a major portion of the billions of dollars appropriated for state and                local assistance is allocated so that each state gets a certain amount or an                allocation based on its populationwherever they live                            Recommendation Homeland security assistance should be based                    strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities Now in                     Washington DC and New York City are certainly at the top of any such list                    We understand the contention that every state and city needs to have some                    minimum infrastructure for emergency response But federal homeland security                    assistance should not remain a program for general revenue sharing It should                    supplement state and local resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that                    merit additional support Congress should not use this money as a pork                barrel                        The second question is Can useful criteria to measure risk and vulnerability be                developed that assess all the many variables The allocation of funds should be                based on an assessment of threats and vulnerabilities That assessment should                consider such factors as population population density vulnerability and the                presence of critical infrastructure within each state In addition the federal                government should require each state receiving federal emergency preparedness funds                to provide an analysis based on the same criteria to justify the distribution of                funds in that state            In a freeforall over money it is understandable that representatives will work to                protect the interests of their home states or districts But this issue is too                important for politics as usual to prevail Resources must be allocated according to                vulnerabilities We recommend that a panel of security experts be convened to                develop written benchmarks for evaluating community needs We further recommend that                federal homeland security funds be allocated in accordance with those benchmarks                and that states be required to abide by those benchmarks in disbursing the federal                funds The benchmarks will be imperfect and subjective they will continually                evolve But hard choices must be made Those who would allocate money on a different                basis should then defend their view of the national interest            Command Control and Communications            The attacks on  demonstrated that even the most robust emergency response                capabilities can be overwhelmed if an attack is large enough Teamwork                collaboration and cooperation at an incident site are critical to a successful                response Key decisionmakers who are represented at the incident command level help                to ensure an effective response the efficient use of resources and responder                safety Regular joint training at all levels is moreover essential to ensuring                close coordination during an actual incident                            Recommendation Emergency response agencies nationwide should adopt                    the Incident Command System ICS When multiple agencies or multiple                    jurisdictions are involved they should adopt a unified command Both are proven                    frameworks for emergency response We strongly support the decision that federal                    homeland security funding will be contingent as of October   upon the                    adoption and regular use of ICS and unified command procedures In the future                    the Department of Homeland Security should consider making funding contingent on                    aggressive and realistic training in accordance with ICS and unified command                    procedures  The attacks of September   overwhelmed the response                capacity of most of the local jurisdictions where the hijacked airliners crashed                While many jurisdictions have established mutual aid compacts a serious obstacle to                multijurisdictional response has been the lack of indemnification for mutualaid                responders in areas such as the National Capital Region            Public safety organizations chief administrative officers state emergency                management agencies and the Department of Homeland Security should develop a                regional focus within the emergency responder community and promote                multijurisdictional mutual assistance compacts Where such compacts already exist                training in accordance with their terms should be required Congress should pass                legislation to remedy the longstanding indemnification and liability impediments to                the provision of public safety mutual aid in the National Capital Region and where                applicable throughout the nation The inability to communicate was a critical                element at the World Trade Center Pentagon and Somerset County Pennsylvania                crash sites where multiple agencies and multiple jurisdictions responded The                occurrence of this problem at three very different sites is strong evidence that                compatible and adequate communications among public safety organizations at the                local state and federal levels remains an important problem                            Recommendation Congress should support pending legislation which                    provides for the expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum for public                    safety purposes Furthermore highrisk urban areas such as New York City and                    Washington DC should establish signal corps units to ensure communications                    connectivity between and among civilian authorities local first responders and                    the National Guard Federal funding of such units should be given high priority                    by Congress                        PrivateSector Preparedness            The mandate of the Department of Homeland Security does not end with government the                department is also responsible for working with the private sector to ensure                preparedness This is entirely appropriate for the private sector controls                 percent of the critical infrastructure in the nation Indeed unless a terrorists                target is a military or other secure government facility the first first                responders will almost certainly be civilians Homeland security and national                preparedness therefore often begins with the private sector            Preparedness in the private sector and public sector for rescue restart and                recovery of operations should include  a plan for evacuation  adequate                communications capabilities and  a plan for continuity of operations As we                examined the emergency response to  witness after witness told us that despite                 the private sector remains largely unprepared for a terrorist attack We were                also advised that the lack of a widely embraced privatesector preparedness standard                was a principal contributing factor to this lack of preparedness            We responded by asking the American National Standards Institute ANSI to develop a                consensus on a National Standard for Preparedness for the private sector ANSI                convened safety security and business continuity experts from a wide range of                industries and associations as well as from federal state and local government                stakeholders to consider the need for standards for private sector emergency                preparedness and business continuity            The result of these sessions was ANSIs recommendation that the Commission endorse a                voluntary National Preparedness Standard Based on the existing American National                Standard on DisasterEmergency Management and Business Continuity Programs NFPA                 the proposed National Preparedness Standard establishes a common set of                criteria and terminology for preparedness disaster management emergency                management and business continuity programs The experience of the private sector                in the World Trade Center emergency demonstrated the need for these standards                            Recommendation We endorse the American National Standards                    Institutes recommended standard for private preparedness We were encouraged by                    Secretary Tom Ridges praise of the standard and urge the Department of                    Homeland Security to promote its adoption We also encourage the insurance and                    creditrating industries to look closely at a companys compliance with the ANSI                    standard in assessing its insurability and creditworthiness We believe that                    compliance with the standard should define the standard of care owed by a                    company to its employees and the public for legal purposes Privatesector                    preparedness is not a luxury it is a cost of doing business in the post                    world It is ignored at a tremendous potential cost in lives money and                    national security
