FINALREGULATIONS FOR REVISIONS TO THE FEDERAL TEST PROCEDURE FOREMISSIONS FROM MOTOR VEHICLES RIN AEi Costbenefit analysisThe Environmental Protection Agency EPA has conducted a costand benefit analysis regarding the final rule which is contained inthe Regulatory Impact AnalysisEPA used two scenarios in arriving at the estimated cost of testfacilities implementing the Supplemental Federal Test ProcedureOne is the use of air conditioning simulation and the second is forthe use of full environmental cells for air conditioning testingThe analysis found an annual cost of  million associated withthe simulation scenario or a cost of  per vehicle Under thefull environmental cell scenario the estimated annual cost wouldbe  million or  per vehicle These amounts include thecost of recalibration redesign mechanical integrity testingcertification durability demonstration annual certification testfacility and vehicle hardwareThe environmental benefits EPA estimates will be a per vehiclelifetime emission reduction of  pounds of nonmethanehydrocarbons  pounds of carbon monoxide and  pounds ofoxides of nitrogenii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and EPA has determined that the final rule will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities The automobile manufacturers regulated by the rule do notqualify as small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act Therefore neither an initial nor final regulatoryflexibility analysis was performediii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  Based on the cost benefit analysis performed by EPA the rulewill not impose an intergovernmental mandate because there are noenforceable duties on State localGAOOGCor tribal governments However the rule will impose a mandateon the private sector in excess of  million in any oneyearEPA has prepared both a qualitative and quantitative assessmentof the benefits and costs of the rule in the Regulatory ImpactAnalysisEPA has considered numerous regulatory alternatives to the finalprovisions of the rule which are discussed in both the preamble tothe final rule and the Regulatory Impact Analysis but hasdetermined that the requirements expressed in the final ruleconstitute the most costeffective and least burdensome alternativethat would meet the mandate of section h of the Clean AirActiv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts andExecutive ordersAdministrative Procedure Act  USC   et seqInstead of the notice and comment procedures in theAdministrative Procedure Act the EPA promulgated this rule usingthe procedures which have similar notice and comment requirementscontained in section d of the Clean Air Act as amended USC  d The

published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on February   Fed Reg  and conducted a public hearing on April and   on the proposed rule The comment period was toclose on May   but was extended until July  because additional time was necessary to gather and analyze datarelating to the ruleThe preamble also notes  Fed Reg  that additionalcomments data and analyses were received after the close of thecomment period and that the EPA considered such information indeveloping test procedures cost estimates and lead time SectiondBi permits EPA to put documents in the rulemakingdocket after the comment period is over This type of addition tothe record after the close of the comment period and the need toreopen the comment period are discussed in Sierra Club v Costle F d  at   where the court held such actionwas not required because there was adequate time for response Wehave been advised by EPA that the additional comments and data wereadded to the public docket between August and
