          okay um i dont have any i guess definite views about elderly care um the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see where elderly people are abused and things like that i think thats one thing that i would look at if i was   uhhuh yeah   putting my grandmother or my mother uh in some sort of home the first thing that i would look at would be their history   right   as far as any court cases that came out of there um the history of you know their doctors um their nurses and things like that   yeah yeah i agree with you i um a group that im a part of goes once a month to a um they call it the Heritage House they call it the Heritage House its its a nursing home for elderly people and this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape a lot of them have had   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   um limbs amputated or um have serious illnesses you know that kind of thing and   uhhuh   um i watched the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands it started out just being a terrible place for the people and then a new company bought it   uhhuh uhhuh   and came in and remodeled the whole place hired new nurses and uh just really just redid it you know   uhhuh im just out of curiosity what what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place   well to me it was dirty for one thing uh when you would walk in the smell was just awful though you know the floors you could just   huh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   if youre walking on them feel how filthy they were um there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying and   uh oh my goodness   of course i dont know how many of them were you know not in their right mind or how many were   uhhuh   you know yeah yeah i just really dont know but i feel like they were neglected and um   in pain or something yeah uhhuh yeah thats what i was going to say it sounds like to just neglect all over neglect you know to clean up and   right right right i dont really think anyone was being you know cruel or or trying to mistreat them or anything i just think they were just not doing anymore you know than they had to do and um just kind of letting everybody live   right right   in a not very good environment but this new company came in and they like i said they remodeled the place and it smells nice when you walk in and it looks nice and   uhhuh   they got like several new color TVs for the people and and redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more interesting place for them to be they made a little patio area where they can go outside and   huh uhhuh thats great   yeah just you know small things that make it seem a lot more   homely yeah   yeah and its like its a lot more like an apartment place instead of just uh horrible   i would i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that and my biggest fear would that they would be is that they would be lonely   right   and i would like to know that there are you know just a lot of activities like you said you know just putting a plant in a room you know Just makes just brightens and and and just makes them just a little more active television   right right uhhuh uhhuh   they can go outside and just to know that theyre not you know laying in a room looking at gray walls you know that that would   right right with nothing you know   that thats what would just really kill me id like to know that you know they have friends there and they you know have little conversations and things id like to know theres a lot of interaction and   yeah right right um   maybe some kind of of activity little field trips or something i dont know how they would do that but   right yeah well they uh this place that we visit its really neat they have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in and   uhhuh   they will do bingo our group does a church service once a month and and then other groups come in and do the services you know other Sundays so that they have at least one service every Sunday and   oh uhhuh wow   so there are a lot of things there are places that have a lot of things for them to do but you really do have to kind of seek it out you know and   uhhuh   and make sure that its not a place like this one was   uhhuh i didnt realize that there were groups that go in like that thats really neat thats really neat   yeah yeah yeah it is its real nice and um i know our church does it and there are a lot of other churches and they are just like civic organizations that do   right uhhuh   and uh i have other friends its kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up and   oh uhhuh   make sure its a friendly animal you know and take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs   uhhuh that is great for that that will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew you know that the puppy is coming on Wednesday   yeah yeah yeah yeah   you know that would be something to look for thats really neat that really is   yeah yeah i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do so   uhhuh   yeah theres a lot that can be done its just a matter of people not being lazy   uhhuh right   and you know doing the best they can again i dont know what id do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know uh that would be   yeah putting putting any of my family in an elderly home to me would be a the very last resort you know it   right yeah   um and i know its hard for a lot of families if youre trying to to work or trying to take care of your own family its kind of hard to   right   to to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent you know on you and i know thats hard sometimes and but it would really have to be a last resort because that would just i would feel so guilty   uhhuh yeah yeah yeah yeah i would too   just i dont know unless i knew that they were somewhere just really i mean just really great you know that they were really enjoying   yeah right yeah yeah i know i know what you mean   i dont know anyone personally thats in an elderly home   yeah well i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because um um many of them of course their minds are not good   uhhuh   and so a lot them have told me exactly the same story you know every time i visit them   yeah yeah   theyll tell me theyll reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did and then the next time i go its the same thing you know but   uhhuh yeah   just somebody to listen to them uh just seems to make them really feel good   yeah uhhuh to nod their head and smile at them   right ill tell you the people i feel the sorriest for theres a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that hes really an intelligent person but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate   uhhuh uhhuh um   and um hes blind and he has seizures you know i mean hes just like in a world of his own and yet he wants so much to be around people   um right   and if you come over to him if he can touch your hand hell grab it and kiss it and oh hes always got a smile i mean he really tries to   oh   to brighten up your life oh its just amazing um but he cant say anything he can just kind of make noises you know   oh thats something that i mean if i had to work in an elderly home i dont think i could do it   yeah   like i i would really like to be a teacher   yeah   but i dont think i could do it because im very very emotional   me too   and the minute i mean the minute something happens i mean i cry on i mean you know Hallmark commercials but im just thats just the end of me   yeah uhhuh i know i know   and so i mean something real life i just im   i know   i uh interview a lot of children im an education reporter   uhhuh   and i always go you know everyday im doing an education things and   uhhuh   i meet these kids who are you know dropping out of school left and right and all the sudden theyre in this program theyre making straight As theyre going to graduate early   um um   and im just i just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic and you know i could just imagine you know working in a home like that   yeah yeah oh yeah   and those people theyre so sweet and and so genuine   uhhuh uhhuh   you know and all they want is just for everything to be happy and you know   yeah yeah   and so that would probably just tear me apart i mean in a good way but you know   oh it does yeah yeah yeah it is its really hard and   uhhuh   but one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids i have a three year old and a six year old and they um   uhhuh   have gotten comfortable being around these people because theyve always gone with us   uhhuh uhhuh   and the people love them and   im sure   they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand and so far my kids will do it just real easily   uhhuh uhhuh   and i think its because theyve gone since they were real little and theyve never been afraid but thats something to me children   yeah   you know need to people need to take groups of children  because the kids just brighten up their lives they   right yeah yeah   as we walk through the the lobby theyll all say bring her here i want to see her  i would love to hold her     and children i mean usually a lot of elderly people like to they like to uh share their experiences with the younger children theyll be telling them all kinds of stories that they dont even know what they mean but   uhhuh yeah thats true   you know they feel like theyve lived life so they need to share it and im sure ill be like that too   yeah yeah well me too   yeah   yeah its quite an experience   but thats great i didnt know there were such groups   yeah yeah there are and and uh it really helps those people i think   uhhuh   but like you said id really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there   yeah yeah   it would be a last resort   and i would hate it if anyone put me in one women   oh i know im always afraid like oh no what if i lose my mind am i going to end up in a place like that   yeah       yeah   somebody take care of me   yeah thats right   okay thus okay   well   okay well nice to talk to you   yeah you too Tonya thanks for calling bye   okay uhhuh byebye
