you   so do you work at TI   yeah you   yeah i just got a little booklet uh this not what were supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts and i thought oh i better make some calls     i know i know arent they   yeah well i havent get a chance i havent got a chance to look at them yet   i love it in the it was a lot nicer than i expected   my daughter uh got a few calls at home she talked to some student in i guess they give them to computer students too and uh Virginia or something like that shes talked to two students   ive talked to i dont think they were students one i think worked at a university university um and the furthest away ive talked to someone has been New York   yeah oh yeah great uh were supposed to talk about the elderly now i guess uh   so yes we are   do you have anybody that you uh have are close to that decision on or anything or ive thought about it for myself and all and my wife my wifes mother is uh in a retirement home shes not in a nursing home uh   oh well thats not did you push the button   yeah did i did we push   did you   let me  ill hit it again just in case   okay just in case   i did it right as she said yeah but uh shes shes down in San Antonio its its a uh   now whats oh   its a brand new one its a Catholic uh retirement home for nuns its at uh Trinity no let me see Trinity i keep calling it Trinity its not Trinity ill think of   oh   Incarnate Word and they have a retirement home for the nuns and they take some lay people   well isnt that neat isnt that neat   yeah and that ones really super now i i know what theyre talking about on regular retirement yeah theres not too many they do have a wing where the people who are really sick you know have nurses   uhhuh oh thats good   and then they have other wings that we visited uh that are very nice i mean its just super   thats neat just supervised more or less than anything and security i guess for them   oh yeah they they they have uh like uh a guard with locks weve been there once at night at Christmas she just went in last year   oh   she drives and everything she shes perfectly healthy uh   right what made you all decide to put her or had what made her decide to go   well her husband died they were in the military together and she just did not want to take care of the house   right by herself   and she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind so to speak and so   ah   well thats good   shes happy as as heck uh and they serve meals of course   thats great   and they have clubs and a swimming pool so thats nice now i i know the ones where youre really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one   umhum   and they were all more or less hospitalized type you know really really sick its a tough question     right shutins and yeah it really is i worked at one as a teenager i volunteered at at   oh you got experience more experience than i do then on it   well  it was really it was really sad heartbreaking i guess   yeah yeah   and uh i just oh i just felt for those people that especially the ones that never got visited   oh that would be awful i never thought about that you know   that just bothered me that just bothered me so much especially you know at my age i was probably about fourteen   umhum   and that really made a bad impression on me so ive always thought not not really bad of them i mean because they are most of them i i believe are probably pretty good for the people but i dont know its just a that would be a tough tough decision   yeah i think that uh hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it and theyre getting nicer   right   ive seen on TV where they take animals and young children in fact my daughter is one my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school took them to an elderly home and boy that really pumps them up that uh   helps yeah   is very nice to see young people i think thats one of the sad things is when youre in an older home   umhum umhum   if you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you know you cant take care of them   right right   obvious obvious you cant take care of children or animals in a nursing home but its nice to have them visit and everything   right yeah and get that youth back   yeah   you know sometimes that even helps them you know just being around young people the because some of them are so um you know just stationary i mean theyll get in a wheelchair or theyll just sit in a chair and and till you come along and really try and pump them up theyre just   right   stationary and i feel like gosh thats all they do all day long so um so i do love to see young kids go and and men take the pets and everything i think thats a real real neat idea   yeah i think you do get more by stimulation stimulation my in fact my motherinlaw just visited shes just about seventy five again perfectly fine   yeah   but one and and she visit us here in in Dallas when she went back every time she goes back to uh San Antonio my wife has two sisters there too she said shes much better shes much more alive and and uh active when shes been on a visit with somebody else you know and   thats yeah   and our routine has come obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and shes much and so the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around uh thats the fastest way to die i think you know   right right stagnant  yeah thats exactly right i think theyre really neat um of course ive seen those reports on TV the horrible ones and that scares me   oh yeah im afraid im a TV flipper anything bad i like i like to flip  i flip it off but it is sad its sad yeah     it really is it its sad to think that we would do that to people and you know ive seen them on TV with uh bed sores and   oh yeah   uh they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry and i just think how can you do that these these people have given so much of their lives you know to to America you know or whatever and here is here is how we treat them we just put them in a home and leave them   yeah right when i was uh younger we i lived in the east im from the east really and it seemed like there several people that i knew that had their uh parents i guess they would be but well in their seventy living with them   umhum   and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old and i guess she she had her own separate room and i think whether its more a custom up there or maybe because i was younger and its just not a custom anymore   right   to have uh you know the grandparents live with you anymore i guess that uh well we are getting away from that which is not right   i think its right i think its neat i think uh you learn a lot from them you   oh yeah   from all their experiences and and thats one of my favorite things to do sit around and listen to their stories   oh right right   i think thats neat because they really have a lot of good ideas insights that my father my husbands father is really old he he had him late in life and hes hell be eighty this year   yeah oh   and i just uh he lives with different you know people in the family hell switch from time to time i just   well thats nice in a lot of ways   yeah i just couldnt imagine locking not locking him up but putting him in a home and just   but that you were implying you said that by mistake yeah right   lock him up   thats what i think about it for me i think well my kids better not do that to me i dont want that you know so i i think of it well how would i want to be treated rather than   oh i know i know right right right exactly   you know its easy to say well yeah lets lets put these old folks in a home but when i think i dont want to do that you know i dont want to be have my little home i always threaten my daughters i say well   umhum thats right   im going to build a little house behind yours and then and ill take care of your lawn he says but im not going to one of those places right yeah     oh youre not going to put me away  thats what my mother she always youre going to lock me up one day arent you i can tell i can tell youre going to lock me up     thats what we thats the way we call it which is really wrong but my wifes mother and the one shes in San Antonio its you know its everything but the opposite of what youve seen i mean its its a little hotel hotel you might say   i know it right thats great   again a swimming pool and grounds and she has enough room she has two bedrooms and a and a separate living area   gosh   they dont have kitchens or anything but they have little its like uh   right   on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal you know   yes prepare your well thats great can now can she leave um on a day by herself   oh yeah its its its nothing like that its like living in the hotel i mean shes totally on her own   oh man thats neat   uh and she still drives which we do does scare us some because she has dented a few things you know   yeah     and we keep thinking about that you know because she they get less alert and they dont care and ive seen some of these elderly people on TV you know the ones from Florida that just run into people and they dont even understand what happened you know   right right i know bless their hearts you hate to hurt them by doing that thats like their one last thing that they can still do and you take away that driving ability and that would really be hard weve   i know i i know go ahead im sorry   uh well weve thought about doing that for for my husbands father because hes   oh he still drives   yeah   thats great well its wonderful in one one respect but i dont know if you can afford the insurance yeah       well luckily he drives a big old tank   yeah   so he i mean i dont think he he could get hurt i just hope to God he doesnt ever hurt anyone but he he hasnt had any accidents luckily   right thats good i mean people are all different   yeah yeah   i i wonder if they should give them a test or at least maybe uh not take their license maybe give them a refresher driving course and just to just to see how well they are every five years   right i saw that on Twenty Twenty that   are they doing it   they um you know theyre testing that theyre you know thinking of doing that and i think thatd be a great idea because you i think they do come become less aware and they just i dont know they and they dont hear as well for one thing and that doesnt help   yeah well everybody needs retraining it doesnt hurt uh   no thats   you know the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches and i dont know why you couldnt after sixty five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving it would it would sure the insurance companies would would probably help pay for some of that you know   right right at least that way the burdens not on the family of taking their license or their car away   right there you go theres a good point very good point   its on the state     very good point but i think they need should do that and then the families will have said
