                                 Nut Watch            Everything you need to know about Larry Klayman can be gleaned from a pressrelease he blastfaxed to the world two weeks ago The heading read            CLINTONALLIES BEGIN SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST JUDICIAL WATCH            Use Friendly NewsweekReporter to Harm Memory of Grandmother of Larry Klayman            LikelyComplicity of Clinton Private Investigators            Theunhinged prose that followed responded to an item filed by Newsweekreporter Daniel Klaidman Klayman did not dispute the fact that he is suing hismother Shirley Feinberg He claims his mom wont pay him back  he spenton private nurses for her mother his grandmother Yetta Goldberg who diedlast August at  He did not want this suit to become public but theClintonites he asserted learned about it and leaked word to Newsweek The final paragraph of his statement bears quoting in full            Klaidman used thisinformation obviously dug up by private investigators of the Clintons tosuggest that the Judicial Watch chairman will sue anyone and so hurt Klaymanby trampling on the memory of his grandmother This is untrue unfair andoutrageous What is true is that Klayman will do what is right no matter whois involved Whether it means caring for his sick and dying grandmother whoraised him guaranteeing payment to her nurses or taking action to make surethey are paid Klayman will not shrink from his standards of ethics andmorality Unlike Klaidman who wants to curry favor with Clinton administrationfriends such as George Stephanopoulos Klayman looks to no one other thanGod for guidance and direction            In factNewsweek did not hear of this lawsuit which was concealed under thename of a collection agency that belongs to Klayman from the White House Itfound out from Klaymans brother who volunteered the information But thepoint is not just that this Klayman conspiracy is imaginary and farfetched Newsweek  which broke the Lewinsky scandal is hardly friendly towardthe White House It is that as evidenced by this and other paranoiaceffusions Klayman is off his rocker            This became abundantly evident when I went to interview himat his Washington office this week After attempting to ascertain whether I wasa Clinton spy or worked for Salon magazine in our view a front forthe Clinton administration Klayman told me that private investigator typesworking for Clinton have been spotted casing his office With darting eyesand barely repressed rage he alleged that administration secret police keepfiles on him He went on to tell me that Ron Brown was probably murderedbecause of what he knew about various administration scandals Alleging theexistence of forensic evidence of murder he explained Everybody in that labbelieved there was a round hole the size of a  caliber bullet In one TVinterview Klayman suggested the killer was perhaps the president himselfThe Brown coverup is the subject of one of the  lawsuits Klayman has filedagainst the administration Another concerns the investigation into the deathof Vince Foster who Klayman thinks may also have been murdered            In otherwords Klayman is one of the fringe characters who has sprouted in the moistground of the Clinton scandals as mushrooms do after a spring rain But Klaymanis not treated like a fringe figure He has by and large achieved themainstream credibility he craves He is a frequent guest on such TV programs asCrossfire  Rivera Live  MSNBCs Internight  and TheCharles Grodin Show with whose twitchy host he seems to have a specialaffinity Klayman is financially supported praised and frequently cited bythe wider conservative movement But he isnt just a nutter who gets rightwingfoundation money and gets on television Hes a nutter with a law degree whotakes advantage of the courts to harass his political opponents How does heget away with it            The press elevates Klayman for a couple ofreasons On television there are more and more shows that take off from theCrossfire format expecting guests to represent strongly contrarypositions If one thinks Ken Starr is out of control the other ideallyshould argue that Bill Clinton knifes people and buries their bodies in theWhite House basement If these guests scream and yell so much the betterBarking however undermines the pretense of a rational debate Klayman whopresents a coherent faade while making wild and unsubstantiated charges isperfect With print publications theres a different problem Fine profiles ofKlayman have recently appeared in Newsweek and the WashingtonPost  But the conventions of newspaper journalism are such that anobjective reporter cannot render his own opinion that the subject has a screwloose Klayman is described in such terms as controversial legal gadfly            You mightthink mainstream conservatives would be wary of Klaymans tactics Tort reformwas part of the Contract With America and he is a oneman litigationexplosion But so far conservatives have been silent perhaps because Klaymanhas proved remarkably effective at abusing the people most rightwingersdislike His primary vehicle is a  million invasion of privacy suit filedagainst Hillary Clinton and others on behalf of the victims of FilegateNever mind that congressional investigators and Ken Starr have decided that thegathering of FBI files on previous administration officials with names startingwith letters A through G was not part of a grand plot to harass politicalopponents Klayman has found an opening to harass his political opponentsinflicting costly allday depositions on Harold Ickes Stephanopoulos JamesCarville Paul Begala and many others            In these torture session Klayman rants and raves anddemands to certify for the court answers that he deems evasive What doescertified mean Ickes responded to Klayman other than crazy Klaymanasks administration officials about whom they date where they go after workwhether they were expelled from school for disciplinary problems Oneyearold White House assistant was interrogated about a triple murder thattook place at a Starbucks in Georgetown Klayman videotapes these depositionsexcerpts of which air on Geraldo when Klayman appears on the programand publishes the transcripts on the Internet This is in pursuit of a caseabout the invasion of privacy remember But resistance is largely futile Lastweek the presiding judge in the case sanctioned Stephanopoulos for not lookinghard enough for documents covered by a Judicial Watch subpoena As punishmentStephanopoulos has to go through the ordeal of another deposition and pay someof Klaymans legal costs The ultimate goal of the Filegate suit appears to beto inflict this treatment on Hillary Clinton            Why dontthe courts put a stop to this Some judges have tried In  in CaliforniaKlayman lost a patent case on behalf of a distributor of bathroom accessoriesHis obnoxious behavior got him barred from Judge William Kellers courtroom forlife Klayman has hounded Keller ever since He appealed the ruling accusingKeller of being antiSemitic and antiAsian Klayman is Jewish his client wasTaiwanese After losing his appeal and being scolded by the appeals courtjudges he tried to appeal to the Supreme Court He has not given up yet It isthis matter he has said which led him to found Judicial Watch in  Theorganization supports requiring judges to undergo psychological testing andholding them personally liable for reckless rulings It also advocatesremoving Keller from the bench            More recently in a trade case in New YorkKlayman found himself on the other end of charges of ethnic bias When JudgeDenny Chin ruled against Klaymans client Klayman wrote Chin a rude letterasking about his contacts with John Huang and suggesting that Chins being anAsianAmerican Clinton appointee may have biased him The connection wasimaginary In our interview Klayman claimed press accounts of this incidenthave made it sound as if the HuangChin connection was baseless He said it wassupported by a document discovered in one of his lawsuits But the documentwhich he faxed to me turns out to be merely a list of AsianAmericansappointed by the Clinton administration Chin fined Klayman  and barredhim from his courtroom for life A threejudge panel on the US Court ofAppeals threw out the fine but upheld the expulsion Ive got ethicscomplaints pending against all four of them Klayman says            Despite Klaymans record ofabusing the courts Judge Royce C Lamberth a Reagan appointee has beenextremely indulgent of his antics in the Filegate case giving him widelatitude to issue subpoenas Whether Lamberth has succumbed to Klayman out ofideology permissiveness or fear of reprisal it is impossible to say Lastweek Lamberth did finally throw out a fishingexpedition type subpoena Klaymansent to New Yorker writer Jane Mayer After Mayer reported Linda Tripphad lied about a youthful arrest for robbery Klayman asserted Mayer had beenfed the information by the Clinton secret police and that it was thus relevantto his Filegate case It turns out as Mayer wrote in The New Yorkerthis week that her source on the robbery incident was Tripps formerstepmotherwho has since agreed to go on the record But Klayman stillbelieves the White House fed the Tripp arrest story to Mayer Shes nottelling the truth about that he says Were there Clinton privateinvestigators working with her Maybe hell ask his mom in her nextdeposition
