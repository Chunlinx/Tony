                                 Strikes Lies and Videotape            Start with a unionadvocate celebrating a successful election lateHoffa style waving a can ofbeer and shouting We won baby Whoohoo Proceed through a docudramaticdepiction of an angry strike and a consumer boycott that forces the company toshut down End with a union member standing in front of a shuttered factorylooking blitzed and saying I guess we showed them            Is thisthe ultimate morningafter video or what            The video was produced by Fieldcrest Cannon Inc theKannapolis NCbased company that is the nations largest manufacturer offurniture coverings and textile bath products and mailed to the homes of Fieldcrest workers three days before they were due to vote in a union electionjust two weeks ago Not surprisingly the workers ended up voting againstunionization by a slim margin After all no one likes people who yellWhoohoo            This wasthe second union election at Fieldcrests factories in six years and the firstin which the company faced UNITE the newly invigorated textile workers unionthat in the last  months has won  of  union elections in the South In Fieldcrest defeated an organizing drive by the Amalgamated Clothing andTextile Workers Union but committed innumerablewell OK more thanlaborlaw violations in doing so which is why the  th USCircuit Court of Appeals eventually got around to ordering a new election Atthis point Fieldcrest hopes UNITE will pick up and move away but that seemsunlikely at best A week after the election union reps filed charges with theNational Labor Relations Board against the company In fact perhaps in Ill get to write this story all over again Just once Id like to see theunion say We lost fair and square and now its over  says Dick Reece thecompanys point man on labor relations But they never do            Fieldcrest Cannons history suggests that whenit comes to keeping unions out of its plants its a firm believer in theMalcolm X approachuse any means necessary In the  election among otherthings company supervisors interrogated employees about their attitudes towardthe union dismissed  activists and refused to give union reps access to thecompanys factories More interestingly although this was not held to be aviolation following the election Fieldcrest gave a percent raise toworkers at its nonunion plantsplants that had just rejected the ACTWUwhiledelaying a percent raise for workers at its unionized plants This wasFieldcrest insisted a coincidence            In allthis Fieldcrest builds on a venerable tradition In a  election at itsplants the last paycheck employees received before the vote contained a notefrom the company telling them that the union was planning to take their moneyIn a race at Cannon Mills that same year billionaire financier DavidMurdockwho had purchased the mills from the Cannon family in promisedworkers that if they supported him by voting against the union he wouldsupport them by keeping the company independent The union went down in anoverwhelming defeat at which point Murdock sold the company to Fieldcrest Hehad already dumped the workers pension funds into insurance annuities run by acompany eventually seized by federal regulators And if you want to go wayback In  the Cannon family averted labor unrest by calling in theNational Guard and decorating the tops of their factories with machine guns andbarbed wire Even as most of North Carolinas textile workers walked outCannon workers stayed put Seen in this context whats a mere videothreatening plant closings            But Fieldcrest has not kept all except three of its plantsunionfree simply by pushing the limits in fighting organizing drives Thecompany also has benefited from the special obstacles that its Southernlocation adds to those that have eroded labors strength nationally Everystate in the South is a righttowork state which means that closed shops andunion shops are illegal Much of Southern industrialization took place outsidemetropolitan areas encouraging development of a companytown mentality andhindering industrywide organizing Kannapolis was ownedschools housesstores and police forceby the Cannon family until after World War II            For mostof this century in fact the history of unionism in the South was one ofbroken strikes employer violence and unkept promises In  for exampleworkers at Cannon Mills walked off the job They returned after twoandahalfmonths when the National Textile Workers Union failed to come through with thefood supplies it had promised them In  the AFLCIO launched OperationDixie an abortive attempt to organize the entire region but it collapsedwhen unions proved more interested in raiding other unions for members than inorganizing new workers Theres little evidence that an ingrained conservatismamong Southern workers has kept unions out But it certainly seems true thatthe absence of a tradition of Southern unionism has made it easier foremployers to play on fears about union corruption and greed and to suggestthat plant closings are an inevitable consequence of unionization            The question of course is whether theemployer should be able to play on those fears The National LaborRelations Act embodies a rather romantic view of democracy in which workerscoolly consider both sides of the unionization issue and then vote The problemis that the NLRA in a curious way saw workers making that decision primarilyby talking among themselves The act envisioned the employer standing to oneside as the vote was held perhaps expressing its opinion but certainly notplaying an active role in shaping the debate which is simply to say the NLRAwas designed to encourage unionization When employers want to play thatactive roleas of course they all doall sorts of complicated questionscome into play            If for example a companywants to argue that unionization will raise labor costs to the point where itwill be forced to shut down operations should it be allowed to do so Is itcoercive for people with supervisory authority to ask workers how they plan tovote or for management to give antiunion speeches on company time Answeringthese questions requires a constant redefinition of the difference between anargument and a threat And while there are many situationslike the dismissalof workers for organizingwhere this difference seems inarguably clearelsewhere things are fuzzier And Fieldcrest has used that fuzziness to greatadvantage It has in the words of UNITEs Michael Zucker banged on workersfears            To say its banged on themof course is not to say the fears are not real The striking thing aboutworkers comments after the vote was how many of them mentioned the possibilityof the company shutting down its operations The mills in North Carolina existbecause textile capital migrated from the Northeast in pursuit of low wages nounions and cheaper materials Its easy for todays textile workers to imaginethat the Caribbean or the Far East is the next stop on this trip As ithappens theres no evidence at all that Fieldcrest Cannon is contemplatingmoving manufacturing abroad or outsourcing But in this case I guessvideotape speaks louder than words
