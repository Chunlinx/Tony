                                  Heart of Glass            The New Northwests distinguishing feature isntrain or money or coffee Its Chihuly  Not Dale Chihuly Not glassart by Dale Chihuly Chihuly is all you need to say whether youretalking about a particular glass piece a Chihuly or evoking the movementthe institution the aesthetic and the regional identity epitomized by theNorthwests and the glass worlds most famous artist Not since Berninidecked Rome with fountains or at least not since the Wyeths became Mainesofficial art family has an artist so exemplified the spirit of a city orregionand it took three generations of Wyeths Chihulys work doesnt sayanything outright about us but hes the best mirror weve got for diviningwhat weve come to today            A little background with apologies to anyone wholives here and already knows it all Dale Chihuly is the artistcelebrity whogets most of the credit for elevating glass blowing from one more craft to abona fideand wildly popular and lucrativeart form He grew up in TacomaSeattles soporific littlesister city and headed first back East and then toVenice to study in the emerging studio glass movement In  on a tree farmnorth of Seattle he founded the Pilchuck Glass School which made thatmovement an institution even as he turned it into an industry            Try as we may we cantescape the glass Chihuly makes or rather has others make the luridVenetians writhing sea forms and extravagant candleless chandeliersresembling giant wasps nests or clusters of waterfilled condoms The loftiestgalleries and living rooms out here have their Chihuly bowls the crassertourist galleries stock copycats To gain Seattle credibility the apartmentset in the sitcom Frasier sprouted one No new cultural palace orfestival shopping experience is complete without a Chihuly click if you thinkIm exaggerating Seattles new symphony hall boasts two Chihulychandeliers            Chihuly himself is just as much a fixture as his Chihulysespecially in of the Seattle Times  gossip column Sample While atour of the Chihuly studio is standard for celebrities Bono did it onebetter He tried his hand  at glass blowing The Seattle Operacommissioned a set in Mylar from Chihuly Only Leonardo da Vinci and King Tuthave topped the attendance record set by Chihuly at the Seattle Art Museum Thefirst project Paul Allen picked for his new film company was a study ofartists inspirations including  you guessed it But the ultimateconfirmation of Chihulys stature is the lottery hometown artists stage to mockSeattles starstruck provincialism and celebrity fawning The winner gets tosmash a Chihuly            But Seattle still lagsbehind its erstwhile rival Tacoma in Chihulymania For Tacoma glass is a lastchance at world stature Its grandest landmark the NeoBaroque Union Stationhas been renovated and reopened as a Chihuly showcase with the mother of allchandeliers in its atrium and more big pieces scattered around This is justthe warmup to the International Glass Museum originally the Chihuly GlassCenter being built on Tacomas waterfront reached by a foot ChihulyBridge of Glass Tacomas captains of industry and finance all ponied up forit As one of them told the Times  Every downtown needs a niche            Chihuly is the natural choice for Tacoma and not justbecause hes a native son His is the perfect art for boosters wannabes newmoney and selfconscious arrivistes  In other words perfect for theprecociously wealthy culturally callow New Northwest Glass has the museumseal of approval but its supremely and as practiced by Chihuly almostpurely decorativeblissfully unburdened with threatening ambiguous or othermeanings You dont have to be smart or arthistorically sophisticated tounderstand these a Chihulys assistant explains in one of severaldocumentaries on him by Seattles public TV station Theyre merelybeautiful Forget Sister Wendy and her gloomy paintings glass shimmering andvacant is the ideal TV art a match for Riverdance and the tenors            Glass also suits a moneydrunktechnologyintoxicated place like the Northwest Its showy and luxurious asglittery as jewelry and a hundred times bigger Its hard slick andliterally edgy At the same time Chihuly taps an earlier earthier ecotopicsensibility His forms evoke not only phalli and vaginas but sea squirts andanemonesthe marine biosphere that sustained the first Northwesterners whichwe still delude ourselves into thinking were sustaining His baskets mimicNative American basketry outright The implicit if wishful message We canhave our machines and money and preserve the wild unspoiledNorthwest            But beautiful Chihulysare just part of the Chihuly phenomenon Chihuly himself is the main show Withhis rampant curls bluff growl black eye patch and brightcolored pirateshirts and scarves hes the perfect foil to geek chic a yearround version ofthe Seafair Pirates who frolic at our big summer paradethe artist for thenew buccaneer capitalism the jester who amuses but never challenges thegeeks He reprises the Renaissance role of artist as courtier standing like athird senator onstage when President Clinton visits partying on Paul Allensyacht with Robin Williams Candice Bergen and of course Bill and MelindaGates This year when Gates hosted his annual CEO Summit the worlds mostcelebrated gathering of tycoons who provided the entertainment The ViennaPhilharmonic and with an exhibition of glassblowing art Dale Chihuly            Not that he blows glass himself though he still saysthings like this from the  book Chihuly Baskets  Glass blowing isa very spontaneous medium and its suits me  Ive been at it for thirtyyears and am as infatuated as when I blew my first bubble Chihuly hasntactually blown since  when an auto accident cost him an eye and his depthperceptionand made his career He acquired the trademark dashing eye patchwithout which hed be just another chubby little guy with frizzy hair And hehired other people including top Italian masters to blow more glass than hecould aloneenough to make him the Christo of glass decking Northwest streamsand youve gotta admire the chutzpah Venetian canals with bright globes andtubes            The EyePatched One hasgone far and so has this town How far Consider the other time  years agothat Seattle had a distinctive defining artistic traditionand not one buttwo celebrity artists Morris Graves Mark Tobey and others in the generationlater dubbed Northwest visionaries drank deep of both the drizzly mossynatural scene and of Asian art and philosophy Tobey sketched spinach hawkersand bums at the downtown Pike Place Public Market and was sometimes mistakenfor one Graves hid out in the deep woods Tobey painted calligraphic whitepaintings and Graves bodhisattva birds in delicate gouache and pastelmedianotably unsuited to large atriums Today these seem as quaint as handboundbooks or handwritten letters            Chihuly succeeds because hes not a maker of art inthe usual sense hes a coach ringmaster and impresarioand above all anentrepreneur No one expects entrepreneurs to do the production work No oneargues anymore over whether Gates is really a techie or worries about JeffBezos literary taste And no one cares whether Chihuly blows glass            Like Seattles software bookselling and coffeetycoons Chihuly has triumphed by marketing and branding the hell out of hisproduct elevating it to something at once precious and ubiquitous TheNorthwest trick is not so much to create something out of nothing as makingsomething very large out of something small and then repeating the process Ahundred million PCs a billion personalized book and CD sales a zillion cupsof coffee  or hundreds of chandeliers made of brittle blades of glass Whichis after all just melted silicon
