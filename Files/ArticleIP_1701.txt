                                             A prediction by theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris that financialturbulence in Asia may cut nearly  percent off the output of industrialcountries around the world next year made headlines in many Europeannewspapers which were happy to note however that US growth should slowdown from  percent to  percent while Europes should creep up from percent to  percent But the OECD pointed out that the European Unionsbetter performance was predicted only because Germany was expected to do wellwith its GDP rising  percent next year and warned that in any event allforecasts will have to be revised as the turmoil continues            The worsteconomic damage was predicted of course for Asia itself and especially forJapan where Asahi Shimbun Monday reported a major fall in business confidence with the Tankanquarterly survey showing that the index of confidence among major manufacturershad fallen from  percent three months ago to  percent now The newspaperblamed the publication of the survey for a fall by the yen against the dollarto its lowest level since May             But the news from South Korea seemed to be getting a littlebetter The South China MorningPost of Hong Kong said in contrast to reports elsewhere that the UnitedStates had already rejected the South Korean governments request for an earlyrelease of some of its expected international bailout funds that PresidentClinton had told President Kim Young Sam that he personally supported therequest because he believed that South Korea was abiding by the demands forgovernmentspending cuts and other financial reforms made by the InternationalMonetary Fund The South Korean government news agency also said that the IMFhad now agreed to consider the matter            But theFinancial Times of Londonreported that the first day of the nation Asian summit meeting in KualaLumpur had been dominated by growing dissatisfactionmost strongly expressedby Malaysia and Chinawith the conditions imposed by the IMF on its Asiansupplicants Thailand Indonesia and South Korea The Malaysian foreignminister Abdullah Badawi was quoted in the FT as saying that the IMFshould show flexibility rather than simply impose on Asian countries the sametype of conditions it demanded of Mexico in  You shouldnt automaticallygive the same kind of painkiller to everybody he said Meanwhile reportedLondons Daily Telegraph thousands of protest marchers in Seoulwere demanding imprisonment for President Kim and renegotiation of the rescuedeal imposed by the colonial IMF            Another deeply discontented country was Turkeywhich after  years of struggle to be accepted as a potential member of theEuropean Union was told by the European summit in Luxembourg last weekend thatit still isnt considered a suitable candidate The Turkish government said itwas freezing political relations with the EU and indicated that it wouldntattend a panEuropean conference in London next March because of the biasedprejudiced and exaggerated assessments of its record on human rights Cyprusand minorities            TheTurkish Daily News quoted British Prime Minister Tony Blair as bizarrely describingthe EU communiqu on Turkey as a way for Europe not to turn its back butits face to Turkey and an unnamed EU spokeswoman as saying even morebizarrely If this was a fair world Turks would have been rejoicing inAnkara But an opinion column by Sirma Evcan in the Turkish                Daily               News said that even the strongest defender of the EU in Turkey cannotswallow the Luxembourg Summit communique which says nothing new gives no hopeIt is just a new version of telling Turkey You are not one of us but you maygo on trying your best to become so in the unforeseeable future            In London last weeks court decision on Microsoft was thesubject on Monday of an editorial in the Financial                Times and athunderous opinion column in the Times The FT said Judge Thomas Penfield Jacksons rulingmight mark a watershed in the companys historythe point at whichMicrosofts effective monopoly of personal computer operating systems movesfirmly into the ambit of the law Increasingly it predicted Windows willbe a product shaped as much by the courts as by its programmersimaginations            In the Times columnist William ReesMogg wrote Last January Bill Gates was still generallyseen as a benefactor of mankind who had developed new and efficient softwareto spread the advance of electronic communications Now this December MrGates is widely seen as a systematic monopolist of communication software whois exploiting the information age  His critics attack Bill Gates as theircritics attacked the old monopolists as a malefactor of great wealth  LordReesMogg said that the precedents under American law are that Microsoftwill not be allowed to expand or even retain its present degree of monopolyand he suggests that Gates take a leaf out of the book of John D Rockefellerwho in his later years consulted a publicrelations firm and took to givingout dimes to children in the street in order to soften his image as ahardhearted businessman The column concluded The best advice one can offerBill Gates is to start handing out money to children I know he will need tooffer them dollar bills rather than dimes
