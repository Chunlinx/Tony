              September        Name Address City ST Zip      Dear Mr Name      The space age began with the launch of Sputnik in October  This      remarkable accomplishment happened during the first semester of my junior      year at DePauw University where by sheer coincidence I was being      severely challenged by an Introduction to Classical Mechanics where I      was studying the equations of gravity and orbital motion as taught by Dr      Correll Believe me I never dreamed that some  years later my life      would depend on my precise understanding of realtime solutions to these      same equations Had I known such strange events would occur I assure you      I would have spent much more time studying physics in Minshall Lab and      less time playing bridge in the Hub The point is the liberal arts      education you and I received at DePauw gave us the tools to learn and      Im convinced instilled in us the curiosity to keep learning In our      changing world the sky is no longer the boundary to our travels In our      changing world there are likewise no boundaries to where a DePauw      education can lead us      Thats why Im writing to you and asking for your help in this years      Annual Fund      Why should we support DePauw Simply stated we must offer the       students now enrolled at the University those same opportunities to      develop skills they will need to meet evermoving challenges Through our      support of the Annual Fund you and I can help continue the educational      tradition we enjoyed a strong foundation for a lifetime of continued      learning and growth There is no doubt in my mind that the pop quizzes my      dad Professor Perk Allen gave his accounting students served an      important purpose His lesson of be prepared real life will test you      every day was carried by each of his students into their individual      careers It is practical advice that remains true today      Is a liberal arts education still sufficient Some argue that the      growing pace of technology makes a liberal arts education less valuable      in the s I believe just the opposite A liberal arts education is      even more valuable today precisely because technology outdates itself so      rapidly The ability to keep learning to keep discovering and to keep      inventing becomes even more important if we are to compete in tomorrows      world      For example when I was at DePauw the most technical educational      experience I can remember was visiting the IBM plant east of Greencastle      to observe the manufacture of computer cards This was the future Yet      those cards quickly became obsolete as computers shrank in size and new      datahandling technologies were invented Today we can readily buy      laptop computers with data storage capacity far greater than that entire      IBM factory could have offered      Yes as a science student at DePauw I did learn the methods of      mathematics and the mechanics of physics More importantly I remember      that professors like Dr Gass and Dr Cook also taught us to persevere in      the face of occasional failures and instilled in us the confidence to      tackle complicatedsounding subjects  subjects which might be difficult      to learn but which could yield great rewards And coaches like Mike      Snavely and Charlie Erdmann taught us about the importance of teamwork      not only on the playing field but in the classroom and in the      dormitories fraternities and sororities during the course of our daily      lives as undergraduates      Your memories are probably very similar Regardless of when you      studied in Greencastle the fact is that the only way we can keep up with      changes of todays world is to possess the energy and the ability to      continue learning Through some  years so far my DePauw education      hasnt let me down The challenges I face today in applying new      technology in the manufacturing of lowcost space products depend upon my      ability to keep learning Believe it or not the wondrous Sputnik      satellite of  compares to a s communications satellite as those      obsolete IBM computer cards compare to modern disk storage units      You have your own special memories and reasons to support DePauw but      we are all members of the DePauw family of friends classmates and      special professors My closeness to the University is strengthened by a      family legacy which goes back over  years to my      greatgreatgrandfather Professor William F Swahlen who taught Greek      at Indiana Asbury from  and carried on with my      greatgrandfather Joseph P Allen  my mother Harriet Taylor Allen       my father Joseph P Perk Allen  professor emeritus of      economics my brother Dr David T Allen  my wife Bonnie Darling      Allen  and continues today with my nephew Tim Allen       Like mine your ties to DePauw are a part of a proud tradition on a      campus where the sense of history is treasured And these ties coupled      with our classroom experience are a valuable part of our DePauw      education We must pass this tradition along Our generous gifts to the      Annual Fund will give todays students the opportunities that older      alumni shared with us by making their gifts to the Fund      This year your Class of  celebrates its golden anniversary and      its time once again to reminisce about your days at DePauw Please      consider making a special gift this year in honor of your reunion and      those special memories Your support will make a difference      I really believe that our support of DePauw does matter The DePauw      classes of    and  can make a difference in todays      world They matter and our support to them matters We must invest in      their future and ours      Sincerely      Joseph P Joe Allen
