                    Introduction        Rheumatoid arthritis RA is a chronic inflammatory        disease of the synovial joints which can result in        articular cartilage and bone destruction leading to        significant disability Central pathophysiological features        of the disease occur in the synovium with thickening of        the lining layer or intima and infiltration of the        sublining layer mainly by macrophages and lymphocytes            In addition the fluidfilled joint cavity contains        numerous neutrophils particularly during acute flares of        RA            The normal intima of the synovium is one to two cells        thick and consists mainly of macrophagelike and        fibroblastlike cells     In inflammation macrophages        make a large contribution to intimal thickening where        these cells increase in number and proportion            Evidence indicates that intimal macrophages arrive via the        circulation as monocytes     and it is proposed that        increased numbers of intimal macrophages in RA are largely        attributed to enhanced monocyte recruitment from blood        vessels in the synovium      Neutrophils are also        recruited in RA and can be found in abundance in synovial        fluid yet they occur in relatively low numbers in the        synovium     In synovial fluid their number can reach         per joint particularly during an active phase of the        disease     Neutrophils occur at the pannuscartilage        junction    and it is presumed that these cells reach        the joint cavity by migrating from the blood vessels in the        synovium following a chemotactic gradient        Chemokines are a family of proinflammatory cytokines        which are strongly implicated in inducing migration of        leukocytes from the blood into inflammatory lesions        Evidence has accumulated to suggest that chemokines such        as CXCL IL CXCL epithelial cellderived        neutrophilactivating protein CCL monocyte        chemoattractant protein CCL macrophage inflammatory        protein and CCL RANTES direct the migration of        leukocytes into the RA synovium and joint fluid            Chemokines occur in significantly elevated levels in human        RA synovial fluid where they are biologically active and        are expressed by cells of the synovium and cartilage        Tumour necrosis factor blockade reduces synovial        expression of CCL and CXCL and reduces inflammatory cell        migration into RA joints     In addition these        chemokines produced by RA synovial stromal cells have        been shown to stimulate monocyte migration     The        functional importance of chemokines in joint inflammation        has also been established in animal models of RA where        antibodies to these mediators significantly reduce both the        number of leukocytes recruited and the severity of disease        In addition administration of chemokines to the joints of        animal models results in inflammation and leukocyte        recruitment        The biological effects of chemokines are mediated by        binding to Gproteincoupled seven transmembrane domain        chemokine receptors     CC receptors CCR bind        members of the class of chemokines with two adjacent        cysteine C residues near the NH          terminus CC eg CCL CCL and        CCL and CXC receptors CXCR bind members of the class of        chemokines with C separated by an amino acid defined as X        CXC eg CXCL and CXCL There have been some reports        on the expression of such receptors on T cells in synovial        tissue and fluid         Little is known about        the expression of chemokine receptors on phagocytes in the        human RA synovium One recent study has shown the protein        expression of several chemokine receptors on        monocytesmacrophages in RA blood synovium and synovial        fluid     The aim of the present study therefore was        to examine the expression of         in situ chemokine binding sites on        macrophages and neutrophils that could mediate the        migration of these cells into the inflamed synovium                    Materials and methods                  Tissue source          Tissue samples were obtained from patients with RA            n   who fulfilled the American          Rheumatism Association criteria for RA Supplementary          Table  Synovia were taken from these subjects at total          knee replacement patients   or knee synovectomy

Representative sections of synovia that had been          incubated with Ilabeled chemokines were immunostained          for CD as a marker for macrophages Slides were          deparafinized

synovial sections          See Supplementary Material                            Results                  Tissue sampling          In all six RA subjects the histological appearance of          synovia showed classic inflammatory pathology with          mononuclear cell infiltrates and a thickened intimal          layer In two of these individuals a minority of synovial          samples also showed microscopically normal regions with          minimal infiltration of inflammatory cells and an intimal          layer of normal thickness one to two cells thick The          synovia of the six nonRA patients showed inflamed and          noninflamed regions These inflamed regions displayed          intimal layer thickening and some infiltration of          mononuclear cells although not as severe as in RA          samples and noninflamed sites showed a normal intimal          layer and no leukocyte infiltrates                          Chemokine binding to macrophages          To examine           in situ binding of chemokines          synovia were treated with ICXCL ICCL          ICCL and ICCL followed by autoradiogaphy For          direct comparison each chemokine was added at the same          specific radioactivity and concentration and          autoradiography was performed for an identical exposure          time All four chemokines bound to synovial tissue cells          in the subintima and the intima in every RA and nonRA          individual Supplementary Fig afor CCL Radiolabelled          chemokine binding was absent in synovia treated with          fold excess homologous nonradiolabelled chemokine          indicating that the binding sites were specific          Supplementary Fig b Histological examination          indicated that macrophages accounted for a high          proportion of the chemokine binding so to confirm this          observation representative sections were immunostained          with CD as a marker of monocytesmacrophages then          processed for autoradiogaphy All four chemokines bound          to CD cells in the subintima in every RA and nonRA          synovial sample No major differences in chemokine          binding were apparent between the six RA patients          despite variation in disease duration and drug treatment          Supplementary Table  The positive cells were located          close to blood vessels in leukocyte infiltrates and non          infiltrated sites and in more remote sites within the          subintimal stroma Fig  In addition CD macrophages          bound all four chemokines in the intimal layer of          inflamed Fig  and noninflamed samples In control          experiments there was no immunostaining when          isotypematched control mouse IgG was used instead of the          antiCD antibody                          Quantitation of intimal binding          The number of intimal cells that bound chemokines were          counted and the results for RA and nonRA patients were          expressed as means Table  There was a significant          increase of chemokinepositive cells in inflamed intima          compared to noninflamed intima for both RA and nonRA          synovia The number of positive cells varied between          chemokines and in RA tissue the rank order was CCL           CCL  CCL  CXCL In nonRA tissue the order          was CCL  CCL  CXCL  CCL The number of          CCL and CCL positive intimal cells did not differ          between RA and nonRA tissue However the number of          intimal cells binding CCL in RA was greater than nonRA          synovium In addition there were more cells binding          CXCL in inflamed nonRA intima compared to inflamed RA          tissue          Data were also expressed as the percentage of intimal          cells binding chemokines Supplementary Table  Similar          results to data expressed as the number of cells binding          chemokines were obtained Table and Supplementary Table           In both RA and nonRA synovia there was a          significantly higher percentage of positive cells in          inflamed compared to noninflamed intima The rank order          of chemokine binding was almost identical whether the          data were expressed as percentage or number of cells          binding chemokines In the cases of CCL CCL and CCL          there were no differences in the percentages of positive          cells between RA and nonRA tissue A higher percentage          of cells however bound CXCL in nonRA inflamed intima          compared to RA inflamed intima                          Chemokine binding to neutrophils          Neutrophils were present in the synovia of four out of          the six RA patients but they were less abundant than          mononuclear cells Neutrophils were absent in          nonrheumatoid synovia Neutrophils were positive for          ICXCL binding Fig  which was displaced in the          presence of fold excess nonradiolabelled chemokine          These cells bound IL in all locations within the          synovium within blood vessels close to blood vessels in          the extravascular tissue and close to or at the          intimal surface Neutrophils did not show any signal for          binding CCL CCL and CCL Fig  No major          differences in neutrophil chemokine binding were apparent          between the four patients who had these cells in their          synovia                          Immunolocalisation of CXCR and CXCR          To define the molecular identity of the ICXCL          binding sites on synovial macrophages and neutrophils          immunohistochemistry was performed to examine expression          of CXCR and CXCR by these cells Sections from the same          blocks of synovia used for radiolabelled chemokine          binding were treated with antibodies to CXCR CXCR and          CD Samples from every RA and nonRA patient showed          expression of both CXCR and CXCR by macrophages in the          subintima and intima Supplementary Fig and Fig           Similarly in RA samples that possessed neutrophils          immunoreative CXCR and CXCR was displayed by these          cells throughout the subintimal and intimal layers the          staining intensity for CXCR was more strong than for          CXCR Fig c Sections treated with rabbit IgG instead          of CXCR or CXCR were negative for macrophage and          neutrophil staining Fig d                            Discussion        The results of the present study show the presence of        chemokine binding sites on macrophages and neutrophils in        the RA synovium These sites were evident around blood        vessels of the subintima throughout the subintimal stroma        and in the intima In RA there is increased recruitment of        monocytes which migrate into the synovial subintima and to        the intima presumably following a chemotactic gradient            The increase in synovial macrophage numbers is mainly        due to enhanced recruitment since there appears to be        little contribution from         in situ proliferation of these cells            although deficient apoptosis may have an effect on        increasing cell number     There is also increased        recruitment of neutrophils in RA migrating from subintimal        venules across the synovium and into the synovial fluid        where they can occur in large numbers The binding of CCL        CCL CCL and CXCL to macrophages and CXCL binding to        neutrophils suggests that these receptors may be involved        in signaling the migration of the phagocytes through the RA        synovium into tissue microcompartments and fluid        The finding that the proportion and percentage of        chemokine binding sites on macrophages increases in the        inflamed intima of RA and nonRA synovia suggests that        these receptors may function in chronic severe synovitis in        RA and more mild synovitis associated with joint damage        degeneration in nonRA pathology In the cases of CCL        CCL and CCL there were no differences in the percentage        of chemokinepositive cells in inflamed regions of the RA        and nonRA intima However there were fewer CXCL positive        cells in the inflamed RA intima than in the inflamed nonRA        intima The RA synovia were obtained from patients with        longstanding disease whereas the nonRA samples were        essentially from patients with joint symptoms of shorter        duration Supplementary Table  One explanation is that        there may be temporal changes in chemokine receptor        expression which could explain this difference between RA        and nonRA CXCL binding In this respect temporal changes        in chemokine expression have been reported in human RA and        an animal model of RA      Alternatively the        difference in CXCL binding could relate to variation in        inflammatory mechanisms or a response to drug treatment in        the RA group        The present experimental approach was taken with the aim        of finding out if receptors on phagocytes bind chemokines         in situ  and showed that the        receptors are available and functional in terms of binding        chemokines Our results agree with         in situ studies in human skin where        macrophages also express binding sites for radiolabelled        CCL CCL and CXCL      The disadvantage with the        radioligand technique is the lack of definition regarding        the molecular nature of the receptors In contrast        immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry have the advantage        of molecular identification but can not show definitively        if the receptors bind ligands Immunohistochemistry showed        that both CXCR and CXCR were expressed by synovial        macrophages and neutrophils suggesting that the CXCL        binding sites on these cells were CXCR and CXCR        A recent immunohistochemical study has shown the        presence of CCR CCR and CCR on CD macrophages in the        RA synovium but not CCR     Since CCL is a ligand        for CCR and both CCL and CCL are ligands for both CCR        and CCR     these receptors are probably the CC        chemokine binding sites on the macrophages in the present        study The lack of CCL CCL and CCL binding to synovial        neutrophils suggests little or no expression of the        corresponding CC chemokine receptors on these cells This        is in agreement with other studies showing lack of CCL        binding to blood neutrophils and general lack of        chemotactic response of these cells to CC chemokines            although recent reports indicate that neutrophils in        response to certain cytokines are capable of expressing CC        chemokine receptors                         Conclusion        This study demonstrates the expression of available        chemokine binding sites for CCL CCL CCL and CXCL on        CD macrophages in the subintimal and intimal layers of        rheumatoid and nonrheumatoid synovia Chemokine binding        sites for CXCL but not for CCL CCL or CCL were found        on neutrophils in the rheumatoid synovium These receptors        may mediate the recruitment of phagocytes to the subintima        intima or synovial fluid and could provide potential        therapeutic targets                    Supplementary material                  Supplementary Materials and methods                          In situbinding

of RA Using the CC chemokine receptor antagonist        MCP a truncated analogue peptide corresponding to        MCP markedly reduces joint histopathology and symptoms in        the MRL         lpr mouse model  S   The CC        receptor antagonist MetRANTES decreased the incidence and        severity of arthritis in mouse collageninduced arthritis         S   With both antagonists mononuclear infiltration is        reduced        CCL CCL CCL and CXCL occur in human RA synovial        fluid and tissue     Therefore the ligands for the        binding sites described here occur endogenously within the        RA joint adding further evidence towards a role for these        receptors         in vivo  In the RA joint the        synovial macrophage is among the principle cell types that        produce CCL CCL and CXCL      The finding of        chemokine receptors on these cells suggests that        macrophages may amplify inflammation by attracting cells of        the same type and other cell types into the joint thereby        setting up a positive feedback loop Similar mechanisms may        also be occurring with neutrophils since in the RA joint        these cells produce CXCL  S  and express CXCL binding        sites                    Abbreviations        CC  chemokine with two adjacent cysteine C residues        near the NH          terminus CCR  CC chemokine        receptor
