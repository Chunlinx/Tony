                okay Diana uh on capital punishment in our state they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman   uhhuh   and i believe also in shooting of uh rape i mean killing a rape victim or i mean someone in the process of rape   uhhuh uhhuh   and i dont know what else i dont really remember what else   uhhuh   but   how do you feel what what do you think about it   i think its justified   uh yeah yeah   very much so   i agree i i agree you know i   i think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman   yeah oh i do too i do too   i mean i think theyre doing their duty but i think if theyre going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it   they ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman yeah i agree i dont know i heard something on the news the other night they were talking about   thats right i agree   uh oh i know what it was it was in our in our little local paper our little Lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week uh theres a little thing at the bottom that its like a call in survey that says you know do you think so and so and then you call this number and you press like one for yes and two for no   right uhhuh   and one of the things the questions the other day uh this last paper and i havent seen the results of it im anxious to was do you think that um capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers   oh i think   which i thought was a real interesting question   right right  did you see Sixty Minutes tonight by any chance   no i didnt huhuh   well they were showing a segment on a man in Philadelphia thats going after the drug dealers hes just a civilian hes a black man and he just got fed up with it   uhhuh uhhuh   and he said hes had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything trying to keep keep him quiet but hes organizing people   uhhuh   and theyre going out and marching on the corners and taking taking back their territory   you know i think thats what its going to take though   i think so i think   i really do i yeah its going to take uh you know the the police i i think i dont think can do it uh can do it alone you know   thats right i think youre right   its going to take uh its going to take all of us getting together im sorry im trying to my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed  its going to take all of us you know getting together and just saying we are not going to take it any more     right we wont allow this in our neighborhood and it said theyre going to other neighborhoods from there   thats right thats right uhhuh   and then quite often theyll get shot because   uh   theyre horning in on somebody elses territory   thats right thats right uh   i think they said forty one had been shot out of one church in the last year   my gosh the only thing about the death penalty and and i know that that they try to be careful and they try to be sure but these people are on death row for like twenty years you know and you know if if     right i know it   you know i i think to be you know convicted being convicted is one thing you know and thats and thats great if theyre convicted if theyre sentenced to death to me you could not sentence them to death unless the case was for sure i mean it had   well it goes all through the state it goes all through the state supreme court system before theyre   right right and and by the time it gets there and theyve been convicted and then theyve been sentenced to death   uhhuh then it should happen yeah   theyre sure i mean theres no doubt i mean i there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty so once theyve gotten the penalty and there is no doubt do it   thats right   you know just   right   i dont i guess i mean thats may sound that sounds cold but gosh you know were keeping you know were were keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row   uhhuh thats right   and not doing anything with them and its costing us a heck of a lot of money and thats terrible to look at it that way but   yeah it is i know but that thats the way it is   yeah if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death then do it you know uh   we had one in Virginia that was sentenced to death and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago i dont know if there was anything in your paper about it   i didnt notice it huhuh   and there was a lot of protest even Robert Redford you know was protesting this guys execution so the governor backed down and i was so mad the crime was horrible his crime was just horrible   gosh yeah oh man yeah and those kind of people im sorry you dont reform them you know i really believe you dont   no i dont think huhuh   if theyre the kind of people that commit these  excuse me grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again you dont reform those kind of people   humum and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me   no no and i dont know the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas you know well if youre insane enough that you can go   right yeah     cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard then are you can can you be helped you know i have i have my doubts you know     thats right yeah yeah i do too   i you know i dont know i think theres a point some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do its just it just gets out of hand and i understand that you know that you know my husband and i   right wasnt it Lewisburg that had a lot of uh bad things happening just in the last couple of weeks or was it not   no no huhuh   no maybe it was i think it was the South East area from Dallas my daughter my daughter lives down in Rowlett and she was telling me about it yeah i cant remember what the town was some little area   oh really yeah oh really yeah weve had several here lately and it there were several of them in North Dallas and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in South Dallas and thats maybe what you were talking about men breaking in uh to houses and taking or a man they they think its the same person taking uh little girls right straight out of their beds at night an d  you know breaking in obviously watching them in the house because theyre breaking into the right window   oh gosh and thats the last they saw yeah   you know the little girls bedrooms and taking them out putting them in a car and driving them out and taking them out and molesting them and then bringing them back and throwing them back in their own front yards   oh gee is that right i hadnt heard about that   yes that is happened i think theres been  i think theres been like six or seven of them over the last like probably eight eight or nine months   gosh they dont kill them they just molest   they dont kill them no theyve taken and theyre all like um like nine anywhere from nine to twelve years old i think is what theyve been   gosh gosh   and hes taken them and and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard and   boy thats scary isnt it   oh can you imagine because it it happens in the middle of the night so the parent   yeah   you know these parents didnt know this the the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming let me in you know can you imagine   yeah oh boy yeah you wouldnt even dare put these signs in the window little emblems in the window saying child in this room in case of fire you know have you seen those   shoot i you know ive got one of those in Brians room i never even thought about that   yeah yeah   God maybe ill take it out i hadnt even thought about it   yeah it is   thats terrible well its really bad that you have to be you know we we were over at a neighbors tonight and and Brian my little boy is only is just a little over two and their little boy is like five you know so theres a big difference and they were playing in the back yard and we were getting ready to leave and i went out in the back yard to get Brian and the boys were gone and the back fence was open  you know   uhhuh oh gosh oh gosh yeah   and she didnt act like it bothered her at all oh this happens all the time and we walked through the fence out the alleys or come to the back of the house you know and walked and i looked down both directions of the alley and i saw neither one of them and uh   uhhuh yeah   and oh and she was like oh God he does this all the time you know where are you you know screaming J D and you know my heart was in my throat you know and uh he Brian was two houses down   oh oh boy  and hes five shoot i guess so gee   you know and he you know i dont know   i know   parents around here just let their kids run everywhere and i just cant do that   yeah there was a little girl picked up in Rowlett from uh from her front yard and her dad was working in the back yard and had just left her few minutes in the front yard and somebody apparently drove up and took her and they never saw her again   oh God oh man this is too scary that is just too scary you know i let Brian play here in the back yard and weve got   yeah   theres two gates that go into the back yard and weve got one of those big eight foot privacy fences and one of the gates has a padlock on it and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things but its on the inside its   right uhhuh   uhhuh   you know youd have to climb like come over theyd have to come over the fence they could not open a gate you know and i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there you know i mean if i dont hear him playing i mean i i get up and come out and look out the window real often you know so   uhhuh right yeah watch yeah yeah i dont blame you   its really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids but i mean you do better safe than sorry   umhum and if they find whos doing that to those little girls as far as im concerned he could   he could fry yes to put it very bluntly he could fry yes yes because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder   fry  yeah right   you know i and i believe that and this is one of them because these little girls will never be the same   yeah yeah huhuh thats terrible   never be the same so  i dont know its  its really scary and i dont know what to and i dont know what needs to be done you know it seems like theres no room in jails to put them in jail and when they do put them in there you know were im taking a business law class at night and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney and   oh gosh   so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases you know  and he said you can pretty much you know if you ever get on a jury you know youre not told this but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to theyre going to serve about a quarter   its going to be reduced right uhhuh   they theyll serve theyll serve a quarter of it so if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years dont sentence them to fifteen years sentence them to a hundred you know because then theyll serve fifteen or twenty so which is really i dont know   yeah yeah yeah its just not it just doesnt seem right   no it doesnt it doesnt they just get out you know there was a thing on   well what are we going to do about it  How i mean how can it be changed   well i dont know   unless the legislature will do something and they dont seem to   thats the thing and you know were just going to have to adopt a  a completely different attitude   uhhuh   and were going to have to say if you commit this crime and if were sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period   yeah   period and do it you know and if you commit this crime you will be in prison for the rest of your life were not going to say were going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years were really going to do it you know its just the system has just   yeah right     and and i understand theyre doing it because the prisons are full but somewhere weve got to come up with some money to build to build more you know and keep these people in them you know   right i think so yeah yeah i think it would be worth it everybody would   they were i was watching a show about this the other night and you know they were like in i think it was on Forty Eight Hours or Morning
