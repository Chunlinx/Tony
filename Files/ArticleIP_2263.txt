                                 The Conservative Collapse            By Jacob Weisberg            Every year just before thepresidents State of the Union address the White House Press Office invitespolitical reporters in for a spin session In keeping with the current mood inWashington the message this timeconveyed by National Security Adviser SandyBerger Budget Director Franklin Raines and Domestic Policy Adviser BruceReedwas about bipartisanship and cooperation But after about an hour ofanodyne sentiments Rahm Emanuel a Clinton political adviser more pugnaciousthan the others couldnt take it any more About a year ago there was adebate about whether there would be a Department of Education he saidjumping up from his chair We have covered a lot of ground here When everyonemakes the point that the president is somewhat conceding the agenda the factis  the Republicans have conceded the presidents priorities In fact itis his initiatives that are the center of agreement            It isamazing how much has changed in  months The chief theme in analyses of thepresidents State of the Union address a year ago was that Clinton was tryingto catch a ride on the unstoppable conservative freight train But historyappears to have changed directions again From the comfortable perch of a percent approval rating the highest of his presidency Clinton spent most ofhis speech Tuesday night proposing a variety of new government programs Thesewere not merely smallbore Dick Morrisera programs Many were substantial andcostly efforts in the areas of education and healthcare reform And now itsthe Republicans who are scrambling to get on board            Emanuel and other gloating Clintonites contend that thepresident brought about this transformation by reclaiming the vital centerClinton did indeed move deftly and systematically to deny Republicans all theirfamiliar means of portraying Democrats as being incorrigibly leftist andoutside the mainstream By pushing a harsh anticrime bill proposing his ownversion of a balanced budget and signing a welfare reform package verydifferent from his own original notion Clinton deprived Republicans of whatthey expected to be their three best issues After the president got donerepositioning Bob Dole had very little left to run on            ButClintons cooption is not the whole story Conservatism has collapsed It hasbeen a clich since the early s that the GOP is the party of ideas Buttoday as Clinton generateswith seeming easepopular and plausibleproposals like expanding college opportunity and extending health insurance touncovered children Republicans are openly admitting that their party has noclue what it is in favor of It is clear that the faithful are paralyzed byennui and the party is floundering writes William J Bennett in the mostrecent issue of the Weekly Standard  What is missing is a focusedappealing and philosophically coherent national agenda One would expectBennett after making such a statement to propose such an agenda But theformer drug czars notion of what the GOP platform should say resembles nothingso much as Clintons farrago of demitasse ideas from a year ago Bennettsuggests focusing on such targets of opportunity as missile defense andopposition to racial setasides and partialbirth abortion These arepolldriven wedge issues which are likely to have little effect on the livesof most people and which surely dont constitute a philosophical program            It was only two years ago that Republicans hadenough consistent doctrine for Thomas Aquinas What happened Essentiallyconservatives had an unpleasant encounter with reality They took a few stepsin the direction of a coherent philosophical program and came back looking likethe English Patient Somehow Newt Gingrich managed to unite all the members ofhis party for a dramatic attack on the role of government This attack wasnever as broad as it was made out to be in Republican rhetoric but even so itscared the hell out of the country An entire party and not just a factionwithin it was threatening to violate the national consensus on governmentsrole Moderate Republicans who barely held onto their seats in  will notsign on again any time soon for an attack on programs that are popular with themiddle class Nor are they ready to mount an assault on environmental andconsumer regulations            So ifattacking government is out what else can Republicans do Bennett Ralph Reedand others would have them embrace social and cultural issues But this plan iseven less promising than renewed attacks on the Environmental ProtectionAgency Moderate Republicans and conservative libertarians were able to findpoints of agreement with more authoritarian conservatives on issues likecutting taxes curtailing welfare and balancing the budget But theres lessroom for compromise on the broader agenda of social conservatives whichincludes issues like school prayer and abortion With a slender majoritydivided Republicans cant easily move in any direction Their only alternativeis to cooperate with Clinton on issues of national consensus which mightpersuade voters they are worthy of continuing to share power with him            While they play along Republicans fantasize about aDemocratic scandal huge enough to overturn the existing political dynamicHoping for a deus ex machina is also not a program let alone aphilosophy            Republicans not only lack ideasthey also lack leaders Even if Gingrich getsback to the point where his colleagues will allow him to be seen in public heactually appeared to be leaning outside the picture frame behind Clinton duringthe State of the Union its hard to imagine him leading a movement again Anddespite the speakers many failings there is no one else with imagination orenergy waiting in the GOP wings The designated respondent to the presidentRep JC Watts provided some novelty value for an evening But thoughpleasant and a polished speaker hes an intellectual lightweightand hescertainly not a potential party leader            Who else do the Republicans have It is amusingto watch the strange new respect phenomenon engulf Senate Majority LeaderTrent Lott as journalists wake up to the fact that he is not the conservativeideologue he appears Theres no telling how far the liberalizing of Lott mightgo with enough positive reinforcement His most recent gambitcriticizing thepresident for proposing excessive cuts in Medicare managedcare feeswas anattempt to outflank Clinton on the left  Its clear that Lott is not thefellow to address the GOPs problem of intellectual bankruptcy            For Clinton the challengeof dominance is to act more responsibly and less politically The president isin a strong enough position now to take his own rhetoric on reformingentitlements which he added to his address at the last minute seriously andto drop leftover junk ideas from the campaign like the Victims Rights Amendmentto the Constitution The voters chose Clinton as a secondterm president Nowits time for him to start acting like one
