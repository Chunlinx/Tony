                    Background        Unfortunately most clinicians either do not seek        evidence or ineffectively seek evidence    Practicing        clinicians rarely search MEDLINE    and when they do        they usually find half of the germane research that a        medical librarian finds    Even librarians can only        find evidence to answer half of the questions posed           As a result many clinicians are practicing with less        than has been proved            To encourage evidenceseeking students have been taught        critical appraisal of medical research Regardless of the        instructional format such as Journal Club research has        demonstrated that this instruction does not increase        medical students actual use of literature             We hypothesized that we could increase students        frequency of searching for evidence by focusing on how to        find evidence as well as how to appraise it We conducted        two controlled trials to test this hypothesis In the first        trial we taught students in the intervention group how to        search for evidence as well as how to appraise evidence        Prior to the second trial we created an Internet site        SUMSearch  httpSUMSearchUTHSCSAedu    to        automate finding evidence We taught how to appraise        evidence and how to use SUMSearch to students in the        intervention group Results were measured with        questionnaires at the end of the study periods                    Materials and methods                  Subjects          Subjects were thirdyear medical students at The          University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio          During the medicine clerkship we taught the students how          to find and appraise medical evidence We performed two          quasirandomized controlled studies  and           For each trial we surveyed the entire class          of approximately  thirdyear medical students at           months after approximately half of the class had taken          the course intervention group The remaining students          comprised the control group          Group assignment occurred in a quasirandomized manner          At our institution students place themselves into           groups of  to members The Deans Office combines          these  groups into  larger groups in order to achieve          similar distributions of gender ethnicity and academic          performance The Deans office randomly assigns medical          students to a sequence of rotations A student from each          group draws from a bowl a number that indicates the order          of clerkship rotations                          Interventions                       Trial            We made four computers available to all students in            key clinical locations Each computer provided the            following software compatible with Microsoft Windows             Scientific American Textbook of Medicine  the            Cochrane Library  and Best Evidence  MEDLINE was            accessible with OVID Windows Client which was            customized with search filters     The Internet            access encouraged use of the Database of Abstracts of            Reviews of Effectiveness DARE practice guidelines            online journals and journal clubs The computers had a            customized interface Figure  that displayed and            organized these resources The interface which could            not be removed offered contextsensitive online help            Additional File  lifelonghlp and tracked the            usage of each resource We used the usage logs to guide            enhancements to the interface Because we prioritized            accessibility and the ability to log in rapidly we did            not use usernames and passwords to track individual            students We taught the intervention group students how            to find and appraise medical evidence using the            resources on these computers Table             File             Help file                          lifelonghlp  KB This file            provides the online help and

several changes in our resources after the            first study Because of developments in the Internet            we converted access to all resources to the Internet            via the public address httpClinicalUTHSCSAedu            This allowed access from home and hospital networks and            easier maintenance We replaced the Windows interface            on our clinical computers with a customized Internet            browser whose home page was this Internet address We            had observed during the first trial that searching for            evidence even after instruction was still very            difficult for students Because searching for medical            evidence can follow an algorithm we created SUMSearch            httpSUMSearchUTHSCSAedu an Internet site that            automates searching for medical evidence                SUMSearch searches for medical evidence at high quality            Internet sites including DARE National Guideline            Clearinghouse and PubMed SUMSearch searches PubMed            with four different strategies Three strategies are            for finding systematic reviews practice guidelines            and traditional review articles and the fourth will            find original research using validated search filters                In addition SUMSearch automatically reformats            and reexecutes the search for original research            multiple times until the best possible results are            found            Based on feedback from students between studies            during the  academic year we also changed our            educational intervention We reduced instruction on            each individual resource but we increased instruction            on SUMSearch Table             At the same time as our second trial the Department            of Family Medicine was also teaching an evidencebased            course in their clerkship Thus half of the students            who had been on the Family Medicine rotation during the            first half of the year received that intervention The            Family Medicine intervention consisted of three            minute sessions that taught how to frame clinical            questions search for evidence and critically appraise            evidence A comparison of the two courses indicated            that the Internal Medicine course focused on how to            find evidence while the Family Medicine course focused            on how to appraise evidence                                    Outcomes          The principal outcomes were selfreport of search          frequency satisfaction with results and satisfaction          with speed of searching We queried these principal          outcomes identically in both trials We also asked in the          second trial whether search frequency influenced patient          care In both trials we assessed retention of content          although we do not report these results at this time          For both trials surveys were administered at           months after half of the students in the thirdyear          class had taken the course The median time between          completion of the course and administration of the          questionnaires was  months for students in the          intervention groups                          Analyses          Principal outcomes measuring search frequencies and          influence from searching were dichotomized into at least          once a week and less often or no answer Outcomes          measuring satisfaction were dichotomized into being          satisfied with more than half of search and less often or          no answer          Questionnaires were analyzed by intervention and          control group We tested significance with the twotailed          Chisquare test In the second trial we performed a          MantelHaenszel analysis to quantify the independent          contributions of the Internal Medicine and Family          Medicine courses on the outcomes                                Results                   study          Of  thirdyear medical students in the first trial            students completed the yearend questionnaire            of  students who had attended the course and            of  who had not We excluded  incomplete          questionnaires          Table summarizes their selfreported behaviors The          intervention and control groups did not differ          significantly in selfreport of frequency of literature          searches  and  respectively satisfaction with          quality of results  and  respectively and          satisfaction with speed of searching  and           respectively                          B  study          Of  thirdyear medical students in the second          trial   students completed the questionnaire of          which   of  students had completed their          medicine clerkship and   of  students had not          Of the students with missing results  were on one          rotation that we could not access during the survey          period These  students had been randomly assigned to a          sequence of rotations that placed both their Internal          Medicine and Family Medicine rotations in the latter part          of the year and thus the control group contains more          missing data          Similar to the results of the first study there were          no significant differences in selfreported habits          between the two groups We detected an insignificant          trend for control group students to search more and be          more satisfied with quality and speed of their          searches          Lastly we stratified the analysis by whether students          had received both courses one course or no course No          combined impact was detected on frequency of searching or          satisfaction with searching The only significant finding          was selfreport of being influenced by a literature          search MantelHaenszel analysis confirmed that this          effect was attributable to the Family Medicine course          even though the Family Medicine course was not associated          with increased search frequency                          Comparing the two studies          Among all students the selfreport of frequent          searching and satisfaction with results significantly          increased from the  to the  study          Table  Searching once a week or more increased from           of all students in the first study to  of all          students in the second study Students were more          satisfied with their results  than with speed           of their searches Satisfaction with speed of searches          did not increase                          Power analysis          In the  study the intervention group was          smaller  students In the  study the          control group was smaller  students Both studies had          approximately an  chance of detecting a  absolute          difference between the intervention and control groups                       There were  nonresponders in the  study          Among these students if all  students in the          intervention groups and none of the  control group          students had actually become frequent searchers the          prevalence of frequent searchers would have been  and           respectively This result and a similar reanalysis          of the  would have been statistically          significant                            Discussion        Neither of the two Internal Medicine courses nor the         Internal Medicine course in conjunction with the        Family Medicine course increased the selfreport of search        frequency Despite teaching both searching for and        appraising evidence our results are consistent with the        negative impact of journal clubs      Possibly        students lack time to search for evidence In both study        years students were less satisfied with the speed of their        searches than the results of their searches        Although all students reported increased searching and        satisfaction with in  our courses had no impact        In addition it is doubtful that the SUMSearch  Internet        site which was taught only to the intervention students        but available to all students was responsible Search        frequency increased more in the control than the        intervention groups  and  respectively Search        frequency increased most in  when the control        group again reported more frequent searching than the        intervention group  and  respectively Although        search frequency increased the quality of students        medical searches was unclear Other studies have reported        the apparent satisfaction of novice searchers with searches        of uncertain quality      Moreover clinicians        demonstrated satisfaction with their searches even though        librarians who later replicated the searches found twice        as many relevant studies and half as many irrelevant        studies            Our power analysis reveals that we might have missed a        positive result if all nonresponders had answered in a way        to favor an intervention effect However we believe that        nonresponse more likely indicated reluctance to report        infrequent literature searching In the second study        logistical reasons prevented us from surveying all         students on one rotation in the control study In the first        study all students were surveyed in one large room at the        same time however fewer students in the intervention        group completed their questionnaire We believe that        students who adopted our teachings and became frequent        searchers after our course were unlikely to sit in the room        and not complete the questionnaire Therefore we believe        that having better response rates would not reveal a        positive effect but rather would make the results even        more negative in the first study        Published recommendations vary on how to best search for        evidence in order to practice evidencebased medicine        First some authors recommend using Best Evidence at the        beginning of a search     We taught the use of Best        Evidence during the first trial Table  but not during        the second study since we had informally observed that Best        Evidence less often provided answers Second others        encourage searching of the Cochrane Library We        discontinued teaching this strategy before our studies        because the Cochrane Library addresses only selected        therapeutic questions Instead we taught the use of the        Internet site of the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of        Effectiveness DARE DARE contains succinct summaries of        Cochrane reviews and high quality systematic reviews from        other sources that address diagnostic and therapeutic        questions We also recommended searching MEDLINE for        additional systematic reviews and the National Guidelines        Clearinghouse for selected practice guidelines based on        systematic literature review eg United States        Preventive Services Task Force and Canadian Task Force for        Preventive Health Care Third some experts advocate not        searching MEDLINE due to the difficulties in searching it            Because very recently published original studies may        not be included in systematic reviews or secondary        publications we taught and automated with SUMSearch the        use of PubMed to search MEDLINE and PreMEDLINE for recent        studies Neither our intervention that taught and automated        one strategy    nor the intervention by Family        Medicine which recommended another strategy using Best        Evidence and the Cochrane Library     influenced        search frequency or satisfaction        We propose two explanations for why our interventions        failed First students lacked sufficient time to seek        evidence Studies suggest that a wide gap exists between        the  minutes clinicians typically allot to seeking        evidence    and the amount of time needed to search        MEDLINE       Indeed some have likened MEDLINE        searching to attempting to drink water from a fire hose            Although MEDLINE is certainly more difficult to        search than other resources recommended for evidencebased        medicine the other resources in aggregate probably        require excessive time to search if they are searched in        sequence as recommended Even though SUMSearch automated        searching of MEDLINE and other resources for evidencebased        medicine generally students were dissatisfied with the        speed of searches Table         Second our search strategy like the other existing        search strategies requires clinicians to spend time        comparing and contrasting individual documents All        strategies recommend starting a search by seeking        individual documents whether the document is a study a        secondary publication of a single study or a systematic        review Although efficient when a recent welldone        systematic review captures all the relevant studies this        strategy is burdensome when the results of trials or        systematic reviews are contradictory or when original        studies have been published since the last systematic        review To be sure a single study may not adequately        address a clinical question             Admittedly our course might have increased search        frequency by students if the instruction had been        integrated across all the clerkships and linked to        students clinical duties However even with course        improvements we might have achieved success in teaching a        technique that is too cumbersome to use during clinical        care That is the technique may require more time than        students will have when they enter practice        Further research and development of more efficient        strategies for seeking medical evidence are needed Haynes        recently questioned Is it time to change how you seek        best evidence and proposed that we first seek evidence in        resources such as UpToDate Scientific American or        Clinical Evidence     These systematic textbooks        contain summaries of medical evidence are reliably        updated and are wellreferenced with links to the        abstracts of references Our negative study supports this        idea as it may reduce the need to search for and appraise        individual studies and systematic reviews Thus a proposed        strategy is to search a systematic textbook first and then        use an automated metasearch engine to seek evidence        published since the literature search of the systematic        textbook However research is needed to assess the        validity of the content of systematic textbooks In        addition research is needed to quantify how up to date are        these resources                    Conclusion        Exposure to two courses within one academic year and the        use of automated searching did not increase students        selfreport of frequency of seeking medical evidence While        we recognize the importance of students understanding how        medical evidence is found and appraised we are concerned        that students lack the time to search for original research        and will have even less time when they enter medical        practice We encourage innovations in evidencebased        medicine that will reduce the time needed to search for        medical evidence        The two trials in this report were separately reported        at the American Association
