  Were Oedipus alive today he might offer the samesolution to the riddle  But he would indeed be feigningnavet to claim that generic man is now understood toinclude woman  Even the most casual observers of socialmovements and language changes are conscious of whatsome might call the crusade for nonsexist languageCareful feminist writers avoid unthinking use of imageryredolent of colonialism and militarism  Though the SenecaFalls convention of  noted and deplored the silenceabout women in the Declaration of Independenceand though nonfeminists have worked toward removingsexism from English most current activity stems fromthe womens movement that began in the s            Feminists concerned about language relentlesslyreveal languages capacity to discriminate againstwomen or to render

anatomically determined language is fashionableMankind tacitly imposes male values on all ofhumanity manhours denies womens work as a measuremanpower effaces women  So too feministslobby for genderneutral terms when appropriate  Afamiliar example reasoning that in terms of job dutiesthe sex or gender of the person who passes peanuts onan airplane is unimportant editors of the Handbook ofNonsexist Language propose flight attendant ratherthan stewardstewardess and oppose gratuitous regenderingof job titles  female flight attendant   Acourt case notes a male purser and a female stewardesswith identical job descriptions but different salaryscales  Similarly feminists discourage titles that identifywomens but not mens marital status thoughmany users mistakenly assume Ms  a

grace and style admittedly frequent victimsof inclusion of the feminine pronoun  More subtleand less readily articulated objections probably existBut few proponents of nonsexist language areignorant of the claims of etymology of custom ofaesthetics or even of the inappropriateness of genderneutralterms in a nongender neutral world  For themas for most feminists political considerations are primaryThis explains support of herstory or wimminterms that finesse etymology to emphasize themaleorientation of conventional history and to eliminatethe man in the word woman   When etymologyserves political concerns etymology is honored  For exampleone writer cites a preference for cunt over vagina because of the latters derivation from a Latinword meaning sheath often sheath for a sword  Thefeminist position recognizes the power of languageLanguage is viewed not only as the product but theshaper of culture and as such is able to perpetuate ordiscourage discrimination or oppression  In

tokenismfew feminists think the cause won  Attitudes towardwomen often assumed to be natural and hence sacredare not easily changed  Nonsexist language is no universalantidote  But most feminists even recognizingthe influence of preverbal and nonverbal forces andvarious sexist institutions see acceptance of sexist languageas an insidious poison            This retreading of English this adjusting

philosophically and thoughthis is relatively unimportant the least attractive  Afamiliar but irrelevant complaint against feminists isthat they lack charm as though an unappealing stylenegates the

itGenerally antielitist and antiauthoritarian by declarationfeminist alterers of language find themselvescorralled with prescriptive grammarians and linguists            The issue of nonsexist language envisions men andwomen as subject or object of language  Yet this isbut one aspect of gender and linguistics a subject thathas its own conferences bibliographies and collegecourses  As literary critics feminists look not only atimages of women in literature but at women as writersand readers  So those interested in language look atwomen not only as writers and readers but also asspeakers and listeners  Such inquiry is less direct andmore exploratory than nonsexist language promotionbut is no less political  Some theorists describe womensrelation to language as primarily a product of patriarchaloppression others usually acknowledging oppressionfocus on womens strengths            Most investigators feminist and nonfeminist alikeagree that womens vernacular differs from

norms suggestwomens repression  Their conservatism  Theirupward mobility  What attitude should feminists taketo womens suggested more frequent use of tag endingsIts a nice day isnt it  Well vote Democraticwont we  Identified by early feminist linguist RobinLakoff womens frequent use of tag endings has beenboth discounted by some but not all empirical studiesand reexamined by other studies that distinguish differentkinds of tag endings used by men and womenThose feminists who emphasize success within theworld as we know it tend to encourage women topurge their speech of tag endings and to retrain themselvesto speak in what is perceived as a more masculinemore assertive way  Others emphasizing womensparticular values urge retention of this and other featuresof womens talk for example women frequentlyassume noncompetitive roles in conversation suggestingthat womens talk encourages participation andthe likelihood of consensus            Such analyses of language pass as traditional inform if not in content  They echo the old questionposed regularly by missionaries anthropologists andlinguists as to whether women speak or chatter aword used only for females and nonhumans a differentlanguage a dialect a genderlect with each otherand with men whether they can do or should speakwhat the title of Dale Spenders book calls Man MadeLanguage   The answers often appear in measured academicprose  When offered by feminists the answersfrequently appear in a style that is marked by wordplay dependent on written forms a style that is unconventionalmannered at its best witty a style thatsuggests alternatives to those styles that feministswould designate maleinfluenced  For it is no praisefor most feminists to be included within the best acceptedfor which read maleendorsed

questioningof it is energized by the work of French feministsand is displayed in the verbal acrobatics of radicalfeminist theologian Mary Daly  For example Dalydescribes the title of one of her early

Nonsexist Word Finder            The subject of nonsexist language is a matter ofgenuine concern not only to women see page  of thisissue but to everyone  It ill behooves us to be unfair toany segment of the population and it is not only immoralbut illegal to discriminate against people onvirtually any basis  In recent decades certain changeshave taken place in the language that reflect voluntarychoices of the words used to characterize people thesehave focused largely on the conscious and conscientioussubstitution of neutral sexless words like individualsperson  and people for terms that normally denoteonly males  Journalists and other commentators havesometimes taken a facetious view of the situation suggestingthat person  itself is sexist because son denotesmale offspring that words like manhole are sexistand that even woman  wo  man  is sexist  By thistime the humor if there was any there to begin withhas worn very thin indeed and the end of it would bewelcome  Then too there have been the campaignerswho have gone to what some regard as opposite extremesif the head of a committee is known to be aman or a woman then chairman or chairwoman mustsurely be the proper denotation if the sex of the personis not known then chairperson  though awkwardsoundingis the preferred form  But it is patently ridiculousto refer to someone whose sex is known as achairperson   Chair should be reserved for the office ofthe chairperson not the person holding the office  Yetmany prefer chair to chairperson on the grounds ofbrevity and because it avoids the awkwardness of thelonger alternative  Miller and Swift MS treat thisproblem and seem to believe that it has been solvedThe lexicographer Alma Graham points out thatchair has been recognized in the sense of the occupantof the chair  as invested with its dignitysince the seventeenth century just as theCrown has been used for the monarch or the OvalOffice has come to stand for the President of theUnited States  Address your remarks to the chairillustrates metonymy a figure of speech in whichsomething is called by the name of something elseassociated with it  Nobody understands an injunctionto address the chair as an order to talk to apiece of furniture  pp                         The final sentence is about as valid as would be thecomment that nobody understands such an injunctionas an order to write the address of the chairperson on adozen envelopes either  But there are other speciousarguments in the above statement              Recognized   By whom  The fact that Grahamhas found that citations for such usage exist how oldthey may be is of little consequence is not to be construedas evidence that they necessarily existed insufficient profusion to warrant acceptance by the Englishspeakingpopulations  Moreover what are the contextsin which the citations were found  There aremany difficulties inherent in adducing citational evidenceunsupported by frequency  There are manyother instances of the misuses of citational evidencenot only by users of dictionaries but by lexicographersthemselves there is no way using the citational materialsat present appearing in dictionaries as prima facieevidence that one would be justified in assuming thata broad statistical segment of English speakers isthereby represented even the most cursory examinationof entries in the OED which I assume to be thesource of Grahams information will rapidly ineluctablylead the observer to realize thata  the evidence in the published work is quite thinandb  the conclusions drawn by the OEDs definersand commentators often cannot be supported bycitational evidenceat least not the citationalevidence that appears in the published work                          That chair is used metonymically in the sameway as the Crown and the Oval Office is true but torefer to the office not to the person occupying itCertainly in the case of the Crown  as ample evidencewill show reference is so made specifically to avoidmentioning a particular regent and not as a figure ofspeech employed for rhetorical effect  As for the OvalOffice  it is mostly used when the referent is authorityof the executive branch of the government to avoididentifying the incumbent president personally andto indicate official policy  In both cases the point isexactly opposite that identified by Graham it is theposition institution authority etc being referred toand not the occupant  By the same token when peopleaddress the chair  they address the office whoevermight hold it and not the incumbent individual            I find little to dispute with MS in the matter ofprinciple  But there are two elements of their argumentthat merit further comment  The first is that Ifind their interpretation of the evidence often skewedthe second is that while adjustment to lexicon whichthey have always strongly advocated is one thingmodification of grammar is another            In referring to an item in The New York Times inwhich youth is used to refer to a young woman MSwriteThough the term may once have been anomalouswhen used of a young woman today it is a recognizedcommongender noun and the next round ofdictionaries will no doubt add their authority tothe change  p                         The First Edition of The Random House Dictionary ofthe English Language lists youth with a definition ayoung person esp a young man the Second Editionpublished after the MS Handbook and presumablyin the next round they refer to defines the word asa young person esp a young man or male adolescentThus the evidence at the RHD offices indicatedthe need for reinforcement of the notion of malenessassociated with the word not as MS suggest a trendtoward epicenism  I am not entirely in agreement withthe RHD treatment for personally I believe thatyouth has lately appeared more and more often incontext like youth center youth rehabilitation  etcwhere the context is clearly commongender and theforegoing is merely set out as a warning to those whotry to predict what lexicographers are likely to do  Onthe other hand I do not have the hard evidence athand and assume that the RHD does            The following appears in bold italics on page To go on using in its former sense a word whosemeaning has changed is counterproductive  Thepoint is not that we should recognize semanticchange but that in order to be precise in order tobe understood we must                        I am not sure that I should have characterized theperpetuation of obsolete or archaic meanings as counterproductiveperhaps wrong misleading ambiguousor oldfashioned would have been closer tothe mark phrased another way I must agree that peopleought to use words in their current senses if theyexpect to be understood  Most do of course use themthat way  When will people learn that dictionaries arenot the product of the collective imaginations of thosewho prepare them or the manifestations of the dreamsof a single lexicographer but the result of lengthypainstaking research to determine how the language isbeing used the analysis and codification of the resultsand then their organization into a usable referencesource  What is counterproductive is the notion thatspeakers of a language have to recognize semanticchange they dont recognize it they create it  Ofcourse if a researcher tampers with the evidencemaking a unilateral unsupported claim or assumptionthat a word means something that it does not thenthat does not constitute semantic change it is what isknown as dirty work at the crossroads and MS areindulging in a bit of mischief by suggesting that semanticchange either has taken place or is taking placebecause they have some evidence that a certain changein usage had crept in  Notwithstanding the unfortunatefact that the gathering and assessment of citationalevidence is not what it should or might be Ishould still put my money on professional lexicographersand their resources rather than on MS            In Chapter   Man as a False Generic MSquestion whether the definitions  the creatureHomo sapiens  at the highest level of animal developmentcharacterized esp by a highly developed brain              the human race mankind  from the College Edition of the RHD  are still fully operativeor whether the first limited meaning an adult maleperson as distinguished from a boy or woman hasin effect become the only valid one in modern EnglishI trust that this is a fillip of propaganda and nota serious query  To be sure it is the most commonmeaning which is why it is listed first  But one mustcontend not only with the way the word might be usedtoday but with the evidence of centuries of culturereflected in billions upon billions upon billions ofwords of text all of which shape the way we think andspeak  There is nothing wrong with trying to changethat shape and advocates of nonsexist English haveworked miracles in the short time since they have succeededin making their concerns known  But to denythat the oblique senses of man are still very much withus is mere optimistic folly  And there is no gainsayingthe fact that the first sense of man male humantends to contaminate if that is the right word theoblique senses  But grammar enters the picture heretoo and dictionaries are remiss in syntactic descriptionof how the language works in comparison with whatits words mean how they are spelled and pronouncedand where they came from  To put it differently it isnot yet the function of the dictionary to show thatarticles definite or indefinite are not usually foundpreceding man in senses  and  but are invariablypresent before sense  uses  No normal speaker of Englishencountering Man wants but little here belowwondersexcept facetiouslywhy women have beenignored  More likely they read wants as meaningdesires rather than lacks but that might well be adeliberate facetious ambiguity  We use terms like NeanderthalMan Peking Man  etc without believingfor a moment that there were no Neanderthal or Pekingwomen leaving aside Peking Toms  Cartoonistsmight depict a child asking a parent about Neanderthalwomen but that is recognizably a joke that dependsfor its humor on the characterization of thequestioner as a fool that it is a child is irrelevant itmight be Edith Bunker  Perhaps the most significantcomment on the failure to distinguish between mangeneric and man male human appears on page When Edith Bunker on the television series Allin the Family quoted Sam Walter FosssLet me live in my house by the side of theroadAnd be a friend of manArchies response was Yeah I heard about themkind of houses in the army                        Is it possible that MS are serious in invoking ArchieBunker the archbigot of all time as a model of understandingand a paragon of modern English usageThere are many thousands of such jokes in every languagefor they depend for their humor on polysemy orhomonymy which exists in all languages  Yet thisnonsense is compoundedLexicographers appear to agree  Although theydo not label the supposedly generic meaning ofman obsolete they write some definitions asthough we all know it is  For example WebstersNinth New Collegiate Dictionary  defines amanabouttown as a wordly and socially activeman  But if man sometimes means any humanbeing should not the definition of manabouttownread a wordly and socially active person ofthe male sex  How can the definers be sure wewill know without being told that a manabouttownis never a woman  p                         On the face of it one might dismiss this question asjust so much rubbish and wonder how people of theintelligence of MS could possibly have come to frameit  The answer has nothing to do with their causehowever but with the simple fact that dictionaries arenot exercises in biunique substitutability in otherwords if one of the senses of run is operate as in Sheruns an engine factory  that does not make it valid toassume that one can substitute operate for run in Werun in the marathon every year   Although recognizingthis as a shortcoming of dictionaries and assigning itarbitrarily to what for lack of a better term we mightcall the genius of the language might seem trivial tothe casual observer it is a valid matter for concern inthe realm of lexicology  Using it to bolster an argumentis plainly a mistake  Unfortunately the mistake is compoundedand perpetuated by dragging in expressionslike man in the street the average working man  andothers and as a result the entire argument degeneratesPerhaps we ought to be saying street person forthe first and working stiff for the second but the firsthas been preempted and it seems a little incongruousto find anyone actively seeking to be called a stiff            There are actually two things at work in theHandbook  one is a genuine concern when a generalizedstatement about people is to be made about beingunfair to women through the use of referenceswhich though denotatively neutral carry the strongscent of maleness  That is if you are going to saysomething about people then avoid using the wordman for example because regardless of the ancillarydefinitions one might find in the dictionary in its mostcommon meaning and use it denotes male and thestrong connotations of that denotation are carried overto all other applications of the word it is not in factas neutral as some believe it to be  If that is what MSmean why dont they just say so  The other thing isthat generalized statements employing reference tomales constitute a notsosubtle form of propagandainterpretable either as promale antifemale or both            A third possibility though naturally not treatedby MS is outandout misanthropy vs misogyny forthe notion of simple manhating should not be ruledout entirely  As a male reader I get strong vibrationsfrom this book that the authors advocate the paranoidview that everything in the language that is not exactlyas they would like it to be is the result of a gigantichate program against women  In that context one isgiven to wonder about the circumstances in languagesthat have grammatical not sex gender            The remainder of Chapter  is mainly a catalogueof misinterpretations aberrations and plain errors regardingthe use of man as a generic  A number ofexcellent suggestions to help people avoid the inadvertentexpression of prejudice are offered albeit interspersedamong excoriating castigatory comments thatare entirely irrelevant to The Cause hence diminishthe impact and strength of purpose of both  It is indeeda pity that the authors persist in expressing theirideas as they do for were they more practical and notso aggressively allinclusive in their condemnation ofthe slightest hint of maleness they would probablyserve their cause more successfully            Curiously British English of all things has provideda solution of sorts to the perennial ancillaryproblem of the neutral he  as the pronoun of referencein the language  In British English it is no longerconsidered a solecism to use the plurals they theirthem theirs as a generalized pronoun for words likeeyeryone everybody anyone anybody  etc  Thus ithas become standard British English to say or writeEveryone can get their copy at the bookshop Everybodyshould make certain to take their own coat  etc  Idont know about Canada Australia etc but in theUS this kind of referent usage is considered a heinousilliteracy by those who consider such matters andthose who wish to appear educated would be wise toavoid it  It scarcely needs pointing out that the Britishusage was not brought about by any sense of justicetoward women but by the apparent fact that the peoplein Britain are not quite as uptight about usage asthe Americans  The second chapter of the Handbook isdevoted in its entirety to The Pronoun Problem mercifullyconcluding with the expression of some doubtthat an artificial generic pronoun like hir thon per and other abominations is likely to take hold            Chapter  Generalizations treats with goodsense methods that can be employed to avoid sexism ina wide variety of constructions  Alas MS continue totake up the cudgel carping against writing which insome cases antedates recognition of a problem it islike nattering on about how awful the Romans werebecause they condoned slavery rather a waste ofspace time and motion Wot  Much that might havebeen offered with sober good advice here is contaminatedby an obsessive concern with the identificationof the sex of the perpetrator of past injustices  Theapproach is vindictive and castigatory  Other libertarianmovements advocate similar policies it is notenough that wrongs be righted the discrimination andother injustices suffered by past generations backthrough the ages must be avenged and the descendantsof those responsible must be made to pay forthose crimes and somehow to compensate the descendantsof the sufferers  Such policies are not onlyasinine they areand here I have found another appropriateplace for the buzz word of the decadecounterproductive the energies expended on vengeanceare entirely wasted and should be channeled tochanging the present system to ensure that they are notcontinued  Although we continue to track downcriminals who did their dirt in WWII we do businesswith and carry on other normal relations with thedescendants of the Nazis and of those who bombedPearl Harbor  The sins of our forebears should not bevisited upon us  In the same way those who supportequal rights for women would be well advised to concentrateon the issues at hand and not contaminatetheir cause with trivia like whether Romeo and Julietor Antony and Cleopatra ought to have the order ofthe names reversed in oddnumbered years so thatwomen get top billing  While that has not been literallyproposed as far as I know the fact that the mensnames appear first has been used by some feminists toillustrate the manifestation of an attitude that womenhave had to put up with all these centuries            Seeing Women and Girls as People Chapter settles down to some good advice describing whatmight be offensive to women and how to get around itthrough paraphrase  MS also go out of their way topraise usages that neatly sidestep offensive usage  Specificcliches working wife working mother housewife etcare discussed with sober explanations ofwhy they are offensive and with suggestions for suitablealternatives            Chapter  covers Parallel Treatment quite properlybearing down on descriptions in which a manand his petite blonde wife appear  They go too farthough when they attack I lost my job in place ofThey fired me on the grounds that such phrasingcontributes to the harmful stereotype of woman asvictim   What unmitigated nonsense  Men say thattoo of course  To be fair MS also criticize identificationsmainly from news stories of women as motherof five and other gratuitous characterizations that arenot only irrelevant to the items newsworthiness but arerarely offered about men            Chapter  discusses under A Few More Words anumber of suffixes  trix ess  etc and words  heroheroine alumnusalumnaalumnialumnae  etc thatapparently offend the authors they campaign for theelimination of la diffrence   My own attitude is that Ifind such terms not in the least denigrating Whyshould a woman object to being called a heroine adivorce or an actress any more than being called afemale or a woman  I see the rather boring pointabout using alumni to cover both men and womenand I quite agree that the use of relatively newer andless widely used terms like authoress aviatrix  andpoetess seems to be a deliberate unwarranted attemptto identify someone as a female but a graduate of thefeminine gender is a woman graduate  alumna  thefirst woman dancer in a ballet company is a primaballerina Ive never heard of a prime ballerino anda woman opera star is a diva or prima donna   Ihesitate to point out that we use prima donna of mentoo because my critics will say that they disapprove ofthe terms second life as designating a temperamentalperson of either sex  These of course are loanwordsborrowed from languages that have or had grammaticalgender  The same is true of heroine and thousandsof other words  What are we to do  The answer is notclear unless we accept a policy of drawing up a verylong list of taboo words  A short list is not impossiblefor it would join words like nigger kike mackerelsnapper and others            The book concludes with A Brief Thesauruswhich lists a few offending words and their suggestedalternatives  If this were indeed to have been a handbook users would have found a longer list more usefulThere follows a desexing section on maxims for Hewho laughs last laughs best read The last laugh is thebest not only does it not say the same thing but thesecond is totally

the book is an AZ listing ofwords that are for the most part sexist but as theauthor sets forth in the Users Guide Some words areincluded here because they are ambiguous Is a bellydancer always a woman  Is a Canadian Mountie alwaysa man  Odd question that I had to phone theCanadian consulate to find out that there have beenfemale Mounties since  though one might questiontheir approval of being so designated  As for bellydancers not only have I never heard of a male bellydancer but find the very idea more exotic than eroticPut on what in the military they like to call a needtoknowbasis then why not distinguish betweenbelly dancer and belly danseuse though I daresaythe author Rosalie Maggio would scarcely approve ofdanseuse   Put another way are not these very questionssexist  In one sense they are but if people were topay hard cash to watch a belly dancer only to find thatit was a man I think they might have some justificationin asking for their money back  I would feel thesame way if I paid to see the Rockettes only find thatthey were Rockets  There would probably be littlechance of a refund if the place were run by a feminist            Is a mens room attendant always a man  Anyman who has traveled in Europe knows the answer tobe No            The entries themselves are more or less helpfuldepending on the information one is seeking  Thetreatment ranges from an

 This dictionarylists alternatives for many of these expressions notso that they can be removed from the languagebut so that you can attempt to balance your writingand speaking with both female and

as might be expected Maggiosalternatives and equivalents are phrasal definitionswhich if assiduously applied would effectively sterilizeall writing  The interesting and useful entries arethose in which the author explains without the freneticanguish that pervades the MS book why theterm is offensive  I cannot say that I agree with everythingshe says nor with every item selected for inclusionbut on the whole the book comes off as a verygood treatment of the subject            Such books are an education  Were I in a positionsayas editor of a newspaperin which I wasresponsible for treating the kinds of subjects that mightbe construed as sensitive to antiwoman prejudice Ishould find The Nonsexist Word Finder the sanest ofthe lot and the easiest to understand and use  Comparedwith The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing  itcovers much more territory and readers are made tofeel that the author is cueing them in to the informationshe thinks they ought to have  The Handbook is apolemical work despite its title it is not organized theway a handbook for writers editors etc normallywould be  It might have been more useful as a handbookhad it cleaved more closely to the structuralmodel of standard style manuals  My greatest objectionto it is its argumentative disputatious tone whichfrequently borders on the vituperative  It is as if youlooked up say inferimply in a

       Britain and North America are not only literatebut dictionarate  In Britain the dictionaryssuccess is shown by the fact that more than  percentof households possess at least one making the dictionaryfar more popular than cookery books about percent and indeed significantly more widespreadthan the Bible which was to be found in  percent ofhouseholds in England in  according to the BibleSociety  In North America It was established someyears ago that there are more dictionaries than televisionsets  Preface American Heritage IllustratedEncyclopedic Dictionary              So you dear reader probably own a dictionaryBut how big is it  Let us consider two recent Britishdictionaries  The Collins COBUILD English LanguageDictionary of   Cobuild  boasts xxiv plus pages  The Collins English Dictionary of  CED  has xxvii plus   Looking at these figures orat the books themselves one would assume that thetwo dictionaries are of roughly the same size  And inone sense they are  But between water and watt thereare fiftyfour main entries in Cobuild and  in CED They share such entries as water biscuit and waterworks But in addition CED alone enters water measurera bug Watford a town north of Londonetc  On the other hand the shared main entry forwatershed has twentythree words in CED but  inCobuild   And the word waterless is a main entryin Cobuild  explained in twenty words whereas inCED it is naught but a socalled undefined runonmerelymentioned but not explained explicitlyas a subentry at water   So CED enters more itemsthan Cobuild  but devotes less space to explainingthem  And that is probably as it should be CED isintended for the adult native speaker of English whosemain concern is with understanding a large number ofunfamiliar items including proper names encounteredin reading and listening  Cobuild is intended forthe foreign learner of English whose dual concern iswith understanding and using the core vocabulary ofEnglish and who having achieved that aim cangraduate to a dictionary for native speakerslikeCED             More generally the size of a dictionary is a functionof two variables the number of items entered itsmacrostructure and the amount of informationgiven about them its microstructure  In CharlesMcGregors words a dictionary that says a lot about alittle and one that says a little about a lot can endup roughly the same size  Cobuild and CED are farfrom being such polar opposites but they exemplifythis general point            In measuring dictionaries how far can we rely onthe dictionaries own estimates of their size  Let usconsider the dustjacket blurbs of Cobuild CED  andtwo other nativespeaker dictionaries the BritishLongman Dictionary of the English Language Longman  and the American Websters Ninth NewCollegiate Dictionary  W    Here is what theysay Cobuild   over  referencesCED        referencesLongman   Over  definitions and                        more than  headwordsW        Almost  entries and                         definitions                        Both Longman and W estimate their macrostructure headwordsentries  and their microstructure  definitions But what of Cobuild and CED   What do theymean by references   In CED the relevant definition ofreference seems to be a book or passage referred to orperhaps a mention or allusion in Cobuild  somethingsuch as a number or name that tells you whereyou can obtain the information that you want for examplefrom a book list or map  We are none thewiser  It is only from an article about CED that welearn it has  entries which suggests that Collinsmeans by references what MerriamWebster means byentries   But CED and Cobuild certainly do not say so            And what about Longmans headwords   Theirrelevant definition of headword is a word or termplaced at the beginning eg of a chapter or an entryin a dictionary  Does that mean that the number ofheadwords equals the number of entries  And thattherefore Longmans macrostructure number of entries is much smaller than that of W or CED   Weneed to look more closely at the meaning of entry             For entry our four dictionaries have this to say intheir relevant definitionsCobuild a short article about someone or somethingin a dictionary or encyclopediaCED an item recorded as in a diary dictionaryor accountLongman a dictionary headword  often togetherwith its definitionW b   HEADWORD  a headwordwith its definition or identification  VOCABULARYENTRY                                       Ws relevant definition of headword does noteven mention dictionaries a word or term placed atthe beginning as of a chapter or an entry in an encyclopediaBut its definition of vocabulary entry isabout dictionaries onlya word as the noun book hyphened or open compoundas

the book run onat its base word and usu set in a type as boldfacereadily distinguishable from that of the lightfacerunning text which defines explains or identifiesthe entry                        If we can sort out all the details hereno meantaskit emerges that W s vocabulary entries includeboth what I earlier called main entries like watershed and what I called subentries like waterless inCED   But it appears that Longmans headwords areonly those that are or introduce main entries  So westill have no way of knowing whether Longmans macrostructureis smaller or larger than W s  Nor do ourtroubles end here  For in its Explanatory Notes pW not only calls our attention to the definition ofvocabulary entry in this book but also introduces usto a wholly new notion that of dictionary entry The term dictionary entry includes all vocabularyentries as well as all boldface entries in the separatesections of the back matter headedAbbreviations and Symbols for ChemicalElements Foreign Words and PhrasesBiographical Names Geographical Namesand Colleges and Universities                        No sooner have we assumed that Ws macrostructureof Almost  entries means vocabulary entries than we must face the possibility that it includessuch other dictionary entries as Harvard U McGillU  and Abilene Christian U   Have they been countedin  We simply do not know  But as a British journalistmight say we should be told  For Ws exemplary precisionin telling us what vocabulary entries and dictionaryentries are is offset by its vagueness aboutwhich type of entry its PRwallahs have counted fortheir blurb            Furthermore our gratitude to Longman and Wfor saying something about the size of their microstructuresis offset by our sorrowful recognition of howlittle they say  Counting definitions is a start  But adefinition can range from a singleword synonym  entryb  HEADWORD to the  words of Ws definitionof vocabulary entry and beyond  And the microstructureof dictionaries includes more than justdefinitions it can embrace examples illustrationssynonym essays usage essays etymologies and allsorts of other information  Everyone talks nowadaysabout making dictionaries userfriendlier  How aboutmaking their publicity buyerfriendlier as well                           Aux armes citoyens   Let us strive to get dictionarypublishers to cry their wares in ways that allow us tocompare them  But citoyens  let us not forget that thevalue of a dictionary resideth not in size alone  Thebest dictionary for me is the one that gives about theword or phrase that puzzles me the information I needat the moment I need it  People have different referenceneeds at different times  The standardization ofthe way dictionaries estimate how much they containneed not and should not entail the standardization ofwhat they contain                              Those who have driven along the New York StateThruway west of Albany encounter a string of townnames that

Europe and in the late thcentury it is everywhere in the world  Its overallinfluence is profound but undiscussed although aspectsof that influence are discussed constantly underheadings like language education standardsliteracy literature science and medicineThere is little that it does not touch being physicallypresent in the architecture of schools psychologicallypresent when we talk and think about what makes uscivilized linguistically present in much of moderncommunication and in what we call educated usageYet is has no name            Let me therefore give it a name the scholarlyguild  The phrase is a reminder of its medieval provenanceits academic focus and its corporate style  Thisguild of scholars is one of the most successful enterprisesin the history of our species  Indeed some of itsthcentury members gave our species the elevatedtitle Homo sapiens  as if thinking of themselves whilelabeling all the birds beasts and bugs in creationThe guild takes many forms now but it retains muchof the Middle Ages of the ecclesiastical Schoolmenwho gathered together in quasimonastic collegesbehind walls that marked them off from the rest of theworld a phenomenon that in England is still calledtown and gown            The men and increasingly the women who haveinherited the mantle of the Schoolmen have no troublerecognizing each other  They live similar lives conductsimilar courses and with similar subventions go tosimilar conferences and give similar papers on everycontinent much as David Lodge describes them inSmall World   They are not as tightly knit as otherfraternities past and present Knights TemplarFreemasons Jesuits Mafia Ancient and Mystical Orderof the Rosy Cross corporate executives of CocaColaor Chrysler or managers of labor unions  Theguilds gentler cohesion and lack of obvious internationalhierarchies have contributed to its marked successand curious anonymity  Its institutions take manyforms and survive under many different politicalregimes  They possess neither a Vatican nor a VicarGeneralto report to and although the guild can attimes be arcane with Latin charters and cappingceremonies by and large its doings are overt and benign            Historically the bulk of the human race has neverknown a classroom let alone a cloister or an ivorytower or met up with teachers empowered by lettersafter their names  Nowadays however there are fewpeople who have not come across colleges and collegegraduates or at the periphery of things been invitedto learn to read and write  That is a physical andsocial measure of the guilds success  Its continuanceseems assured  Working in its favor is a social contractwith a threepart system established in every countryin the worldBottomup progression the young being inductedinto school at an early age and proceedinglevel by level to institutions of ever higher learningstopping off for various reasons at variouslevels usually marked by tests and the distributionof certificates providing a social grade  These processesare often reinforced with such commentsfrom parents and teachers as Youll never get anywherenowadays without a college educationThere are even league tables among nations showingthe percentages of those who stay in the systemlongerTopdown rank an apex of professors and doctorsbuttressed by the holders of college degreesmany of them lowerlevel administrators teachersand researchers within the system  These are inturn surrounded and supported by holders ofschool certificates and other qualifications  Spreadingout from the base of the pyramid are thosewho have less suitably certified educations or noformal education at all people who may havemixed feelings about book learning big wordsfancy degrees eggheads highbrows and absentmindedprofessors as well as the perils ofscholarship science and technology  Within thesystem there are others with similar mixed feelingsbut by and large the system remains intactWe all send our kids to schoolLanguage appropriate to level a basic ability toread and write followed by the capacity to handleabstract usage and at a higher level to be at easewith what Philip Gove in Websters Third calledISV international scientific vocabulary  For Englishthis means a capacity to add the Latinateonto the vernacular then Greek onto the Latinateso that you can eat a hearty breakfast and be cordialafterwards without suffering from cardiac arrestBeyond English entry into the guild maymean acquiring a special language of educationsuch as French in Senegal and English in Kenyabecause many of the worlds tongues are not yetand may not ever be part of the circle of standardizedprint languages in which the work of theguild can be conducted                        You and I gentle reader are accredited membersof the guild  This is demonstrated in a variety of waysa shared literacy and the assumptions and biases thatgo with it an awareness of what books are for consciousnessand use of innumerable cultural allusionsand educated idioms and a relative ease in reading aperiodical called VERBATIM with sections called OBITERDICTA and EPISTOLAE  We are generally capable ofconducting ourselves in the company of others whohave been groupeducated to college level            In school college and university people have forsome six centuries been receiving diplomas and titles toprove that in varying degrees a loaded word theyare educated  Oftener than not use of language establishesmembership and socialcumeducational rank asclearly as any parchment  One of the less pleasantways in which such rank can be pulled is to label thelinguistically less secure illiterate  They too canread and write of course but their solecisms barbarismsand vulgarisms call for rebuke and whatbetter rebuke than to treat them as if they did notbelong at allto condemn them figuratively to theouter darkness of the unlettered  Subtler still is thelabel selfeducated applied to people who have littleformal learning  Thomas Hardy described an extremecase in Jude the Obscure             The scholarly guild has always interested itself inlanguage its standards and usage its literature andclassics its mediumsmedia of manuscript and printits academic apparatus and Latin tags  It places a highvalue on success with such things  Its members havetended to place a lower value on rural and urban dialectpopular culture and folklore  These are only acceptedinto the canon of good usage and literatureafter a long and vigorous rearguard action  Only nowfor example is the soap opera with its enormous socialimpact beginning to be recognized as a fit topicfor academic analysis  Movies and soaps attain respectabilitywhen there are enough papers in learned journalsand theses in bound volumes to elevate them beyondbeing merely popular  It is similar withmembers low on the ladder of rank  Once upon a timethere was a playwright who knew little Latin and lessGreek  Much of his skill was acquired in the hurlyburlyof life but his works had a certain merit  Withthe passage of time he was canonized by the guild andhis Complete Works have been annotated and organizedby folk with doctorates in Shakespearian StudiesHe made it to the top  It can be done but it is rare            The guilds institutions have in their unobtrusivelyubiquitous way become more powerful thanboth the Catholic Christianity which gave them birthand the regimes of Europe that scattered them roundthe world  Their diaspora has been so successful thatmost of us unreflectingly see schools as the naturaldispensers controllers instruments and structures ofeducationand of educated discourseeverywhereon earth  It is another measure of the guilds successthat we can hardly imagine an alternative to it  Theutopian communes of anarchists socialists and hippiesfor example have not even dented it            After centuries of social and cultural directionfrom the guilds leaders the professorial elite the academicscientific and medical establishments it ishardly possible for anyone in the Western or Westernizingworld today to be reckoned or to feel educatedwithout having been to schooland the more schoolthe better  It may be possible to imagine alternativesor significant adaptations if we wish them only afterwe have found the right label for the subject  Societiesseldom see what is central in their own cultures havingmuch less trouble identifying it in the cultures ofothers            Historians have often discussed the three estatesof the Western worldnobility church and commonsMany of us also from time to time talk about afourth estatethe media  The idea of social estatescan be taken one stage further to the global agglomerationof educational and scientific communities  Theyconstitute a fifth estate an entity as worthy of anthropologicalinvestigation as the Yanomama of theAmazon or the Dinka of the Sudan  Unfortunately justas we find it hard to imagine the guild as a whole andto envisage alternatives to it so no organization existsoutside this fifth estate that could investigate it  Anthropologyis one of its own more recent subdivisionsSo who might assess these diplomaed assessors            There appears to be only one solution  A traditionalaim of the guild is the quest for truth  If thataim is sincere and by and large it seems to be thefifth estate may yet turn the bright light of science andscholarship on itself  That would be an interesting day                              Texican            English is a mongrel tongue  It is basically composedof  percent AngloSaxon and  percentRomance including Latin and Greek words  The remaining percent are either invented  laser bogussplurge  or have been borrowed from more than other languages or dialects from Arabic to Zulu  Noother national language even comes close to that  Onereason for this diversity is the custom of Englishspeakingexplorers and pioneers in a new land to adopt thenative name for unfamiliar plants animals andthings  Other cultures do not follow this customWhen the Greeks first saw a huge animal in Egyptthey called it hippopotamus  the Greek word for waterhorse  When the Boers first saw a strange animal inSouth Africa they called it aardvark  a Dutch wordfor earth pig  The English however seeing a largebearlike animal in IndoChina adopted the Nepalesename panda  and a strange water mammal was givenits Javanese name dugong             When two peoples speaking different languagesshare a common border there is an infiltration ofwords from one language to the other  The north borderof the United States is with Canada most of whosepeople share our common English speech  True theofficial language of the province of Quebec is Frenchand true we have borrowed a few words from therelacrosse  for example  But the south border is anothermatter  For more than  years since the Anglos arrivedin Texas there has been a culture transfer backand forth across the Rio Grande  The process is stillgoing on  Fifteen years ago few people north of SanAntonio had heard of burritos fajitas flautas  orchalupas   Today thanks to franchise Mexican restaurantsthey have become a part of Americas vocabularyOther food names that have passed through theTexas pipeline into common usage are chile enchiladataco tamale tortilla frjol frito picantejalapeo nacho mescal tequila  and margarita   Itmay be interesting to note the Spanish borrowed chiletamale mescal  and mesquite from the indigenous Indiansbefore passing them on to us            Let us now pass on to the names of some clothingitems that Texans borrowed and then passed on to therest of the country sombrero mantilla poncho rebozoserape  and huarache   A number of animals andvegetables followed the same route avocado fromaguacate mesquite sapodilla from zapote guayulecoyote armadillo ocelot from ocelote chaparral  andjavalina from jabalina   Since cattle ranching is commonto both sides of the border it should come as nosurprise that there has been an exchange of ranchrelatedwords lariat from la reata bronco lasso fromlazo rodeo chaps from chaparreras charro hackamorefrom jquima mustang from mestengo  andquirt from cuerda or cuarta             Finally there is a miscellaneous group of wordsAlamo  the site of the Texas defeat by Santa Anahoosegow from juzgado court dinero money aSpanish corruption of the Latin denarius macho from the same root as machete  he who wields a machetemust be skillful and powerful hence the wordhas come to mean virile and its associated noun machismo virility  A gringo  from griego Greek is onewhose speech sounds like Greek to me  The story thatit comes from the song Green Grow the Lilacs saidto have been sung at San Jacinto is an example of folketymology  Let us not forget marijuana which is simplyMary Jane in Mexico or cucaracha  the cockroachthat entered English via a popular song            Some time ago Texans picked up a speech habitthat is being acquired by the rest of the country  WhenTexans in particular South Texans want to emphasizea statement they often use a Spanish word  If theywant to be emphatic about a large undertaking theymight say Im going to do it all  The entire thing  Thewhole enchilada   About someone who is in completecharge of a project they could say He runs thingscompletely  Hes the boss  Nmero uno   Then there isnegation I had nothing to do with that  Nothing atall  Nada   And to request confirmation they mightwell say You do it exactly this way  Youd better do itright  Comprende             Texas has contributed a few good words to theEnglish language without any help from Spanish orMexican  During the s a Texas lawyer acquired asmall herd of cattle on Matagorda Island  Because heknew little about

Ajackalope is an imaginary horned rabbit reputedlyinhabiting West Texas            These fifty words that have entered English after abrief sojourn in Texas can be found in almost any dictionaryThat

Democritus theorized that a thing could be dividedand divided until it became so small it could nolonger be divided  The theory was largely shelved fortwo thousand years until several physicists

Robert Chapmans New Dictionary ofAmerican Slang Harper  Row   Also WentworthFlexnerand Chapman both cite the term theleather as meaning a kick but they date the term from citing a passage from Damon

Course Cuthbert            Recently I found in one of those files in which formany years I have been systematically losingthings a magazine clipping from many years agowhich points out that the formal language of a centuryand more past can lead to misunderstandings today  Itoffers a case in point from one of the  volumes of TheLives of the Saints  a massive work written between and  by Sabine BaringGould the English clergyman who is best remembered as theauthor of the hymn Onward Christian SoldiersHere is what he had to say about Saint Cuthbert anEnglish monk who became Bishop of Lindisfarne andwho died in the year No saint of his time or country had more frequentor affectionate intercourse than Cuthbert with thenuns whose numbers and influence were daily increasingamong the Anglosaxons and especially inNorthumberland                        I wasnt quite sure about the clipping so I checked thework itself in our public libraryand thats what itgives  BearingGould a compulsive writer was a manof Victorian delicacy  In one of his novels he mentionedcertain heavilyfrilled cotton investitures of the lowerlimbs and elsewhere referred to the bloomer arrangementin the nether latitude            Anyway this sent me to the big Oxford  where Ifound about a columnandahalf on intercourse   As anoun it was first used of trade dealings between peopleof different localities  Originally spelt entercourse  itcomes from the French entrecours commerce whichis from the Latin intercursus also commerce            Soon it came to denote communion between personsand that which is spiritual or unseen  I vaguelyremember a hymn I heard and perhaps helped singthat contains the phrase intercourse divine            As early as  the word was used with apparentsexual signification by Thomas Malthus the parsonand economist who is remembered for his Essay on thePrinciple of Population An illicit intercourse betweenthe sexes  But that use apparently was rare in thosetimes  I do not know when the word standing alonecame into common use with an explicit sexual senseIn the th century the word was also a verb to runthrough run across  To have intercourse with             Now back to Cuthbert the saint  Ivor Brown inone of his delightful books on words Random Words writes that Cuthbert had been an honoredEnglish name but that somehow during the war it ceased to be a name and became an insult andwas used of slackers who evaded military serviceBrown does not know how that happened  This use ofthe name as a derogatory noun is given in both the Supplements to the OED and in the recent oneSeventytwo churches in Britain were named for CuthbertKirkcudbright Church of Cuthbert the nameof a small former Scottish county and its main town ispronounced

                 Duende XV  may be absent in Italian andFrench as Mr Bria assures us but it is alive andprospering in Portuguese  It has the original meaninga sprite or hobgoblin that plays tricks

obviouslyderived directly from the  nd marker of theactive gerund in Latin which suggests the therapistactive agent rather than the patient            Not so  Mr Delaney is a victim of the confusion sooften experienced by Latin students between the gerundwhich is a neuter noun active in meaning andthe gerundive which is an adjective of similar formbut passive in meaning  Analysand  like several  ndwords in English is derived from the gerundive andso means a person to be analyzed  Similarly reverendmeans one who is to be revered ordinand is onewho is to be ordained an old standby of crosswordcompilers deodand  is a thing to be given to Godand legend is something to be read  We use in theiroriginal Latin forms addenda and corrigenda meaningthings to be addedcorrected            An interesting example of a derivative from thepassive gerundive that has acquired a quasiactivemeaning is reprimand from reprimendus  one who isto be repressed  In the course of its transfer to Englishthrough French it has become a severe or formal rebukeie the act of repressing                              Charles Delaney asks for further examples of onomatoplazia Here are two which misled

amusing example of this kind of semantic confusionwill be found in Chapter XX of Aldous HuxleysCrome Yellow   From boyhood the romantic poeticallyinclined hero Denis Stone found the word carminativeparticularly evocative  It suggested the warmththe rosiness  carmine  of wine and flesh and by associationwith carmencarminis  the idea of singing  Tofind out that it meant able to cure flatulence was thedeath of youth and innoncence  All the same in onerespect Denis was right  The word like charm  isindeed associated with singing and goes back to thetime when men attempted to cure the ills of the fleshby incantation  And to return to Mr Delaney swimminglyis associated with aquatic sports with asmooth gliding movement says OED   No confusionthere I would suggest

winning essay XIV  on Shakespeares extensiveuse of legal language Mr DS Bland makesone error for sure and if I read him rightly yet anotherin the same spot  He refers to those chilling linesat the end of IIIii where Macbeth invokes Nightscover for the intended murder of Banquo  Bland slipsup when he states it is to enable him to proceed onhis path to the murder of Duncan  Your Third Prizenotwithstanding Duncan was murdered several pagesearlier            The serious error is in his apparently thinkingthat MacbethsCancel and tear to pieces that great bondWhich keeps me pale                        relates to night destroying daylight in the sense thatdarkness will cancel the daylights bond whateverthat may be  No the bond here is Banquos lease onlife and his fatherhood with great alluding to thesupernatural powers of the witches especially theThird Witch  It is she who had addressed Macbeth inI ii as that shalt be king hereafter  A few lines latershe confounds him by prophesying that Banquo shallget kings  Macbeth harps on this mystery after thewitches vanish muttering to Banquo in a tone of enviouswonderment Your children shall be kings            In the tyrants mind that great bond really meansBanquoFleance both subject to the bonded prophecyuttered by the Third Witch  The father can beget newoffspring safe from Macbeths hand the son is the palpablethreat  Both their lives must be snuffed out immediatelyor the usurper will remain paralyzed keptpale by that unearthly promise  He views either ofthem as the instrument the bond of his not being ableto pass on the crown to a successor of his choosing orof his subsequent begetting  Yes Night will devourDay but Macbeths significant meaning here is undercover of darknessin reckless defiance of weird authorityhewill have his black agents eliminate thebonded progenitor of Scottish kings along with hisonly progeny  As it turns out Fleance escapes to fulfillthe prophecy of Banquo begetting a line of kingsMacbeths action to have the bond canceled becomesnull and void            True to the terms of the indenture set forth by itsguarantors that great bond will suffer no default                              In answer to Mr Ansons first point I can only saymea culpa   It is the kind of silly slip that we are allguilty of making from time to time  Witness ChesterDelaney XV  who attributes lowing herd to OliverGoldsmith instead of to Thomas Gray            As for Macbeths great bond  this is a crux overwhich commentators have argued for years  Mr Ansonsinterpretation is one that has been advanced beforeand is dealt with for example in Kenneth MuirsArden edition  My own reading of the passage turns asmuch on the word pale as on bond  but the word limitset by the essay competition forced me to be ratherelliptical  Briefly I interpret bond as being implicit inGods first act of creationthe separation of nightfrom day  In praying for its cancellation Macbeth isunwittingly asking that chaos should come again asindeed it does within the world of the tragedy until therestoration of order through Macbeths death and theassumption of the crown by Malcolm            But my main object in choosing the passage was toillustrate the way in which Shakespeare could movefrom the literal to the metaphorical or metaphysical inhis use of a legal term  From that point of view thediffering interpretations Mr Anson and I read into thepassage are of secondary importance                              Henry Henns Me Gook XIV  prompts me toask which Chinese language his Asians

otherdraws ideographs on that palm with a forefinger  Itsa delight to see the smile of recognition when communicationis established                              I found Mr Henry Henns amphigory XIV  onmilitary slang interesting but his explanation of themeaning of Viet is at variance with my information            Let me begin again by making two observationsFirst we must realize there is a difference betweenspoken and written Chinese  Next when looking at aChinese character the symbol can be purely phoneticpurely semantic or a combination of both  Mr Hennknew that the two characters for Vietnam could betranslated individually as extreme and south  Whenhe looks at the map it is obvious that Vietnam is to theextreme south of the Chinese Empire  His misconceptionis thus reinforced            Let us go back in Chinese history to the beginningof the Warring or Contending States Period  At aboutthis time new powers were arising around the old Chineseheartland  Among them the Chin Mr HennsChin  and the Yueh   As explained by Professor Paul WKroll Chairman of the Department of Oriental Languagesand Literature University of Colorado Boulderthis new people called themselves by a name thatwas very similar to the Chinese word for extremeThus in the Chinese spoken language of that time wehave two homophones one meant the Viet people orkingdom the other simply extreme to exceed            When a literate Chinese had to write about thisnew kingdom a problem arose as there was no charactterfor the Viet  The problem was solved simply byusing an already standard character that had a similarsound to what the Viet called themselves            For example the Chinese word for Buddha is usedas the first character for the English word Florida   Letme quote from Professor John DeFranciss The ChineseLanguage Fact and Fantasy p When the Chinese were confronted with the problemof expressing foreign terms and names as happenedon a large scale with the introduction ofBuddhism in the first century AD they did so byfurther extending the use of Chinese characters asphonetic symbols  The word Buddha itself came tobe represented by a character which at one timehad a pronunciation something like biwat andnow after a long process of phonological changeis pronounced f                        It seems the character f is being used phonetically asecond time around in Florida             Let me emphasize by further extending in thequote above  My argument is not that the Chinesepronunciation for Viet is Yueh but that Mr Hennerrs when he translates the Chinese character as extremeThe Chinese character is simply a phonologicalrendering of a Viet word meaning people  The correcttranslation is the Yueh or Viet of the south asopposed to the Yueh who used to be just

much to the recognition of Latinspedagogical value especially as a vocabulary buildersomething both intuitively and statistically known tobe true  The vocabularybuilding argument is apotent one for proponents of Latin education p  Im all for Latin courses but theres an easier wayof building your English vocabulary then plowingthrough the intricacies of Latin morphology and syntaxAll you need is

since many English words andtheir Classical Latin etymonds share little or no meaningClassical Latin can at times hinder rather thanhelp for example Classical Latin conferre has none ofthe presentday
