                                  Bring Out Your Dead             At the end of yet another hour shift just onetask lay between me and blessed sleep threading a central venous catheter frommy fortysomething patients neck into the blood vessels near his heart Bobnot his real name was suffering from liver failure caused by the hepatitis Cvirus hed contracted from shooting heroin with contaminated needles In mostcases an ordinary IV does the job ferrying fluids and medications But Bob wasa tough IV stick A central line was essential            Hands shaking Bob signed a consent form after Ioutlined the risks of the procedurebleeding collapsed lung infection Bobwas all too familiar with the risks of infection thanks to me aninexperienced haggard medical intern A day earlier Bob had been therecipient of my first centralline placement The incision became infectedapotentially deadly complication for Bob because liver damage weakens the immunesystemand I almost had to wheel him into the intensivecare unit            My supervising resident walked me through thecentralline procedure after we gowned up I felt the spot on Bobs throatnestled under muscle where I would pierce the skin and hit the internaljugular vein My fourth jab with a finder needle filled the syringe with areassuring flashback of blood After making certain I hadnt nicked an arteryI inserted a larger needle into the skin just above the first needle After thelarge needles flashback I threaded a long coil into the blood vessel and intothe larger vessels near the heart            Finished we ordered achest Xray to ensure the catheter was sitting in the right location I leftthe hospital relieved But while on rounds  hours laterafter my blessedsleepa nurse told me about the yellowish liquid oozing from Bobs neck nearthe catheter placement I had punctured his thoracic duct a collection of thelymphatic fluid that carries infectionfighting cells throughout the body            When my father began his internship in pediatrics  yearsago most interns had as medical students practiced catheter placement andsurgery on dogs for months in a vivisection laboratory Today thanks toprotests by antivivisectionist groups and a queasy public few medicalstudents practice on animals A  study by the Association of AmericanMedical Colleges found that only  of the nations  medical schoolsrequired vivisection in physiology courses and just eight required it onsurgery rotations            That means that someones grandfather is the firstliving thing most medical interns stick with a needle cut open or sew backup Studies have found that rookie doctors patients suffer no morecomplications than the experienced doctors patients But these studies areflawed Most were either conducted under wellcontrolled circumstances in themost prestigious teaching hospitals or were too small to be statisticallysignificant Also some of these studies dont account for near misscomplications such as Bobs infection and punctured thoracic duct Althoughsuch mishaps may not have longterm effects they do contribute to patientstress I know that Bob would have benefited if I had performed more lineplacementson either dogs or patients            Some hospitals avoid teaching the technique ofcentralline placement by employing teams of nondoctors who specialize in thetask Such teams work well but most hospitals cant afford them Doctorsshould learn the technique themselves especially in case of emergencies            Many medical schoolsoffer computer simulations and other alternatives such as Stan for studentswho refuse to operate on animals Manufactured by Medical EducationTechnologies Inc Stan short for Standard Man is a realistic dummy uponwhich doctors practice resuscitation But despite all the sophisticated medicalmonitors attached to him Stan has his limitations Hell never experience alifethreatening emergency that forces you to work in lessthanidealconditions If you fail Stan his family wont be waiting in the hall for theterrible news And you cant practice centralline placement on him            Doctors take their practice where they can find it LastMarch the Israeli army provoked public outrage when it admitted to using thebodies of dead soldiers to teach complex medical procedures todoctorsintraining The practice was revealed after one fallen soldiersfather himself a doctor noticed an incision on his sons neck His son hadbeen killed in the line of duty and no resuscitation attempt could explain thesurgical wound Evidently the army doctors had long condoned an unwritten ruleallowing medical practice on soldiers whose families had given permission forautopsies But this soldiers family hadnt given autopsy permission            Practicing on dead patients is nothing new InRobin Cooks semiautobiographical book The Year of the Intern the protagonist takes aim with an epinephrinefilled syringe at the still heartof a patient who moments before he had unsuccessfully tried to resuscitateNext he shoves a breathing tube down the dead patients throat Neitherexercise is intended to revive the patient Last year medical student DavidCook wrote in the journal the Pharos about his own experienceobserving as medical students and doctors practiced placing a breathing tubeinto a freshly deceased patient            Exploiting the newly dead sounds ghoulish but themedical establishment rationalizes the practiceat least in privateby sayingthat its better than letting interns fumble on live patients The practice iscommon enough that a medical ethicist didnt raise eyebrows at the hospitalwhere I completed my internship when he surveyed residents about how many hadplaced central lines into comatose or onthevergeofdeath patients Likewisethe Israeli armys chief medical officer responding to the public outragesaid that if authorities ban his doctors from practicing on fallen soldiers itwill be the injured who will suffer            So whats worse defiling cadavers or practicing onpatients or animals My twofold answer even if it makes us all uneasy is toreintroduce vivisection on a limited basis to all medical schools and to allowsurgical practice on the recently dead donated bodies            Each year about  students begin medicalschool in the United States One animal for every four students would mean thesacrifice of  dogs per year Hundreds of dogs are euthanized every dayMight they be used for this purpose before meeting their ends if we make theirdeaths as humane as possible Students who object to animal experimentationshould be allowed to decline but be required to spend extra time with Stan andhis friends            As for human surgical practice we should create asystem akin to organ donation Individuals could give consent on their driverslicenses or when theyre admitted to the hospital We could easily convincefolks of the similarities between donating your body to medical schools fordissection and donating it to hospitals for practice Still there wont beenough dead bodies to go around If we wont sacrifice a few dogs well haveto sacrifice our own comfort and safety a sacrifice most patients or hospitalsdont really want to make            Even though Bob survived my amateur centrallinetechniques Im guessing that he would have preferred a more experiencedintern I know how he feels I rue the day when they strap me down for myinevitable bypass operation As I drift off into unconsciousness the lastthing I want to hear the senior surgeon say to a junior associate is So thisis your first bypass Well the very first step is the incision Cut him thereNo Not there There
