          okay uh i really havent thought about the topic of drug testing but uh just off the top of my head ive i dont think i see much wrong with it um if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had uh coming in uh were trust worthy et cetera and so on i think i would i would uh probably do the random testing just to insure that my company uh runs safely and smoothly   yeah um i i also havent thought too much about it uh but i suspect it it it very much depends upon the job   umhum umhum   maybe there are some jobs where i guess it doesnt really   hum yeah that   i mean its its if if its not affecting someones performance im not sure if its a problem   umhum yeah   if if its a position a a position where it could potentially affect   thats true i didnt think about that like for instance uh if someones working on heavy machinery or uh say driving trucks or buses city buses or something like that   you know if if right   then that is something that affects the affects then affects the community you know if youre if youre drinking or on drugs or whatever youre driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands   that dont right and then if youre a computer operator and uh theres really no big deal i think you know then then then maybe its not     yeah yeah   necessary   yeah for me i think that drug testing just it it follows the path that societys going in if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs   umhum   i mean its just its just where society is right now and you know something we have to cope with and i think the drug testing is something that drug users have to cope with   but yeah well i think it it may i mean that in in in that respect i think it may help a lot i think it may be pushing people away from hopefully push people away from drug use if they know that you know well if you use drugs you wont get this job i mean   umhum yeah yeah i think that may be yeah that may be one of the points of it   yeah   of course i think um im not sure you know what the time span is but i mean if i think if i used drugs last week and i had a you know had a job interview that i wouldnt use drugs the day before or something and they wouldnt even see it you know im saying they cant they may not be able trace dont know how far you trace i dont know what the you know limits are or whatever   yeah i dont know i dont know the uh that that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think i dont i dont actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system ive heard some you know you so some things supposedly stay for six months some stay for less some stay for longer i mean   umhum umhum umhum yeah   they think LSD i guess stay forever in in in some ways i mean if you get flashbacks for uh   hum yeah   forever   oh really hum   i i i guess so   something like that yeah   i mean there must be some some something i mean people people who people get these little little flashback things you know   umhum hum   of some sort so i dont really know   yeah i mean i i dont use any drugs i dont really drink or anything so im pretty uh   uh i guess decisive about that just the fact that you know if since i dont use drugs i have no problem with taking a test   right well the same here actually i dont use drugs at all and i and im at at most a social drinker so its so its never a problem   that just it yeah yeah yeah umhum so the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and uh i mean its kind of the same thing with the lie detector  the lie detector test       if you dont have anything to hide youre not going to mind it   umhum right   you know but for people that you know dont have anything to hide and then there are some things that just arent peoples business you know that they come out at that point so i think a lot of people have trouble with that   right that that that uh thats a fine line to draw   and i can i can understand that umhum umhum   i mean uh that thats really you know do you uh do you worry about you know this or that i mean you know what what what about their rights to privacy well if theyre doing something illegal there they have a private you know like especially in in in the case of drinking you know if someones   yeah umhum right   is something more than a social drinker shall we say yet theyre not an alcoholic what do you do   umhum yeah yeah   so   i mean i i took a lie detector test once and it didnt i didnt mind it but i was just offended by some of the questions i guess i mean there was one question do you like your mother you know i said yes do you hate your mother no have you ever killed your mother       and i was just going you know what in the world   well those are just yeah those it turns out those are just to get a um probably to get some sort of those are to get some shock value out of you or just to see what happens when you get shocked yeah theres uh um i do some im a student graduate student in psychology   is that what it was i just okay   and we sort of you know figure out um i i know a a little bit uh about that kind of stuff and what they try and do there is they want to sort of get base line measures for you you know how is it that when when you see these things and you know and and and they can look at the lines and sort of sort of get an idea   umhum hum umhum so it kind of get kind of get something to measure my responses by i guess   yeah otherwise they have no idea if youre just sort of jumping around and being fidgety and maybe they say that you would sort of it can be shocking and it they want to see how easy it is shock you   yeah umhum yeah they ask that i was going what in the world are you asking me about here you know its just   yeah   but i guess i dont know some people probably have killed their mothers i dont know but           yeah well i guess so i mean i guess i dont i dont what happens actually actually happens if uh   umhum   if you have killed your mother   yeah its like i   you get a big a big jump there you know   yeah   but yeah its i think its their way of seeing how how how well you do in a shock situation without worrying abo ut you know stuff like that so   umhum hum hm okay i never thought about that and that makes me feel a little better  of course that was years and years ago and also i dont   yeah yeah and i dont think that you killed your mother though i wouldnt worry about that     i dont think that some thing i mean there are some people i mean because society a lot of people are taking drugs there is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives but they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever and the stuff that happened to them you know five years ago comes up and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better you know when they might be actually trying to improve their lives you know   umhum yeah thats uh you know it it it it could blow things right away for them you know unless they say well look i mean unless they walk it wont   umhum umhum   im thinking walk in and say look i did do drugs you know a year ago and im off them for a year now and this and that and so if you take if i take ill be happy to take the test but it will show up positive of course i think   umhum umhum yeah yeah i would probably do that and id probably bring something in showing that i had been to such and such hospital for help or you know whatever the twelve month program or whatever it is that that they do   yeah yeah because then i mean then although legally they cant discriminate you i think on the basis but im not sure   umhum   but i dont i dont really know i dont know what the laws are pertaining to this my wife probably does but   yeah yeah im not sure what they are either   i dont i dont of this stuff   but   but yeah its its its its an interesting topic that theyve actually thought about your right in that it doesnt   umhum yeah i the other day we had talked about uh capital punishment   oh i   and i really i really hadnt thought uh thought about it i mean i think about it because i hear about it but i hadnt sit had to sit down and and say well what do i think about it  you know and thats kind of like today im not real sure what i think about it im kind of you know in in the middle on that one   umhum yeah well these these are tough i i sort of like this it makes you think   umhum umhum umhum really really   so i think thats thats real good   umhum okay it was very nice talking to you okay take care byebye   well been nice talking to you too byebye
