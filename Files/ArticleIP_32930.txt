shock a top officialbanker told the paper Although the new structure has not yet been revealedthe IHT reported that the central bank has already said that four ofthe banks would be controlled by Malays who make up slightly more than half ofthe population and two by Chinese Ethnic Chinese make up about a third of thepopulation but control a disproportionately higher percentage of the countryswealth There is no word yet on how current shareholders will be compensatedfor their equity            Thesaga of former Chilean President Gen Augusto Pinochet who has been underhouse arrest in London since October  when a Spanish judge requested hisextradition to face charges there took still more turns this weekend when theSpanish attorney general called on Britain to release Pinochet because theprocedure has taken so long that it is no longer legal Many Spaniardsincluding the judge who originally demanded Pinochets extradition protestedthe move Swiss French and Belgian authorities have also asked that Pinochetbe extradited to their jurisdictions so it is possible that if the Spanishrequest is withdrawn the proceedings will continue with one of those countriesas the petitioner Also the conservative Sunday Telegraph of Londonreported it is possible that Pinochet could face trial in Britain if Spainwithdraws its request In Spain El Pas reported that Chile has tried to persuade the United States tofind an extrajudicial solution to the Pinochet problem perhaps referring thematter to adjudication A surprising editorial Monday in the conservative Spanish daily ABC came out against such asolution It isnt a question of political ideology or of bilateral relationswith a friendly country Its a question of what is or isnt right Spain is afriend of Chile and this matter  is having a negative effect on bilateralrelations But if our country is a friend of Chile it is an even better friendof justice said the paper            Thealarming lead story in Sundays Observerclaimed that Britains BSE mad cow disease epidemic may have been caused bya scientific experiment that went wrong The blunder has cost the country bn billion claimed the lives of  people and triggered fears that thedeath toll could eventually reach several million According to the storyExperts believe that hormones taken from the brains of slaughterhousecarcasses were injected into cows in a bid to create a new breed ofsupercattle But the experiment  backfired The hormones extracted frompituitary glands were transmitted in an agent that spread mad cow disease andeventually infected humans as new variant CreutzfeldtJakob Disease Thereport received little attention in the other serious British papers            Both the Sydney Morning Herald and theAge ofMelbourne gave prominent coverage Monday to aboriginal leaders plans to usethe  Sydney Olympic Games to bring global attention to the plight ofindigenous Australians According to the Age s story an Aboriginal embassy will be set up in Sydney for theduration of the Olympics to lobby visiting VIPs and media This comes aftersuggestions of an indigenous boycott of the games were rejected in partbecause several aboriginal athletes such as track star Cathy Freeman aremedal contenders and after the Olympic organizing committee did a back flipand decided to fly the indigenous flag at official venues In an editorial the Herald predicted that some Australians willbe angered by the strategy of shaming  Australian governments andinstitutions in the eyes of the world for their mistreatment and neglect ofAborigines because they will see it as calculated to tarnish the nationalimage at a time when all other efforts are directed towards polishing it andshowing Australia at its best But the paper claimed such anger is notonly futile but misdirected The Herald placed hope in theacknowledgment by some native leaders that the presentation of Aboriginalpeople as victims though useful to win some political arguments is ultimatelydisempowering for Aborigines themselves If international scrutiny shames whiteAustralia into necessary reappraisal of flawed policies well and good If italso sharpens Aboriginal leaders understanding of the need for greater effortson their part even better
