                                 Malpractice Makes Perfect                           USAToday  the Washington Post  and New York Times all lead with aprestigious independent medical organizations call for a new federal agencydedicated to minimizing medical mistakes which says the organization are nowkilling between  and  people a year The Los AngelesTimes reefers this to a Page  story leading instead with the namingin Northern Ireland Monday of a ProtestantCatholic powersharing Cabinetwhich could mean the true end of The Troubles in that country            The papers explain the basic point of the medical error recommendationsmost slipups occur not from individual ineptness but from structural flaws inthe ways hospitals and caregivers function An example both the NYT andthe WP cite is prescribing the wrong drug because its name is verysimilar to the right one Systematically noting and disseminating such possibleconfusions to physicians would reduce risk All three leads make the point thatmedicine could benefit from following the tracking and notification proceduresof other risky fields like aviation and nuclear power The NYT notesthat establishing such a system is thought to cost only slightly more than percent of the  billion in healthcare costs attributable to preventablemedical injuries            The biggest unclarity in the medical error coverage has to do with who wouldget to see the results of the proposed systematic error tracking Just doctorsor potential patients too USAT refers to reporting without fear ofpunishment which suggests a pretty tight lid Both the NYT andWP suggest that the system envisioned would allow serious medical errorsto be made known to the public but keep less serious ones confidential Buttheres no discussion of whether this makes sense from the patients point ofview A related point Theres already a data bank for sharing informationabout incompetent doctors Surely it would be relevant to know if it functionssimilarly to whats being proposed now and to know if it has indeed helped makemedicine safer            The other significant wiggle room in the stories relates to the dimension ofthe medical error problem USAT says its the eighthlargest killer inthe US The WP suggests its the fifth How do the two papers getdifferent results off the very same press release Well USAT goes withthe low end estimate of errorbased fatalities and the Post goes withthe high end            The NYT and LAT go high on their fronts with reports thatMexican and US authorities have begun excavating sites in Mexico very nearthe Texas border believed to be a dumping ground for scores of Mexicans andAmericans killed by drug traffickers within the past few years The LATsays officials are expecting to find between  and  corpses Both paperssay that members of Mexican law enforcement are suspects in some of thesemurders USAT blurbs the story inside            The USAT offlead and the top story in the Wall Street Journal business news index is that later thisweek on the heels of a spate of problems with Boeing airliners the FAA willstart a thorough safety inspection of the companys manufacturing plantsfocusing on quality control procedures The Journal says the field auditcomes after months of increasing tension between the agency and company            The LAT fronts and the WP and NYT stuff thedeveloping saga of that yearold Cuban refugee boy plucked from the oceannear Miami on Thanksgiving morning The boy who saw his mother drown and thenspent  hours adrift in an inner tube is the object of an international tugof war He is staying with relatives in Florida and has become says theLAT  a poster child for antiCastro exiles there but his father backin Cuba wants him returned The boy is said to want to remain in the US Thematter will probably end up in federal court            The WSJ reports that the World Wrestling Federation faced withadvertiser pullouts may be toning down its material It quotes WWF minor domoVince McMahon as saying viewers will soon see less aggression less colorfullanguage and less sexuality The biggest advertiser to pull out over contentis Coke which has a waitandsee attitude about coming back Another refugeefrom the sex and violence the US Army
