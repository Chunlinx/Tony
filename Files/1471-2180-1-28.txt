                    Background        Despite tremendous progress in developing        antiretroviral drugs to combat HIV there remains a need        for an effective HIV vaccine This need is particularly        pressing in third world countries where demographics and        economics make drug therapy difficult to deliver Although        HIV infection elicits neutralizing antibodies and a        cellular immune response against the virus reviewed in                and there exist exposed uninfected EU        individuals that appear to have acquired resistance to        infection by HIV      the hallmark of HIV infection is        the almost universal inability of humans to mount an immune        response that can prevent the eventual development of        AIDS        An effective vaccine will require not only the design of        effective immunogens but also the design of optimized        protocols of immunogen delivery As a live attenuated        vaccine for HIV is considered difficult to test and        dangerous to implement           various        alternatives to HIV could be considered as potential live        vectors for HIV immunogens including enteric bacteria        poxviruses vaccinia and canarypox small RNA viruses        eg poliovirus and Semliki Forest virus Rhabdoviruses        eg vesicular stomatitis virus DNA viruses eg        adenovirus and adenoassociated viruses and even naked DNA        to achieve expression in living host cells             Dengue possesses several advantages which favor its        choice as a vector for HIV immunogens As a flavivirus it        replicates entirely in the cytoplasm through RNA directed        RNA polymerization and is incapable of integrating into the        host genome Flavivirus replicons can replicate inside        cells and achieve prolonged expression of high levels of        virally encoded proteins with minimal toxicity            and are unable to recombine or mutate to produce infectious        HIV particles Finally by eliciting an immune reaction        against the dengue nonstructural proteins remaining in        replicons dengue virus replicons may induce a protective        immunity against dengue which would not predispose        vaccinated individuals to DHF Properly administered        dengue virus replicons expressing HIV epitopes might thus        serve as dual vaccines conferring protection against        dengue virus as well as HIV        The challenges in developing a safe and effective HIV        vaccine are many and varied Choice of immunogen is clearly        problematic Critical epitopes may be masked by glycosyl        groups andor tertiary structure      and           The extensive genetic variability of HIV complicates        immunogen choice and the high rate of mutation increases        the likelihood of the rapid development of resistance        Furthermore the method of immunogen delivery eg        purified subunits or inactivated virus vs various forms of        live expression can determine the relative nature and        extent of humoral and cell mediated immunologic responses        Priming with various types of live expression followed by        boosting with purified subunits is currently favored as a        method to obtain stronger immunologic responses that either        method alone reviewed in    and     Previously        acquired immunity to a viral vector such as vaccinia may        influence its efficacy in inducing immunity against        heterologous proteins being delivered       and        it may be wise to provide physicians with HIV vaccines        based on a variety of vectors to handle a variety of        clinical situations        The use of live dengue as a vaccine or as a vector for        heterologous immunogens has historically been considered        problematic because of the pathologies associated with        dengue infection Although dengue fever DF is usually        self limited dengue hemorrhagic fever DHF is        considerably debilitating and frequently fatal            However DHF is unlikely to result from or be promoted by        the vectors reported here The enhanced replication of        virus seen in dengue hemorrhagic fever is generally seen        upon reinfection by dengue virus of a serotype different        from previous infections and is believed to be mediated by        antibodies against viral structural proteins so called        antibody dependent enhancement of infection or ADE These        cross reacting antibodies actually promote viral uptake by        macrophages      The main challenge in using live        dengue in humans is thus avoiding the development of        antibody dependent enhancementADE of infection by        antibodies against the preM and E proteins of one dengue        strain which weakly cross react with the preM and E of a        second infecting dengue strain Since the replicons        reported here lack the major viral structural protein        genes they are not only incapable of sustaining a        spreading infection but also are incapable of eliciting        antibodies against the missing structural proteins They        should neither induce DF nor promote DHF        Dengue virus has a typical flavivirus genome structure        as described in Figure  The structural proteins C preM        M and E are involved in packaging export and subsequent        entry The nonstructural proteins NS NSA NSB NS        NSA NSB and NS include an RNAdirected RNA polymerase        and a protease function involved in cleaving certain        positions of the long viral polyprotein which contains all        the viral genes      The four serotypes of dengue        virus  through  share approximately  amino        acid residue identity with one another in the E gene           and induce crossreacting antibodies            Two strategies suggest themselves for circumventing the        problem of ADE from dengue vaccination One strategy is to        immunize with multiple strains of dengue virus to elicit        high affinity neutralizing antibodies against the multiple        dengue serotypes At least one vaccine to do this using        dengue vaccine candidates DEN PDK DEN PDK DEN        PGMK F and DEN PDK has been in clinical trials             A second strategy is to induce immunity only to        viral proteins other than preM and E Several studies have        shown that the nonstructural glycoprotein NS can play an        important role in protection against dengue Mice immunized        with purified dengue NS protein injected intramuscularly        and boosted after  days and two weeks were protected from        developing lethal dengue encephalitis upon subsequent        challenge with dengue  virus     Similarly mice        immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing        authentic NS    were protected against the development        of dengue virus encephalitis when challenged by        intracerebral injection Inoculation of mice with specific        combinations of monoclonal antibodies Mabs directed        against dengue NS    also protects against lethal        virus encephalitis upon intracerebral dengue challenge        Other nonstructural proteins are also immunogenic and may        participate in eliciting protection            Previously we have reported the successful construction        of several dengue virus replicons which replicate        intracellularly without the preM and E proteins required        to form infectious virions including one replicon which        can be expressed from transfected DNA     Towards the        goal of devising a live dual vaccine based on only        nonstructural dengue proteins and heterologous HIV        material we report here that these replicons can be        harnessed to express heterologous genes including HIV        gp and gp Upon introduction into a hosts cells        these subgenomic fragments should replicate        intracellularly and support prolonged expression of dengue        and heterologous immunogens without producing the deleted        dengue structural proteins and without forming infectious        virions                    Results        In various previous attempts to express heterologous        genes in full length wild type dengue virus we        experienced a very poor success rate despite attempts to        clone heterologous material into various positions of the        genome data not shown Our first efforts to determine        whether or not heterologous material could be readily        expressed in dengue replicons was to clone the        comparatively tractable green fluorescent protein GFP        into the preME replicon into the position from which        the preM and E genes had been deleted Figure  GFP was        readily visualized in cultures  hours post transfection        with preMEGFP as seen in Figure         Encouraged by the success with GFP we next looked at        preME replicons with HIV env material cloned into the        position of the deleted preM and E genes We analyzed two        clones preMEgp and preMEgp expressing HIV        gp and gp respectively Figure  Expression of        genes in the preMEgp replicon was reproducibly        visualized at  hours post transfection Figures          at a level of approximatley  of the cells but in        many experiments the corresponding cultures transfected        with the gp replicon preMEgp either no        fluorescence could be visualized not shown or only        fluorescent cells with a bizarre morphology characterized        by debris andor degenerative appearance could be        visualized Figure  However when we harvested cultures        earlier at  hours post transfection with preMEgp        intact fluorescing cells were readily found though the        morphology still appeared atypical compared to either that        of cultures transfected with wild type dengue virus and        dengue replicons    or the preMEgp replicon see        Figure         To serve as effective vaccines it is preferable if not        necessary that expression systems be capable of expressing        immunogens for longer than a couple of days Although we        knew from previous experiments    that dengue replicons        could survive for at least  days in culture the limited        durability of cells transfected with gpexpressing        replicons raised the question of whether or not cells        transfected with preMEgp replicons could survive for        similarly long times in culture When cultures transfected        with preMEgp were trypsinized and replated on day         post transfection and then analyzed on day  post        transfection fluorescent cells were readily visualized        Figure  In comparison to cultures that were not        trypsinized on day  post transfection however these        cultures had fewer intact fluorescent cells and more debris        not shown Although this suggests that gp expression        from a dengue replicon stresses cells we did find fields        with adjacent gp positive cells suggesting that at        least one cell division between day  and day  had        occurred in a cell successfully transfected with        preMEgp Figure  right panel A  days of culture        post transfection with preMEgp only about  of        the cells or less were positive not shown which        represents a considerable decrease from  hours post        transfection        In the experiments described above and in Figures        through  expression of dengue replicons with        heterologous material from HIV was followed either using        antiHIV sera or antidengue sera depending on the        experiment To demonstrate that the same cells were        expressing both dengue proteins and HIV proteins we used a        double label technique with FITC detecting HIV proteins        and rhodamine detecting dengue proteins Figure        demonstrates the concordance of dengue virus protein and        gp expression in cultures  days post transfection with        preMEgp Figure  The more extensive background        of auto fluorescence encountered when visualizing the        rhodamine fluorescence makes low levels of specific        rhodamine fluorescence more difficult to discern but        clearly all intact cells positive for HIV are also positive        for dengue proteins The rhodaminepositive spot in the        lower left of the panel is cellular debris and is also        positive for dengue proteins but the FITC fluorescence was        not well reproduced by digital photography though it still        may be visualized on certain monitorcomputer combinations        Similar results were obtained at  days post transfection        Figure                     Discussion        Our finding that dengue virus replicons can express        heterologous genes including HIV envelop for prolonged        periods of time in cell culture without selection        represents a significant step in developing a new vector        system potentially capable of delivering immunogens to any        host in whose cells the dengue replicons can replicate        Flavivirus replicons have previously been demonstrated to        express heterologous genes for up to  days in tissue        culture in Kunjin     However these experiments were        done in the presence of selection for the heterologous        genes cloned into the replicons We have demonstrated        heterologous gene expression in the absence of selection        for up to at least  days post transfection with chimeric        dengue replicons Although we have formally demonstrated        expression not replication our previous demonstration of        the replication    of dengue replicons lacking        heterologous material suggests that the replicons described        here which contain heterologous material are indeed        replicating Evidence that cells continue to replicate and        express replicon proteins in both daughter cells after        transfection with these chimeric replicons further supports        the implication of chimeric replicon replication Ideally        to serve as dual vaccines against dengue as well as against        other pathogens the replicons should express the dengue        NS protein        So far attempts to visualize        NS production by Western blots have failed presumably        because of the low transfection efficiencies However we        have previously argued that the replication of dengue        replicons could not take place in the absence of the        essential nonstructural gene NS which implies that NS        is being made The frequencies and fluorescence intensities        of replicon positive cells seen in the experiments reported        here are comparable to those seen for dengue replicons        lacking heterologous material     suggesting that        replication of the preME replicons containing        heterologous material is occurring as well The finding of        at least one closely apposed pair of cells expressing high        levels of replicon proteins on day  post transfection two        days after trypsinization and replating Figure  right        panel not only implies replicon replication but also        implies the expression of NS protein as well The        definitive demonstration of effective NS production will        have to await studies of the immune response in animals        immunized with these replicons        Choice of immunogen remains problematic for these        vectors Clearly HIV gp is too toxic for prolonged        expression Even the gpexpressing replicon seems mildly        toxic in that the frequency of gp positive cells        declines with time in culture post transfection with        preMEgp not shown However as noted above we        have seen at least one instance of putative cellular        division at least  days after being successfully        transfected by preMEgp Figure  right panel        Experiments are now in progress to determine the        feasibility of long term expression of other HIV        immunogens including gag and tat                    Conclusion        Demonstration of long term protein expression by a        gpexpressing replicon alone of course does not        demonstrate that the chimeric dengue replicons constitute        an effective vaccine However at the very least they add        to the potential armamentarium available to the        vaccinologist It is highly likely that a successful HIV        vaccination protocol will involve multiple immunogens and        delivery protocols For instance mice immunized with        attenuated Friend leukemia virus FLV develop an immune        response whose efficacy is dependent on the additive        effects of at least three separable spleen cell populations            By analogy it may be necessary to devise multiple        strategies to obtain a similarly complex and effective        immune response in humans against HIV In animal models of        HIV different immunogens and modes of immunization can        induce different modes of protection with varying degrees        of effectiveness          Harnessing        multiple immune responses may be the answer to designing an        effective HIV vaccine    and the availability of        multiple vectors may facilitate the harnessing of multiple        responses        Much work obviously remains to be done to develop dengue        replicons as effective vectors for HIV immunogens More        work needs to be done on determining the ability of dengue        replicons to express other potential immunogens including        HIV gag tat reviewed in  and env genes with deleted        hypervariable regions see     Animal studies in our        lab are currently being initiated to determine the nature        of the immune response such vectors can induce in mice and        these studies will presumably need to be extended to        primates Finally effective delivery systems will need to        be devised Although our successful development of a        plasmid which can express a dengue replicon from        transfected DNA facilitates delivery by DNA vaccination            the development of packaging cell lines which can        package these replicons into virions would be a major step        forward towards a vaccine which could be conveniently        administered in typical clinical situations Experiments        are currently underway in our laboratory to develop such        packaging cell lines                    Materials and methods                  Culturing of dengue Virus          Dengue virus strains DENWP and DENNGC kindly          provided by Dr Lewis Markoff     were passaged in          monkey LLCMK cells at C

plated          to reach approximately  confluence on the day of          infection Infections were typically at an MOI of           PFUcell in Medium  plus  FBS                          In vitro
