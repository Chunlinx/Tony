                                 Nothing but Net            The Internet is a movingtarget Every minute thousands of Web pages are updated or abandoned Messagessent to newsgroups replace older postings All but a fraction of the chatroomconversations and digital images that streak across the Net vanish aftertheyre displayed            Seekingto preserve the chaos of the Net for posterity is Brewster Kahle a man with amission a server and a lot of magnetic tape Kahle who once designedcomputers for Thinking Machines Corp founded the Internet Archive in  tocollect and store all the disparate bits of the Internet From offices in thePresidio the former Army base adjacent to San Franciscos Golden Gate Bridgethe Internet Archives powerful computer the Internet at high speedsConsulting intelligent algorithms about what information to store and howoften the archives computer copies data to tape cassettes on a QuantumDLT recorder When each cassette is full a robotic arm removes it storesit in a carousel and replaces it with a blank one            The Internet may seem impossibly vast to users but in factits quite finite The entire World Wide Web is currently estimated to containabout  terabytes or  million megabytes of data Newsgroups  and otherInternet subsystems account for another  or so terabytes Compare thesenumbers with the  terabytes of ASCII data contained in the Library ofCongress  million books or the  terabytes of data at the average videostore With tapecassette storage costing only  per gigabyte  billionbytes archiving the Internet is practically economical Already thearchivists have stockpiled more than  terabytes of the Net and currentlytheyre storing about  gigabytes of data every month Faster connections tothe Net promise to speed things up and Kahle estimates that his group will bedone by the end of             Storingthe Internet once is only the beginning As experienced Web surfersknow things change rapidly on the Net The archive doesnt have the computermuscle to store the publicly available Internet every week but even if it dida lot of stuff would still fall through the cracks On sites like MSNBC and CNN breaking news comes and goesevery minute which means pages disappear faster than they can currently besquirreled away Slate is updated daily Shifting faster still are Web sitesgenerated by databases such as the online bookstore Amazoncom Because theinformation these sites produce is specific to a users experience they cangenerate a literally infinite number of different pages Finally much of thetraffic on the Internet is dynamicchat rooms instant messages and now evenphone conversations To archive the Internet with absolute fidelity wouldrequire cloning not only every computer on the Internet but also every personusing every computer            Many responsible netizens already archivethemselves for selfish reasons Archiving is a nobrainer for publication siteslike the San Francisco Chronicle s The Gate which collects the contents of the dailynewspaper and connects them to a good search engine And other sites likeDeja News alreadyassemble postings from the Internet newsgroups                        Where theInternet Archive trumps these archives of course is in its sheercomprehensiveness While it isnt a replica of the Internet its a start Andits not useful just to historians Suppose your Web browser allowed you tospecify not only an address but also a date Remember that headline you saw onWired News  buthave been unable to find since The headline was posted for only a day and youhavent had much luck using the sites search tool to locate the piece Butusing the Internet Archive to turn back the hands of time will uncover it foryou And what about your teenage cousins Web page with that cute picture ofher Mohawk Cousins mother cancelled her ISP account and now the site isgone But an intelligent browser could catch the no such site error and lookit up on the archive instead displaying the lastknown version Did yourfavorite politician really just flipflop on your hotbutton issue Comparelast years campaign Web site with todays These are just a few of the manyvaluable services that promise to keep the nonprofit Internet Archive richlyendowed            Useful though it might be the idea of archiving theInternet is assailed by all sides David Berreby argued last year in Slate that exhaustivedocumentation of our world threatens to box us into a corner The recentDocumenting the DigitalAge conference gathered experts from the computing telecommunication andarchiving worlds to explore these issues Corporate executives complained thatbecause their archives are routinely subpoenaed by plaintiffs attorneys theyhave every incentive to shred their data instead of preserving them Lawyersworried aloud about privacy and copyright concerns Should you have the rightto exclude your public page from the archive Consensus opinion Yes Shouldwe be saving usage logs which detail every page a person sees Probably notDoesnt this whole thing violate current copyright laws left and right Almostcertainly Should those laws be amended to allow such an archiveProbably            Professional archivists arguethat its a waste of time to store the Internet without providing a properhistorical context Others say that having too                much informationabout the Web at our disposal will be as bad as not having enough They addthat finding things promptly on the Web with a search engine is hard enoughthat using it as a historical research tool would be incredibly painful Theyadvocate an orderly weeding assembling and categorizing of digital recordsMicrosofts chief technical officer and Slate contributor Nathan Myhrvoldwhose Save the Web memo last year helped start the archive movement countersthat we dont know now what will be important later Your cousin might grow upto be president at which point her teenage Mohawk Web site will becomesubstantially more important than it is now Myhrvold adds that its better tostart saving todays Internet now even if it is badly collected and organizedrather than lose it forever            And tothink that Brewster Kahle thought he was just solving a problem by starting theInternet Archive and not introducing lots of new ones
