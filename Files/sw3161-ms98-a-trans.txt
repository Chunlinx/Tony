        the AIDS issue is        is a bit of a problem i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end i mean how can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor im not really sure if its true or not that uh were not spending as much per lets say afflicted person on cancer uh theres some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more people mean more people than AIDS and yet uh more people die of it and yet the funding is already uh exceeded AIDS has more money than uh breast cancer   and well thats interesting isnt it yeah   so uh i mean if its true i ive ive always heard these things ive never bothered to dig it out and make sure but uh ive heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that whoevers sitting up there making these decisions uh or whatever institutions raise the money and uh its just one big PR campaign that yeah we think thats the worlds worst thing so lets give money to AIDS and yet weve had breast cancer problems for years and its just one of those   right   well of course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesnt effect men its not gonna get funded and uh having thought about that for a while   what did you think about that idea   well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i got i got to thinking the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and theres only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood antigen antigen uh  antibody test for the antigen in the blood and thats fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years   hm theyve not really given it attention either yeah   so its not really cure for yeah its not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i dont know i i guess theres just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it through different organizations March of Dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever how they fund whatever um illness they wish its its kind of hard to   right   to get an even keel on that i mean its really hard to say well theres you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so lets give it this amount and then this other ones only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or   well im im glad im not the one thats  thats in charge of of making those decisions they uh you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because theyre all so serious you know i mean its not so serious i guess until it affects your family and then all the sudden its the most important thing   right   so i i would hate to have that  responsibility just personally but but then again we really we really do have it as a society just decides which things we need to address i uh i guess i it it frightens me to think  of so many people with with AIDS and with cancer and many of those things um if theyre not able to to be insured then the countrys gonna pay for it one way or the other   right   whether its through prevention or or treatment or you know just uh just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves so it seems like one way or the other were gonna end up paying for it   thats true you know the the other thought that i had um ive had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it so its kind of a a unfair advantage as they were but       the other thing that ive thought of on this is i wonder if there isnt enough money uh in our economy or in our system uh it seems like theres so much that goes to things that dont really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah theyre kind of nice but we have such an affluent society society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a uh cure for just about everything of course then we wouldnt have any room to put people but thats   just change our priorities right just change our priorities a little bit and   yeah you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these  phenomenal amount of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but   right   are they that enhancing for the masses for the masses you know they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but uh had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else
