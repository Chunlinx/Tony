                                  Does Crime Pay            Criminals by and large must beriskloversotherwise theyd be carwash attendants instead of criminalsLottery players by and large must be riskloversotherwise theyd buyTreasury bonds instead of lottery tickets You might be tempted to concludethat criminals and lottery players are often the same people Thats probablythe wrong conclusion After all risklovers enjoy having all their eggs in onebasket which suggests they should pursue either crime or the lottery but notboth            Still if you want to understand what attractspeople to crime it pays to understand what attracts people to risky activitiesmore generally so it pays to understand what attracts people to thelottery            Lotteries are attractive when they offer big prizesor relatively good odds If youre running a lottery and youre going to payout  million you can offer a single  million jackpot or you can offer prizes of  million each Which is more appealing to the players Usually theformer For the most part lottery players prefer a small chance of a bigpayout to a bigger chance of a smaller payout Thats because the people whoprefer a bigger chance of a smaller payout are buying certificates of depositnot lottery tickets So if you want to make the lottery more attractive itsbetter to double the size of the jackpot than to double the number ofwinners            More preciselydoubling the number of winners makes the lottery more attractive to the sort ofperson who never buys lottery tickets anyway while doubling the jackpot makesit more attractive to the sort of person who might actually be tempted toplay            Now lets apply the same reasoning to criminal deterrenceFor the most part criminals prefer a small chance of a big punishment to a bigchance of a small punishment Thats because the people who prefer a big chanceof a small punishment go into punishing careers like construction work or coalmining instead of crime So if you want to make crime less attractive tocriminals its better to double the odds of conviction than to double theseverity of the punishment            Add  percent to thelength of the average jail sentence and crime will fall Add  percent to theconviction rate instead and crime will fall even further Like any riskloverscriminals are out to beat the odds so they get particularly demoralized whenthe odds turn against them            So much for the theory now to the facts Whats true ofthe lottery should be true at the racetrack And gambling consultant MauryWolff confirms that if youre designing a complicated bet like a trifecta theway to generate the most action per dollars worth of prize money and hencethe most profit for the track is to offer very large prizes at very long oddsWhy then do the tracks continue to offer bets with much smaller payoffsAccording to Wolff its because big prize winners take their money and go homewhile small prize winners plow their winnings back into the next race Thatsets up an interesting tradeoff for the track owner One big prize maximizesprofit on the current race while several small prizes maximize the action onthe next race Interesting as that tradeoff may be its largely irrelevant tothe main point which is that players like big prizes and long odds Onanother interesting tangent Wolff asked me whether theres somethinginherently corrupt about a system where the proceeds from state lotteries areused to fund school systems that then have an incentive to produce the kind ofstudents who will go out and play the lottery            With regard to crimelets consider the most spectacular of all crimes murder Here the expert isProfessor Isaac Ehrlich who in the mids pioneered the use ofsophisticated statistical techniques to measure deterrent effects of convictionand punishment Together with Professor Zhiqiang Liu Ehrlich has recentlyrevisited the subject refuting his most vocal critics and offering newevidence in support of his original conclusion Increase the number ofconvictions by  percent and to a very rough approximation the murder ratefalls by about  percent Increase the number of executions by  percent whichamounts to increasing the severity of the average punishment and again to avery rough approximation the murder rate falls by about half a percent Thesenumbers are based on evidence from the s and s Capital punishmentstudies tend to focus on decades with more executions and hence more data Asthe theory predicts convictions matter more than punishments            Thats not to say that punishments dont matter Executionsmay be a lesseffective deterrent than convictions but they are neverthelessan extremely powerful deterrent according to Ehrlichs numbers one additionalexecution in  could well have prevented over  murders            I am grateful to Ehrlich for that amazingly strongresult because I use it to illustrate three points that Im always eager todrive home to my students First incentives matter even to murderers Secondeconomic theory predicts that some incentives matter more than others and thedata confirm the theory Executions prevent murders but convictions preventeven more murders And finally if you want to give policy advice its notenough to know your numbers Youve also got to know your values IsaacEhrlich the man who proved to the satisfaction of the economics professionthat capital punishment works is a passionate opponent of capitalpunishment
