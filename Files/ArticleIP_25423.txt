                                  Maureen Dowd            Two of this years PulitzerPrizes were awarded for wit one for Margaret Edsons play of that name abouta scholar of  th century English poetry facing ovarian cancer andanother for the quality most evident in the writing of New York Timescolumnist Maureen Dowd Newspaper commentary a dying art see Jacob Weisbergson its last great is nowadays dominated by sententiousness not satire Onthe flat windy landscape of the nations opinion pages Dowd stands out forher sharp oneliners and her brisk aperus  Woody Allens recent moviesare versions of The Catcher in the Rye Bread  Al Gore Prince Albertgrew up as the capitals version of Eloise at the Plaza The Lewinsky matteris the first scandal with product placement CSPAN has turned politics intoa TV series that nobody has the power to pull And lets not omit Dowdsincisive summary of the moral and constitutional crux of the Clinton sexscandal almost worthy of Oscar Wilde These are not grounds for impeachmentthese are grounds for divorce            Like anyone who tries tobe funny Dowd sometimes strains for effect and falls flat She posed a choicebetween New Yorks Rudolph Giuliani and Washingtons Marion Barry as onebetween the mayor who cracks down on crime and the mayor whose crime wascrack At other times her glibness gets in the way of her insightHistorians will long ponder how Mrs Clinton came in as Eleanor Roosevelt andleft as Madonna They will Like anyone who must produce  words ofheadlinebased observation twice every week she appears on occasion to phonein her copy as when she imagined a series of US history documentariesdirected by Oliver Stone Abigail Adams is really Lucianne Goldberg Andshe could set a welcome example for pundits everywhere if she took a solemnpublic oath never to write another word about Ally McBeal  Stilloccasional lapses aside no other regular newspaper columnist matches hergimlet eye her sense of phrase or her unpredictability            One measure of Dowds importance is that even people whoprofess to despise her seem to read her religiouslyand to recycle her jokesat parties Another is that she is subject to frequent sometimes scathingcriticism in publications of every ideological stripe and market niche Herunalloyed contempt for the Clintons managed to infuriate even as lukewarm aClintonite as Garry Wills who wrote more than a year before the Pulitzerthat any journalist must be super strenuous to take the vileness award fromMaureen Dowd But Dowds disgust with the presidents persecutors and hermerciless flaying of Ken Starr including the famous Sept  column of lastyear that began He couldnt stop thinking about the thong underwear earnedher some brickbats from the antiClinton right The National Reviewcalled her a writer of relentless orthodoxy by which of course it meantliberal orthodoxy            But Dowds politics arenearly impossible to glean from her columns Most of her colleagues on theTimes oped page represent an identifiable and more or less consistentposition Thomas L Friedman is the voice of liberal internationalism RussellBaker was the voice of New Deal liberalism Bob Herbert is the voice of liberalpopulism William Safire is the voice of libertarian conservatism and A MRosenthal is the voice of sheer ranting lunacy Dowd in contrast plays herideological cards close to the vest Her published views on matters of policywould scarcely fill a chapbook She favors gun control hates the tobaccoindustry and welcomes the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland            These positions are hardly evidence in the Clinton era ofa heterodox temperament They are as likely these days to be held by aRepublican as by a Democrat But its not Dowds views that irritate hercritics so much as her style and her attitude The case against Dowd taken uplately by Michael Wolff in New York magazine she is derisive mockinghyperbolic bitchy and by Dan Kennedy in the Boston Phoenix Call herour most celebrated bad columnist was most cogently laid out in a  pieceby Katherine Boo in the Washington Monthly  At the time Dowd was stilla reporter following the presidential campaign after having covered the Bushand Reagan White Houses She was anointed a columnist in  replacing AnnaQuindlen in what National Review calls the Times  liberal Irishwomans seat Boos brief boils down to two main charges that Dowds breezysardonic style has inspired a flood of stilted selfconscious imitators andthat the Dowd crowd contributed to the erosion of political discourse byplacing style and personality above seriousness and substance            The first charge iseasily dismissed A writer with a strong and original voice will alwaysinfluence lesser talents Imitation is the tribute mediocrity pays to geniusYou might as well blame the Beatles for the Monkees or Matt Groening for TheFamily Guy  But the second accusation is both more interesting and morecomplicated especially because the trivialization of politics has long beenone of Dowds obsessions In Clintons Washington according to Dowd thecelebrity culture and the political culture have become indistinguishable            But the merger of politics and celebrity was one Dowdherself helped broker Or to switch metaphors she is simultaneously abrilliant diagnostician of the political disease of our time and a symptom ofit It was Dowd after all who wrote the story of Frank Sinatras allegedaffair with Nancy Reagan as chronicled in Kitty Kelleys biography of Nancyon the front page of the New York Times  Dowd protests that the piecewas an assignment and quite rightly that editors not reporters decide whatgoes on Page One            And its Dowd who lastyear wrote a hilarious column called Of Frogs and Newts which linked thedoomed speaker with yes Ally McBeal And Dowd who speculates about what kindof a president Tom Hanks would make and who calls Al Gore the SavingPrivate Ryan of presidential candidatesmeaning that the aura ofinevitability that surrounds him now may turn out to be a curse in  Doesthis make Bill Bradley Shakespeare in Love             The politics of celebrity is also a politics ofpersonalityof confession and healing of narcissism disguised as empathyUnlike Clintons but kind of like Gores Dowds moments of selfrevelationare carefully rationed and therefore unusually effective She recently wrotea powerful piece about the shooting of Amadou Diallo in New York City thatbegan with an account of her father a DC policeman killing a suspect inselfdefense Last year in a defense of the concept of sexual harassment sherecalled her own humiliation years before by a powerful editor she had goneto see about a job And in a remarkable and notorious column from June of she detailed her encounter at a popular DC Indian restaurant withMonica Lewinsky herself whom Dowd had mercilessly cast as a fat insecurebubbleheaded Valley girl You can take the girl out of Beverly Hills butyou cant take Beverly Hills out of the girl Do you mind if I ask yousomething Lewinsky said to Dowd Why do you write such scathing articlesabout me            The fact that Dowd wasstruck dumb by this question has been used against her The Phoenix sKennedy sees it as proof of her utter disengagement and her detachment fromthe people she writes about But we wouldnt know about Dowds failure tomuster a response or about Lewinskys poise and forthrightness unless Dowdherself had chosen to tell us And while perhaps an explicit admission thatshed been unfair to Lewinsky would have been sporting the column as writtenis at once more artful and more honest            Last October in a column that featured selections fromsome of the predictably misogynist hate mail she has received from bothliberals and conservatives Dowd permitted herself to fantasize about aparallel universe in which she could be a champagne farmer in France in lovewith a neighboring cognac farmer Or an archaeologist in the Yucatan who fliesher own plane and owns a supper club called The Fuzzy Slipper Anything sheconcluded as long as I am not a Washington journalist in the era of Clintonand Gingrich and Starr covering this horrible grudge match between the rightand the left that has been building since Watergate            Dont believe a word ofit Dowd is the only writer on her papers oped page fully in tune with thepolitical and cultural moment Other pundits beam their opinions at us asthrough a time warp from the hazy days of past administrations George F Willis stuck in Reagans first term though he tries to convince us that hes stuckin the Madison administration Safires a Nixon man to the end and Frank Richrecalls the glorious presidency of Eugene McCarthy But Dowd is mutatismutandis the HL Mencken of the Clinton erathe presidents symbioticscourge He may have the numbers of a lot of women but Dowd alone has his            Like the rest of his most loyal supporters and his mostintractable enemies and she has been uniquely both Dowd is part of thebaby boom generation Historians will record she has written elaborating onsomething Leon Weiseltier once wrote about Clinton that our generationscontribution was to be the generation that worried about its contributionAnother feature of this generations passage through American culturesharedby liberals and conservatives cynics and true believers Clinton GingrichSteven Spielberg and Dowd herselfis a misty sense of some better earliertime before they came along and screwed everything up            The body of Dowds work as a columnist and inparticular the Flytrap pieces that won her the Pulitzer is one of the mostbrilliant examples yet of boomer selfcastigation The Clinton presidency isof course another example And one worries a bit about what Dowd will do whenit ends She has been practicing for this inevitable terrible event latelyscoring Elizabeth Dole as Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the CuckoosNest  admitting to a fondness for John McCain and having great fun at theexpense of Al Gore and George W Bush the two scions likely to fight it out in But while she will no doubt be splendid on their millennial campaignits hard to see how her intemperate wit will find adequate targets in either aGore Jr or a W Bush administration            Is it too selfish of us to ask for a repeal of the nd Amendmentfor four more years of Clinton and another million for Ken Starr
