                    Background        Contamination of the Great Lakes has led to the        bioaccumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs in        fish particularly the larger predator species prized by        sportfishers       These compounds are synthetic        organochlorines OC that along with        dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene DDE comprise the bulk of        OC residues found in human tissues     and some of the        highest body burdens of PCBs in humans are found among fish        consumers        Consumption of these contaminated        Great Lakes fish has been associated with several adverse        reproductive outcomes including shortened menstrual cycle            reduced fecundability      reduced neonatal        size     and neurologic disorders              For much of the  thcentury the secondary sex ratio        male birthsall births has been declining in many        countries       It has been speculated that this        declining sex ratio is a sentinel indicator of        environmental contamination     although others have        argued that on a population level this is not the case                There is evidence however that        hormonal levels around the time of conception are        associated with the sex ratio of offspring     and        there is compelling evidence that exposure to particular        chemicals does lead to changes in the sex ratio of        offspring         as seen for example with        exposure to dioxins following an explosion at an herbicide        plant in Seveso Italy      Animal studies have        suggested that exposure to PCBs may lower the sex ratio of        offspring       Studies among human populations        exposed to PCBs in different settings however have        suggested increases     decreases      or no        change     in the sex ratio To examine whether        increased parental serum PCB concentration is associated        with changes in the sex ratio we looked at both maternal        and paternal serum PCB levels in a cohort from the Great        Lakes region of the United States                    Methods                  Study sample          Under the Congressional Great Lakes Critical Programs          Act of  the health departments of Wisconsin          Illinois Indiana Ohio and Michigan formed a consortium          to assess PCB and DDE exposure risks and reproductive          effects of contaminated Great Lakes SportCaught Fish          GLSCF consumption This study is part of the work of          that consortium and the methods are described in detail          elsewhere      In brief between  we          interviewed by telephone charter boat captains from          consortium states who were active in  and their          spouses presumed frequent GLSCF consumers captains          cohort n   households approximately  response          rate In order to include more persons with low GLSCF          consumption we used random digit dialing with matching          to the captains cohort by age and region first six          digits of the telephone exchange to contact the general          population Only those contacted persons who had eaten no          GLSCF in the year before the survey and not more than          five meals in any year since  were eligible          infrequent consumers cohort n   households          approximately  response rate Participants in the          upper quartile of GLSCF consumption were later          recontacted and asked to donate blood as were controls          matched by geographic region and age to the high GLSCF          consumers approximately  and  response rates          respectively Twohundred and sixtytwo women and           men donated blood which was analyzed from  through           Twohundred and fortytwo of the women who donated          blood had children and  of the men had children We          searched for birth certificates of selfreported          children If either the birth certificate or the mother          indicated that a child was not a singleton birth that          child was excluded from analysis                          PCB and DDE analysis          Subjects abstained from eating sport fish for  hours          before donating blood and fasted completely from dinner          the night before until the blood draw the next morning          Thirty milliliters of blood was collected from each          donor The whole blood was collected in redtop          vacutainer tubes no anticoagulant or serum separator          It was allowed to clot for at least  minutes then          centrifuged for  minutes at  rpm The serum was          transferred with solventrinsed glass vials The analyte          was subsequently stored at C until laboratory          testing Five milliliters of serum was analyzed for DDE          and several PCB congeners using the capillary column gas          chromatography with the electron capture method              Copies of the PCB and DDE laboratory methods and quality          control protocols are available from the authors upon          request          Blood analyses were performed by two laboratories the          Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene Madison WI and          the Michigan Department of Community Health Laboratory          Lansing MI Prior to laboratory analysis both          laboratories participated in a quality          assurancelaboratory standardization protocol Each          laboratory had to process two standards of both high          and lowlevel concentration Analysis of the subjects          samples did not begin until the results of both standards          were comparable between both laboratories Duplicates and          spiked samples were routinely run with each batch of          approximately  samples to ensure precision and accuracy          were maintained For samples run in duplicate the          average percent difference was  or less for individual          PCB congeners Recoveries of spiked samples were greater          than  for the individual congeners Percent recovery          and precision among duplicates was equally good for          DDE          Limits of detection were determined statistically for          each congener    and any instrument response below          the limit of detection was reported as a nondetect The          limits of detection for the individual PCB congeners          assessed and the percentage of nondetects for samples          analyzed at both the Wisconsin State Laboratory of          Hygiene and the Michigan Department of Community Health          Laboratory are shown in tables and  respectively          Several methods have been proposed to assign values to          samples that are below the limit of detection all of          which may introduce bias       We have used a          method based on one described by Hornung and Reed             and modified in conjunction with scientists from the          Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reduce          overestimation when summing many individual congeners for          which few of the samples are detectable Specifically if          at least  of the samples had detectable values for the          analyte PCB congener the concentration for any          nondetect was imputed by dividing the limit of detection          by the square root of two If less than  of the          samples had detectable values the concentration for any          nondetect was left at  This imputation was done          separately for samples analyzed at the Wisconsin State          Laboratory of Hygiene and samples analyzed at the          Michigan Department of Public Health Laboratory          Congenerspecific PCB values were summed to yield a PCB          total for each subject In our sample this imputation          procedure resulted in total PCB concentrations that were          only marginally greater than those obtained if all          nondetects were assigned  The mean PCB concentrations          by exposure category are shown in table for both the sum          using imputed values for nondetects and the sum with          nondetects assigned  The limit of detection for DDE in          the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene was  ngmL          Only  of  samples was below this limit and it was          assigned a value of  The limit of detection for DDE          in the Michigan Department of Public Health Laboratory          was  ngmL Only  of  samples were below this          limit and they were assigned a value of                           Data analysis          The sex ratio we report is defined as the number of          male births divided by the total number of live births          often referred to as the secondary sex ratio The sex          of fetuses that do not result in a live birth are not          considered Worldwide this sex ratio is fairly constant          at     and this is exactly what it is for the          children of white women in Wisconsin between  and           Wisconsin Bureau of Health Information natality          data Because of the uncertainty in changes in maternal          serum PCB concentration as a result of childbirth and          breastfeeding practices     we only considered the          sex of the last at the time of the blood donation child          of each mother This also was therefore the birth          closest in time to the blood analysis Because the birth          of a child should not alter paternal serum PCB          concentration we considered the sex of all children of          each father in our sample to increase the power of our          analysis          We had complete data for a total of  mothers and           fathers who donated blood for analysis In one          analysis both maternal and paternal PCB levels were          included in the same model and therefore only the last          child of couples for whom we had blood samples from both          parents were included n   Otherwise separate          analyses were run for maternal and paternal exposure and          the  children for whom we had blood samples from both          parents were included in both maternal and paternal          analyses          The parity of the mother the number of live births          was treated as a categorical variable   or           and dummy variables for parity  and  were included          as potential confounders If we could identify a mothers          first child from a blank entry under last live birth on          the birth certificate then we could determine the          mothers parity at the birth of each of her children          directly by counting subsequent children If we could not          determine a mothers parity in this manner but we could          identify for a given child at least  nonfirstborn          child of the same mother born earlier then the mothers          parity at the later child would have to be at least  and          therefore was coded as  There is not much data on          the reliability of the last live birth entry on the          birth certificate but  US reports have found birth          certificate data on birth order to be extremely good          with concordance rates with medical records of greater          than       In addition in our data every child          who we knew from the mother was not a first child did          have an entry under last live birth on their birth          certificate Age of the parents at a given birth was          determined from the questionnaire Selfreported years of          GLSCF consumption and childrens birth dates were used to          determine whether a parent had eaten GLSCF prior to the          pregnancy Because GLSCF consumption contributes greatly          to OC exposure if a parent had eaten GLSCF but not          before the pregnancy of a given child being analyzed for          that child we assigned the parent the median PCB and DDE          concentrations of the infrequent consumers          We performed our analyses on all subjects with          complete data We were missing data on the last child of           mothers and  children of  fathers with blood          samples  primarily data on maternal parity which was          missing for the last child of  mothers and  children          of  fathers Considering only the last child of each          mother the sex ratio was lower among the children of the          mothers who were missing data  than among the          children of mothers who were not missing data           The PCB concentrations among the  mothers who were          missing data were higher geometric mean  ngmL          than for the mothers who were not missing data geometric          mean  ngmL Therefore by excluding mothers with          missing data we would potentially bias against finding a          decreasing sex ratio with increasing PCB levels The same          pattern held for fathers for fathers who were missing          data the sex ratio among their children was lower           and the fathers PCB concentrations higher          geometric mean  ngmL than for fathers without          missing data ratio  geometric mean PCB           ngmL Therefore excluding fathers with missing data          would also potentially bias against finding a decreasing          sex ratio with increasing PCB levels          Because the blood draws were carried out a varying          number of years after the births analyzed we ran          additional analyses after using a toxicokinetic model to          revise serum OC measurements to account for decay over          time Making the assumptions that subjects have achieved          an equilibrium between their OC intake and excretion          that they reach a new OC equilibrium faster than OC          concentrations in fish are changing and that the          subjects fish consumption is stable over time then the          decay of the body burden of OCs should be governed by the          decrease in OC concentration in fish over time Since PCB          contamination of fish in the Great Lakes has been found          to be declining in a manner well described by first order          kinetics    we revised serum OC measurements according          to the formula          OC           revised  OC           measured  exp  t          where  is the decay constant for OCs in the fish and          t is the number of years between the birth analyzed and          the analysis of the subjects blood Appendix see          additional file  We used fish OC decay constants of            and  chosen to cover a range of decay          rates that describe reported decreases in OC levels of          GLSCF over time     OC           revised is then the estimated serum OC          concentration at the time of the birth analyzed and OC                    measured is the OC concentration we          measured in  Because this model assumes that          the subjects fish consumption is stable over time after          revising serum OC concentrations based on this model we          performed analyses both on each entire group of fathers          or mothers and then also on only those who did not          report that their GLSCF consumption had changed a lot          This was determined from the responses to the following          question on the questionnaire Since you first began          eating sportcaught fish from the Great Lakes has the          amount of fish that you have eaten each year increased a          lot increased somewhat remained about the same          decreased somewhat or decreased a lot Quintiles of          exposure were determined for each separate regression          analysis          Additional file                     Appendix          Click here for file          When PCB and DDE measurements were analyzed as a          continuous variable they were transformed to the natural          log scale because they were skewed towards higher          concentrations The distribution of the natural logs of          serum PCB concentrations for the mothers and the fathers          included in our analysis are shown in figures aand a          respectively by the year of birth and sex of the          children Also shown Figures band b are the revised          natural logs of the parental serum PCB concentrations          after applying the toxicokinetic model with a decay          constant of   the revision that led to the most          change in the natural log of the PCB concentrations When          only the last child of parents was analyzed we          calculated adjusted odds ratios aOR for male births and          Wald  CI using logistic regression To analyze all          children of fathers  which involved repeated          observations from a single father  we used generalized          estimating equations with an unstructured correlation          matrix to calculate aOR and  CI from empirical          standard error estimates Mean values are shown in the          text and tables  their standard deviation sd SAS          version     was used for all analyses                            Results        The sex ratio among the last children of the mothers        with complete data was  This ratio was higher than        the expected ratio of  because only the last child of        each mother was considered The sex ratio among all        children of the mothers in our sample n   was         The sex ratio among all children of fathers with complete        data was  Characteristics by exposure status of        mothers and fathers and their children in our analyses are        shown in tables and  respectively The higher than        expected sex ratios among the last children of mothers in        our sample as well as a decrease in this ratio as maternal        PCB exposure increases can be seen in the crude sex ratios        by exposure quintile in table  We compared the sex ratio        among the children born to parents in each quintile of        serum PCB concentration to those in the lowest quintile        adjusting for the year of the childs birth paternal and        maternal age at the childs birth the mothers parity and        whether the child had an older brother Figure  Our        results were not materially affected if we included an        indicator variable in the model for whether the parent was        from the captains cohort or one of the infrequent GLSCF        consumers        Compared to mothers in the lowest quintile of serum PCB        concentration the odds of a male child for mothers in        higher quintiles steadily decreased Figure a The odds        of a male child among mothers in the highest PCB quintile        compared to the lowest was reduced by  OR          CI  When maternal serum PCB concentration was        treated as a continuous linear variable the odds of a male        child decreased by  for every unit increase in the        natural log of serum PCB concentration OR   CI         We saw no effect of paternal serum PCB        concentration on the odds of a male child Figure b The        pattern of effects of both maternal and paternal serum PCB        concentrations were not materially affected by        simultaneously adjusting for maternal and paternal PCB        levels although the confidence intervals became wider        because there were only  couples for whom we had blood        analyzed from both parents There remained no association        between paternal PCB exposure and odds of a male child when        we restricted our analysis to the frequent GLSCF consumers        only n   fathers  children Among the frequent        GLSCFconsuming mothers n   however the decreasing        aOR for a male child with increasing maternal PCB exposure        was still seen aOR per unit increase in the natural log of        PCB concentration   CI  Similar        analyses were done considering serum DDE concentrations        but we did not find consistent effects        We ran additional analyses after applying the        toxicokinetic model to revise measured serum PCB        concentrations to account for the time interval between the        childrens births and the blood draw from the parents We        ran these analyses with different decay constants for PCB        content in GLSCF over time We first performed these        analyses with either all fathers or all mothers but        because the toxicokinetic model we used assumes that a        persons GLSCF consumption is stable over time we also        performed the analyses after excluding the children of        those fathers n   and mothers n   who had        reported that their GLSCF consumption had changed a lot        Lastly because the toxicokinetic model is based on changes        in levels of fish contamination it may be more appropriate        for GLSCF consumers than nonconsumers of GLSCF Thus we        also ran the analyses after applying the toxicokinetic        model only to those subjects who consumed GLSCF while for        subjects who were not GLSCF consumers PCB concentrations        were left at the levels found at the time of the blood        draw        The relation between maternal PCB exposure and odds of a        male child was robust to revision of maternal serum PCB        concentrations based on the toxicokinetic model Regardless        of the decay constant exclusion of those who reported that        their GLSCF consumption changed a lot or application of        the model to GLSCF consumers only there was always a        decreasing trend in the odds ratio for a male child with        increasing maternal PCB exposure The only case in which        this decreasing trend did not reach significance at a         level of confidence was when mothers whose GLSCF        consumption changed a lot were excluded and the model was        applied to GLSCF consumers only in which case the upper         confidence limit was  Table  Revision of        paternal serum PCB concentration based on the toxicokinetic        model led to some categories of paternal exposure having        elevated odds ratios for a male birth but this reached         significance in only one case and in general the quintiles        with elevated odds ratios were not the highest exposure        quintiles Table  Regardless of the decay constant        exclusion of those who reported that their GLSCF        consumption changed a lot or application of the model to        GLSCF consumers only there was no indication of a linear        trend between odds of a male child and the natural log of        paternal PCB concentration                    Discussion        Our data suggest that maternal exposure to PCBs before        pregnancy in this case primarily through consumption of        contaminated fish from the Great Lakes is associated with        a decrease in the sex ratio of offspring These results        were robust to different assumptions about the decline in        PCB exposure from GLSCF over time There was some        suggestion in our data that some levels of paternal        exposure to PCBs may increase the sex ratio but these        results were weak and not consistent The mothers we        excluded from analysis tended to have higher PCB levels and        the sex ratio of their children was lower Thus the most        likely direction of any resulting bias from these        exclusions would have been against finding a decreasing sex        ratio with increasing PCB levels and so would be unlikely        to explain our findings among mothers Although the sex        ratio among the children of the fathers we excluded from        analysis was lower than among the children of those fathers        in our analysis the paternal PCB concentrations were        similar The low response rates for blood donation could        also have introduced bias the direction of which would be        difficult to predict To have contributed to the results we        report for maternal exposure those mothers who did not        donate blood compared to the mothers who did would have        had to have had either lower PCB levels and a lower sex        ratio among their last children or higher PCB levels and a        higher sex ratio among their children While suspected PCB        levels possibly surmised on the basis of fish consumption        may have contributed to the choice to donate blood or not        we do not see why this would additionally have been        systematically related to the sex ratio of the mothers        children        Previous studies have found changes in sex ratio        following exposure to hormonally active compounds and        different effects of chemicals on mothers and fathers could        have opposing effects on the sex ratio             Hormonally induced ovulation leads to a clear reduction in        the sex ratio of offspring     a result that has also        been found following paternal exposure to the nematocide        dibromochloropropane      Paternal but not        maternal exposure to dioxin following an explosion at an        herbicide factory in Seveso Italy was found to reduce the        sex ratio      In contrast among veterans of        Operation Ranch Hand the unit responsible for spraying        Agent Orange and other dioxincontaining herbicides in        Vietnam paternal dioxin levels greater than  ppt were        associated with an increased percentage of male children            In the latter study however maternal dioxin levels        were not measured although these would be expected not to        be above background and the paternal levels were likely        somewhat lower than levels in men exposed following the        Seveso incident        The most dramatic instances of PCB exposure were the        Yucheng and Yusho poisonings when rice oil used for        cooking was contaminated by heatdegraded PCBs during the        manufacturing process         Following this        incident no alteration of the sex ratio among children of        exposed mothers was found       although the sex        ratio of children born to fathers younger than  years at        the time of exposure was found to be reduced for        approximately  years following the exposure            The specific PCB congeners to which people were exposed        following the Yucheng and Yusho incidents may have been        somewhat different from those found in Great Lakes fish and        fish consumers          and unlike exposure        to PCBs from Great Lakes fish the Yucheng and Yusho        incidents also involved significant exposure to        polychlorinated dibenzofurans PCDFs as a result of        heating the contaminated rice oil for cooking              Whether these differences could explain the differences        in sex ratio findings between the Yusho and Yucheng        incidents and our findings is not clear        A study of Great Lakes fish consumers in Michigan also        found no relation between serum DDE concentrations and sex        ratio but did find that fathers with serum PCB        concentrations greater than  ngmL had a higher        percentage of male children OR for a male child          CI  than fathers with lower concentrations            There was no evidence of a linear trend between PCB        exposure and sex ratio in our data although in some        individual quintiles of PCB exposure in some of our        models our results were in the same direction as the        findings of the previous Michigan study     but        generally not significant The study of Michigan fish        consumers did not find a significant relation between a        dichotomous measure of maternal serum PCB concentration and        sex ratio Mothers with serum PCB concentration greater        than  ngmL had an odds ratio for a male child of          CI  compared to mothers with lower serum        PCB concentrations The pattern of our current results over        the quintiles of maternal serum PCB concentrations fig        and table  however suggest that a dichotomization of        the exposure could attenuate the odds ratio for a male        child as a function of maternal exposure        The sex ratio of live births could be affected as a        result of postconception effects of PCBs It has been        reported that maternal consumption of contaminated sport        fish from Lake Ontario reduces menstrual cycle length and        time to pregnancy       The sex ratio of live        births could be reduced if fecundity among women who        consume contaminated GLSCF is reduced because of an        increased rate of spontaneous abortion of male fetuses        Evidence may in fact suggest although there is some        debate that exposure of female rhesus monkeys to aroclor         a mixture of PCB congeners leads to a reduction in        the sex ratio of offspring possibly contributed to by        increased spontaneous abortion of male fetuses              Preconception parental estrogen levels have also been        hypothesized to affect the sex ratio of live births            and given the estrogenic and antiestrogenic actions of        different PCB congeners      this could be another        mechanism by which parental exposure to PCBs alters the sex        ratio        An important limitation of our study is that the serum        OC measurements were made several years after the birth        considered for analysis We attempted to mitigate against        this concern by running several analyses after revising the        serum OC concentrations according to a toxicokinetic model        to account for decreases in serum OC concentration during        the interval between the birth and the blood draw Our        results for maternal exposure were quite robust to changes        in the parameter of this model  as well as exclusion of        those subjects who reported that their GLSCF consumption        had changed a lot  although the results only hold insofar        as the model of OC decline is accurate It must also be        considered that an association between higher maternal PCB        levels and decreased odds of having a male child could be        produced if delivering a male child were related to more        rapid excretion of maternal PCBs in some way not related to        factors controlled for in our regression models An        additional limitation is not having measurements of other        possible contaminants It is possible that some chemical        or combination of chemicals other than PCBs in the fish        could lead to the changes in sex ratio we found although        this may be less likely given the specificity of our        results for serum PCB and not DDE Lastly it is possible        that these results could be confounded by fish consumption        itself if fish consumption affects the sex ratio although        we are not aware of any evidence to this effect                    Conclusions        Our data suggest that maternal exposure to PCBs may        decrease the sex ratio of offspring While there is some        suggestion that paternal exposure to PCBs may increase the        sex ratio this finding was not robust Nonetheless        caution may be warranted in interpreting null findings of        the effect of chemicals on the sex ratio as indicating no        effect because of the possibility of opposing effects of        maternal and paternal exposure Although the overall        decline in sex ratio over the past few decades may not be        attributable to general environmental contamination these        results add to the growing body of evidence that exposure        to particular chemicals can alter the sex ratio                    Competing interests        None of the authors have received reimbursements fees        funding or salary from an organization that may in any way
