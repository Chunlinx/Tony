        a tough one     yes it is  i know well i i believe in it   would you like to begin uhhuh do you feel like there should be any kinds of restrictions on when its   i think uh yes i do think that but i do think that i believe in it whole heartedly i really think that a lot of crime we have the criminal   obviously   you know element is just unreal i work in a high school here   uhhuh uhhuh   and it just boggles my mind whats happened over the last few years   really do you mean even with adolescents   you know ive been there fifteen sixteen years and just watching the mentality of our teenagers and and this tough stuff thats going on now you know   uhhuh do you feel that it should be applied to them as well then same kind of laws or   i uh well i think that they should tougher laws for the teenagers yes i do believe that not but not the uh capital punishment for them   umhum umhum   i really dont feel that but i do feel tougher laws but some way i feel they have to uh revise our criminal system   you think its too lenient over all   umhum i really do and i think that the um oh rehab is terrible you know they put them in there and theres too its just because of numbers though i understand the rehab is so big that they cant   yeah   but any way back to capital punishment i do believe in it for murderers and and especially um   uhhuh   oh you know when they actually thinking about it is that number one manslaughter something like that   oh premeditated you mean versus uh uhhuh uhhuh   i i dont know im not real sure premeditated right murder definitely of course i do feel that and then these   at this point most capital punishment is really uh related to murder though right i mean theres no capital punishment unless a life has been lost   umhum umhum   i think i think thats the right   right right and um   i wonder something i mean i believe as you do that something needs to change but i wonder sometimes what what makes an impact on criminals that do this kind of a crime i mean it it almost seems like they either dont believe itll ever be them thats caught or if they do they dont really value their lives enough to care if they would lose their lives   umhum thats true   its its i im not even sure i i feel uh in between i guess im im not sure that i have a strong commitment either direction because   umhum   i dont know enough about what what would motivate these people you know i do think that they are some times um   right   put in a rehabilitation program when theres really a very small chance of rehabilitation that that theyre coddled for too long and they get the kind of courtesies of our society that that   right umhum   the homeless would love to have you know somethings wrong here   yes yes thats right thats for sure   but its a tough one   well and sometimes the uh on the rehab uh ive just from being around the students that im around they know how to talk to the authorities they know exactly what to say to anybody in a   in in what respect   uh they know the right answers you know   like whats within their legal rights or do you mean how to manipulate the system   right whats well whats within their legal rights and how to manipulate them   uhhuh   and how to manipulate them just just they they answer to authority and to people to adults and that type of thing that they have to answer to or even the criminals do in to the people that count the judges and that type of thing you know they they usually answer to them   umhum umhum   in a way that like i said manipulative they just manipulate theyve manipulated manipulated so long so this is   so they feign for example that theyre really are um apologetic or what ever for their crime but theyre   umhum right and sorry right and very very sorrowful and then when they get out then we run into the problem of getting right back into a routine again of the same thing   but but you know that they arent umhum umhum im sure thats easily learned if they dont get it from their peers they get it from going through the system one time being in juvenile court or what ever   so umhum umhum   do you know if theres much of a difference between the law im im embarrassed to say i dont know between Texas and California what what difference is there   i really dont myself i really dont i know they permit it here but i dont know you know the difference in it actually   hum uhhuh yeah   in fact we just had um a person put to death uh about three weeks ago was in in Texas and i forget for the reason now oh it was for the uh that clergy that he murdered he murdered a uh   uhhuh   a uh it was a priest i believe he murdered   oh my uhhuh it is interesting to look at other cultures other countries and see how different their rates are you know you look at even um   umhum   countries like Saudi Arabia where theres a lot of emotion and sometimes an
