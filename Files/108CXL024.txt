              The Salvation Army  N Meridian Street Indianapolis IN            June        Name Address City ST Zip      Dear Mr Name      The Salvation Army received a note not long ago from a woman who makes      contributions to our programs from time to time Shed been thinking      about our Camping program for children      Her note explained that while driving through the country recently       in a rare moment when she didnt have a lot on her mind  she found      herself truly aware of her surroundings Lush green fields that      stretched for miles wisps of white clouds scattered across a clear      blue sky tranquil silence broken only by cheerful bird songs the      fresh sweet scent of morning air And she felt a sense of peace for the      first time in a long time      What a contrast from the city shed left a few miles back Filthy      sidewalks where children play Boardedup buildings where people live      Blaring sirens and horrendous crime She recalled a report on TV the      night before about a teenager who shot an even younger boy to death as      part of a gang initiation      She has a hard time understanding why things like this happen  why      some children have no respect for life not even their own      She wondered what would happen if she could take one child from the      city and place that youngster where she was now  in the midst of this      beauty and serenity What would change for that boy or girl      Thats when she thought about The Salvation Armys camping program      She remembered reading how kids from the Indiana cities spend a week      every summer at Hidden Falls Camp They spend most of their time      outdoors playing games with new friends discovering flowers theyve      never seen and creating treasures from sticks rocks and leaves Here      kids get their fill of good food love and attention  things many of      them get too little of at home      With her note she enclosed a check for  to send one child to camp      this summer Shed never given that much money before But she was      convinced it would make a difference            Its hard to explain exactly how camp can change a childs heart But      I know it does      Kids probably wonder what God looks like If I could speak to them I      would tell them they can see a great deal of God in the trees and stars      and streams that He created When theyre running with the wind in their      faces and the sun on their backs or stepping barefoot onto cool green      grass they would begin to understand what I mean      Im telling you all this because perhaps you too are asking      questions  why one child takes the life of another why children feel      so empty inside that they turn to drugs to fill the void why they have      so little selfworth that they value the friendship of thieves and      killers      And perhaps youre also asking What can I do      I dont have all the answers But I am certain of this You can make a      difference in one childs life by sending a gift to The Salvation Armys      camping program      It costs approximately  to send one boy or girl from Central      Indiana to camp for a week That may sound like a lot However when you      consider transportation food lodging crafts sports counseling and      much more you realize it covers a lot and equals what you might pay for      a night or two of lodging at a hotel      If you cant sponsor a child for a whole week perhaps you can send      enough for half a week  or even just one day Your contribution may      also be used to support our yearround programs for children      You see camp is only the first step Through the year we also offer      a number of different programs  including scouting basketball and      afterschool activities  to help children develop talents character      and selfesteem      Please prayerfully consider how much you can give and give just a      little more      I guarantee youll feel good knowing youve helped us touch a heart      Perhaps youll even save a life At the very least youll give one child      the chance to see Gods face and feel His love Often thats all it      takes to change a life      Blessings      Jack C Getz Major DIVISIONAL COMMANDER      PS The list of children who want to attend camp this year grows      longer every day and its important that we send every one of them With      your help no child will be disappointed Please send your most generous      gift today
