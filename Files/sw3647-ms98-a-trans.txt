        Brian in Plano Texas how are you doing today     hi fine im Nancy how are you   great Nancy   im in Plano also  yes were not too long distance today   youre in Plano also uh   well good to hear i was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania   oh that was good Utah ive had a couple of but that was it   really   yeah   all right well good to hear good to hear     learned about their basketball team     which one   uh Jazz   oh yeah the Utah Jazz   yeah yeah   yeah theyre theyre pretty good they got some   thats what i heard yeah   good  good some good uh good players out there   yeah   well you ready for New Years Eve   i am   good should we uh start this so we can what was your name again Nancy thats right and im Brian just a moment   okay Nancy right right     okay Nancy the i guess the todays subject is benefits in a job other than salary what uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as as crucial benefits   right uhhuh well im a little different than other people because i dont have benefits with my job   uhhuh   im a nurse and i work i float   oh uhhuh   so that i have no benefits except higher pay for doing that   right uhhuh   so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance and i i make enough money by the hour to make up for that   to to compensate for some of the benefits oh   right uhhuh yeah its cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace   yes   and then i have my freedom i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do   well thats thats an excellent so actually that is a benefit uh   well it is to me most people prefer the security of nine to five and weekends off and     yeah   knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement and im just really not interested in all that   right right well i guess thats a good point uh i do belong to a a large corporation or my that where im currently employed   uhhuh   and theres uh theres some different things uh one that youve already mentioned is is health insurance i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a through a group plan   right   as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasnt employed with a large corporation and that got to be somewhat expensive and so i i think one of the benefits i i see is the uh is the group uh group discount   yeah right and especially if you have a family then i think it makes a big difference   yeah and yes and thats thats one thing i do have   yeah   if i didnt have a family i dont think i would have as as a male or as a as an individual of in this stage of my life i dont think i would have insurance uh other   right   i dont think i would go through that expense one other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job i really enjoyed because they had what was called a flex schedule where i could go and i could work uh nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours or i could do uh work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a four you know three week day weekend   oh yeah right   and make uh make my job flexible in that case   could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week   well basically yeah i had to do that uh the same uh for about every quarter of the year i mean   uhhuh   uh because i was in a in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that uh i needed to make my schedule uh so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel so   umhum   so i i think that uh that was a that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed and i dont currently have that in my current operation but uh   yeah   you mentioned uh flexible work schedule and thats thats good   yeah   and uh what other benefits do you think are important   oh well i guess retirement that kind of thing which i dont worry much about so     yeah yeah thats true     i just prefer to worry about today and probably not a practical attitude but thats who i am so   well and thats an individual thing   umhum   yeah with uh with our current uh organization we do have a nice retirement package and also a a nice thing that that we have in our corporation is a uh is a profit sharing plan where we can uh participate in the the profits of the company if were you know if weve been there a while and were vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the company that we can   right   uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times and uh also uh in one of my wifes uh companies where she worked theyd had a real nice profit sharing plan that that effectively they made a certain
