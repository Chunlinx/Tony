                    Introduction        The interaction of MS coat protein with its        translational operator is one of the bestunderstood        examples of RNAprotein recognition having been studied        extensively by genetic biochemical and structural means          The primary and secondary structures of operator RNA        are shown in Figure  This RNA hairpin makes contacts with        both subunits of a coat protein dimer One of the most        important features of the complex of coat protein with its        RNA target is the insertion of two unpaired adenosines into        equivalent pockets on different subunits of the coat dimer        Figure  The interactions of A and A with coat        protein involve nonidentical contacts with the same five        amino acid residues namely Val Thr Ser Thr and        Lys    Xray crystallographic analysis infers        specific amino acidnucleotide contacts but does not by        itself allow a clear definition of their individual        contributions to RNAbinding and translational repression        In the experiments described here we introduced amino acid        substitutions of Apocket amino acids in singlechain coat        protein heterodimers in order to determine the role of each        residue in interaction with A and A                    Results and Discussion                  Rationale          Amino acid substitutions in the RNAbinding site of          coat protein including substitutions of Apocket          residues result in reduced affinity for translational          operator RNA and therefore compromise its ability to          carry out translational repression However since coat          protein is a symmetric homodimer substitutions are          necessarily introduced simultaneously into both halves of          the molecule making it difficult to distinguish the          separate effects of mutations on binding of different          halves of the asymmetric RNA ligand We previously          described a means of making this distinction based on the          phenomenon we call heterodimer complementation We have          explained its basis in detail elsewhere    but the          basic ideas are depicted in Figure and briefly          reiterated here          Heterodimer complementation relies on the ability to          genetically fuse the two subunit of coat protein            thus producing a singlechain dimer in which the two          subunits are covalently linked This fused dimer has the          same RNAbinding and capsid assembly properties typical          of coat protein itself with the important difference          that the two halves of the molecule can be manipulated          separately In other words we can produce heterodimers          that contain different amino acid substitutions in their          two halves          Because of its symmetry and because it binds an          asymmetric ligand coat protein bears two equivalent          RNAbinding sites related to each another by a dyad          symmetry axis Since the RNA ligand makes contacts with          both subunits each binding site is made up of amino          acids contributed by both monomers We think of each of          the two equivalent symmetryrelated RNAbinding sites as          being comprised each of two halfsites where we define a          halfsite as representing the contribution of a subunit          to one complete binding site see Figure  After RNA          binding the subunits can be distinguished by the          asymmetric nature of their contacts with RNA We follow          the convention of Valegard et al   and refer to the          two subunits as A and B Thus we can think of each          binding site as being made up of A and B halfsites In          homodimers any mutational defect in either half site          occurs in both halves of the dimer and both binding sites          are affected However the introduction of a mutation          into one subunit of a singlechain heterodimer causes a          defect in only one halfsite and therefore inactivates          only one of the two RNAbinding sites Because one          binding site remains intact such mutantwildtype          heterodimers are functional repressors except in cases          where the mutation affects a residue that plays a role in          both halfsites When different binding site lesions are          introduced into the two subunits thereby creating a          mutantmutant heterodimer several outcomes are possible          If for example one lesion affects halfsite A and the          other affects halfsite B one of the RNAbinding sites          is doubly defective but the other is left intact          Consequently such heterodimers are active repressors In          the context of the work presented in this paper this          means that if a particular Apocket mutation is          functional for translational repression in combination          with a lesion in halfsite A it must affect half site B          where from previous genetic and structural mapping we          know it interacts with A If on the other hand it          complements a half site B lesion then it must primarily          play a role in halfsite A where it binds A          Heterodimers that contain either half site A lesions or          halfsite B lesions in both subunits are inactive          repressors If a mutation complements defects in neither          of the halfsites then the identity of the amino acid is          judged important for interaction with both A and          A          It should be noted that Figure is an imperfect          representation While it illustrates the basic idea of          heterodimer complementation for the sake of simplicity          it fails to adequately illustrate certain features of the          binding sites In particular it does not show that the          two binding sites are in reality overlapping In fact          the purpose of this paper is to attempt to distinguish          features within the overlap by defining the roles of          Apocket residues and assigning them to halfsites          The reader should also be alert to the possibility of          confusing Apocket which is shorthand for          adenosinebinding pocket with the term halfsite A          which refers to those amino acids involved in binding RNA          on subunit A of the coat protein dimer          To implement the heterodimer complementation scheme we          created a series of substitutions of each of the Apocket          amino acids For each mutant we constructed four          different kinds of singlechain dimers Mutant homodimers          have the same defect in both submits Wildtypemutant          heterodimers have a mutation in only one subunit and tell          us whether the identity of the mutated Apocket amino          acid is important on only one half of the dimer The          other two types of constructs were heterodimers of          Apocket substitutions with either YH or TI We used          YH to inactivate halfsite A where A is bound and          TI to inactivate halfsite B the site of A          interaction These are wellcharacterized substitutions          of amino acids whose roles in RNA binding are known from          biochemical genetic and structural studies Mutations          that restore translational repression when paired in          heterodimers with YH map to halfsite B while those          that complement TI map to halfsite A Effects on          translational repression were determined by measuring the          galactosidase activity produced from           lacz fused to the translational          operator in the plasmid called pRZ Wildtype coat          protein typically represses galactosidase synthesis to          about  of the unrepressed value          A note about nomenclature We name mutant homodimers          by placing the numeral  in front of the amino acid          substitution For example the VA singlechain homodimer          we call VA We name heterodimers by listing both          substitutions with the mutation in the monomer given          first for example VAYH VATI or VAWT          where WT refers to the wildtype sequence The plasmid          called pCTdl contains the WTWT singlechain          homodimer sequence   We used pUCter as a          nonrepressing control                            Assessing the native structure of mutants          The ability of coat protein to fold correctly is          sometimes sensitive to amino acid substitution To ensure          that any particular mutation does not grossly perturbed          coat protein structure we subjected each of the mutant          proteins to a test of its ability to assemble into          viruslike particles   an activity sensitive to          folding defects This was accomplished by subjecting cell          lysates to electrophoresis in agarose gels followed by          blotting to nitrocellulose membranes Probing with          antiMS serum and Iprotein A reveals the amount and          the electrophoretic mobility of the coat protein produced          by each plasmid construct Since viruslike particles          have a characteristic electrophoretic behavior this          provides a simple means of assessing a mutant for          acquisition of native protein structure We have used          this method extensively to assess the proper folding of          coat protein and representative results can be seen in          previous publications from this laboratory             Our results showed that some mutations disrupted coat          protein structure when introduced into the conventional          dimer Specifically substitutions of Val and Lys          generally resulted in failure to produce viruslike          particles while Ser and Thr tolerated all the          substitutions we introduced We previously reported that          Thr has a remarkable sensitivity to substitution and          that fusion of coat protein subunits in the singlechain          dimer reverts these and other coat protein structural          defects    This was also the case with the mutants          we describe here all of which formed normal or near          normal amounts of capsids in singlechain homodimers and          in their heterodimers with wildtype YH and TI          results not shown                          Testing the roles of the individual Apocket ammo          acids                      Thr            Xray structural analysis suggests that the hydroxyl            of ThrA makes Hbonds with N and N of A ThrB            is said to Hlbond with N and N of A    In a            forerunner of the current work we determined the            effects of introducing all  amino acid substitutions            of Thr and created heterodimer constructs to test the            separate roles of the two Thrs on binding of A and            A In summary we found that RNA binding activity            tolerates substitution of ThrB but not of ThrA In            other words Thr makes crucial contacts with A but            tolerates substitutions in the site where A is            bound These experiments were related in an earlier            report   and are not further elaborated here                                Val            Structural analysis shows that the side chain of            Val approaches the faces of both A and A in            their respective binding pockets We previously            isolated a mutant VI which increases the size of            the side chain while retaining its aliphatic character            The VI mutant is a translational superrepressor             in vivo and binds RNA fold            more tightly             in vitro   This suggested            that the increased size of the isoleucine side chain            compared to valine might improve a hydrophobic            interaction with one or both adenosines Here we            describe the introduction of other substitutions of            Val that seek to determine the role of the size of            the hydrophobic sidechain VA reduces the size of            the sidechain asking whether Val approaches the As            closely enough to provide a stackinglike interaction            VL like VI provides a greater surface area for            interaction VF increases the bulk of the side chain            even further as do VY and VW            The introduction of alanine at position  must            severely disrupt proteinRNA contacts since            translational repression is abolished nearly completely            in the VA homodimer Table  Being smaller the            alanine side chain apparently is unable to form as good            interaction with the adenosines as does valine The            fact that the VAYH and VATI heterodimers only            partially recover repressor activity and to about the            same extent indicates that Val makes contacts of            roughly equal importance at both A and A In other            words the VA substitution fails to complement fully            mutations in halfsites A and B On the other hand            several amino acids with larger side chains each of            them hydrophobic or predominantly so are acceptable            replacements In fact as we have already said VI            represses better than wildtype VL is also a            competent represser nearly as good as wildtype as            are also the VLWT VLYH and VLTI            heterodimers Both VF and VY showed only small            defects in repression defects which were not fully            corrected in any of the heterodimer constructs            Tryptophan was the bulkiest substitution we introduced            and it resulted in a fairly severe represser defect            when present in both halves of the dimer VW            However nearly all the repressor activity was restored            in the VWWT heterodimer The observation that            repression is restored more completely in VWTI            than in VWYH indicates that the effects of the            VW substitution are more severe in the pocket where            A is bound                                Ser            On structural grounds Ser has been thought to            contribute to RNAbinding in both Apockets               The O of SerA appears to Hbond to N of A while            the O of the SerB side chain Hbonds to N of A            We previously showed that introduction of arginine at            position  resulted in a repressor defect   and            heterodimer complementation experiments suggested that            SR disrupts an interaction with A   The            results presented here confirm and extend the earlier            result using more subtle substitutions The mutant            called SC replaces Ser with cysteine which is            isosteric with serine but a poorer Hbonder            Substitution with alanine in SA entirely eliminates            the ability to form an Hbond Both SA and SC are            repressordefective and by about the same amount            Table  Repression is restored to wildtype levels            in the SAYH and SCYH heterodimers but not in            SATI or SCTI Therefore the identity of Ser            is only important in the Apocket where it contacts            A through an Hbond with N The interaction with            A predicted from xray structural analysis            apparently makes little or no contribution to RNA            binding energy                                Thr            Together with Lys Thr forms one wall of each of            the Abinding pockets Its close proximity to both A            and A suggests substitutions here might affect RNA            binding In fact the main chain carbonyl of residue             appears to be Hbonded to the exocyclic amino group            N of A in subunit A We already know from the            effects of amino acid substitutions previously            introduced here that the identity of residue  is of            some importance For example TA and TS are both            repressordefective             in vivo    although there            seems to be some disagreement as to exactly how            defective TS is for RNA binding             in vitro    On the other            hand glutamine seems to be tolerated here since TQ            is a good repressor   Inspection of the crystal            structure suggests a possible reason for the importance            of Thr The methyl groups of the Thrs approach the            faces of both A and A and this may help provide a            hydrophobic environment for the bases Neither alanine            TA nor serine TS can perform this function We            constructed TL and TI to test the effects of some            other hydrophobic side chains The proximities of the            Thrs to the two As also suggest the possibility of            engineering stacking interactions by the substitution            of threonine with each of the aromatic amino acids in            the mutants we will call TF TY and TW            The various Thr substitutions we constructed are            all virtually as active as wildtype in heterodimer            combinations with WT and with YH the halfsite A            lesion Table  On the other hand each of the            mutations is about as defective in heterodimers with            TI as it is in each of the Thr mutant homodimers            This means that Thr plays a role in binding RNA in            halfsite B where A is bound This confirms the            results of earlier heterodimer complementation            experiments that already showed that TS is a member            of halfsite B   However these new results show            that a range of substitutions of Thr are well            tolerated in halfsite A while a range of            substitutions in halfsite B compromise translational            repression each to a comparable extent            The crystal structure of TS in complex with            wildtype RNA has been determined   It showed only            slight differences compared to wildtype Several            possible structural explanations for poor repression by            TS were offered  The loss of the Thr methyl            group results in a reduction of hydrophobic interaction            area of  out of   total This should reduce            binding affinity somewhat but seems insufficient to            account for the observed             in vivo defect  The TS            mutants may pay a higher entropic cost in binding RNA            since Ser could be more mobile than Thr  The            most significant structural change in the TSRNA            complex was the movement of GluB and the apparent            loss of a water molecule bound to its side chain Since            GluB resides within A of A G and G it was            suggested that GluB could interact with these bases            transiently in the binding pathway Our results confirm            that the important changes are indeed associated with            subunit B We also point out that the RNA main chain            passes near ThrB causing us to wonder whether some            substitutions here create steric clashes thus            contributing to an RNAbinding defect by introducing an            unfavorable contact                                Lys            The aliphatic portions of the side chains of both            Lyss may play roles in RNA binding since they cross            the faces of both adenosines In addition the amino            group of Lys seems to interact on the B subunit            through salt links with the phosphates of A and            G The importance of these phosphate contacts has            been supported by the results of phophorothioate            substitutions   Structurallybased predictions of            the role of Lys on the A subunit on the other hand            are less clear It appears to have some flexibility in            its complex with wildtype RNA since its electron            density is weak    It is located roughly in            position to interact with the ribose or the phosphate            of A Moreover in complex with a variant RNA it is            seen to interact through its amino group with the            phosphate of nucleotide    Phosphorothioate            substitution implicates the A phosphate in            interaction with protein but since LysA also forms a            contact here a possible involvement of LysA is            obscured            We previously isolated the KR mutant which            replaces Lys with arginine resulting in a repressor            defect Heterodimer constructs with the KR mutant            already showed that the identity of Lys is important            in both halves of the dimer   In other words            arginine fails to functionally substitute for lysine            even when it is present on only one subunit of the            dimer In the present study we made additional            mutations To eliminate most of the sidechain KA            introduces alanine at this position KM was            constructed to test the role of the amino group            Methionine has a hydrophobic side chain about the same            length as the aliphatic portion of the lysine side            chain but lacks the terminal amino group The close            proximity of Lys to both A and A suggests the            possibility that the introduction of aromatic residues            may allow stacking interactions We therefore also            constructed KF KY and KW            The substitutions introduced at position             generally resulted in severe repressor defects Table            IV Most of these defects are only partially corrected            in heterodimers with wildtype or with YH and            generally are not improved at all in heterodimers with            TI It is notable that the KM substitution which            was designed to preserve the aliphatic characteristics            of the lysine side chain while eliminating its amino            group causes a severe repressor defect in mutant            homodimers Repression is only slightly improved in            heterodimers of KM with TI with somewhat greater            improvement when combined with YH These results            suggest that the identity of the Lyss is important            for interaction with both A and A and further            that the amino groups contribute importantly to the            energy of interaction on both subunits of the dimer            perhaps somewhat more importantly at A ie            LysB                                      Conclusions        The results we present here emphasize the importance of        combined functional and structural approaches to        understanding molecular interactions Some of the contacts        observed in the xray structure of the MS RNAprotein        complex clearly make little or no contribution to its        stability Our results are summarized in Figure  where we        schematically illustrate the important interactions at A        and A in the context of the structure of the whole        translational operator To recapitulate Val and Lys        make important stabilizing interactions with both A and        A On the other hand the contributions of Thr Ser        and Thr are highly asymmetric Thr contributes to        binding only through its interaction with A while the        effects of Ser and Thr are confined to their        interactions with A                    Materials and Methods                  Sitedirected Mutagenesis and Recombinant          DNA          Mutations were introduced by sitedirected mutagenesis

region of each mutant was determined          Fused dimers were constructed as derivatives of          pCTdl a plasmid whose construction and properties          have been described elsewhere                            Analysis of coat protein and galactosidase          expression          The ability of the coat mutants to assemble into          viruslike particles was assessed by agarose gel          electrophoresis and western blot   Blotted coat          proteins were visualized using antiMS serum and          Iprotein A The relative           in vivo RNA binding activities of          the various mutants are reflected in their abilities to          repress translation of a replicasegalactosidase fusion          expressed from pRZ in E coli strain CSHF            Assays of galactosidase activity were performed by the          method of Miller   The values we report are the          averages of three assays Although there is some          variability in these measurements the variations are          usually no larger than  and never exceed
