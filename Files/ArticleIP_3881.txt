                       ScenesFrom a Marriage                        Steven ELandsburgs otherwise excellent analysis in The MarriageContract omits the case where there is a third party involved ie thekids If Tom and Gerri would each individually be better off with a divorcebut their kid Terri would be worse off to a greater degree than the sum of thebenefits to Tom and Gerri and may not be involved in the negotiationswouldnt it be safe to say that the covenant marriage is clearly superior inmaximizing total wellbeing             AndrewBrecher Washington                           SoulMan                        In Plain Folk an otherwisefine review of The Anthology of American Folk Music  Luc Sante statesIt is just as surprising to find out that such bluesmen as Hutchinson andRichard Rabbit Brown were white            This was asurprise to me because I was sure that among the very few biographical detailsknown about Brown was the fact that he was black Ive checked several sourcesand had this confirmed and seen nothing to the contrary There is nothing tothis effect in the liner notes I therefore wonder what the basis for Santesstatement may have been             Tom

assertion that the equity stock option market issimply a big casino that contributes nothing to the smooth functioning ofcapital markets is both wrong and silly Equity options just like commodityand currency futures can and often do serve a hedging function Consider forexample someone who owns shares of IBM at  and has a  paper profit onthe stock If that investor were willing to pay extra for the security oflimited downside she could buy put options with a strike price of  whichwould lock in her profit on the shares at  less whatever the options costHardly the act of a speculator in a casino            Equityoptions themselves arent the problemthey have legitimate usesand withoutthe ability to lock in positions that equity options offer certain folks mightnot be in the equity market in the first place People like Wade Cook are theproblem I wish Surowiecki had made that distinction             Joe Osha New YorkCity                           To DiFor                        The very insinuation thatHillary Rodham Clinton could possibly have anything to learn from PrincessDiana was intriguing enough to make me click on Margaret Carlsons Hillary and DiThough I had hoped for something more interesting than spin control for womenin a mans world I was impressed with the breathtakingly casual lack offairness to the first lady that created the intriguing premise            Carlson contends that Dianawas more successful for her causes than Hillary has been for hers even thoughDiana was clearly less committed to her charity work than to her jetsettinglifestyle Carlson writes that land mines made it onto the worlds agendabecause Diana put them there implying that Diana was a success and thatthere are still  million people with no health insurance implying thatHillary is a failure            Apparently Carlson isunfamiliar with the old saying about apples and oranges All Diana had to do tosucceed in Carlsons mind was to get people talking The first lady on theother hand had to actually make an unprecedented change in American publicpolicy before she could measure up If we use the same standard for bothHillary was a great success more people talked about health care than aretalking about land mines and at best the jury is still out on Diana thoughI imagine land mines will go on killing people for decades to come            Im afraidthat Carlson has been infected with the same virus epidemic since Dianasdeath that makes people recast all criteria for a good and successful life interms that only Diana can meet No matter that another woman might have donemore good than Diana She doesnt stand a chanceunless she too has thepublic relations windfall of a spectacular and tragic death Thats quite alegacy for the late princess

cities He commended our arts and entertainment coveragebut concluded that something is missing  namely the city A morecomprehensive review of the online city guides might have led Plotz to thecommunity section of CitySearch San Francisco where he might have found the city hewas looking for            He saidthat the local guides ignore politics although we list and describe the workof over  activist organizations in the Bay Area and  municipal agenciesThe charge that our guide is limited to capsule reviews and shortcheerleading columns about yuppiedom is unfair We write about and for anaudience that reflects the vast sociological spectrum that is part and parcelof San Francisco life Plotz concludes that online guides perceive of citiessolely as places of consumption but at CitySearch San Francisco we cantjust gobble up our citywe have to live in it too             Marc Voglpolitics and activism editorCitySearch San Francisco                           Contact                        Regarding Stephen HarrigansEndlessSummer on plot holes in Contact  please allow me to nitpick yournitpicking You remark on the implausibility of Matthew McConaughey eatingCracker Jack in the Costa Rican jungle that whole sequence takes place inArecibo Puerto Rico which when I last checked was a commonwealth of theUnited States One can safely assume that they import certain rare delicaciesfrom the mainland            You wonder at how after thedestruction of the extremely expensive machine another one is built onHokkaido the entire premisespelled out in the filmwas that two were builtat the same time one as a backup Nor does John Hurts millionaire eccentricfloat around on his own custommade Mir He is actually on Mir where hesays the Russians are happy to rent him space Finally you express shock thatthe alien Jodie Foster meets speaks English The whole point is that upon herarrival they read her memories Or didnt you find it odd that an alienintelligence appeared to her in the form of her father            Now whydidnt you complain about something really important like how fake thecomputer displays were I mean everyone knows that in real life computersdont have D displays and make cool noises Those pesky movies             MichaelTritter New York City                           Stephen Harriganreplies As to the Puerto Rico vs Costa Rica issue I am gravely wrong Iapologize to the readers of Slate  the makers of Contact  themanufacturer of Cracker Jack and the citizens of the territories andcommonwealths of the United States                                       GIJane                        I feel the need to bring toyour attention a major major flaw in One WomansWar Sarah Kerrs review of GI Jane  Toward the end of thisreview Kerr makes one of the most absurd statements I have ever read It leftme wondering if she is mentally competent let alone capable of intelligentlyreviewing a film            Heres what she said afterdisclosing that she recently saw Demi Moore on a talk show looking morefeminine like an innocent wistful pixie than her onscreen character inGI Jane  She did not seem to be a person likely to say suck mydick Its tempting to conclude from this that shes empty at the core tryingon different personas to hide her lack of a self            Hello Ms Kerr are youfamiliar with the term acting Thats what Demi Moore does for a living andthats what she was doing in GI Jane  Why should it be a surprise thatan actor appears different in real life from an onscreen persona Do youexpect Sigourney Weaver to tote around an Uzi in real life looking for aliensto shoot If you saw Patrick Stewart on a talk show and he wasnt wearing hisStar Trek uniform would you assume that he was empty at the core            Someonewith such a clear lack of understanding of the distinction between acting andbeing should perhaps not be writing movie reviews                           JamesFlood Baltimore                           Address your
