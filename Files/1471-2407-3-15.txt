                    Background        Lymphadenectomies with routine histopathologic        evaluation have been performed for staging and regional        control of primary cutaneous melanoma even in cases        without clinical evidence of metastasis Because of        significant morbidity associated with the procedure        regional lymphadenectomy has been generally recommended        only for patients with evidence of regional lymph node        involvement     To assess the involvement of regional        lymph nodes the biopsies of sentinel lymph nodes are        invaluable for detecting occult metastases without the        significant morbidity associated with lymphadenectomy                  Previous studies have reported that the        status of sentinel lymph node is an accurate reflection of        the regional lymph node status as a whole and that        treatment decisions can be made based on the results of        sentinel lymph nodes alone              Previously we had demonstrated higher diagnostic        accuracy in detecting and diagnosing melanoma        micrometastases in sentinel lymph node using monoclonal        antibodies to MART clone MC and MelanA clone        A in comparison to the traditionally used        immunohistochemical markers S protein S and        HMB     The cytoplasmic staining with these        immunomarkers does not obscure the nuclear details and        facilitates accurate interpretation of tumor cells        macrophages and nevus cells in contrast to S             A monoclonal antibody to a third melanoma immunomarker        Tyrosinase clone T showed an immunostaining pattern        similar to MART and MelanA            In the present study we evaluated the combination of        monoclonal antibodies MART MelanA and Tyrosinase in        optimized titers Table  for evaluation of sentinel lymph        nodes of cutaneous melanoma We designated this combination        after our institution as MCW melanoma cocktail             Hypothetically due to the immunoreactivity of the cocktail        towards three epitopes of two antigens in the same tissue        section combined use of these immunomarkers should        increase the sensitivity while still maintaining their        individual high specificity The possibility of using a        cocktail of these monoclonal antibodies for the evaluation        of melanoma sentinel lymph node would require only one        section as compared to three adjacent sections for each of        the immunomarker with resultant cost savings of        approximately two thirds        The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of        detecting and interpreting micrometastases in the sentinel        lymph nodes of patients with cutaneous melanoma utilizing        this cocktail in a single section instead of three adjacent        sections needing each of the three immunomarkers in the        cocktail We also compared the cocktail against MART and        MelanA individually                    Methods        Sentinel lymph node specimens were grossed as described        previously     Formalinfixed paraffinembedded tissue        sections of  slices were evaluated with the cocktail        Figure  In some cases more than one lymph nodes were        submitted as sentinel lymph nodes The fresh unfixed        sentinel lymph nodes were transected into slices no thicker        than  mm across the long axis from one pole to the other        They were fixed flat in formalin after wrapping them in        tissue paper to avoid curling and were processed for        paraffin embedding        The test group included  slices of  sentinel lymph        nodes  to  slices per lymph node from  cases  to         lymph nodes per case of AJCC stage I and II cutaneous        melanoma lacking metastases which were easily detectable in        sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin These lymph        nodes were from various regions other than the axillary        areas A negative test control group was studied to verify        the specificity of the cocktail It consisted of  slices        of  sentinel lymph nodes  to  slices per lymph node        from the axillary area in  cases of mammary carcinoma of        which  slices were positive for mammary carcinoma        metastases Figure         All the sections in the test group and negative control        group were immunostained with the cocktail the details of        antibodies in the cocktail are shown in Table  As a        standardization process to confirm positive        immunoreactivity  melanomas including one spindle cell        melanoma and one clear cell melanoma were evaluated All         melanomas were immunoreactive with the cocktail        Antibodies from a few additional sources other than those        mentioned in Table  were also evaluated However only        the antibodies from the sources mentioned in Table with        heat antigen retrieval protocol achieved optimum results        without significant background staining        The sections were pretreated for antigen retrieval using        Dako pH  target retrieval solution Dako Corporation        Carpinteria CA at C for  minutes and cooled at        room temperature for  minutes The target retrieval        solution must be at a temperature of C from the        start The duration of this heat antigen retrieval step was        crucial for avoiding nonspecific background staining It        was optimal for all the three antibodies in the        cocktail        Threemicron thick serial sections of paraffinembedded        tissue blocks were numbered consecutively from  to         Section  was stained with hematoxylin and eosin Section         was immunostained with melanoma cocktail using        Diaminobenzidine Hydrochloride DAB as a chromogen        Section  was used as a negative control without primary        antibody A positive control consisting of a formalinfixed        paraffinembedded tissue section of melanoma demonstrating        reactivity for the cocktail was processed with each batch        of slides Two adjacent sections were immunostained with        MART and MelanA respectively during our previous study        on  out of  slices from  cases     The        immediately adjacent unstained sections during the previous        study were used They were immunostained with the cocktail        in this study        Five pathologists interpreted all immunostained slides        independently to determine the presence of melanoma        micrometastases Whenever indicated respective adjacent        hematoxylin and eosin stained sections and negative control        sections were also used to facilitate the final        interpretation        Statistical evaluation for degree of interobserver        agreement was based on the Receiver Operating        Characteristic ROC curve which takes into consideration        the nonbinary spectrum of surgical pathology        interpretation          For the generation of        the ROC curve and to calculate the areas under the ROC        curves Az values the spectrum of the interpretation was        spread into five points with negative and positive at each        end            A consensus binary negative or positive diagnosis was        reached by all five pathologists in tandem under a        multihead microscope This was used as the final diagnosis        for statistical analysis Az values by different observers        for  sections were compared using nonparametric methods        based on the MannWhitney statistics     SAS        statistical software The SAS institute Cary NC was        implemented for this statistical analysis Table                     Results        Of the  sections immunostained with melanoma        cocktail  sections  cases were positive for        melanoma micrometastases Figure A B Az values for        the cocktail by all five pathologists were high and ranged        from  to  maximum possible Az value is         without statistically significant differences p         Table         In general the micrometastases were subtle and        difficult to detect in the hematoxylin and eosin stained        sections alone Depending on the observer micrometastases        of melanoma in  slices were detectable in only  of        hematoxylin and eosin sections However with closer        methodical scrutiny these micrometastases were seen        retrospectively in all  adjacent sections stained with        hematoxylin and eosin All  sections from sentinel lymph        nodes of mammary carcinoma in the negative test control        group Figure  were interpreted unequivocally as negative        for melanoma micrometastases by each of the five        pathologists Figure C        Out of  slices a pool of sections immunostained        individually with MART and MelanA during our previous        study Figure  were compared with the cocktail Melanoma        micrometastases were detected in  of  slices        immunostained with MART and MelanA individually        However  slices demonstrated micrometastases with the        cocktail These four slices from  lymph nodes of         cases negative for micrometastases with MART and        MelanA showed melanoma micrometastases predominantly as        single cells These micrometastases were detectable        retrospectively in adjacent sections stained with        hematoxylin and eosin in all four slices Thus MART and        MelanA individually could not detect micrometastases in          of the slices No sections which were negative        for micrometastases with the cocktail demonstrated        micrometastases with MART and MelanA individually        The melanoma cocktail did not show background staining        of nonmelanocytic cells in the sentinel lymph nodes        Figure and  and demonstrated immunostaining pattern        identical to MART and MelanA reported previously              slices from   of the cases showed        groups of cohesive spindle cells which were immunoreactive        for the cocktail in the capsule of sentinel lymph nodes        The bland nuclear morphology of these spindle cells was        consistent with benign capsular melanocytic nevi Figure         None of the  sections of sentinel lymph nodes from         cases of mammary carcinoma demonstrated benign capsular        melanocytic nevi                    Discussion        At present histomorphologic examination with        immunohistochemistry remains the most reliable and        practical means of detecting melanoma micrometastases in        sentinel lymph nodes      MART and MelanA are two        antibodies to different epitopes of the same antigen and        are complementary to each other As previously reported        MART and MelanA demonstrated predominantly cytoplasmic        staining of melanoma cells     The monoclonal antibody        T to tyrosinase has been reported to demonstrate high        sensitivity and specificity for melanoma     It has        also demonstrated an immunostaining pattern in sentinel        lymph nodes identical to MART and MelanA We combined        these three antibodies as MCW melanoma cocktail Table                In contrast to S these immunomarkers did not        obscure nuclear details In addition they did not stain        the dendritic cells which are generally prominent in the        sentinel lymph nodes after the diagnostic biopsy of a        primary lesion This facilitated unequivocal interpretation        of singly scattered melanoma cells which were otherwise        impossible to identify in sections immunostained for S        due to high noise to signal ratio resulting from numerous        S immunoreactive dendritic cells in the background        Thus a highly sensitive immunomarker such as S is less        effective for interpretation of sentinel lymph nodes for        melanoma micrometastases especially when present as single        cells than MART and MelanA     Certain        morphological features help to differentiate melanoma cells        and other nonmelanoma cells such as S immunoreactive        dendritic cells in sentinel lymph nodes However as        demonstrated in our previous study it is not uncommon to        face an equivocal situation when S protein is used as        an immunomarker for the interpretation of single melanoma        micrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes     Based on        our previous study with HMB    and an initial study        with micropthalmia transcription factor     these        immunomarkers were not considered suitable for inclusion in        the cocktail due to the immunoreactivity of nonmelanoma        cells in the sentinel lymph nodes        During further evaluation we confirmed that the single        cells immunostained with HMB were mast cells and not        melanophages Although not reported in the literature mast        cells in mastocytosis and reactive mast cells in desmoid        tumors also showed immunoreactivity for HMB with granular        cytoplasmic immunostaining pattern The same cells in the        immediately adjacent section were confirmed as mast cell by        CD personal experience Lack of similar staining in        the negative control sections excludes their nonspecific        nature Mast cells are relatively frequent in sentinel        lymph nodes likely secondary to the previous biopsy in the        draining field personal experience Occasionaly these        cells may present an interpretation challenge but they can        usually be interpreted as benign     To avoid this        interference by HMB and its lower sensitivity in general        HMB was not incorporated in the cocktail        Out of  sections immunostained with the cocktail and        interpreted by all five pathologists collectively  were        positive for melanoma micrometastases Figure Aand B Az        values amongst the five pathologists interpreting these        sections independently did not show statistically        significant differences demonstrating excellent        interobserver agreement with the cocktail Table  None        of the  sections of mammary carcinoma sentinel lymph        nodes showed immunoreactivity for the cocktail in any of        the nonmelanoma cells Figure C and were interpreted as        negative for melanoma micrometastases by all five        observers        The cocktail showed favorable detection rate for        melanoma micrometastases as compared to MART and MelanA        alone Of  sections  sections were positive for        melanoma micrometastases with the cocktail However only         were positive with MART and MelanA individually        Thus MART and MelanA could not individually detect        melanoma micrometastases in   of slices that were        positive for melanoma micrometastases with the cocktail As        expected combining a monoclonal antibody to tyrosinase        with MART and MelanA in the cocktail increased the        spectrum to encompass three epitopes of two melanoma        antigens MARTMelanA and tyrosinase If indicated in        the future additional monoclonal antibodies showing        immunostaining patterns in sentinel lymph nodes that are        similar to these three antibodies which also posess high        specificity for melanoma may be added to this cocktail by        widening the spectrum for many melanoma specific antigen        epitopes However care should be taken to not include any        antibody that may immunostain other nonmelanoma cells in        the sentinel lymph nodes Otherwise such antibodies may        contribute to the deterioration in the specificity of the        cocktail compromising its application for evaluation of the        sentinel lymph nodes of melanoma        During the standardization all  melanomas including        one spindle cell melanoma and one clear cell melanoma were        immunoreactive with the cocktail Nonimmunoreactivity of        special variants of melanoma to various melanoma        immunomarkers is a challenge During interpretation of        sentinel lymph nodes the diagnosis of melanoma is known        and the aim is to detect the melanoma micrometastases of        the known primary If the sentinel lymph nodes of special        variants of melanoma are negative by the cocktail it        would be prudent to confirm the immunoreactivity of the        primary lesion for the cocktail If the primary melanoma        is nonimmunoreactive for the cocktail the negative        interpretation of the sentinel lymph nodes with cocktail in        this situation may be confirmed with other suitable        immunomarker to which the primary melanoma is        immunoreactive The cocktail was not compared with S in        this study as its role in evaluation of sentinel lymph        nodes of melanoma was already demonstrated to be unreliable        even in comparison to MART and MelanA individually in        the previous study     We did not compare tyrosinase        alone with the cocktail because the questionable        contribution of such a study would not be offset by the        additional cost involved Published studies do not report         immunostaining with antityrosinase antibody T        Tyrosinase alone or any other immunomarker used        individually would be less sensitive than a cocktail To        evaluate the exact impact of the cocktail in comparison to        all of its component immunomarkers individually for        evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes additional studies        dedicated to comparison of individual component        immunomarkers with the cocktail may be called for        Capsular nevi in the form of a few cohesive cocktail        immunoreactive spindle cells with bland elongated nuclei        Figure  were observed in   of sections           of sentinel lymph nodes and   of cases As        compared to this none of the  slices of sentinel lymph        nodes from  cases of mammary carcinoma showed capsular        melanocytic nevi The sentinel lymph nodes of melanocytic        nevi were from different sites and none were from the        axillary region The exact explanation for this difference        in the prevalence of capsular nevi could not be deciphered        and further evaluation is in process The association of        higher frequency of capsular melanocytic nevi with        congenital nevi    is one possibility In our study        except for the difference in their regional variation        another possible explanation is the cytokine effect of the        melanoma draining to the sentinel lymph node        Hypothetically an association between the higher        prevalence of melanocytic capsular nevi and the        predisposition for melanoma may be likely Although these        melanocytic capsular nevi appear benign morphologically a        low probability that they may represent subtle metastases        was also considered Further evaluation of these and other        possibilities in larger series is recommended        Using immunohistochemistry Yu et al    reported        capsular benign melanocytic nevi in   of sentinel        lymph nodes of melanoma from   cases some cases        had more than one sentinel lymph node Capsular        melanocytic nevi appear to be the most significant benign        lesion that could pose a diagnostic challenge in the        interpretation of melanoma micrometastases in sentinel        lymph nodes For similar reasons noninsitu molecular        techniques such as RTPCR           would        have higher tendencies for false positive results        Morphology appears to be the single most important tool        facilitating their correct interpretation     Other        approaches including the observation that capsular nevi        are nonimmunoreactive or weakly immunoreactive for HMB        have been suggested for differentiating capsular nevi from        melanoma micrometastases     However it is important        to note that a significant number of melanomas are also        nonimmunoreactive for HMB Thus strong immunoreactivity        for HMB rules out capsular nevus but        nonimmunoreactivity may not be contributory        Rather than immunostaining three adjacent sections with        individual antibodies in the cocktail only one slide is        required which leads to cost savings Although the cost of        the three antibodies used in the cocktail has to be        incurred the material and labor cost savings for one        instead of three slides is obvious For proper sampling        some studies recommend the evaluation of three levels at          intervals     In that case if each of the three        antibodies in the cocktail had to be used individually it        would require the immunostaining interpreting and        correlating of nine sections In contrast to this the        cocktail requires only three sections each at intervals of          Thus use of the cocktail in concert with any        protocol with reference to number of sections to be        evaluated and proportion of sentinel lymph node to be        sampled     would achieve obvious cost saving        The most ideal positive control would be the sausage of        three controls immunoreactive individually for one of the        antibodies but nonimmunoreactive for other two respective        antibodies in the cocktail However this is a difficult        positive control to get The positive control used by us        showed subtle differences when immunostained with each        individual antibody in the cocktail with some areas        slightly darker than others However when the same control        was immunostained with the cocktail the entire control        showed relatively homogeneous immunostaining The change in        this immunostaining pattern would suggest the deterioration        of one of the component which can be correlated with the        same control immunostained with the individual antibodies        In addition another precaution taken by us was that the        cocktail was prepared after periodically evaluating        individual antibodies with the positive control This later        approach is the best alternative                    Conclusions        It is possible to use a combination of monoclonal        antibodies to MART MelanA and Tyrosinase as a single        cocktail reagent on one glass slide in contrast to three        individual antibodies on three slides The cocktail        facilitated easy detection and interpretation of melanoma        micrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes with reproducible        interobserver results There was favorable increase in the        detection rate of melanoma micrometastases in sentinel        lymph nodes as compared to MART and MelanA individually        Furthermore this approach leads to obvious cost savings        and simplifies the interpretation by reducing the number of        slides to be evaluated                    List of abbreviations        AJCC American Joint Committee on Cancer Az value area        under ROC curves DAB Diaminobenzidine
