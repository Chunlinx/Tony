            all right uh yeah not as much as i used to be i i grew up in Pittsburgh and   you say you a Steeler fan so did i no kidding   did you yeah i left there i went to school out that way that about forty miles east of Pittsburgh and then uh i left in the mid sixties and right after i left well a few years later they started having some good teams   yeah Chuck Knoll as a matter of fact uh did the coin flip in uh yesterdays Super Bowl   yeah yeah hes looking good hes sixty i think and he just you know   he looks real good he certainly had a an unfortunate uh end to a brilliant career   yeah for considering yeah they just uh i dont know what happened they just werent getting any draft picks and werent i guess they just werent picking the right guy werent right people   well thats what i think i think the the the sad thing about the Steelers is that they stuck with the crew a little too long and i think thats the the biggest problem for dynasties is that you just really have to cycle people   umhum right umhum   um   yeah they uh he was loyal to a lot of those guys that helped uh helped him win those Super Bowls in the seventies and uh stuck with him too long and then i think the the draft uh picks did fall on hard times and they just never were able to get back to where they were   yeah   but uh uh weve lived here in Dallas for about nineteen years and ive never become a Cowboys fan in fact i dont i just dont like them at all but   no yeah   i   how about Houston uh Oilers any more appealing to you   oh i like them better than the Cowboys i dont i just uh other than the Steelers i dont have a real a real favorite uh like the Eagles i like the Redskins but uh usually like the teams that the Cowboys are playing for the most part youre a Forty Niner fan   yeah well i had you know i was a Steeler fan and a Forty Niner fan um theyve certainly built themselves a you know a great team as a matter of fact if they hadnt lost so many games early in the season i think they might have been a contender might have given Washington a game   umhum hum yeah yeah they had   but uh they lost uh so many games early that they that their comeback made little difference at the end   yeah they werent the same without Montana   well Montana made a difference but as the analysts analysts have said over and over again the game is won and lost at the line of scrimmage a smart quarterback makes a big difference and i really think for example yesterday Buffalo might very well have been in it until the end had Kelley been uh a smarter quarterback i i frankly am surprised that   umhum   um Marv Levy would allow him to call all those plays   oh was he calling the plays i didnt even   yeah and i think thats just too tough in a on a uh uh you know a guy i mean you got to be real real savvy to do that and i dont see Kelley as being that savvy i dont i think thats one of the weaknesses in the Buffalo offense myself   yeah yeah yeah yeah he had a   because they certainly have a heck of a defense although it was picked apart a little bit i mean Washington just looked phenomenal   umhum right yeah well couple of those passes a couple of those receivers for Buffalo dropped some important uh passes too they it would have made might have made a little bit of a difference not much but uh   and uh yeah yeah   i dont i i just looked in the paper this this evening and trying to figure out when the last time the AFC won a game guess it was eighty four Raiders   it its its nine years ago   Raiders beat uh the Redskins i think as a matter of fact but boy its   yeah its been been a while   i was thinking maybe they uh ought to just AFC ought to just give it up and uh when uh it comes time for the Super Bowl the NFC champ plays an all star team of the AFC teams that might be a little more interesting because im getting a little tired of watching the blowouts in the uh     well it is it is a little disappointing and theres some it its very interesting to see you know whats whats behind this is it is it the uh i mean you would think theoretically that the draft picks would uh you know random and then free agency also makes a big difference   right   uh i dont understand it i mean they just uh they they Denver you know went a few times and they didnt do anything uh Cincinnati they didnt do anything now uh Buffalo   yeah umhum yeah well Buffalo twice well they did get close last year they could have won last Buffalo could have won last year against the Giants but uh just seems like theres a big gap in talent between the or maybe in coaching between the AFC and the NFC because its like i said its been nine years or eight years since they uh since AFCs won a game   yeah   but uh i guess theyre gonna somebody was saying uh somebody i was watching the game with some people they were saying that instant replay may be on its way out i guess they have enough votes to uh or not enough votes to keep it going   well you know i think thats sad in a way because i think if you look for example there were a couple of calls yesterday that were appallingly bad   umhum yeah   i mean i just its its its shameful and and i think that that once Pandoras out of the box you know   yeah   so i dont know i i i i think it can complicate things i recognize that but i sure think its its reversed some some calls that were bad calls although yesterday it didnt reverse one that was a very bad call what   yeah well um yeah i just dont like it it it delays the game it delays uh i dont know it it just kind of interrupts interrupts the flow of things and uh i   well there yeah there is that problem and and but uh i guess that  that the real the real interesting thing is in the age of television youre going to get so much analysis of it that a that a game really for example yesterday when when Andre Reid   umhum
