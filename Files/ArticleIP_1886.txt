                                 Bringing Up Mother            Parents have long been aterrible disappointment to the childcare community When questioned theypersistently fail to express dissatisfaction with their current childcarearrangements or even much difficulty in finding such care Yet with equalpersistence experts keep proclaiming a childcare crisis            Thelatest hue and cry has been raised in regard to the  welfarereformlegislation that aims to send millions of welfare mothers into the labor forceand their kids presumably into surrogate care Critics of the new law arguethat suitable care is in short supply For an example of the concern seePeter Edelmans Dialogue in Slate with Mickey Kaus Yet past experiencesuggests that parents who want to work can and will find child care that suitstheir needs            Way back in  when custodial care for kids first becamethe causists favorite cause clbre  the federal Childrens Bureau andWomens Bureau jointly issued the findings of a survey they had conducted Thestudy said the foreword clearly indicates how urgent is the need forlargescale expansion of day care services If so you would have a hard timetelling it from the data presented When questioned mothers of  percent ofthe children covered said they thought their childcare arrangements were quitesatisfactory            This clashof perceptions is accounted for by the fact that most of the children inquestion  percent to be exact were not being cared for in the type ofsetting the researchers favoreda licensed daycare center nursery school orlike facility Most were being cared for by relatives friends or smallscalecare providers Some  percent were latchkey children who were expected tolook after themselves These moreover were the days when federal planners setutopian standards for acceptable care When the Department of Health Educationand Welfare decided to set up its own center for employees kids it found itcould not meet the requirements for windows and outlets per square footnutritionists and therapists per square child and so on            More than two decades later parents andpolicymakers are still disagreeing In  the last year in which acomprehensive survey was done  percent of parents said they were satisfied percent were very satisfied with their care arrangements Sandra Clarka researcher at the Urban Institute notes that parents may be embarrassed toadmit they leave their kids in questionable settings And for manyworkingpoor families daycare expenses are an enormous burden But evenwhen parents were asked if they would prefer other arrangementsand who amongus resists bettermentonly  percent answered yes            But it isnot only childcare advocates who have been frustrated by the researchfindings Last week brought disappointing news to another faction in thedaycare battle those who deplore the whole institution as harmful to thenations children No doubt to the annoyance and disbelief of daycareopponents such as the Rockford Institute and the Center on the Family inAmerica a study newly released by the National Institute of Child Health andHuman Development found that day care does not hinder a childs intellectualdevelopment Nor except for a small effect for very young children in longhours of care does it affect their emotional bond with their mothers            Many more children of course are in licensed centers thanwas the case in  Current center capacity is estimated at some  millionkids Still the  survey found only  percent of preschoolers with workingmoms were in center care Another  percent were in licensed daycare homesAs you would expect higherincome mothers are more likely to use relativelyexpensive center care than are the working poor but thanks to governmentsubsidies the nonworking poorie welfare mothersare almost as likelyas middleclass working mothers to have their youngest kids in centers            Centercare is not however a guarantee of quality Nor is price Quality the UrbanInstitutes Sandra Clark points out is not an easy thing to measure Stillaccording to the new study the quality of the care does matterespeciallywhether the caregivers talk and interact with the children frequently A flurryof recent research recently reported in a Time magazine cover story points to the importance ofearly stimulation in the later development of a babys brain And with aquarter of highschool seniors being rated functionally illiterate on standardreading tests it seems pretty clear that some additional stimulation isneeded Yet many centers especially those neither serving higherincomefamilies nor competing for government subsidies are plagued by poorly trainedlowpaid staff high turnover and insufficient supervision            And here is where the disappointing parentscome in again Testifying before a Senate committee in  the University ofMichigans Sandra Hofferth reported that her studies show that while parentsclaim to care about quality in the end they opt for price and convenienceResearchers Suzanne W Helburn and John R Morris reached a similar conclusionin a  study of the market A major cause of the mediocre quality found inthe child care industryboth center and family careis the lack of demand forit They recommend finding a way to alarm parents so they  confront theconflict between adult fulfillment versus childrens developmental needs            All threeof these experts and others besides point to a misdirection of federalresources The government does provide direct daycare subsidies to  millionlowincome children the four main programs currently spend about  billiona year in addition to about  billion for Head Start and some of thosesubsidies come with quality strings attached But the largest single federaldaycare subsidy is the Dependent Care Tax Credit which now distributes morethan  billion in tax rebates annually mostly to middle and higherincomefamilies And Helburn and Morris point out since tax credits can be used forany kind of care the parents chooseand parents being the way they aretaxbreaks are not good tools for ensuring good quality They may not even begood tools for buying day care When the government in  started askingparents to provide the Social Security number of their putative daycareprovider claims for credits dropped markedly            From this perspective the recently passed welfare reformcould be a blessing to some kids Advocates worry that if substantial numbersof welfare mothers are pushed into jobs centers might be swamped by demands toserve as many as a million added kids That probably wont happen David Butlerof the Manpower Development Research Corp which has been the prime evaluatorof welfaretowork programs points out that planners have routinelyoverestimated the amount of formal child care needed for such projects And thenew law also exempts from participation any mother with children under  forwhom affordable accessible and suitable care cannot be found On the plusside the reforms will increase federal money for child care by more than million a year If states take advantage of the various incentives providedthem though few probably will total federal and state support could expandfrom about  billion annually to almost  billion according to UrbanInstitute estimates States will also be freed from the hodgepodge ofregulations that currently cause gaps in coverage as mothers move among hometraining and work            If many more welfare parentsdo find and hold jobs their children might well benefit from theintellectually stimulating care many of their mothers cannot provideif thatsthe sort of substitute care they actually get Still as last weeks NationalInstitute study points out whatever effect day care has on kids is swamped bythe impact of their own families Kids with welleducated emotionally stablemothers and secure economic circumstances tend to do fine whether theirmothers work or not Others not so lucky in their parents or homes often donot As Urban Institute senior fellow Isabel Sawhill notes we license daycare centers but we dont license parents Perhaps we should
