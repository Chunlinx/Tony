        okay well basically my habits are totally gone i used to exercise quite a bit and now i have a child and and um trying to do go to school back to college again so its   okay   its uh exercise is kind of forget it   well it but if it well if i remember back to when i had a child they give you a lot of exercise just  what age is your child   they sure do yeah my daughter yeah yeah uh shes three so three with a i think its almost like shes got this endless   uhhuh   energy i mean its no longer nap time that kind of thing so   oh shes given up the naps   yes yeah so   oh i remember  i remember mine doing that thats terrible   yeah exactly so the exercise we can pretty much uh get from her uh she always wants to go outside and do things so im kind of uh shes an only child too so its its not like you can say go out and play with other kids so its   oh  right and so many people work nowadays there you know theres not that many kids in a neighborhood necessarily anymore either     umhum sure sure   but well my main uh exercise the only one ive ever stuck to at all is walking   yeah uhhuh   and i  try to get out and walk two miles most everyday but but it you know it fluctuates ill do real good for a while and then ill be off of it for a while just depending on whats happened but the last uh   uhhuh umhum sure   couple of uh years uh my husband is an accountant and he moved his office to the house and i work for him   umhum sure   so that helps because were at home and i can get out and walk a lot better than when i was working in an office   sure sure   so that has helped but anything else uh well we have a lake house and down there when we go down there some on weekends we get a different type of exercise you know just  doing a lot of work and things down there but that and uh and walking is about it   yeah yeah thats about what uh basically if we can get out and take a walk its its great but uh most of the time we cant so its uh were too busy doing other things but that also takes into account of walking though when you think about it so it ah   umhum i will admit though when i do walk i feel so much better you know when i get out and do that two miles it takes about thirty minutes just our neighborhood is just kind of very flat land with sidewalks and   oh sure sure uhhuh sure   uh i really do uh and and i smoke and i can tell that it just immediately if ive been coughing or something you know it just immediately seems to clear my lungs up   uhhuh uhhuh to loosen it up yeah yeah thats true   but um   so yeah   well i got a lot of exercise though the last four or five days i have two grandchildren   oh yes   three months and nineteen months and my daughter and soninlaw went on a   uhhuh   trip for three days and left them with us and we nearly went nuts   uhhuh so oh boy sure trying to keep up with the nineteen months uh sure theyre into everything   well and the baby was sick so he wasnt good you know so it took was one on one i mean i had to take one and he had to take the other one and it was busy   the baby hm oh he was cranky   and they woke up all during the night  and im not uh used to that   sure once you lose that sure thats very true   uhhuh   it wasnt too long ago where i was doing the same thing and that uh totally gets your mental capabilities uh thrown off totally when theyre uh tired and uh you wake up in the middle of the night and its my daughter used to be pretty much on a regular basis for that so   umhum   daddy just came home so the house is starting to liven up here now  but uh thats about it thats kind of how my exercise is right now is just basically running after a three year old   um umhum right uh when you were talking about mentally losing sleep it also made me think of one other thing walking   so umhum   does for me when i do it it does help me mentally you know if im worried about something or whatever and i get out and do that   umhum   walk it just i dont know it just sort of helps your mental attitude too   it sure does yeah   so i miss that when i dont do it   sure sure well it was really nice talking to you then   but well nice to talk to you   okay umhum thank you umhum bye now   bye bye
