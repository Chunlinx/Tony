                                 The Stock Market ChickenCounting Orgy            The Dow Jones industrialaverage is up by almost half in the past year The NASDAQ Composite Index andthe SP  are up more than  percent Thanks to the portfolio trackingservices on financial Web sites like Microsoft Investor millions of middleclass investors areaware of their rising net worth to the dollar on a daily or even hourlybasis Troubadours of capitalism celebrate each new high as evidence of thesystems ability to create wealth            But inwhat sense has the stock market boom created wealth This is not aphilosophical question Its a mathematical one Nor is my point that a Dowbreaking  is necessarily a speculative bubble that will burst though Ireserve the right to claim that was my point if it happens But when weimagine how we will spend our stock market wealth were engaged in an orgy ofprehatch chicken counting Is there any way the wealth that people arespending in their minds can be spent in realitythat is converted into goodsand services            Heres the puzzle The shares traded on the New York StockExchange are worth a total of over  trillion Worth in the sense that athis is the sum of the prices theyre trading at little bits at a time and bthis is the sum of the numbers their proud owners mentally fondle Perhaps trillion of that worth has been added in the past year Meanwhile thoughthe entire US economy produces goods and services of about  trillion ayear and grew less than  percent in the past year Four percent growth is infact very healthy But it means that the increase in goods and services in theeconomy was  billion less than oneseventh of the increase in claims ongoods and services implied by the rise in prices on the New York Stock Exchangealone Add the other exchanges the NASDAQ real estate and various otherinvestments and the growth in the economys capacity to produce real wealthshrinks into insignificance compared with the increase in wealth as perceivedby the owners of these investments            No one loves a share of stock for its own sakeEven shares in a company as wonderful as say Microsoft are treasured only fortheir tradein value So what would happen if everyone suddenly tried to tradethe wealth weve accumulated during the past year for real stuffcarshouses vacations new washing machines whatever Two things would happenStock prices would plummet and the price of real stuff would rise As aresult much of our perceived wealth would melt away            Of course were not allgoing to cash in our stocks tomorrow One thing sustaining current stockpricelevels is baby boomers socking money away for retirement But many experts havepredicted that this pleasant dynamic will reverse itself when the boomergeneration starts withdrawing and spending its retirement nest eggs Instead ofsustaining the market the agingboomer factor will be depressing it Theresult neednt be a crash But some combination of stockprice stagnation ordecline and general price inflation will deny boomers the value they thinktheyre accumulating            This isanother reason that the notion of solving the Social Security problem byinvesting payments in the stock market is such folly The infusion of theseextra billions will drive prices up when boomers are all buying and thesubsequent withdrawal will drive prices down when boomers are all selling            So the alleged wealth accumulated in the stock market cantbe realized all at once now and probably cant be realized all at once decadesfrom now Can it be realized gradually over the years as people sell off alittle at a time Its possible but pretty unlikely Stock prices representthe discounted present value of a companys future earnings stream In otherwords What youre willing to pay for a share of stock is or ought to beequal to what you would pay today for the right to claim that shares fractionof the companys profits from now on If prospects for future earnings haveactually improved by  or  percent in the past year the economy willgenerate enough wealth to cover all the new chits in peoples pockets            There aretwo ways the present value of future earnings might have increased by  or percent during a period when the economys general productive capacityincreased by only  percent One possibility is that companies were radicallyundervalued a year ago The other is that something happened in the past yearto improve general corporate prospects by  or  percent In either casestock prices and profit potential are in theory now correctly aligned            But do you know of any dazzling new insightabout the past or revelation about the future during the past year that wouldjustify a  percent upward valuation of all of corporate America Well BenStein wrote in Slate a while back attributing the bull market to new understandingabout the lack of risk in equity investments Slates Paul Krugman notes thatthe past year has brought good news about the economys ability to tolerate lowunemployment without igniting inflation But this news Krugman says makesus  or  percent richer at mostnowhere near enough to justify the rise inthe Dow Whats more if the past years huge rise in stock prices reflects anew but accurate optimism about future economic growth this means the payofffor that future growth is already in the past In other words futurestockprice increases will have to trail economic growth            A relatedpossibility The increase in stockholder wealth could reflect a transfer fromthose Americans who dont own stocks Or from our own nonstock repositories offuture valueie our labor Could it be that the rise in stock valuesreflects the ongoing shift from labor to capital of the return to productionin our economy In other words were not producing  percent more but moreof what we do produce goes to corporate profits and less to wages WellKrugman maintains that no such shift is taking place Another economistLawrence Mishel takes issue with Krugman in the current issue of the AmericanProspect             Then theres what economists call the wealth effect Evenif the impression that were a lot richer than a year ago is a fantasy thevery fact that millions believe it might help make it come true Prosperity islike Tinker Bell It lives on belief that it lives Folks who believe evenincorrectly that their net worth is up by  percent will spend with zest andthe economy will thrive and grow as a result Of course this kind ofdemandside thinking is extremely out of fashion After all if spendingmoney you dont really have is the key to prosperity big government deficitswould do the trick just as well Yet deficits are deeply unpopular most of allwith the sort of folks who celebrate the new wealth created by the stockmarket            Of course this whole line ofreasoning would apply to stock market crashes as well as to booms The onedaycrash of  for example reduced peoples net worth by billions withoutdirectly reducing by as much as a single doughnut the amount of goods andservices or the economys ability to produce more of them Maybe the moral isjust the obvious one that stock prices occasionally overshoot the mark in bothdirections But maybe the moral is that the only folks who are going to gettheir full chickens worth out of the  market are those who stop countingtheir chickens and start trading them in
