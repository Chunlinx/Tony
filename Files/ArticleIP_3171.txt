                                 Are We Content            The news that scientists inScotland have successfully cloned an adult female sheep bringing forth a youngfemale named Dolly has raised questions of considerable public urgency themost troubling of which in my own mind is Dolly The cells from which Dollywas cloned it turns out were taken from a sheeps ample mammary glands TheScottish embryologist who obtained the cells was reminded of the fullfiguredcountry singer Dolly Parton Such are the improbable byways of on the wintryCaledonian moors            A moresubstantial issue raised by the advent of cloning itself from the Greekklon  meaning twig or branch is of course the possibility thatcommerce in the very stuff of which were made will ultimately turn humanityinto merchandise our genesis controlled by some mutant form of agribusinessTurning People Into Product was the headline above a New York Timescommentary by Brent Staples that evoked among other things thesciencefictional prospect of the wholesale manufacture of synthetic humanbeings            The word was apt Product in this collective senseused without an article has none of the quantitative formative or evenpoetic associations that the word had otherwise acquiredas in gross nationalproduct a product of Groton and Harvard or the fruit and product of hislabors past Dryden It is used rather as a white slaver might speak offlesh                           Product as a generic mercantile term for marketable commodity has beenaround for years but it seems to have first acquired prominence as jargonandspecifically as a term with a somewhat offputting aromain the recordingindustry during the s In his book Rock Gold The MusicMillionaires  George Tremlett observes that people in the music businessalways talk about music with one word that you hardly ever see mentioned inthe popular press Product  Sound recordings may be technically superbwith all the benefits of the latest digital electronics but its only goodProduct live Product or strong Product if it sells Otherwise its deadProduct            Product has since come to encompass all aspectsof the entertainment world and the cynicism it once embodied is today onlyoccasionally highlighted by means of its presentation in quotation marksEmployed matteroffactly even unselfconsciously product is perhapsnow found most often in connection with the motionpicture industry Thisyears nominees wrote one newspaper critic recently after noting that asingle bigstudio movie was in the running for an Oscar for best picturerepresent a triumph of independent films over Hollywood product Anothercritic says of the director Quentin Tarantino He has been acclaimed for someof the most hollow product ever to pass itself off as art                           Product in the entertainmentindustry sense used above occupies adistinct class within the phylum content  Whereas product is forthe most part a commodity that exists or is envisaged content  in itsmost advanced and today most widely used sense means the totality of allsubstance in particular commercially viable substance that can be madeavailable through the various communications and information media not justmovies TV shows and music but also software games sports newsdirectories advertising and everything onlinenow and in the future            When content is used this way both the specificsource or substance and its medium of transmission are irrelevant to itsdefinition much as source and medium of transmission are irrelevant to adefinition of the word heat  In a recent email communication theRandom House editor Jesse T Sheidlower writes                           I added this to theforthcoming edition of Random House Websters College Dictionary  but ittook a tremendous amount of effort to define We argued about what it reallymeans and sent drafts back and forth for about a week before we arrived at thefollowing definition which like all definitions that one struggles with looksperfectly innocuous and simple content n  substantive information orcreative material viewed in contrast to its actual or potential manner ofpresentation                        This isthe meaning of content in the cloying phrase content is king themantra repeated endlessly by Bill Gates and other multimedia conquistadorsThe dominant corporations are bigger than ever and have more control thanever the media critic and former Washington Post national editor BenBagdikian said recently in a newspaper interview What they are aimingforand have gone a long way toward achievingis to control the originationof content and the natural delivery system            The same content appears in the term contentprovider  Although at first used to designate corporations such as TimeWarner Disney and Microsoftwhich scour the universe for matriel to givelife and purpose to their distribution networksthe term has been tricklingdown to apply to individuals We like to think of ourselves as contentproviders I heard a cleric say recently about his line of work a commentthat I took to be knowingly ironic but which could also have been a sincere andpathetic attempt to be with it Church talk presents this problem often Thecomposer and multimedia performer Laurie Anderson now calls herself a contentprovider                           At first I thoughtThats one of the grossest things Ive ever heard And then I thought aboutit and I go Well thats not really horrible In fact I eventually startedto like it Every time I renew my passportcontent provider I put thatright in                        The big issue with contentis of course Who owns it Information is the resourceextractive industry ofthe next century and the concept of intellectual property a term thatdates back  yearscomes up when individuals or companies assert aparticular claim and embody it in the form of copyrights trademarks andpatents Intellectual property refers basically to nontangiblecreative product and like a rising sea it seems to cover new territory withevery passing year The National Basketball Association has famously sought totrademark the scores of its games HarleyDavidson has sought to trademark therumble of its motorcycles Patents can even be held on the genetic blueprintsof various forms of life            In biotechnology as intelecommunications intellectualproperty law remains at an embryonic stageBut it is not premature to begin thinking of Dollys ovine progenitor not somuch as a sheepor even as productbut in some sense as content In herclones eyes of course she will always be a significant udder
