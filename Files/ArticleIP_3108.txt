                                 Travel Without Clothes            Ive just been reading Homeron the plane back from Paris Arriving with many bags that required anxiouswaiting lugging and shoving I found myself wishing that modern clothinghabits were a bit more Homeric            Since theOdyssey recounts a journey in many stages with several other tripscontained in it Homer describes many arrivals and departures often atprincely houses In Homeric times as now a luxurious welcome involved a bathfood and drink entertainment and a comfortable bed for the night Unlike nowhowever it involved new clothes too At the time Homer wrote about clothingwas a household supply like a wine cellar full of casks or many herds ofcattle and coops of chickens Guests would use the clothes the way they usedthe food wine water fuel and service            Reading about Telemachus trip to Sparta to visit QueenHelen and King Menelaus for example you realize that he brought no luggage atall except gifts for his hosts When he arrived he was stripped washedoiled and freshly dressed from head to foot in garments woven by the lady ofthe house and her servants His own were presumably cleaned and absorbed intothe householdno word from Homer on this The same thing happened everyevening throughout his stay and he left for the next stage of his trip alsocarrying only gifts dressed in whatever his hosts had last given him to wearHe could expect to be reclothed by whomever he visited next            Homericclothes were often elegant Elaborate patterns some of them with narrativescenes might be woven into fabrics of great finesse their finely spun fibersdyed in strong and subtle colors Women did all this work and they did itunceasingly for their households which could become famous because of it ifthe mistress of the house was a talented fabric designer and had skilled helpFor clothes they wove the cloth in personsized widths and lengthsno cuttingoff the boltand garments were created by draping pinning or wrapping themonto the body Sometimes two pieces were sewn up the sides and across theshoulders with slits left for head and arms to be slid on and belted orsashedvery basic a few sizes would drape to fit all            The most famous clothing drama in theOdyssey begins with Odysseus washed up on a beach naked and halfdeadon the island of Aeaea The goddess Athena his watchful patroness soonarranges to get him saved and sent onward She prompts the islands PrincessNausicaa to cajole her father into letting her drive a years worth of dirtyclothes all the way down to the waters edge in a big oxdrawn wagon to spendthe day with her maids washing and drying them on the beach right where Athenaknew she would find the shipwrecked Odysseus            Readingabout this you realize that laundry could be so large and rare a project onlybecause the palace was supplied with hundreds and hundreds of availablegarments along with hundreds and hundreds of sheets and blankets and kept onmaking more The princess wanted the laundry done right now though becauseshe hoped to find a husband soon and the family would need clean clothes andbedding for possible marriage feasts A handsome stranded stranger would becertain to capture her interest too Those gods left nothing to chance            All goes as planned and the princess gives Odysseus a suitof the family clothes now clean and dry Then she tells him how to find thepalace and how to approach her royal parents to ask their help not liking topresent him as somebody she had picked up on the beach But when Odysseusappears alone as a needy traveler before them the queen narrows her eyesAnd just where did you get those clothes you have on The queenrecognizes garments she had designed and woven herself Nausicaa had forgottento allow for the artists longterm proprietary knowledge of her own work            Thatsounds familiar enough since were used to the distinctiveness of designersideas and craftsmens pieces What seems alien is a particular garment beingalways linked with its maker but not with a particular wearer In a worldwithout textile or clothing markets each piece of weaving was like a familymeal or a home performance of music available to anyone present but theproperty of no one person never bought or sold always identified with the onewho had created it inside that house Except in times of war or pillage itchanged hands only as a gift            Since most garments were plain rectangularpieces being well dressed meant having an attractive personal styledrapingyour cloak in a novel fashion sashing your waist with particular flair WhenHomer wants to dwell on the perfections of dressed persons he mentions thedash with which their clothes are worn unless the point is the beauty of thefabric and who had woven it Often the poet has a guardian deity adding moredash after the person is fully dressedrefining the coiffure improving thefacial expression and sprinkling extra grace over the frame            Ordinaryclothes in the modern world are even now approaching a certain Homeric samenessin their basic shapes with individual appeal added by the wearers own styleYou can see the ideal in the Gap ads A Tshirt and denim pants just sit thereuntil a supple person slides into them and strikes a cool pose The morefantastic grow the evening gowns on the runway the more uniform grows the garbof the crowds on the subway Massmarket pants and shirts and jackets areeverywhere much the same and suggest interchangeability outstanding effectsarise from interesting fabric or a terrificlooking wearer            What contemporary travel needs to become truly convenientare updated versions of Homeric households You get to a hotel room in yourtravelstained sweater shirt and pants and drop all these down a chute Youshower slip on the robe provided this part we already have and then in thecupboard you find stacks of pants and shirts and sweaters maybe a wrapskirtor two and some jackets all in many colors and all in your size since youemailed the information ahead with your reservation You dress afresh in yourchoice of these have dinner spend the night dress anew in the morning if youlike and check out On to the next hotel same story Eventually you get homecarrying no bags wearing some clothes you can add to your own collection assouvenirs of your most recent stayready of course to offer them to yournext houseguests in exchange for theirs            If somewhere on your travelsyou find you suddenly need a really good suit for the day that would bearranged like a rental car or added as an extra hotel service The hotelwould deliver the desired ensemble to you along with the indispensableneedleandthread person and the right shoes and would return it after you hadchecked out At posh hotels with posh connections supplies would be highleveland instantaneous Nonposh ones would put you in touch with the nearest agencyfor a more modest range of products Youd have to invoke your own gods for therequisite charm            Underwear didnt exist inHomeric times and women didnt travel except for goddesses who flew throughthe air For my scheme to work certain questions I admit need more thoughtBut the thought of traveling without packing except maybe for a tiny computerand a tiny camera has a powerful charm of its own Some might even take asketchpad instead or a paperback volume of Homer
