          well what do you think about it   well um most of the stuff up until now in the recent months i i i dont have any problem with   no i dont either   uh i mean its you know it   i dont think its going to change very much but   no i agree with that as as far as the as far as the mess thats developing as a result um       you know uh as a country the United States uh i think our hands are tied as far as as as any further involvement until the UN sanctions it in fact it really was to begin with   umhum yeah yeah   and uh i just i heard a comment on the radio this morning that uh you know it it gets to a point where uh if enough people are are going to be slaughtered over there over the the the internal problems um somebody may step in again but uh i really think its its a UN issue   umhum yeah   at that point because it is internal   well you know the funny thing i find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the American public goes crazy   uhhuh   and now the fact that were not interfering with the internal rebellion in in Iraq theyre going crazy you know i mean you cant please them one way or the other   thats right thats right thats absolutely right   you know and i and i think that i i agree with you this is exactly the right course i mean thats an internal problem to Iraq it has nothing to do with us   umhum      and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the UN gets involved then its nobodys business   thats right   um   i mean these these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time some of them have been going on for for tens of years if if i understand it right in places like the Sudan and   all the time i mean yeah i mean yeah yeah and its certainly and its certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years and its going to continue as long as you have so many diverse groups that are that are vying for power its going to happen all the time   yeah thats right yeah thats absolutely right   i mean the Kurds have tried it before theyve gotten their butts kicked and this is just another time that its happening   yeah thats thats absolutely right   you know and theyll regroup out in the mountains and theyll try it again in a couple of years   yeah it was just you know it was its a very opportune moment for them to try you know you   sure and and and i dont have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it   oh yeah yeah      you know but i im not real sure that we promised them anything   umhum   i that would have been stupid and i dont and i dont think we did it everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right i dont think they would have done that     yeah i agree   but it just it it really doesnt make any difference this is just a chapter a another chapter in Middle Eastern history   yeah and you know and it there are many of them theres no doubt about it   oh sure i mean the the British occupied the place the French occupied it weve done it ah it its happened so many times this is this is really nothing special uh   umhum well and and and so many of the so many of the conflicts um really dont have a basis in in uh politics or or human rights or anything like that it   thats right its all its mostly religious anyway   its its religious based and uh you know by by selfproclamation this is a holy war and it is right and then uh we we go on from there   yeah yeah exactly   yeah it its its a mess it its theres no doubt about it and uh   well i i i think one of the big problems i mean looking at it from the American the American publics standpoints they dont understand the Middle Easterners   thats right   they dont understand what i mean their politics really isnt politics its religion couched as politics   umhum umhum   and theres a big difference   absolutely   you know uh we sit there and and we think that they think the way we think   umhum   and thats a big mistake because they dont   you bet you bet well yeah because theres no uh you know there theres theres a complete different set of values um theres theres different value placed on human life and uh right down the list you know possessions and and everything else and uh   umhum yeah yeah   whats right is wrong and whats wrong is right in some cases and its   thats thats thats it a lot of the time i i was stationed in in Turkey for for a year and a half   okay   and it it was tough understanding understanding those folks   yeah yeah   you know uh they uh theyre uh theyre so completely different culturally and socially and   umhum   and religiously its just it was very strange it was very interesting   i believe it yeah yeah i can i can i can believe that yeah i i dont claim to have an indepth understanding by any means but uh   now i shoot i i think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts dont dont have a clue sometimes   thats probably true   you know they they sit there and and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert well im not real sure thats thats appropriate   uhhuh no no thats thats uh a a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field   no   but uh   well i sort that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too   yeah   and we make experts by reading books you know   thats right   and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing   uhhuh absolutely   yeah   absolutely   yeah i uh i i guess you work for TI yeah   thats right yes   so you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else   right right thats an everyday occurrence   yeah its its like our car industry the only reason our car industry hasnt gone down the tubes is because the Japanese you know came into it and helped us out   umhum umhum       i agree yeah its its uh there there is there is its an overall problem in in in this country understanding uh foreign cultures or even accepting them   um umhum   and uh it it it bites us over and over again the the   yeah and until we until we start changing our educational system i mean were were going to be were weve already been overtaken but its going to get even worse later i mean looks whos looks whos getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything its not us   umhum thats right thats right   you know we weve got folks running around here who get who get degrees in basket weaving and   umhum   you know underwater psychology or some some ridiculous stuff like that     absolutely   and and where are the engineers coming from   uh well theyre theyre coming from various places and a lot of them are going back there   yeah exactly   thats   my uh my roommate is a uh hes getting his doctorate in industrial well its not industrial engineering its human factors his degree was in uh you know industrial engineering   okay i see   um and hes from the Philippines   yeah   and the only reason he came here was because the education is much so much better for those who will go after it   right   he has no intention of going back to the Philippines because theres no jobs   sure okay   you know uh but i i see it all too often i mean weve got loads of foreign students   umhum   and theyre coming here going after the hard degrees and then theyre going back to Korea and Japan and Hong Kong and everywhere else and theyre applying it there   absolutely thats right   and   i dont know its to me its amazing i dont know what were going to do as a country were were going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later   yeah because you know every every the the countrys got a problem with uh with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that and the long long range views are are just kind of become a thing of the past   umhum yeah you   and uh   i dont i dont think there can be anymore long range planning i think it its its sticking your finger in the holes and the dike   umhum   you know uh oh heres a crisis well lets plug it up   yeah yeah   i dont know i dont know what the answer is its far beyond me   yeah thats for sure thats  thats the way things have gotten   yeah all we can do is keep plugging   yeah   you know i i wonder i i read in the paper just last week IBMs unveiling their new laptop computer   umhum   well at a price tag of six thousand bucks i dont know if theyre going to have a whole lot of takers   no absolutely   because uh now i have the i i have the IBM PS two   okay   but im sorry i got it   yeah   its slow its uh there are many better machines on the market right now for   yeah   a the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan through the school and i saved forty eight percent so i said yeah if i can have an IBM for forty eight percent discount ill take it   okay    okay umhum absolutely   but up to that point i had never i had always said i would never have one because i wouldnt pay that kind of money for their name   thats right   but   thats absolutely right yeah   now you watch just sure as anything the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it   uhhuh uhhuh yeah the the unfortunately the way the the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get get something in your hands um it its its obsolete and uh   umhum its already outdated yeah   were we we fight that that battle every day here at work uh   yeah yeah i i can imagine i uh  years ago i remember when i had a TI ninety nine   umhum   put all the money into the expansion box and all this that and the other and uh things just kept changing so much and i kept getting rid of them and i finally said well you cant do this  youve got to buy something and stick with it so i   thats right thats right   so i just at an opportune time i got one that that suited my needs and ive just stuck with it the only thing ive done to it is just add a uh add a mouse and a hard drive   okay yeah   and thats all i plan to do of course im limited on memory now because ive got the low line i got the model twenty five   oh okay   so im stuck with six forty but im not a power user so it doesnt matter   yeah well that thats thats the key you know whatever whatever works for you and uh   yeah   if it does the job then thats thats what you need   yeah now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user          hes hes looking now to get rid of his hes got a three eighty six and wants to get a four eighty six you know this kind of stuff   uhhuh
