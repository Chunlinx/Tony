                                 Star Power            What accounts for charismain musicfor the authority or power that strangely radiates from this or thatperformer not just from the sound but so it seems from the performerspersonality from the shake of a head or the expressive curl of a wrist Irealize that of all the grand effects that music can produce charisma is oneof the cheapestwhich is to say the easiest to fake if your standards arenot too high Years ago in the days before I became a journalist I playedtrombone with a group called the Uptown Horns backing up blues and rock bandsand I savor the memory of how our jaded little group used to mock the rockworlds cult of the charismatic To hold ones fist stiffly in the air in agesture of ridiculous defiance while the bass amplifier thundered and theguitar shrieked and our man on tenor sax honked deliriously and to see abarroom audience respond with shouts and their own idiotic fists in the beeryairthat was to laugh A fascist rally at the Second Avenue gin mill Wemusicians were all smirks behind our kickass faade            In thelast few months Ive been running around to classical concerts in New Yorklooking for charismatic qualities in places where in theory they might beexpected and Ive noticed something else about the charismatic in music Agenuine touch of the charismatic is never where you expect it to be A givensoloist might be wonderfully talented and might choose to perform the kind ofmusic that exudes noble and heroic inspirations with every phraseand evenso the indefinable strength that counts as charismatic might fail to appearAn examplenot to be cruel but just to show what Im getting atcould beseen at the New York Philharmonic debut a couple of months ago of a violinistnamed Frank Peter Zimmermann from Germany            Zimmermanns reputation in Germany is said to be excellentIn New York where he played the Bruch Violin Concerto in G minor  theaudience leapt to its feet and gushed appreciation The New York Timespronounced itself content Yet what can I say It may have been the doughy lookof earnest concentration on the young mans ample cheeks or it may have beenhis habit at the conclusion of every dazzling doublestopped arpeggio ofdeftly lifting his bow off the strings with a satisfied aira happy pastrychef pleased and relieved to have given the world one more perfect Linzertorte And the result was to be honest dismaleven if the concertos manysplendidly demagogic passages performed virtuosically did their customarywork            Theclearest examples of charismatic musicianship that Ive seen lately have beenin performances by Yuri Bashmet the Russian violist who was in New York notlong ago conducting his own chamber orchestra at Carnegie Hall and playingwith the Philharmonic under Kurt Masur Bashmet ought to be an unlikely sourceof spectacular and forceful effects due to the humble nature of hisinstrument The viola tends to be plaintively melancholic or else to squawkuglyduckling style like a bassoon or an English horn In the pantheon ofinstruments the viola is a mortal not a god Yet when Bashmet comes out ontothe stage wiping his Prince Valiant locks off his face and holding his nongodby its helpless neck like a dead rabbit you feel even before he starts toplay a vibration in the air ever so slightly as if gusting from the airconditioner            Before he starts I admit there is somethingfishy in that observation I blame his preconcert publicity Bashmet we aretold by virtually every journalist who has written about him began hismusical career on the electric guitara teenage rock star in RostovonDonback in the late s He played in a Beatlesstyle band then embraced theviola out of the despairing recognition that on the guitar he would nevermatch the fireworks of Jimi Hendrix his idol And so the violist gazes outwardfrom the stage and the audience mulling over the biographical background withits air of s mayhem and longlost Soviet dissident hipness is bound towonder Is this a Promethean figure Hendrixlike standing before us A man ofextremes On the verge of mental derangement            He playswith a weird supercontrol He produces a wide sumptuous when he wants to andat other times the speedy wobble of a swallowed scream But characteristicallyhe uses very little vibrato at all and the tones that emerge are round andaffectless like a man singing falsetto His emotional peaks are almost alwaysachieved at the lowest volume He whispers You expect him to sink beneath thelevel of audibility But those falsetto timbres of his make a searing toneeven in a middle register where tones are usually not searing and the soundis an Xray which penetrates everywhere            The of his performances that I have heard do not capturethe full strangeness in this sound The CDs get louder or softer but thequality of penetration fails to vary The true Xray tonality is something youcan hear only in the concert hall And in the concert hall you become awarealso how risky it is for him to produce that very strange soundwhich is tosay how heroic is his playing In a recital at Carnegie Hall more than a yearago he reached for that sound and at one excruciating moment lost control ofhis bowing and sent out a wild overtone double the volume of his normalplaying like the feedback on an electric guitar Hendrixlike after alltheworst howler Ive ever heard from a musician of first rank            At hisPhilharmonic appearance during his most recent visit he performed a violaconcerto by the Russian composer Alfred Schnittke who not only wrote the piecefor him but was kind enough to derive a theme cabalistically from the lettersin Bashmets name The concertoyou can hear it for yourself on is afantastic affair It feels like an ancient epic with the viola as Gilgameshwandering the earth Unspeakable horrors deploy across the background Tartarhordes and Stalinist work brigades seem to go marching past in flaming colorsThe violence is shocking The starry sky is gorgeous            Schnittke is a witty composer and at certainmoments you have the feeling that he is drunkenly singing sardonic songs of woeand contempt And all the while Yuri Bashmet goes threading his way acrossthe foreground a lonely man with an eerie and haunting sound sometimesquietly shrieking sometimes singing lyricallya heartbreaking figureheartbreakingly courageousuntil by the end he seems to be quietly sobbingIm not sure that in the course of his performance with the PhilharmonicBashmet didnt once again lose control of  Yet by the end I was nearly sobbingmyself            It was because thecharismatic in music is genuinely aweinspiring and to watch the violist trekacross Schnittkes barbarous Russian landscape was like watching humanity andinhumanity in ferocious battle waging every grand and noble struggle that weassociate with the  th century violin concertos except without anyof the reassuring triumphalism that among  th century composerswas indistinguishable from a finale            But what is thisawesome thingthe charismatic in music My supposition of the momentnow thatI find myself under Bashmets sway a definite indication of charismatic forceby the wayis that charisma in music the real thing and not the fake is amorethanmusical quality Music is always telling stories more or less andI think that charismatic power is an element in one of those storiesthe forcewe feel when a strong personality comes up against a demonic power and refusesto be cowed and takes hairraising risks and succeeds in being if only for amoment the demons equal
