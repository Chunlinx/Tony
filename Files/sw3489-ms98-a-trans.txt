        okay Jerry i guess tonights topic is about recycling and id like to tell you first of all whats happening in our community here in Plano     umhum all right   right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the by the collection agency or the the city along with your garbage can uh you can put out newspaper you can put out glass you can put out aluminum cans you can put put out certain types of plastic material and thats on a roll out effort right now not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and uh participate right now but uh that will be rolled out to everyone i hope in the next year or so and those that arent participating they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum and i think uh overall thats an an excellent opportunity because i hate to see our landfills being filled up and uh growing bigger and bigger and bigger where theyre becoming a big problem for only not only the people that are living today but for the future also   yeah uh i was reading  my community thats cute i live in a place called Dye Mound   so how about your community   Dye Mound   or Dye Community   uhhuh   and its not a city  not incorporated my nearest neighbors about a half a mile at least i cant even see their house and uh     sounds like a place where i grew up   yeah i mean uh im out in im out in the wilderness literally   well i like it   and uh well give you an idea its three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete i mean to the asphalt were out there   uhhuh   and uh we i do some interesting recycling things   well good   im building our house right now and im going to incorporate into my uh garage area a weight activated uh crusher   oh okay   so when i drive the car in the in the driveway in the afternoon it itll just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the the uh pressure side of a uh hydraulic cylinder   umhum   and the weight of the car will crush whats ever in the disposer     oh   hopefully hopefully its not my wife   well lets hope not you can be uh get in trouble for that   well i thought id you know id use it as a a escapement type thing i dont know if youre familiar with that operation but what you do is you just build up the pressure   uhhuh   and then you go over and release it and then it just it just drops you know   well its quite similar to a hydraulic jack isnt it   very similar yeah   okay okay   well what what itll be you just you drive up on the jack but you it wont go down   yes until you release it   until you pull the pin yeah   all right i think thats   anyway i  i have another uh recycling method i use   yes   you know all that junk mail you get   oh yes i sure do   the glossy paper that says buy this and send off for that and you have won and all that well anytime they send me a return envelope   uhhuh umhum   i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i you know happen to gather up   oh     because uh well like i say we live away and when you throw trash away you throw it in my yard and i dont like that so i dont do that so i take it and i send and i mail it back to them   yes no well great thats excellent   ive had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff   well uh if a lot of people did that then then we wouldnt have a lot of this junk mail thats a great idea i hadnt thought about that and we might be able to incorporate some of that one thing   yeah well i think one of the the best ways to eliminate uh or help the recycling problem is to eliminate nonreusable items   right   for instance uh i saw a thing on uh Nova think was the other day this guy has designed   umhum   recyclable materials i mean recyclable items whatever he makes its all out of the same thing   right oh   see so if its plastic its all out of plastic if its metal its all out of metal its hes a design hes a engineer designing stuff   yes well thats a great idea thats a great idea   and incorporating incorporating incorporating incorporating you know reusable materials into your uh you know your assembly line into your actual scheme of   product   product operations is is the only way to really do it on a on a broad scale make it financially uh attractive to recycle and somebody will find a way to make money at it   yes uhhuh yes they will exactly   well there is a guy in Dallas thats all he does   hm   he collects trash   well thats a full time job   you know yeah well hes hes out for cardboard   yes well ive found out too that uh you know a couple years ago weve always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years and at one time we could get a pretty good return uh with the Boy Scouts we could take and collect the newspaper an and
