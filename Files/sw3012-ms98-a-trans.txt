                hello   hello   hi um this is Betty and im in Richardson Texas   im Nola and im in Plano   oh okay well here we go       i guess were going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are that did some stuff over in the Gulf um   yeah no did you push one oh okay okay well then i think it i just started doing this so i dont know too much about it   yeah uh no i havent pushed one yet i just oh okay were just sort of getting acquainted here   oh okay   um you know i i just wanted to see if you know you had an opinion about this or you know   uhhuh   um so if thats okay with you then ill just press one okay   thatll be fine     well hi  good morning   hi   i think i mean if if i start this i just wanted to say that um one of the things that i dont think we really understood about the the middle eastern situation is that theyre a totally different type of people than we are and i mean they think differently and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours and and right now i i think that thats been proven in the fact that um they have just well anyway i just think that you know the United States policy over there i think we should just leave them alone i really do in in a major way because they just um that whole region over there i think needs to settle its own differences within itself   yeah   and thats the way the course that they should go i mean you know we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them but i dont think this intervention at such high levels should be going on the the thing with Israel and Palestine i believe that should be settled between them and also um you know the other thing is their idea or our idea idea of democracy has nothing to do with them i mean that i mean im talking about the whole middle eastern and and maybe this is too general but i just believe that um they do not look at democracy the same way we do they dont understand it as we dont understand the way they live   yeah   and so you know trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just you know it i dont think that thats the way to go in this and um you know it it oh well thats thats a couple thoughts on it i i guess you know id like you to maybe express something here   yeah well i i i think overall thats right i think its kind of sad though that for generations theyve been taught to hate each other   yeah   and thats if you know if somewhere in there someones going to have to learn a different way   thats yeah   you know and an i i think that um true we do have completely different ways of looking at things at a lot of things but uh at the same time i think there are a lot of there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do as far as example and and um i think some different things could come from whats happened than what we expect   well yeah well yeah um i i guess we could be a catalyst for their change i um the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there and i dont think wed be talking about this you know the Israeli situation Palestinian situation um sort of came to a head um unless there had been a war i mean that was   yeah   one thing that came out of it good or bad i i dont judge any war as good or bad its just a war  and i dont see any winners or losers i just see dead bodies im sorry  you know but um   yeah   i i i just think you know youre right and i think maybe its at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along its not going to be that were going to uh you know sort of tell them to go to their room and thats going to solve the whole problem its going to be them   yeah but thats the type of thing they understand they dont understand any other way and so at that at that you have to work at their level to an extent too   yeah and you know its yeah that thats true too i um   uh they wouldnt have understood anything else than what we did in the war there was nothing else yeah   oh well yeah they they understand violence  they love violent leaders to you know i mean look at you know the leader they had they they just adored him because he was so strict and cruel and you know for a while there he had them   yeah i cant figure out why they adored him   well it has a lot to do with their religion i got to say that over there um and i know this   yes yeah   only because from personal experience that im speaking of this because ive ive you know traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where ive done that and one one of the kindest people ive ever met in my whole life um is from that area of the country and i mean he is just overly he he is abounding in kindness lets say and his life is so Godly i mean every thought they have a totally different life than we have   yeah hum   you know and when you add the um commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them and they have very basic life um   yeah   well its just a very basic life and they just really believe in Allah or God or whatever and its you know everything is to the glory of Allah and and you know and it its almost like   umhum whats sad is that the leaders that have control   yeah well thats see   are in   that using that yeah   power yes and they abuse that   and its always been military and its always been and thats thats always been the way of the world dont you think   which i think that thats not the the way the majority of the people over there really are   yeah so its really hard when you see the leaders compared to the people   but i think in a in a way the war uh i think in a way all uh the involvement over there too though has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that dont follow what those few are doing and there are a lot of people who are good people   yeah yeah   you know theres and i i think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these uh newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the the uh soldiers leaving um you know surrendering and trying to get out of that situation and and the um uh you know   right and surrendering that was yeah it just really comes down to people are people you know you have to have some compassion some humanness doesnt matter where the boundaries are   thats right   um you know there are political boundaries and those are man made boundaries but you know for heaven sakes thats something thats been going on for ages and   and i i think so much of it is what youre taught   yeah thats true   you know they teach their children uh in such a way that
