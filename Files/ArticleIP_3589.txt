                                 Narcissusism            You cant avoid daffodils inApril and you wouldnt want to With their long ruffled trumpets and brightpetals splayed like the rays of the sun these unabashed bloomers give ofthemselves freely and ask little in return Even the hardest among us feel likebetter people for taking pleasure in their charms            Mycurrent favorite is shyer than most Its called Narcissus Hawera  andit bloomed for the first time in New Zealand in  Its small rarelyexceeding  inches Its a translucent pale yellow with a head that dipsslightly beckoning you to lift it with a finger to get a better look It has ashort straight snub nose with the tiniest unevenness along the rim Itsperianth is reflexed meaning that the petals sweep back from the cup and twista little so that the flower looks as if its being blown by a gentle wind Acurve at the top of the stem causes the Hawera to flutter giving it adisarming nervousness            Despite seeming so vulnerable Hawera is sturdy andnot at all fussy Its an excellent performer often yielding several belllikeflowers on a single stem and blooming for weeks Content almost anywhere itmultiplies freely It has a sweet delicate fragrance unlike the heady odorsome narcissuses give off            I firstsaw Hawera last spring in a garden outside Chicago where it had beenplanted along the foundation of a stone house in long drifts interspersed withsweeps of fern The  th century British gardener Gertrude Jekyllwas the first to suggest pairing ferns with daffodils pointing out that justas the daffodil foliage begins to brown and die back the fern hits its strideand covers the mess This particular fern was fine and lacy and looked fetchingnext to Hawera  I scratched its name into my notebook and actuallyremembered to order some in the fall Last week in San Francisco I saw itcoming up in a pleasing manner from between the stones of a garden path            I set aside some of my own bulbs last fallpotting them to bring indoors to bloom in winter Although slow to appeartaking nearly two months to flower after being brought inside Hawerawas glorious when it finally arrived It ruined for me two varieties ofdaffodils I already had flowering One Narcissus Topolino  I had triedbecause it was said to be an easy forcer and it waseagerly blooming in avulgar fashion with a trumpet too long for its small face The otherNarcissus Diskcissal  was said to be fragrant and it wastoo fragrantPlus it was a splotchy yellow with white leaching through it Once the elegantHawera ventured forth the others were exiled to the compost pile                           Hawera is a late bloomer in the garden as well and while othervarieties of narcissus have been opening daily in my New York garden there isstill no sign of Hawera  Daffodils are categorized as early middleor lateblooming and if you choose a few from each you can hope for six weeksof flowers and you may actually get them When it
