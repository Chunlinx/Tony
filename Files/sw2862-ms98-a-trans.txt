                well did you get a chance to watch any of the games   uh no i i just kind of i i kind of watch them on the news and thats about it   oh okay   uh uh um the Michael Jordans on Chicago Bulls isnt he   yeah     what did he get hurt last night or   no i dont think so because uh i saw just a little bit of the game today and he was out there playing   oh okay   although uh i what i saw was at the end of the first quarter i think he only had like eightch eight points   umhum   at the end of the first quarter they thought that was big news   oh yeah   so i dont know but i dont know who won and uh i dont know who do you normally pull for the the Mavericks or   no i i kind of feel like the about the Mavericks the way i do about the Cowboys now   oh yeah   yeah uh just all this Roy Tarpley stuff and and uh what is it their you know he got hes in trouble again down in Houston and and uh they said the other night his contract is so big that if anything happens to him you know if they dont trade him theyll have to pay him off you know so theyre rather have him except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon and and and have some chance of him playing you know earning his money   oh jeez yeah because thats just dollars right out of the franchise   yeah sure is   oh man   yeah   now i uh i ive always been pulling for the Lakers for a long time   oh yeah   and uh not just not just because they always win but uh when they had uh Akeem   theyre consistent umhum   anybody who was old as that playing that well you know i just kind of had to go with them then i kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and uh course uh all the people that follow the Lakers and everything out there in in California um and it also helps when they were winning   yeah well they play better as a team than anybody else seems like   i was i always wondered that you know i i will take a look at the individual score you know in the individual stance in the NBA   umhum   and you know they they have in the paper you know like fifteen different categories and theyll have like a individuals uh theyll have the the highest scorer the top rebounders uh assists foul shooting percentages and all that and you go thown through and virtually every one of the categories there isnt uh a Laker in the top ten usually hardly any uh anybody anybody in the top twenty except for like Magic   uhhuh   and uh yet the Lakers continue to win so youre right i think they do really play much better as a team than they do uh uh each one you know individually at their spot but uh   yeah and year in and year out its not like they have you know a lot of teams will will will win the playoffs and then the next year theyll be all theyll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff to   yeah   to concentrate on the game   i understand that um i guess Bostons really uh giving uh arent arent they playing Detroit i think Bostons playing Detroit and i think theyre really giving them a run for their money   yeah except Larry Birds hurt   did he get hurt again   his his back is bad all the time now i think   yeah yeah i tell you what i guess its tough to play that many games and still stay healthy   yeah they play two or three times a week like you know and then they go on road trips and they do the same thing and and then they and then they stay out for two or three weeks at a time so it really gets you know the i mean theyre sleeping in different bed every night and   yeah yeah   and i imagine that really helps his back   he ought to have his own bed come along with him you know   uhhuh yeah he said he said the other night on the news that he hadnt done any extra shooting for six weeks so you know and hes the one thats always winning the um the the outside the three point shot and the   oh yeah yeah   he does that every year   yeah matter of fact i watched him uh on TV you know sink i dont know a jeez it was like uh uh thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range   uhhuh   unbelievable   yeah      oh i dont know did you ever play much basketball   not much just uh just just playing horse and stuff like that   yeah   yeah because its it kind of a violent game   it really is for a non contact sport quote unquote   and and they dont yeah and they dont wear any pads so i   yeah really   i figured     some of those guys got pretty funny funny looking uh eye wear   yeah they have to wear goggles because they get hit in the in the face with elbows all the time   man   well its his its i was looking in the paper for something on it and heres the the top NBA draft prospects and uh i mean theyre all the size of football players you know except theyre just taller   yeah several years ago when i was up in uh Cleveland i was staying at the Marriott and the Cavaliers were playing somebody i think it was like Utah or somebody like that and uh i was down by the pool and there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water now i wear uh contacts and i i had my glasses on and i went down there and and just jumped into the water where they were and it went right up over my head and i came up spittering and sputtering for air and they were all the basketball players there to play the Cavaliers they were all like uh like six eight and     uhhuh   uh you know six ten and they were standing in water that was like six foot   six foot yeah   you know and it was uh it was funny i tell you i saw i saw a guy i dont remember what his name was but he got on the elevator and he had his swimsuit on and uh he was just skin and bones you know it looked like something out of Africa   umhum   and uh  i made some comment and uh he says yeah he says i weigh about uh uh two hundred and forty pounds   yeah   but he says its not much when you stretch it over seven foot one   yeah really   so youre right those guys really you know the the big ones i dont even know how much Ewing weighs but uh hes got to be way up there   oh yeah well heres a heres a guy from LSU Stanley Roberts hes seven feet tall and he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds so   God thats a thats a lot thats a lot of a lot of guy coming down on you   yeah umhum   jeez i didnt even see whos whos supposed to have the the uh the best uh draft picks     it doesnt even say it doesnt say here it says uh it says the underclassmen this is for underclassmen for June twenty six   yeah   and uh i guess i guess they dont they have they they uh have a lottery on it they pick numbers and thats how they take them in order   oh yeah   it must not be according to their how they did during the year   i i used to go down to Reunion Arena uh went down there a couple years on the day of the draft   umhum   and that was really pretty interesting they usually have uh uh you know a video uh highlights of the season you know and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the Mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage both the good and the bad   umhum   i i dont know i havent i didnt go down there last year but uh it it was only like a couple dollars to get in and it was really kind of interesting but uh so who do you thinks going to win the playoffs   i i dont know whos  is it Chicago and and   Chicago uh and lets see uh Golden State and the Lakers and Chicago and Philadelphia think Chicagos playing Philadelphia and then the uh shoot i cant remember them all now   Utah Portland Boston and Detroit   right yeah yeah   okay thats the NBA yeah   NBA playoffs Philadelphia was uh favored by one point over Chicago and the Lakers one point over Golden State and Detroit by five five over uh Boston jeez   i think Boston Boston will win   think so   yeah   i tell you what those guys really hang tough   umhum   you know i id like to see them back up there again they really uh they really gave some some really good years of uh uh of enjoyment and fun and everything have you ever been up there to Boston Garden   oh no uh   well i dont know is that in i i havent really gone to a lot of games live but boy id sure like to basketballs gotten to be a lot of fun   umhum
