peculiarphysical symptoms that accompanied his death The strangest of these is theclaim by his contemporaries that Alexanders corpse did not decay for severaldaysan assertion usually written off as

Harvard Universitys WEB Du Bois Institute forAfroAmerican Research reflecting  years of scholarship on thetransatlantic slave trade was attacked at its unveiling last month at Williamand Mary College According to the Washington Post  critics faulted theCDROM for failing  to address the cultural impact of the African diaspora to provide a definitive list of the voyages and  to mention the names ofany of the millions of Africans transported to America on slave ships Otherscholars disagree saying that the CDROM brings together information on voyages undertaken by more than a dozen countries and that it revolutionizesour understanding of the slave trade For example the CDROM makes clear thathalf of the Africans died not during the middle passage as has been commonlyassumed but at African ports before embarking The CDROM will be availablefrom Cambridge UniversityPress for  beginning next month For more on the Du Bois Instituteread Franklin Foers Assessment of Henry Louis Gates Jr in
