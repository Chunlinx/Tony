                                 Bradleys  Hoop Schemes            If the Democratic presidential nomination were abasketball game we would be going into the second half with the Gore team ledby the former benchwarmer from the Harvard freshman team holding a slightlead The Bradley squad led by the former AllAmerican from Princeton hasntquite caught up and the captain is complaining that opponent Gore isntplaying fair            I think weve reached the sad day when a sittingvice president distorts a fellow Democrats record because he thinks he canscore a cheap political point Bradley said recently            This isnt just a runaway sport metaphor Bradleyswhining about Gores tactics is in fact an essential aspect of his politicalstyle and is surely derived from his style as a basketball player            Not that Bradleys complaints arent sometimesjustified Gores tiresome accusation that Bradley favors Medicaid vouchersseeks to link his foe subliminally if irrationally to Republican plans forschool vouchers The vice presidents effort to portray Bradley as a latterdayNewt Gingrich is unconvincing considering that Bradley is frank about hisdesire to spend a lot of tax dollars expanding the availability of federalhealth insurance            But if anybody shouldrecognize why Gore is dishing out cheap shots it is Bradley As a playerBradley was a gifted shooter with remarkable stamina but he lacked the footspeed and upperbody strength of many NBA athletes He compensated for hisliabilities with tactics which while not exactly cheating were not quitewithin the rules either            One of Bradleys former opponents Baltimore Bullet forwardJack Marin spent every game trying to escape Bradleys viselike hold on hisshorts the Washington Post recently reported            He was one of the dirtiest players I ever playedagainst Marin told the Post  He held and pushed and tugged It wasirritating            A former Princeton teammate was quoted as describingBradleys style as Darwinistic Basketball is a contact sport Gary Walterssaid He was never a goodytwoshoes If Bill had been a pitcher he wouldhave thrown brushback pitches Thats the game within the game            Now this competitive style seems to be a point ofpride According to the Post  Bradleys wife Ernestine likes to tellsupporters about her first Knicks game where she was amazed to discover thather gentle totally open inquisitive boyfriend threw elbows like a streetfighter Watch the elbows she warns to applause            But now that Gore isthrowing elbows back in an effort to stave off Bradleys gains thegentlemanscholarstatesman is quick to take offense            Heres Bradley complaining to Meet thePress moderator Tim Russert about Gores insinuation that he might raisethe eligibility age for Social Security                           Bradley The reality is that the only way this is going to be solved is if youcan prevent it from being a political football like Als criticism of me forvoting to continue discussion on a variety of options at the same time theadministration was considering the same discussion               GoreNo               Bradley I mean you know if its OK for the administration to discuss               GoreNo Not raising the retirement age               Bradley getting sarcastic Oh you didnt discuss it in all of your SocialSecurity forums out there               GoreWell I certainly didnt               Bradley No one ever did right No one ever did Give me a break                        For sports fans Bradleys bitching and moaning is lessthan surprising The competitor who takes liberties when the refs arentlooking is often the same one who wants special attention when they are            Sportswriters call it working the refs and it isa subtle art While a mediocre athlete such as Gore often regards thereferees as impartial arbiters to be respected a superior athlete such asBradley will treat them as fallible foes who can be manipulated into renderingfavorable decisions In the political arena of course reporters are analogousto refs Electoral competitors as well as athletic competitors seek to appearaggrieved rather than antagonistic This appeals to the crowd whose roar mayprovoke a favorable call without calling into question the judgment of themedia referees            The trick as Bradleydemonstrated on Meet the Press  is to bring the opponents dirty deedsinto plain view                           Bradley Whether its my healthcare plan or whatever then you only have anegative message               GoreWell hold on a second here               Bradley Im talking about positive messages               GoreYeah               Bradley To talk to people about where the country should go               GoreWell you know I havent had to apologize yet               Bradley I know you havent                GoreNor have you called upon me to               Bradley I call upon you now to apologize               Gorebecause I havent given you to cause to But at the beginning of theshow               Bradley Do you apologize               GoreNo I dont               Bradley OK Well there it is There it is                        This is the political version of the basketball moment whenan exasperated player turns to the ref and points out his opponents allegedfoul In sports the putative victim almost always shouts something like Thereit is In this case Russert didnt blow his whistle and the game went on            The fact is that in politics as in sports bendingthe rules isnt cheating if you get away with it Pitchers scuff the ballDefensive ends deliver late hits Other athletesturnedpoliticians seem tohave absorbed this point better than Bradley Jack Kemp the former BuffaloBills quarterback who ran for vice president on Bob Doles ticket has alwaysbeen too much of a rahrah type to complain about political cheap shots JimBunning the junior senator from Kentucky was known during his major leaguebaseball career for throwing hard inside fastballs to keep batters off theplate But he hasnt complained about the tactics of his political rivals            The Bradley reflex to call foul is probably tooingrained for Bradley to completely abandon it But somebody needs to remindhim that you dont win the game by working the refs You gotta score points onyour own Bill quit whining and play
