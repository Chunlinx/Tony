                    Background        RNA polymerase II pol II transcription factor TFIID        comprises the TATAbinding protein TBP and a set of        TBPassociated factors TAF         II s        At least  TAF         II s have been identified in TFIID and        cloning of their cDNAs has shown an evolutionary        conservation of TAF         II s from yeast to mammals                TAF         II s are not only components of the        TFIID complex but a subset of TAF         II s are also found in the SAGA PCAF        TFTCSTAGA complexes which lack TBP                        TAF         II function in living cells has been        studied in yeast where the use of temperature sensitive        TS mutants has shown that many TAF         II s are required for transcription of        the majority of yeast genes          In        contrast TS lesions in TAF         II  TAF         II  and TAF         II  have a less dramatic effect        affecting the expression of only a specific subset of genes        mainly involved in the cell cycle       for        reviews see           In mammalian cells a TS mutation in TAF         II  shows that one of the functions        of this protein is cell cycle regulation                Genetic experiments indicate that TAF         II  is required for the viability of        mouse F embryonal carcinoma cells as well as for their        differentiation into parietal endoderm   In the        absence of TAF         II  undifferentiated F cells die        through apoptosis but TAF         II  is not required for survival of        retinoic acid differentiated F cells        Several studies have also focused on TAF         II  TAF         II  comprises  amino acids and        contains multiple functional domains At least four        glutaminerich domains have been described Sp and CREB        interact with distinct glutaminerich domains of TAF         II  and TAF         II  acts as a coactivator         in vitro for these activators In        transfected cells subdomains of TAF         II  can act as dominant negative        repressors of CREB activity        It has        further been suggested that some neurodegenerative diseases        may result from sequestration of TAF         II  by expanded polyglutamine domains        and consequent interference with CREB activity   TAF         II  also contains two conserved        regions CRI and CRII which are shared with the         Drosophila homologue dTAF         II  and mammalian TAF         II     The CRII region is        also shared with the yeast homologue yTAF         II     and contains a histone        fold domain required for heterodimerisation with hTAF         II yTAF         II     The CRII domain plays        an essential role in the ability of TAF         II  to potentiate liganddependent        transactivation by the the receptor for alltrans retinoic        acid RAR in transfected mammalian cells    Aside        from these studies little is known concerning the role of        TAF         II  in more physiological        situations        An increasing body of evidence indicates that targeted        S proteasomemediated proteolysis of transcription        factors is an integral part of the transactivation process        There is a very tight relationship between the potency of        activation domains and their stability                Activation domains and sequences required for degradation        overlap and mutations in the VP activation domain which        impair its function result in enhanced protein stability          Similarly liganddependent targeted proteolysis of        several nuclear receptors has been observed                In the estrogen receptor the RAR and the RXR        deletion of the helix H of the ligand binding domain        which is essential for liganddependent activation        stabilises these proteins showing that proteolysis and        transactivation are intimately linked        In        the case of nuclear receptors their targeted proteolysis        in the presence of ligand may be a mechanism for        attenuating the physiological response to the ligand It        has also been suggested that targeted proteolysis is a        means of regulating other physiological responses such as        signaling through STAT factors   and heat shock                 Although targeted proteolysis of transcriptional        activators has been investigated it is not known whether        components of the basal transcription apparatus are subject        to this type of regulation in response to physiological        stimuli We show here that TBP and TAF         II  are selectively depleted in        extracts from TRA differentiated F cells and from        differentiated CC cells This depletion is due to the        selective targeting of TBP and TAF         II  for proteolytic degradation since        depletion is blocked when cells are treated with proteasome        inhibitors During F cell differentiation degradation of        TBP and TAF         II  is concomitant with that of the        RAR a critical activator in primitive endoderm        differentiation These results reveal a novel pathway        controlling the intracellular levels of these two TFIID        components and show that in F cells RA not only induces        targeted proteolysis of the RAR but also of the basal        transcription factors which mediate transcriptional        activation We further show that stable ectopic expression        of TAF         II  in F cells delays the targeted        degradation of endogenous TAF         II  TBP and the RAR in response        to TRA The cells have an enhanced growth rate and their        differentiation into primitive endoderm is impaired at an        early stage but they readily differentiate into parietal        endoderm Treatment of these cells with TRA also induces        the appearance of a population of cells with an atypical        elongated morphology distinct from that of the primitive        endodermal cells which have not been previously documented        with wild type F cells and which are resistant to        differentiation with btcAMP                    Results                  TBP and TAF II are selectively depleted in          extracts from TRA differentiated F cells          F cells are a well characterised model for cellular          differentiation In the presence of TRA F cells          differentiate into primitive or visceral endoderm and          into parietal endoderm in the presence of TRA and bt            cAMP       Differentiation          is accompanied by growth inhibition characteristic          changes in cell morphology targeted degradation of          RAR induction of marker genes and increased          apoptosis          To determine whether components of basal transcription          factor TFIID were subject to regulation during F cell          differentiation immunoblotting with monoclonal          antibodies against TBP and a number of TAF           II s was used to monitor the levels          of the respective proteins in differentiated cell          extracts see Materials and Methods          No significant changes in the levels of TAF           II  TAF           II  TAF           II  TAF           II  and TAF           II  or the largest subunit of RNA          polymerase II were observed between  and  days of TRA          treatment Fig A lanes  and data not shown In          striking contrast TAF           II  and TBP were strongly and          selectively depleted in extracts made from cells          differentiated with TRA for more than  days Fig          Alanes  and remained at low levels up until at least          day  lanes  No such changes were observed in          vehicle treated control cultures Fig A lanes           In these experiments TAF           II  and TBP were detected using two          different monoclonal antibodies directed against distinct          epitopes see Materials and methods The relevant          extracts from TRA treated cells were also analysed by          staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue showing that there          was no overall change in the protein profile Fig B          Therefore there is a selective depletion of these two          TFIID components in extracts from differentiating          cells          To evaluate the levels of TBP and TAF           II  in extracts from primitive          endodermal cells we performed titration experiments using          serial dilutions of undifferentiated F cell extract          Upon prolonged exposure TAF           II  could still be detected in a          fold dilution of the F cell extract whereas it was          virtually undetectable in extracts from day           differentiated cells Fig C lanes  compared with          lane  Similarly TBP was readily detected in the          fold dilution of F cell extract while the levels          detected in the differentiated cell extracts were          significantly lower compare lanes  and           The above experiments were performed with total cell          extracts made in the presence of  M KCl We also asked          whether the depletion of TBP and TAF           II  would be observed in nuclear          extracts from differentiated F cells where the nuclei          were extracted with  M KCl to ensure efficient protein          extraction As observed in total cell extracts TAF           II  and TBP were selectively          depleted in nuclear extracts from differentiated cells          Fig D          TBP and TAF           II  were strongly and selectively          depleted in extracts from visceral endoderm          differentiated F cells analogous to what was observed in          primitive endodermal cells data not shown When F          cells were treated with TRA and bt            cAMP to induce parietal endoderm          differentiation a selective depletion of TBP and TAF           II  also took place between day           and day  Fig Elanes   and  however TBP but          not TAF           II  reappeared in parietal          endodermal cell extracts around day  lanes           Together the above results indicate that there is a          specific regulation of TBP and TAF           II  during F cell          differentiation                          Depletion of TBP and TAF II is not observed in          F cells which are refractory to TRA          To determine whether the depletion of TBP and TAF           II  was intimately linked to the          differentiation process we examined the regulation of          these proteins in mutant F cells with altered          differentiation properties F cells in which the          retinoid X receptor  gene has been disrupted by          homologous recombination RXR cells are impaired in          their response to TRA   When these cells are          treated with TRA the depletion of TBP and TAF           II  observed in the cell extracts          is delayed by almost  days and takes place only between          days  and  rather than between days  and  in          wildtype cells Fig A while no such depletion is          seen in extracts from vehicle treated cells Fig B In          contrast no significant change in TBP and TAF           II  is seen in extracts from TRA          treated RXR RAR cells in which the RAR gene has          also been disrupted    and which are known to be          refractory to TRA induced differentiation Fig C          Thus the selective depletion of TBP and TAF           II  requires that the F cells          respond at least partially to TRA but does not          require full differentiation to take place                          Depletion of TBP and TAF II is due to targeted          proteolytic degradation          The depletion of TBP and TAF           II  in extracts from day  TRA          treated cells could result from transcriptional or          posttranscriptional events Semiquantitative          reversetranscription PCR RTPCR experiments using          exonspecific oligonucleotide primers showed that there          were no significant changes in the TAF           II  or TBP mRNA levels during          differentiation data not shown This suggests that          disappearance of TBP and TAF           II  in extracts from differentiated          cells does not occur at the transcriptional level but          rather results from a posttranscriptional event          The peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitors MG and          ALLN have previously been used to investigate the          posttranscriptional regulation of proteins during          physiological processes    To determine whether          the depletion of TAF           II  and TBP observed in the          extracts from late TRA treated F cells was due to their          selective proteolysis we treated TRA differentiated          cells with these inhibitors on days     and           After an overnight exposure extracts were prepared day              and  extracts in Figs Aand B In the          absence of MG or ALLN TBP and TAF           II  disappeared in the          differentiated cell extracts middle panel Figs Aand          Blanes  In contrast in the presence of the          inhibitors both proteins were readily detected even at          late times where they are normally not observed lanes           The levels were nevertheless lower than those          detected in undifferentiated cell extracts The level of          TAF           II  which remains constant during          differentiation is only mildly increased by the addition          of MG or ALLN Figs Aand Blower panel lanes           and  The addition of MG or ALLN to          nondifferentiated cells also resulted in only a small          increase in TBP and TAF           II  levels Figs Aand B top          panel compare lanes  and  The above results          indicate that when proteolysis is inhibited the depletion          of TBP and TAF           II  is no longer observed showing          that it is due to TRAinduced proteolytic          degradation          We also prepared extracts from differentiated cells          where MG was added only at the time of extract          preparation Extracts made in this way are a measure of          the intracellular level of these proteins since synthesis          and degradation are both stopped at the same time          Comparison of the TBP and TAF           II  levels in extracts from day           differentiated cells prepared in the presence of MG          showed that they were indeed significantly reduced          compared to undifferentiated cells or day           differentiated cells approximately  fold Fig C          lanes   and  similar results were obtained in the          presence of ALLN data not shown Nevertheless these          proteins do not disappear completely as they do in the          absence of MG lanes  Therefore the complete          disappearance of these proteins seen in the absence of          protease inhibitors indicates that there is further          degradation in the extracts which exaggerates the          differences between differentiated and undifferentiated          cells Although less TBP could be immunopurified from          the MG blocked differentiated cell extracts using the          antiTBP antidody C when equal amounts of          immunopurified TBP from differentiated and          undifferentiated cells was loaded equivalent amonts of          TAF           II  were detected in the TFIIDs          data not shown Thus while the overall level of TFIID          is diminished through the reduction in TBP and TAF           II  the relative stoichiometry of          the remaining TFIID is not significantly altered The          apparently larger decrease in TAF           II  seen in Fig Cresults from the          lower efficiency of the antibody see also Fig C          Taken altogether the above results show that the          intracellular level of TBP and TAF           II  and consequently TFIID is          significantly reduced in differentiated cells through          TRAinduced proteolytic degradation                          Coordinate degradation of TBP TAF II and the          RARgamma receptor during F cell differentiation          It has previously been shown that the RAR is subject          to degradation beginning  hours after TRAinduced          differentiation of F cells   To determine whether          there is a coordinate degradation of RAR TBP and TAF           II  we examined extracts made at          these early times After  hours of TRA treament the          levels of RAR TBP and TAF           II  were unchanged Fig D lanes           However after  hours there was a TRAdependent          reduction in the amount of RAR and TBP and a          significant shift in the electrophoretic mobility of TAF           II  lanes  By  days the          levels of all three proteins were strongly reduced lanes           These results indicate that the onset of          degradation of TBP and TAF           II  is concomitant with that of the          RAR suggesting that these events are          interdependent                          Constitutive ectopic expression of TAF II          impairs F cell primitive endoderm differentiation          The above results show that the level of TAF           II  and TBP is strictly controlled          during the differentiation of F cells by a          posttranscriptional mechanism involving targeted          proteolysis To test whether artificially increasing the          level of TAF           II  would affect the proper          differentiation of F cells we established cell lines          which constitutively express flagtagged versions of          human TAF           II  fTAF           II  and fTAF           II  see Materials and          methods TAF           II  contains all the          known functional domains but lacks an unconserved          prolinealaninerich region whereas TAF           II  comprises only the          CRII region          For fTAF           II   cell lines were          examined and we chose two lines A and B since they          expressed the highest levels of the fTAF           II  protein Immunoblotting with an          antiflag monoclonal antibody showed a significantly          higher expression level in line A compared to line B          Fig A lanes  This result is confirmed by          immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody TA which          detects both the endogenous and ectopically expressed TAF                    II  proteins Figs Band C lane           In line A the level of the ectopically expressed          protein is higher than that of the endogenous protein          while in line B both the exogenous and the endogenous          proteins are expressed at similar levels For fTAF           II  which contains only          the conserved Cterminal domain  cell lines were          examined of which  expressed the fTAF           II  protein Fig A Both of the          cell lines expressing fTAF           II  showed an          approximately fold accelerated growth rate compared to          wild type cells while no significant increase was seen in          the fTAF           II  expressing cells          Fig E and data not shown note that the apparent          slowing of growth between day  and  for lines A and B          is due to their reaching confluence          We first verified whether treatment of these cells          with TRA would lead to the depletion of the ectopically          expressed TAF           II  In line A both the          ectopically expressed TAF           II  and the endogenous TAF           II  were depleted with the same          kinetics Fig B lanes  TBP was also concomitantly          depleted in these extracts and all three proteins were          stabilised when cells were treated with MG lanes           Importantly however the disappearance of all three          proteins was clearly delayed by  hours compared to          wildtype cells compare Figs Band Fig Aor Fig C          In line B there was also coordinate disappearance of TBP          and the exogenous and endogenous TAF           II  Fig C although no obvious          delay such as that seen in line A is observed In          contrast no depletion of fTAF           II  was seen following          TRA treatment while the endogenous TBP and TAF           II  were depleted normally between          days  and  Fig B and data not shown          As the targeted proteolysis of TBP and TAF           II  is linked to the          differentiation process the delayed depletion in line A          suggests that TRA induced differentiation may be          perturbed Their differentiation was therefore compared          to that of the wildtype cells          In wild type cells the degradation of RAR begins at          day  and the protein is strongly depleted from extracts          made at day  Fig D lane  At later times low          levels of only the unphosphorylated form of RAR can be          seen in the extracts lanes  In contrast in line A          elevated levels of RAR are observed even at day  Fig          D lanes  In line B an intermediate situation is          observed since high levels of RAR are seen at day           which decrease by day  lanes  In all cases low          levels of only the unphosphorylated RAR are detected by          days  lanes  These results indicate that          proteolytic degradation of RAR is delayed in lines A          and B suggesting that an early event in the          differentiation process has been perturbed          Comparison of the growth rate of line A with that of          wildtype cells in the presence of TRA shows that line          A is less sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of          TRA than wildtype however growth is eventually slowed          compared to undifferentiated cells Fig E Line B also          grows faster than wildtype over the first  days but          subsequently its growth slows and is considerably          retarded compared to undifferentiated cells Fig E          Together these observations show that line A is poorly          sensitive to TRAinduced growth arrest and retains an          essentially undifferentiated morphology while growth of          line B slows after  days of TRA treatment and          morphological differentiation is retarded          We determined whether fTAF           II  expression modified          TRA induced apoptosis The proportion of early apoptotic          cells in lines A B and wildtype was determined by flow          cytometry in the presence of propidium iodide and annexin          VFITC     In wildtype cells the proportion          of early apoptotic cells increased from  in the          absence of TRA to  after  days of TRA treatment          Fig  In line A spontaneous apoptosis was lower than          wild type  compared to  and only a mild increase           was seen by day  Fig  In line B spontaneous          apoptosis was also lower than wild type  compared to           while in the presence of TRA the proportion rose          to  Fig  Thus line A is resistant to TRA          induced apoptosis while line B shows reduced sensitivity          to TRA induced apoptosis          Differentiation of lines A and B was further assessed          from changes in cellular morphology  days after the          addition of TRA wildtype F cells adopt a typical          flattened primitive endodermal morphology see upper          panel of Fig  In contrast line A cells retain an          essentially undifferentiated morphology even after  days          of TRA treatment centre panel Fig  The          differentiation of line A is severely impaired as the          cells never adopt a differentiated morphology even after           days of RAtreatment data not shown Similarly          line B cells appear essentially undifferentiated after           days of TRA treatment lower panel Fig  After           days a fraction of the cells begin to adopt a primitive          endodermal type morphology although the cells are much          less flattened than wildtype cells and the majority of          the cells retain an undifferentiated morphology Fig           Only after  days of TRA treatment did the majority of          the cells adopt a differentiated morphology data not          shown          F cell differentiation is characterised by the          induction of different marker genes We used reverse          transcription coupledPCR RTPCR to compare the          induction of some of these genes in lines A and B with          that observed in wildtype cells The RAR gene is a          marker which is rapidly induced in wildtype cells          normally after  hours         In          agreement with this the RAR mRNA is fully induced by          day  in wildtype cells Expression persists until day           and decreases only by day  Fig A lanes  note          that the small increase in lane  in this experiment is          not reproducibly observed In contrast in lines A and          B RAR expression is weak at day  peaks only at day           and drops off by day  lanes  and  Thus          induction of RAR is severely retarded and transient in          lines A and B In the same RNA samples constant          expression levels of HPRT were observed in differentiated          and undifferentiated cells In contrast to the RAR          gene induction of the collagen IV and laminin B mRNAs          was almost identical in the wildtype and mutant cells          Fig Band data not shown showing that the delay in          induction is specific to RAR          After  days of TRA treatment bt            cAMP was added to induce parietal          endoderm differentiation Addition of bt            cAMP induced the rapid appearance of          rounded cells with typical parietal endoderm morphology          for both the wild type cells and lines A and B Fig           Thus while primitive endoderm differentiation of lines A          and B is impaired they readily differentiate into          parietal endoderm          In lines A and B we noticed after  days of TRA          treatment the appearance of a novel cell type          characterised by elongated tightly packed cells Fig          A The morphology of these cells was completely          different from those of undifferentiated or primitive          endoderm cells Although the majority of the cell          population differentiates when bt            cAMP is added to these cultures the          elongated cells persisted even after several days of bt            cAMP treatment Fig B showing          that these cells are refractory to the differentiating          effect of bt            cAMP Cells with this atypical          morphology were not observed when wildtype cells or fTAF                    II  expressing cells are          differentiated either with TRA or TRA and bt            cAMP Therefore ectopic expression          of fTAF           II  has induced a novel          differentiation pathway leading to the appearance of          atypical elongated cells          Taken altogether the above results show that          primitive endoderm differentiation of F cells is blocked          in line A expressing the highest level of TAF           II  and is significantly          retarded in line B cells which express lower levels of          TAF           II  In contrast all          three fTAF           II  expressing cell lines          and several control lines picked at the same time all          showed a normal TRA response with respect to growth          inhibition differentiated cell morphology and targeted          depletion of TAF           II  and TBP Fig Band data not          shown                          TAF II and TBP are depleted in extracts from          differentiated CC cells          To determine whether the down regulation of TBP and          TAF           II  is specific to F cell          differentiation we asked whether this phenomenon could be          observed in an unrelated cell type CC are mouse          skeletal muscle myoblasts which differentiate into          multinucleated myotubes   This differentiation          process does not require the addition of retinoic acid          but takes place spontaneously when cultures are grown to          high density and undergo growth arrest          In extracts from differentiating CC cells a          progressive decrease in TAF           II  and TBP can be seen beginning          on day  such that these proteins are strongly depleted          from the extracts by day  Fig A lanes  compare          with lane  In contrast the levels of TAF           II  remain constant Fig A The          observed depletion of TBP and TAF           II  was not observed when the cells          on day  were treated with MG for  hours prior to          extract preparation on day  Fig B lanes           These results indicate that TBP and TAF           II  are also targetted for          proteolytic degradation during CC cell          differentiation                            Discussion                  Posttranscriptional regulation of TAF II and          TBP in differentiated F cells          We show here that targeted proteolysis of TBP and TAF           II  is an integral part of the TRA          response in F cells This process is specific for TBP          and TAF           II  as it is not observed with the          other TFIID components analysed and is induced          concomitantly with that of the RAR In F cells with          constitutive ectopic expression of TAF           II  targeted degradation is          delayed primitive endodermal differentiation is impaired          and a novel differentiation pathway is induced Hence          targeted degradation of TAF           II  and TBP is a prerequisite for          proper F celll differentiation          TAF           II  and TBP progressively disappear          from whole cell or nuclear extracts made from TRA          differentiated F cells This depletion does not result          from altered transcription of these genes since no          significant changes in the corresponding mRNA levels were          observed during differentiation In lines A and B the          ectopic expression of fTAF           II  is driven by a synthetic          promoter yet coordinate depletion of the exogenous and          endogenous TAF           II  is observed further confirming          that this is indeed a posttranscriptional event          In contrast TBP and TAF           II  are readily detected in          extracts made from differentiated cells treated with          MG ALLN and the proteasomespecific inhibitor          lactacystin our unpublished data showing that their          disappearance is due to selective proteolysis In the          presence of the inhibitors the detected levels are          significantly lower than those seen in equivalent          extracts made from undifferentiated cells Addition of          the protease inhibitors only during the extraction          procedure is another way to measure of the intracellular          level of TBP and TAF           II  In these extracts also the          levels of TBP and TAF           II  are significantly reduced in          differentiated cells compared with undifferentiated          cells Therefore the intracellular levels of TBP and TAF                    II  and consequently TFIID are          reduced in differentiated cells through selective          proteolysis          Targeted degradation of TAF           II  does not require amino acids           since deletion mutant  is targeted along          with the endogenous protein in lines A and B In          contrast mutant  is not degraded during          differentiation indicating that the sequences required          for targeting are located between amino acids           Many of proteins which are targeted for proteolytic          degradation contain signal sequences such as PEST or          cyclin destruction boxes which mediate their proteolysis          however no recognised destabilising motifs are present in          TBP and TAF           II  and indeed these proteins are          stable in nondifferentiated F cells and in many other          cell types It will therefore be interesting to identify          the sequences are required for degradation of TBP and TAF                    II  in differentiating F cells In          this respect we note that we have not been able to          recover F cell lines significantly overexpressing TBP          suggesting that TBP overexpression is toxic          In F cells RAR plays a key role in primitive          endoderm differentiation        hours after          addition of TRA degradation of this protein begins such          that by  days most of the protein is depleted            The onset of RAR degradation coincides with that of TBP          and TAF           II  suggesting that these events          are causaly related This idea is supported by the fact          that in line A degradation of TBP TAF           II  and RAR are all delayed to          similar extents A lesser delay in degradation of RAR          in line B was also observed If the corresponding delay          in TBP and TAF           II  degradation in line B was less          than two days it would be missed since we prepared          extracts at two day intervals All of these observations          are consistent with the idea that upon exposure to TRA          there is an early transcriptional response in which a          RARRXR heterodimer activates genes required for          differentiation As a consequence the RAR and the TAF                    II  and TBP components of the basal          transcription machinery are downregulated through          proteolytic degradation It has been suggested that          degradation of the RAR or the ER is a means of          regulating the cellular response to these ligands both in          terms of magnitude and time    The coordinate          degradation of RAR TBP and TAF           II  in response to TRA indicates          that the cellular TRA response is not only regulated          through degradation of the activator but also through          degradation of components of the basal transcription          machinery          The differentiation of CC myoblasts into myotubes          does not require TRA but is induced by growth          inhibition and serum starvation Despite the important          differences between these cells and F cells targeted          degradation of TBP and TAF           II  is also observed when CC          cells differentiate Hence targeted degradation can be          induced by stimuli other than TRA Our report is the          first showing that basal transcription factors can be          regulated in this way in response to different          physiological stimuli          As described in the Introduction recent studies          indicate that the activation process is linked to          targeted proteolysis of transcriptional activators In          the case of the RAR degradation requires a          constitutive phosphorylation of the AF domain          heterodimerisation with RXR and the presence of ligand          indicating that the receptor has to be transcriptionally          active to be degraded   Under these conditions the          receptor is ubiquitinated and degraded While we have not          been able to directly detect ubiquitination of TBP or TAF                    II  in extracts where          ubiquitination of RAR can be detected our unpublished          data at early times we do observe a significant shift          in the electrophoretic mobility of TAF           II  which may correspond to a          polyubiquitinated intermediate While the molecular events          involved in degradation of transcription factors are in          general poorly understood it is noteworthy that both NRs          and TBP have been reported to interact with the          proteasome component SUG       which may act to          target these proteins for degradation In addition other          components of the proteasomeubiquitin degradation          pathway have also been shown to interact with either          nuclear receptors or components of the preinitiation          complex for review see   Further experiments will          be required to determine whether TBP and TAF           II  are modified directly to allow          targeting or whether they are targeted indirectly          through the formation of transcriptionally active          complexes with the RAR which as it is itself degraded          acts to recruit the degradation machinery          A decreased level of TBP in differentiated F cells          has previously been noted    These studies did          not address the mechanism underlying its downregulation          but they revealed a downregulation of the pol III TAF          BRF and the pol I TAF           I  and TAF           I  proteins and diminished          transcription by the corresponding polymerases in TRA          differentiated F cells In the light of the present          study it is possible that the BRF TAF           I  and TAF           I  proteins are also          posttranscriptionally downregulated by targeted          proteolysis in the same way as TBP and TAF           II  This pathway may therefore be          used to more generally regulate the activity of all three          RNA polymerases during differentiation                          TAF II plays a key role in F cell growth and          differentiation          We show here that TRAinduced primitive endoderm          differentiation is impaired in cell lines constitutively          expressing ectopic TAF           II  as judged from          retarded targeted degradation of RAR cell morphology          growth inhibition apoptotic response and induction of          the RAR marker gene The effects are most pronounced in          line A cells which express the highest level of ectopic          TAF           II  and do not show a          differentiated cell morphology even upon prolonged          exposure to TRA An intermediate but significant          effect is seen using all criteria tested in line B cells          where fTAF           II  expression is lower          In contrast cells expressing fTAF           II  differentiate          normally          The RAR gene is normally fully induced by           hours   and elevated expression persists up until day           In lines A and B induction was seen only after  days          and this induction was transient compared to wildtype          cells As the RAR gene is important for TRAinduced          growth arrest   its delayed induction in lines A and          B may in part explain the phenotype of these cells          Nevertheless the collagen IV and laminin B genes as          well as several other known marker genes our unpublished          data are induced normally in lines A and B by day           even when no obvious morphological differentiation is          observed This differential induction of the RAR versus          other marker genes has not been previously noted in the          various RAR and RXR knock out cell lines analysed The          phenotype generated by ectopic TAF           II  expression is therefore          distinct from that seen in these knock out cell lines          Most of the currently identified marker genes are not          appropriate for the analysis of the phenotype of these          lines A detailed understanding of how ectopically          expressed TAF           II  blocks primitive endoderm          differentiation will require the identification of novel          marker genes whose expression is significantly altered in          lines A and B and which may be directly regulated by TAF           II           Despite the fact that primitive endoderm          differentiation of these lines is perturbed they          differentiate normally into parietal endoderm This shows          that in contrast to what has previously been assumed          differentiation into parietal endoderm does not require          the cells to first be fully differentiated into primitive          endoderm since line A cells go from an essentially          undifferentiated morphology to a parietal morphology          However even line A is not totally refractory to TRA          since several marker genes are induced and they have          become bt            cAMP responsive Again the          phenotype of these cells is not the same as that of the          RXR RAR cells where none of these events take          place          Our results rather indicate that ectopic TAF           II  expression acts at an early          stage to impair primitive endoderm differentiation but          does not prevent the TRAinduced changes which render          the cells bt            cAMP responsive The initial          elevated TAF           II  expression in lines A and B          impairs both the TRA transcriptional response and its          associated degradation of RAR TBP and TAF           II  prolonging the period of          elevated expression of these proteins resulting in a          subsequent block of primitive endoderm differentiation          It has previously been shown that phosphorylation of the          RAR AF is indispensable for primitive endoderm          differentiation   When F cells expressing the RAR          in which the phosphorylation site has been mutated are          treated with TRA no degradation of this protein is          observed There is therefore an intimate relationship          between differentiation and RAR degradation suggesting          that proper RAR degradation is essential for          differentiation   This idea is supported by our          present results since we show that TAF           II  overexpression impairs both          RAR degradation and primitive endoderm differentiation          It is therefore probable that the increased stability of          the RAR in lines A and B is the major cause of their          impaired primitive endoderm differentiation It is          interesting to note that the TAF           II  deletion mutant is          not degraded in response to TRA and its expression does          not interfere with differentiation This suggests that          TAF           II  is only targeted for          degradation if it contributes functionally to the TRA          response          The severity of the phenotype observed in lines A and          B correlates with the expression level of the exogenous f          TAF           II  protein a version of          TAF           II  in which the Nterminal          prolinealanine rich region has been deleted The deleted          region is not conserved in hTAF           II  and dTAF           II  is not involved in          interactions with other TAF           II s SP or CREB     and          has no known function In agreement with this the fTAF           II  and the fTAF           II  protein can be          coprecipitated with the endogenous TFIID of lines A and B          our unpublished data It is likely therefore that the          phenotype of lines A and B results from the TAF           II  overexpression           per se  although we cannot exclude          the possibility that the effects are not due only to the          elevated expression levels but that they may          additionally reflect a dominant negative property of this          mutant Investigation of this has been hampered by the          fact that we have not been able to isolate F cell lines          stabley expressing full length TAF           II           Treatment of lines A and B with TRA induces a          fraction of the cells to adopt an atypical elongated cell          morphology which to our knowledge has not been          previously seen upon differentiation of F cells Unlike          the other cells in the population these cells do not          differentiate into parietal endoderm showing that they          are refractory to bt            cAMP These observations suggest          that ectopic TAF           II  expression promotes TRA          induction of genes which are normally not activated in F          cells leading to a novel differentiation pathway It is          also possible that TAF           II  expression modulates the          activity of transcription factors in addition to the RARs          leading to the appearance of this novel cell type                            Conclusions        We report for the first time that components of the        basal transcription machinery are subject to regulation by        targeted proteolysis in response to a physiological        stimulus Our results point to a critical role of TAF         II  in F cell physiology It is        downregulated during F cell differentiation and expression        of TAF         II  at elevated levels promotes cell        growth impairs the normal TRA response and induces a        novel differentiation pathway                    Materials and methods                  F and CC cell culture and          differentiation          Wildtype and mutant F cells were grown as described             Differentiation was induced by addition of           M alltrans retinoic acid TRA with or without  M          dibutaryl bt            cAMP In most experiments an          appropriate number of  cm plates were seeded with           cells and after  hours day  TRA was added and          protein or RNA extracts were made from one plate of cells          on each of the indicated days Stably transformed cell          lines were isolated by electroporating plasmid pXJfTAF           II  along with the          puromycin resistance gene under the control of the SV          promoter Puromycin resistant cell clones were selected          in the presence of gml of puromycin amplified and          the presence of exogenous fTAF           II  was detected by          immunoblotting and immunofluoresence data not shown          Aliquots of each clone were frozen after the minimum          number of passages and three independent differentiation          experiments giving analogous results were started from          the frozen stocks For cell growth rates  cm plates          were seeded with  cells and after  days cells were          counted with a particle counter Coulter Z CC cells          were maintained undifferentiated by growth at low          density CC cells were differentiated by plating at          high density and growth in  serum for the number of          days indicated on the figures Morphological          differentiation was clearly seen by light microscopy                          Extract preparation and immunoblotting          Protein extracts from cells were made essentially as          previously described    Briefly cells were washed          and harvested with ice cold phosphate buffered saline          Cells were then resuspended in buffer A  mM TrisHCl          pH   glycerol  mM Dithiothreitol  Nonidet          P with   M KCl and subjected to two rounds of          freezethaw followed by a  min incubation on ice The          cell debris was then removed by centrifugation and the          soluble protein fraction was frozen in liquid nitrogen          and stored at C Nuclear extracts were prepared by          first lysing the cells for  minutes in  ml of isotonic          buffer  mM KCl  mM TrisHCl pH   NP           mM EDTA and  mM MgCl The nuclei were then recovered          by centrifugation at  rpm for  minutes and the          supernatant containing the cytoplasmic proteins was          discarded Nuclear protein was then extracted from the          purified nuclei with buffer A containing  M KCl          Protein concentrations were determined by the method of          Bradford using a Biorad protein assay kit Equal amounts          of protein normally  g unless otherwise stated were          then subjected to SDS PAGE and immunoblotting TBP was          detected using monoclonal antibodies G and C                 TAF           II  was detected using monoclonal          antibody TA   which recognizes an epitope in the          conserved Cterminal domain and monoclonal antibody TA          raised against peptide P in the Nterminal region as          described in   TAF           II  TAF           II  TAF           II  and TAF           II  were detected using the          previously described monoclonal antibodies              and refs therein RAR was detected using the          previously described antibody   Antiflag monoclonal          antibody was puchased from Sigma Blots were revealed          using peroxidase conjugated goat antimouse IgG antibody          and chemiluminescence with an ECL kit Amersham          Protease inhibitors MG Cbzleuleuleucinal and ALLN          acetylleuleunorleucinal were purchased from          CalBiochem and ICN Biochemicals respectively Each was          resuspended in DMSO and added to cells or extracts at a          final concentration of  M                          RTPCR and flow cytometry          Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent          Life Technologies from F cells grown in parallel with          those used for making protein extracts  g of total RNA          was then analysed by RTPCR performed as described            Control reactions not shown contained all components          except reverse transcriptase Details of the          exonspecific primers for HPRT TBP and TAF           II  are available upon request          The primers used for RAR laminin B and collagen IVa          were as previously described   Southern blotting and          hybridisation for RAR were performed by standard          procedures Flow cytometry was performed as described by          Metzger et al  using a final concentration of           gml of propidium iodide and FITClabelled annexin V          CALTAG Laboratories Samples were analysed on a FACScan          Becton Dickinson equipped with a single aron laser A          minimum of  cells per sample were analysed with the          CELLQuest software
