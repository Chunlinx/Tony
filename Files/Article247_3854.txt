                                 The Senate Stays Soft            The Washington Post  New York Times  and Los AngelesTimes lead with yesterdays procedural votes in the Senate thateffectively ended any chance of passing campaign finance reform this yearUSAToday runs the Senate results on Page  leading instead with the FBIsquiet efforts to warn local police about the possibility that antigovernmentmilitias and hate groups will become increasingly dangerous in the coming yearbecause of the apocalyptic significance some of them attribute to the newmillennium            What happened in the Senate the papers report is that in successive votesto force floor consideration of two campaign reform measuresone simply a banof the unregulated campaign use of donations made to the national politicalparties soft money the other a broader bill that also would have tightenedrules about issue ads that actually function in support of particularcandidatesthe pro forces achieved slim majorities but fell short of the votes required to cut off a filibuster against the measures After these votesSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott quickly tried to move on to other businessprompting complaints from the proreform forces led by Sen John McCain thatLott had broken his promise to allow extended floor debate But the WPcites sources saying Lott will prevail this morning            Everybody quotes President Clintons reaction Once again a minority inthe Senate has blocked bipartisan campaign finance reform Clinton called theSenate impasse a victory for the politics of cynicism The LAT claimsthat despite these remarks Clinton has not thrown his full weight behind theissue although the paper provides no evidence of this noting only thatClinton is a prodigious money raiser within the current rules The NYTgoes high with the observation that the outcome keeps the special interestmoney issue alive for next years presidential campaign The LAT andWP emphasize that the campaign reform causes outcome was very similarto what happened last year but only the NYT claims that actually thisis the fourth straight year that campaign reform has died in the Senate            The WP tarnishes McCains reformer star a bit with a companion piecebased on a Common Cause investigation to the Senate vote lead reporting thatearlier this year McCains Commerce committee backed off tough new regulationsprotecting airline passengers in favor of a much weaker bill after airline softmoney flowed into Senate GOP coffers Although McCain denied knowing about therush of money he admits in the story that Big people have access to my officethat ordinary Americans dont have Thats one reason we need reform            The WP  LAT  and NYT front the latest political newsfrom Indonesia And USAT runs it inside But only the WP seems toget the emphasis in the story just right True President BJ Habibie hasapparently decided not to run to remain in office but the bigger news thataffects many people and concerns the UN and the countries currently supplyingpeacekeeping forces in East Timor is that Indonesias legislature has formallyrelinquished the nations claim to the region The WP makes this the bigprint headline The NYT relegates it to smaller type beneath a headerabout Habibie And the LAT and USAT headlines are all aboutHabibie and dont mention East Timor at all            The LAT slugs a story about corruption in Russia thusly GREASY PALMSARE RAMPANT IN RUSSIA Even if there were a widespread corruption scandal inLos Angeles say would the paper ever use GREASY PALMS ARE RAMPANT IN LA Ofcourse not            The WP  NYT  and LAT front Tuesdays federalindictment of McDonnell Douglas now part of Boeing and a Chinese airline itdid business with on charges of diverting hightech manufacturing tools toChinas military The NYT is alone in emphasizing that the case couldcomplicate the current effort by the governments of China and the US tocomplete a trade agreement that would bring China into the World TradeOrganization            Both the WP and NYT go inside about a studybased on redacted US government documentsbeingpublished today in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that is themost elaborate accounting yet of the secret deployment by the US during theCold War of nuclear weapons in foreign countries many of which have policiesstrictly banning a nuclear presence The only real remaining mystery say thestudys authors Whats the blackedout country alphabetically between Canadaand Cuba that had US nukes foisted on it between  and             Both the Wall
