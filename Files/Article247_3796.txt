                                 LA Too Much for the Man                        Hello Richard            As always it is a treat to read your cogent insights I agree with you thatthe big story here involves the changes in capitalism and especially in thenature of work Unfortunately I think it would have been a much stronger bookif the author saw it that way             First I have an urgent message for Susan Faludi Get out of Los Angeles assoon as possible There is a real world out here with real people in it Ifpossible bring Sylvester before his spirit is crushed forever beneath theweight of all those muscles Were waiting for you            Susan Faludis book has two great strengths First she engages with a bigand profound set of questions that affect all of our lives She does this withgreat earnestness and deep commitment She devoted years of her life to theundertaking How many authors will do that Too few I think Second Faludisinterviews with an unusual selection of men are masterful gems each one cutand shaped by profound empathy vivid observation and keen listening They arerendered in rich romantic prose that pungently conveys the disparate worlds ofher interlocutors I love the way she lets us in on the action through her ownresponses of compassion and bewilderment She is always there never silent aswe feel men and women opening up to her trusting her bonding with her somuch so that months and years later they continue to call and bring her up todate on their lives and their troubles What I cherish about this book andabout Faludi herself is the way she surrendered to the mystery and adventureof this intellectual journey She began with one set of assumptions and allowedthem to transform as she herself was transformed by the men she came to knowHer personal authenticity was the backdrop against which these men were able toturn their experiences into words with an anguished and heartbreakingtransparency Without being mawkish I think one can say that Susan Faludireached beyond her role as a feminist or even as a writer She reached towardher own individual humanity and through that medium reached a deeper truth withthose men she sought to understand Between her introduction and herconclusion each of the empirical chapterson the shipbuilders the Citadelcadets the gangstas the Spur Posse the Vietnam vets the Promise Keepersthe football fans the militiamen the porno film stars the fashion tyrantsand their slaves and Sylvester Stallonecan stand alone as testimony to arich and unique lifeworld            The question inevitably arises though What does it all mean Here Ibelieve Susan Faludi gets it mostly wrong There are two critical intellectualerrors that form the very foundation of her undertaking one substantive theother methodological I was hopeful when I read on Page  her complaint thatpopular accounts of the male crisis and male confusions are almostunrelievedly ahistorical but I was crestfallen some pages later when sheidentifies some of the deep historical structures that might have allowed herto unravel her data and then dismisses them as irrelevant                           Im not speaking simply of the economic shift from industry to service nor about a shift from a society organized around industry to one set up aroundelectronic technology And Im not speaking simply about the irony of mensupporting a massive militaryindustrial effort to produce machines  thatultimately would replace them  Those changes were only surface symptoms                         There is no way to talk about these historic shifts simply And this isthe first time I have heard these monumental issues in the evolution ofmaterial life referred to as surface symptoms Whoa If thats the surfacethen we must be talking about something very deep indeed that is the cause ofall this angst But what is it Well by Page  we arrive at Faludisdefinition of the heart of this particular darkness The deep pain experiencedby the men she meets is explained by this confession and complaint My fathernever taught me how to be a man So here we are once again on a canvas ofahistorical pop psychology where the silence of the fathers and their devotionto commercial culture has crippled the sons leaving them no source of meaningother than Were they sexy Were they known Had they won            If there is a crisis of masculinity then it truly can only be understoodthrough history We are now completing at least in the West the last feudalcentury For the first time in any society a majority of its people areeducated and informed For the first time in any society a majority of itspeople use their brains and not their backs to accomplish its work The bondsof hierarchy and patriarchy are not dissolved but faded and weakened as neverbefore The fixed productive and reproductive roles of men and women oncedetermined by anatomy are now giving way to an exhilarating and terrifyingplethora of choices The concept of work has been forever transformed and theboundaries of class have followed suit These are the deep structures that arein motion These are the sources of the ruptures with the past we all face            If there is a crisis then rejoice The old sources of meaning that kept useach in our place are dead or dying Susan Faludis men are being crushed asthe tectonic plates of history roil and split and mow them down They complainand whine and wail for a world that is vanishing OK It hurts But this istheir opportunity to not just be hemen but human beings If they cant beuseful by protecting their women and making thingsthen its time to embracethe usefulness of supporting their women learning new skills committing totheir families and finding new ways to teach their children and contribute totheir communities The old world had women in a box and men in a harness Noone was allowed to venture outside their roles If the fathers were silent itsbecause thats how they thought the script was written Dont pine for thatGet on with the challenge of forging a new life and writing your own betterscript            Finally the methodological fallacy at the heart of this book If you wantto see whats happening in the stream called our society says one of Faludispatriots go to the edges and look at whats happening there  Thisalleged societal dynamic becomes her methodological justification for usingthe stories of the underemployed contractedout and laidoff men of SouthernCalifornia to illuminate more general male losses  It must be said thatthis kind of approach is very tricky If you are going to pick a few cases toillustrate the larger whole then you have to have some pretty compelling andwellarticulated reasoning for their selection I am surprised Richard thatyou find Faludis characterizations of the male crisis to fit the Britishprofile I think that what she has unearthed in grisly detail is the uniquelyshallow instrumental and crass culture of Los Angeles which I once hearddescribed as high school with money where looks fame and income composethe ranking rules for a truly wacky hierarchy Lamentably she has lost sightof just how weird and out of the mainstream that culture is It is not ourculture It is not our society It is not the grain of sand in which the realworld that most of us live in is etched The gangsters the militiamen theporn actors the overthetop football fanstheyre all fascinating but Idont think that any of them says very much about most of us But then I livein Maine where ornamental culture has made little impression except possiblythrough a widespread interest in the LL Bean catalogue            Once again a plea to Susan and Sylvester Move to Maine Its not too lateWell love you here even if you have a paunch or imperfect thighs            More laterShoshana Zuboff
