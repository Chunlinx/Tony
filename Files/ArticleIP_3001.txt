                                 Cold War Follies            In October  after theSoviet Union stationed nuclear missiles in Fidel Castros Cuba President JohnF Kennedy called upon Dean Acheson for advice With typical selfassurancethe grand old man of the Cold War bellowed his recommendation at a meeting ofthe socalled ExComm of top Kennedy aides a swift US airstrike to take outthe nukes When asked what the result would be Acheson replied that Moscowwould then destroy a cache of NATO nuclear missiles in Turkey Then what hewas asked Under our NATO obligations Acheson said Washington would have toattack a nuclear base within the Soviet Union itself And then Acheson pausedThats when we hope the magisterial wise man said that cooler heads willprevail and theyll stop and talk            Mercifully the end of the Cold War has brought an end to this type ofhairraising exchange But those readers looking to remember the bad old dayscan find this sort of thing and plenty of it in Aleksandr Fursenko andTimothy Naftalis important new book on the Cuban missile crisis One Hellof a Gamble  It would be nice to report that their account packsthe pleasure and thrills of a spy novel but thats not exactly the case Spynovels induce a frisson of tension thats enjoyable because the readerknows nothing is really at stake But Fursenko and Naftalis book while itwill leave readers knuckles white is no fun at all to read because theevents it describes are so frightening            Their impressive account is one of the best of a flood ofnew books about the Cold War triggered by the end of the superpowers longstruggle These have ranged from the triumphalist such as Jay Winiks Onthe Brink  a hagiographic account of the Reaganera officials he sees asthe Cold Wars victors to the tendentious say Peter Schweizers simplisticVictory  giving all the credit again to Reagan to the thoughtfulsuch as We Now Know  by the dean of Cold War historians John LewisGaddis One Hell of a Gamble belongs in the last category Fursenkoand Naftali resist the urge to gloat or sermonize and instead let theirresearch speak for them It has quite a bit to say little of it soothingFursenko a leading Russian historian and member of the Russian Academy ofSciences and Naftali a fellow in internationalsecurity studies at Yale addmuch to what we know about the coldest days of the Cold War from carefuldigging in newly opened Soviet archives            Inparticular the popular image of the missile crisis as a triumph for JFKsdiplomacy gets badly dented Kennedy began his term hoping to establish a newdetente with Moscow but he also sought to rid the Western Hemisphere ofcommunism by ousting Castro These goals soon proved incompatible In his campaign Kennedy talked up a fictional missile gap in order to show up the GOPas flaccid on communism During the Eisenhower administration Castro had begunmoving deeper into the Soviet orbit out of fear of a US invasion Kennedysfailed Bay of Pigs invasion in  aggravated Castros anxieties and gave hima rallying cry for a proSoviet tilt Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev fearingthe loss of his model for a new path of socialist development got mischievousWhy not throw a hedgehog at Uncle Sams pants he asked and decided to movemissiles into Cuba The gambit would at a stroke deter Kennedy from invadingCuba cement Moscows alliance with Havana and shift the world strategicbalance Washington would learn to live with the missiles Khrushchev figuredjust as Moscow lived with NATOs nuclear missiles on its Turkish frontier            But Kennedy had no intention of doing soInstead of Achesons airstrike the ExComm chose to blockade Cuba withwarships After several harrowing days Khrushchev blinked and agreed to removethe missiles in return for an American pledge not to invade Cuba and a secretpact to remove the Turkish missiles The superpowers subsequently entered abrief era of eased tensions installing the famous KremlinWhite House hot lineand signing a nuclear test ban treaty  One Hell of a Gamble writes Arthur Schlesinger Jr Camelots court historian shows an Americanpresident doggedly bent on the avoidance of nuclear war Actually it showsthat mixed politics send mixed signals True the planet was not destroyed forwhich we should be grateful but Kennedys maladroit foreign policy helpedcreate the conditions for the crisis The world was brought to the verge ofnuclear catastrophe because of a missile gap that did not exist Turkishmissiles that were not supposed to be there and an invasion that was notcoming            Khrushchev doesnt come off looking any better Fursenko and Naftali offer awealth of new details about Soviet and Cuban motives including the mostcomprehensive picture yet of Havanas slow entry into the Soviet orbit We alsoget a better look at the roots of Khrushchevs decision to back down In theX article the landmark  essay that spelled out the fundamentals ofAmericas Cold War strategy George Kennan argued that the Kremlin has nocompunction about retreating in the face of superior force And being under thecompulsion of no timetable it does not get panicky under the necessity forsuch retreat  If it finds unassailable barriers in its path it acceptsthese philosophically and accommodates itself to them Sure enough confrontedwith such a barrier in  Khrushchev decided to give way He retreated asphilosophically as he could although he described his reaction to the setbackin rather less elegant language There was no need for the Kremlin he said toact like the czarist officer who farted at the ball and then shothimself            Fursenko and Naftalis book is full of this type ofgripping new detail including the books biggest scariest revelation TheKremlin we learn had decided to use tactical battlefield nuclear weaponsagainst US troops if Kennedy invaded Cuba Had Kennedy not opted for theblockade its clear that the first combat use of nuclear weapons sinceNagasaki could have prompted a terrifying cycle of escalation The Cubanmissile crisis it seems may have been even worse than we had thought            Facing a more complex worldsome diplomats and conservative scholars seem to long nostalgically for the eraof Mutual Assured Destruction One Hell of a Gamble comes as a welcomecorrective Bad as todays global uncertainties may seem the Cold War systemalways had an even more dangerous potential for getting out of control Evenafter the superpowers  showdown led to an easing of tensions the planetstill had a series of nuclear scares such as the October  nuclearalertwhich happened on the detenteminded watch of Henry Kissinger andRichard Nixon The inherent problem with Cold War brinkmanship as the Harvardtheorist Thomas C Schelling has noted is that it could elicit concessionsonly if ones opponent didnt know exactly where the brink was One Hell ofa Gamble reminds us just how terrifying that game could be Any foolcould start a war Khrushchev used to like to say In  KhrushchevCastro and Kennedy almost did
