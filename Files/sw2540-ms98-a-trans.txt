          well Stephanie whats your position on gun control   well on a scale of one to ten uh being ten no kind of legislation and zero being uh total ban i probably would lean more towards six or seven um i feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals   umhum   um i lived in Massachusetts for two years and they have a total ban on guns and i saw that it didnt stop crime in that state   now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles   any any kind of firearms   really   yeah uh its theres was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught um with a firearm and also i think there was a fine   and that didnt help at all   no i dont the the crime is not any better or any worse i mean its   huh   i i shouldnt say i dont know if it was any worse but it certainly didnt get any better   umhum i usually just im trying to think of i guess i would tend myself to be more towards the the like three   uhhuh   where i dont think you should should necessarily ban guns any by any means but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature uh you know you shouldnt be able to go out there and just buy one and you know right off the shelf   yeah i i i agree with that i i think that the law the law is on who can buy a gun are are way too lax i think that i think that the   and but uhhuh exactly and so i think that kind of control is would be good   yeah   but the uh i you know im trying to think of how many times you you make the statement and and just to kind of exam it a little bit and i i know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true uh only the guns were in the hands of the criminals but how many times i guess i have never heard of a a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person whos being robbed had a gun   um i   and maybe they just dont report those or im not sure or you know i cant think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed but good thing they had their gun on them and they they thwarted the robbery attempt   yeah i im im not really sure i dont personally i dont own a gun um and i dont think i probably ever would   umhum   um although i would like to know how to handle one and i think its good that everybody and i think everybody should learn how to handle one   umhum   um you just never know when you might come into contact with one   true   um   did did you were you brought up in a family that hunted or   no no uh nobody in my family hunted uh my father had had guns when i was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in Massachusetts       we lived in New Hampshire at the time   how about that   and he moved to Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns so we ended up uh with these guns and my really my only experience experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right   huh umhum   and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere   oh jeez   and so that was really the only experience that ive had with guns and it it kind of scared me   right umhum   but i think that if i learn how to use one i would i would feel better   right ive also always thought about the idea you know most sports you know which are the N R A and people have their thing you know if you ban guns youre just banning the the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature most of thats done with rifles and such uh though theres you know probably im sure some sector that does it with handguns but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous you couldnt be inconspicuous when you walked into a store stuff like that you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately   yeah   you know  if they had to have a rifle or was you know made it more difficult to get a a uh a handgun now of course you know in this world anytime youve freedom you can be able to get anything you want   yeah thats true   but i guess to make it more difficult for the person whos just so irate and upset and you know temporarily a little bit uh offset or off keel i dont know if thats a large percentage percentage of uh crime or not but i guess it would be some but i i think definitely like today they just introduced the whats called the Brady bill the seven day mandatory waiting period on getting any guns and i think that   umhum i would definitely support that   shoot thats a good idea   yeah i i i agree i the thing that scares me uh though about where i would i would want definitely want some sort of legislation and coming from the north east im just not used to seeing um these and i i know this may sound kind of stereo typical but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks   oh sure   thats kind of scary to me that kind of to me it is more like  vigilantism   uhhuh   you know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in L A on the freeways and then you come here in in the Dallas area um   right yeah thats crazy     i dont i dont believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles   yeah thats kind of kind of wild   um especially not in the back window   uhhuh   for everybody to see   that is kind of wild well thats all very interesting   well thanks for talking   sure youre welcome okay byebye      goodbye
