                                 Tame at Heart            Why do bigstudio movies that celebrate wildnessand primal man and equate civilization with corruption tend to play as if theirplots have been hammered out by Hollywood executives on car phones And why dothose pictures always feel as if theyve been honed with the help of focusgroups in suburban shopping malls to ensure that no aspect will be jarring tothe middlest of middleclass viewers Instinct is the newest specimen ofcommercially overprocessed primitivism The film which purports to explore thecircumstances under which a celebrated anthropologist Ethan Powell AnthonyHopkins disappeared among Rwandan gorillas and emerged two years later as amute and wildeyed killer of park rangers is loaded with radical credosideasevocative of Kafka deep ecology and Dian Fossey at her most gorillaphilicBut every one of those conceits is rendered toothless by a form of storytellingthats the opposite of instinctual The more subversive Instinct gets inproclaiming free will an illusion fostered by a rigidly repressive society themore captive it seems to a rigidly repressive studio marketing department                           Instinct isinspired by Daniel Quinns  cult novel Ishmael  which is largely aSocratic telepathic dialogue between a man and a gorilla the latter of whomhectors the former about the destructive path of modern society and restatesthe history of the world as a struggle between leavers animals wise nomadictribes and takers mostly white males Someone must have spent a fortune tooption Quinns book before concluding that an interspecies Socratic telepathicdialogue with huge chunks of the Earth First manifesto wouldnt burn up thebox office so screenwriter Gerald DiPego was brought in to fashion a storyaround Quinns core principles The movie would have been more fun though ifDiPego had left in a token telepathic ape Maybe just for a prologue Gimmethat banana and Ill tell you the story of my old friend Ethan Powell What acharacter             Anyway Instinct is built around that theaterstandby the series of charged encounters between a psychiatrist and a shackledpatient during which it dawns on the doctor Cuba Gooding Jr that he and hissociety are the ones who are actually in need of curing Come to think of itthe first Broadway play I ever saw Equus  featured Hopkins in the roleof the shrink who concludes that a boy who blinded eight horses with a metalspike has a passion sadly lacking in his sterile countrymen The ambitiousGoodings first challenge is to get Hopkins sedated and under heavy guard atFloridas Harmony Bay Correctional Facility to speak It seems to me that hisnext challenge is to get Hopkins to shut up since with relatively littleprodding the exmute wild man launches into a stream of resonant orations aboutlife among the silverbacks Did they think of me I thought of them  Itwas terrifying and wonderful  I was coming back to something I had lost along time ago and was only now remembering Danny Elfman puts a swelling choiron the soundtrack to help us remember those same thingsie awestruckcountercultural jungle movies such as The Emerald Forest  andGreystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes                            Instinct recycles a lot of counterculturaltouchstonesthe lovable psychotics out of One Flew Over the CuckoosNest  the fascist guards out of Cool Hand Luke  Helives with the animals takes on their behavior becomes one of them saysGooding seemingly on the verge of a chorus from Doctor Dolittle He can give me a look at man at his primitive stateungoverned man Its agiggle but the idea of a young AfricanAmerican learning the secrets of theDark Continent from a plusyearold Welsh ham has its daft charm Hesleading me into the jungle concludes Gooding Maura Tierney playing Hopkinsestranged daughter listens to Gooding talk and struggles to keep her emotionsin check smoking intensely while her eyes water and her chin quivers Will sheand Gooding do the Wild Thing No perhaps the mall focus groups turned thumbsdown on interracial romance Back in the prison Hopkins puts Gooding in aheadlock and gives him an intellectual noogie What has he lost now that hehas been immobilized by a senior citizen Control No No one has controlFreedom No No one is free The answer is supposed to be his illusionsbutmore likely its whatever remains of Goodings credibility as an actor            If nothing else thedirector John Turteltaub  Phenomenon   keeps the performers fromdrifting into camp A rawskinned actor named John Aylward does a good job ofmaking the wardena malignly neglectful bureaucratrecognizably human andJohn Ashton plays the chief villain a guard called Dacks as a man whosecruelty arises out of an obsession with control What makes him scary is hiswatchfulness But Turteltaubs technique is otherwise too slick for hissupposedly primal subject The larger problem is that Instinct doesnthave the courage to leave its natural subjects untamed The gorillas arepussycats and Powell isnt a true murderer after all He killed a couple ofRwandan park rangers in defense of his adorable ape familywhich makes themovie a de facto vigilante picture and thus as mainstream a product as any thatHollywood churns out You taught me to live outside the game says Goodinghis eyes misting up But Instinct is the work of players            For true instinct you must turn to Mike Figgis an Englishdirector  Leaving Las Vegas   One Night Stand   whosdefiantly not a player and whose pixilated semiautobiographicalsemiallegorical The Loss of Sexual Innocence would not have got pastthe mall focus groups that evidently embraced Instinct  It nearly didntget past the screening that I caught at Manhattans indiefriendly AngelikaFilm Center which was marked by uneasy throat clearing and lots of walkoutsWhat the hell is this thing            In the movie Adam andEve show up at intervals looking like Calvin Klein models He Femi Ogumbanjois black and muscular she Hanne Klintoe is waiflike and flaxenhaired withan expensivelooking coif They emerge naked from golden waters into ayellowish African landscape explore each others orifices and recline besidea white stallion and in range of a disappointingly ordinary snake At theend they eat squishy fruit vomit and are set upon by paparazzi             Before that seminal episodes of disillusionment jealousyand betrayal are recalled by the movies protagonist Nic Julian Sands As alad in Kenya he peers through a window at an African girl practicing herEnglish in lingerie for a drowsing old white pervert Cut to an Englishlandscape from which all color has been drained and where Nic is a skinnyteenager Jonathan RhysMeyers whose pubescent girlfriend drunkenly cheats onhim during her fathers wake Sex and death are forever entwined Nic seesphotos of a naked woman stabbed by a lover a corpse bloated after three weeksin a river As a grownup he drives through the northern English countrysidebeside a frostily pissedoff blond wife whom he subsequently takes from behindin the kitchen of their country cottage while his young son clutching astuffed animal wanders their way Figgis shoots all this through windows tomake the couples alienation palpable            Nics wife dreams of coming upon Nic in a jazzcombo then dancing halfnaked for old people Nic dreams of being dogged at atrain station by a gangly cretin who then stabs him As the pavement rises upto meet his falling body he sees himself and his wife walk into

airport but fate keeps them fromconnecting The Italian twin drives Nicwho turns out to be a documentary filmdirectorto the desert of Tunisia where there is further betrayal loss ofsexual innocence exploitation of Third World peoples and a tragicretaliation The soundtrack is melancholy classical piano            That The Loss of Sexual Innocence doesnt gelis a point too obvious to belabor Much of it is risible yet I loved watchingitnot because I thought that the emperor was wearing new clothes but becauseI thought he looked finebeautiful actuallynaked Figgis camera is probingand alive so that even when his meanings are laughable his images remainallusive and mysterious What can I say The man gives good movie
