Morning Post of Hong Kong reported from Beijing thatthe trip has left friends of the US feeling sore and has caused frictionin Chinas diplomatic relations It quoted an East European diplomat as sayingthat Russian President Boris Yeltsin was unhappy with the reception Chinaaccorded Mr Clinton believing it was bigger than the welcome Mr Yeltsinreceived when he visited in  European Union diplomats similarly wereput out by the fact that the US Embassy refused to brief them on the visitwhile the president was in Beijing and chose instead to send a standard pressrelease to Britain in its then capacity as president of the EU The decisionmeant that the only official account of the visit to be transmitted fromBeijing to European capitals was based on talks with Chinese officials            A Japan Times editorialsaid the United States has rightly elevated China to a far more central placein its foreign policy than it occupied in the past given that China ispoised to become a  st century superpower and is already playing amajor role in stabilizing Asia economically But it rejected the idea that theUnited States might be planning to substitute China for Japan as its key Asianally China remains an oppressive communist dictatorship it said and thisstands in the way of a genuine partnership in any field besides trade andbusiness            An editorial in the MondayTimes of India saidthat the main conclusion to be drawn from Clintons trip to China is that thelimits of US power have already been reached Its all downhill from hereThough the size of the presidents entourage made his trip seem like theimperial journey of a mediaeval potentate his body language was that of atravelling salesman it said There is no sense in relying on the US            Theemotion aroused by the closure of Hong Kongs Kai Tak airport Sunday night tobe replaced by the modernistic marvel of the huge new airport of Chek LapKok came close to rivalling the events of a year ago when the formerBritish colony was restored to China according to the SCMP  Referringto the old airports hairraising rooftopscraping approach and itsenvironmental deficiencies the newspaper said that the sheer audacity andimprobability of the place so perfectly captured the spirit of the city thatHong Kong will seem lost without it            The liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz stronglycriticized the United States Monday for its failure to get tough with IsraeliPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Washingtons unwillingness to demand thatIsrael uphold the commitments it undertook in the Oslo and Hebron accords isnow threatening to undermine the most vital system of checks and balances inthe diplomatic arena The initiative of Israels most important ally couldbe superseded by interArab or ArabEuropean initiatives that will be fartougher it said adding that it will now be almost impossible torehabilitate the ruins of the trust the Palestinian and Israeli public oncehad in the peace process            Theconservative JerusalemPost led its front page with the warning by Egyptian President HosniMubarak following his Cairo summit with King Hussein of Jordan and Palestinianleader Yasser Arafat that the negotiations deadlock and Israels plan toexpand Jerusalem could ignite violence that might prove unstoppable In aneditorial itput the blame for the present impasse in the negotiations firmly on Arafatwho it said makes Netanyahus delaying skills seem almost amateurDemanding urgent fulfillment of Arafats yearold promise to amend the PLOCovenant to erase calls for Israels destruction the Post also calledfor an end to the long boycott by Arafat of direct negotiations withNetanyahu            Pakistans Dawn urged Washington to support an Arabsponsored move at the UnitedNations to condemn Israel for its blatant attempts at judaizing the Al Qudsarea of Jerusalem If the United States were to veto the resolution as it isreportedly proposing to do it would detract from its credentials as theprincipal promoter and protector of the Middle East peace process it saidFor once President Clinton should put all diplomatic niceties aside and makeit plain to Mr Netanyahu that his obduracy must come to an end For him thereis simply no option but to return to the path of peace and stability in theMiddle East            The front pages of mostEuropean newspapers were dominated Monday with the standoff in Northern Irelandbetween the Protestant Orange Order and the British government which usedpolice and troops to prevent Orangemen from marching through a Roman Catholicquarter of Drumcree Sunday The Daily Telegraph reported that David Trimble the UlsterUnionist Party leader and first minister in the new Ulster assembly hadthreatened to resign if the march wasnt allowed through The Irish News of Belfast calledfor an improbable compromise by which the Catholic residents of DrumcreesGarvaghy Road would lift their objections to the parade going down it whilethe Orange Order would voluntarily decide to return home by another route            The main French newspapersfocused on the enforced Arabization of Algeria where on Sunday classicalArabic became the sole official language of the country with the use ofAlgerian Arabic Berber Arabic and French being prohibited Libration said in an editorial that the only people who would rejoice over this arethose struggling with arms and terrorism to transform Algeria into an Islamicstate            Le Monde also reported on itsfront page that in France marriages within the military are calmer and morestable than civilian ones
