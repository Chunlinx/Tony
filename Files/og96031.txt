concludes that the year industry costs areestimated to be  to  million and the year cost to thegovernment to be  million The analysis considers data foraverage wages the cost of specific processing equipment and thecost of conducting specific laboratory analysesThe potential health benefits resulting from the elimination ofthe four pathogens is estimated to be  to  billion over years The range of benefits occurs because of the currentuncertainty in the estimates of the number of cases of foodborneillness and death attributable to the pathogens that enter the meatand poultry supply at the
