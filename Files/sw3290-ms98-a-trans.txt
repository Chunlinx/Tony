        uh the the only work i do outside the home is i am an Avon representative     oh okay   and i sell Stanley products   uhhuh   and uh so i i dont really i dont really dress up a whole lot do you work outside   she can well i i work um im a CPA and i do contract work   oh uhhuh   and so and i work with another CPA who just started his own practice and i work with him a couple days a week and so when i go to his office or to other clients offices then ill dress up   oh uhhuh umhum   but otherwise its great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever so that that makes it pretty nice it   umhum umhum umhum umhum   its kind of weird because before i used to work you know full time and and uh it seemed like i was wearing a suit every day just about   well youd have to dress differently when youre working every day i think yeah   right right and so its uh some of my suits i havent put on for quite a while  so it   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh its kind of a nice to relax a little bit yeah   its its very nice i   yeah well my my dress up i live out in the country also so what i wear depends on the weather   uhhuh sure   uh so i really i know a lot of the Avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up but i mostly dress   uhhuh   i try to dress nice but for convenience because when the weathers bad when i go into the home i take off my shoes   uhhuh   which i try to wear something easy to take off you know and put on and i dont too often take off my coat even so   right   uh i really dont have to dress up like you you would like if youre in an office or something   yeah yeah well i imagine that where you live uh youre in warm clothing quite a bit of the year   uh well not actually because we really only have maybe three four months of id say warm weather   not really oh is that right   yeah and the rest is uh gets into the cooler weather   umhum   uhhuh course they keep saying the weathers gonna change or were gonna have more Florida type weather up here so i dont know but for now   uhhuh so yall are waiting for that   umhum but even for now we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and uh cold weather and that type of thing now my daughter works all the time so she dresses   uhhuh yeah   it i think you know you have to spend more money on your clothing and that because you do have to have the appearance a good appearance to do a good job   right right   where you work   yeah well down here its sunny most of the time and uh   umhum   usually warm i mean weve had a few cool days uh this month but not anything im sure compared to what youve had so far so i mean people are still wearing shorts and   um umhum umhum   and uh usually around Halloween it starts getting cooler so you start you know breaking out a coat   umhum umhum right yeah   at that time but that that lasts you know for a few months   did you find you wore uh slacks when you were working full time or did you did did they wear more dresses and skirts   no no never wore slacks it was   no slacks   i think it was one of those things where its not like someone came out and said you cant wear them it was one of those understood things that you just you know either wore you know a dress or   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh not even a dressy slack a dressy suit slack suit even if its all   not no not not with what i did um most people didnt sometimes like the secretaries might   uhhuh uhhuh umhum   but even then you didnt see them wearing slacks too much and i really you know theres some nice pantsuits out and and i wouldnt have minded minded you know wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold   umhum umhum hm umhum umhum i know my daughter mostly i dont think she ever wears slacks slacks to work but i didnt know if the trend changes you know if uh   but um uhhuh you know i think its one of those things where its not viewed upon as being professional i guess they expect women to be in skirts  or dresses   uhhuh uhhuh look more like a woman huh  uhhuh uhhuh   yeah  thats right  and its the men that make the rules   uh well then you you you know why they make them then  that way     but no we usually you know skirt and skirt and blouse or suit or dress is is what you see down here so its nice with me working at home because i can wear pants   umhum umhum yeah   no one no one can see me unless im you know gonna   yeah but yet you need to keep up an appearance for your husband too though at home but thats i i believe   yeah yeah but im not gonna put a skirt on just for him   oh you dont think you will huh  well youll be excused because considering everything  huh uhhuh   yeah i think that the main issue at home is being comfortable in your clothing   yeah but i i look at homemaking as a job also uh being a homemaker and i i think sometimes we lose sight of that   right yeah   uh by the fact that we dont sometimes watch our dress
