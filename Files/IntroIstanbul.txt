                      The City and ITS People        Istanbul is one of the worlds most venerable cities Part        of the citys allure is its setting where Europe faces Asia across        the winding turquoise waters of the Bosphorus making it the only city        in the world to bridge two continents        Here where the waters of the Black Sea blend into the        Aegean East and West mingle and merge in the cultural meltingpot of        Turkeys largest metropolis Busy Oriental bazaars coexist with        European shops kebabshops and coffeehouses sit alongside        international restaurants modern office buildings and hotels alternate        with Ottoman minarets along the citys skyline traditional music and        Western pop bellydancing and ballet Turkish wrestling and football        all compete for the attention of the Istanbullu audience        This is the only city in the world to have been the capital        of both an Islamic and a Christian empire As Constantinople jewel of        the Byzantine Empire it was for more than  years the most        important city in Christendom As Istanbul it was the seat of the        Ottoman sultans rulers of a year Islamic empire that stretched        from the Black Sea and the Balkans to Arabia and Algeria        Istanbul owes its longheld historical significance to a        strategic location at the mouth of the Bosphorus From this vantage        point the city could control not only the ships that passed through the        strait on the important trade route between the Black Sea and the        Mediterranean but also the overland traffic travelling from Europe        into Asia Minor which used the narrow strait as a crossing point In        the words of the thcentury French traveller Pierre Gilles The        Bosphorus with one key opens and closes two worlds two seas         That strategic advantage is no less important today than it        was  years ago when a band of Greeks first founded the city of        Byzantium on this very spot Ankara may be the official capital of        modern Turkey but Istanbul remains the countrys largest city most        important commercial centre and busiest port producing more than        onethird of Turkeys manufacturing output The Bosphorus is one        of the worlds most active shipping lanes and the overland traffic is        now carried by two of the worlds longest suspension bridges        The thriving city has long since spread beyond the        fifthcentury Byzantine walls built by the Emperor Theodosius II and        now sprawls for miles along the shores of the Sea of Marmara on both        the European and Asian sides Back in  this was the worlds largest        city with a population of  million That figure has now passed         million and is still growing swollen by a steady influx of people from        rural areas looking for work more than half the population was born in        the provinces These new arrivals have created a series of        shantytowns around the perimeter of the city Their makeshift homes        known in Turkish as gecekondu built by night take advantage of an        old Ottoman law that protects a house whose roof has been built during        the hours of darkness The slums are eventually knocked down to make        way for new towerblocksa new suburb is created yet another        shantytown springs up beyond it and Istanbul spreads out a little        farther        At the other end of the social spectrum are the wealthy        Istanbullus who live in the upmarket districts of Taksim Harbiye and        Nianta where the streets are lined with fashion boutiques        expensive apartments and stylish cafs Those belonging to this set        are the lucky few who frequent the citys more expensive restaurants        and casinos and retire at the weekends to their restored wooden        mansions yal along the Bosphorus But most of Istanbuls inhabitants        fall between these two extremes living in modest flats and earning an        average wage in the offices shops banks and factories that provide        most of the citys employment        Although small Armenian Greek Orthodox Jewish and        Catholic communities survive the majority of Istanbullus are Muslim        and adhere to the principles known as the Five Pillars of Islamto        believe with all ones heart that There is no God but God and        Mohammed is his Prophet to pray five times a day at dawn midday        afternoon sunset and after dark to give alms to the poor and        towards the upkeep of the mosques to fast between sunrise and sunset        during the month of Ramadan and to try to make the pilgrimage to Mecca        at least once in ones lifetime Those who have made the pilgrimage can        add the respected title haci before their names an honour proudly        displayed on shopowners signs        Just as the Bosphorus separates Asia from Europe so the        inlet called the Golden Horn separates the old Istanbul from the new        The main attractions for the visitor are concentrated in the historic        heart of old Istanbul Three great civilizations have shaped this part        of the cityRoman Byzantine and Ottoman Though little remains from        Roman times the citys Byzantine legacy boasts Haghia Sophia the        Church of the Divine Wisdom and one of the worlds greatest buildings        the magnificent mosaics of St Saviour in Chora and the impressive        Theodosian Walls The Ottomans built countless mosques in their        capital the finest of which is the Sleymaniye inspired by the form        of the Haghia Sophia But the most popular tourist sight is Topkap        Palace the home of the Ottoman sultans where the riches of the        Imperial Treasury and the intrigue of the Harem draw many thousands of        visitors each year        From the belvedere in the treasury of the palace where the        Sultan used to gaze down upon his fleet you can look across the mouth        of the Golden Horn to the modern district of Beyolu where        multistorey hotels rise beyond the turret of the Galata Tower Down by        the shore of the Bosphorus is the glittering faade of the        thcentury Dolmabahe Palace while beyond stretches the graceful        span of the Bosphorus Bridge a concrete symbol of the city linking        Europe with Asia        Byzantium Constantinople Istanbuldown the centuries        the city has been open to influences from both East and West and this        crossfertilization of ideas has created one of the worlds liveliest        most engaging and most hospitable cultures It is neither European nor        Oriental but an unparalleled and intoxicating blend it is quite        simply unique
