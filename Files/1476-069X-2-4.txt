                    Background        Generally the benefits of energy efficiency programs        are expressed in terms of the economic payback that will        accrue for individuals or organizations To introduce        environmental benefits into this framework some        investigators have quantified the emission reductions        related to the decreased use of electricity and fossil fuel             including criteria air pollutants and greenhouse        gases While these analyses are useful they provide only a        limited set of information as issues such as pollutant        fate and transport or pollutant toxicity are omitted        making environmental and economic endpoints        incomparable        Multiple studies have developed models to estimate the        health impacts of emissions from specific sources using a        riskbased approach to link emissions of key pollutants        with dispersion models and health evidence               While this is a valuable approach it can be difficult to        apply in the case of broadbased energy efficiency        programs as these programs tend to affect multiple sources        simultaneously eg numerous homes within a state all        power plants on the grid Quantifying the health benefits        of energy efficiency programs therefore requires a        simplified approach toward risk calculations with adequate        characterization of uncertainty to aid in the        interpretation of the findings        In a recent investigation     we developed a model        to predict the public health benefits of increased        residential insulation in new housing related to the        emission reductions of fine particulate matter PM           and its precursors nitrogen        dioxide and sulfur dioxide We determined that increasing        insulation from current practice to the latest        International Energy Conservation Code IECC  levels        for all singlefamily homes built from  to  would        save  TBTU    British Thermal Units during the        tenyear period  TBTU for the annual housing output per        year Linking this evidence with estimated emission        reductions extrapolated results from dispersion model        outputs and epidemiological evidence we concluded that the        resulting public health benefits would include        approximately  fewer deaths  fewer asthma attacks        and  fewer restricted activity days within this        decade  deaths  asthma attacks and  restricted        activity days reduced per year for all new homes built in                Although this investigation demonstrated that a        riskbased methodology for demandside management programs        is viable and provided a crucial foundation for policy        analysis interpretation was impaired by the relatively        narrow focus For example the new housing market        represents only a small fraction of the potential public        health benefits of insulation in the residential sector        There are approximately  million new singlefamily homes        built each year     but the existing housing stock        consists of more than  million singlefamily homes        Furthermore it would be anticipated that there is greater        per unit potential for energy savings in existing housing        given many homes built prior to the promulgation of energy        codes that therefore contain relatively less insulation        than newer homes        In spite of the anticipated greater energy savings of        the existing versus new housing market the relative public        health benefits will not necessarily be proportional        Because the geographic distribution of housing starts        differs from the distribution of existing homes geographic        patterns of energy savings will differ There are regional        differences in population density and meteorological        patterns both of which will influence the magnitude of        health benefits The fuels used in homes also differ both        regionally and by age of home which will strongly        influence emissions In this paper we apply our risk model        to the existing singlefamily home market in the United        States to evaluate the following questions         What are the magnitude and distribution of public        health benefits associated with hypothetically retrofitting        singlefamily homes with insulation at IECC  levels        when necessary         How does the economic value associated with these        public health benefits compare with the economic savings        for the households         In general how uncertain are public health benefit        estimates derived from simplified models and what are the        major contributors to that uncertainty                    Methods                  Energy Savings          To quantify the energy savings associated with          insulation retrofits in existing singlefamily homes we          use a regressionbased approach to simulate energy          savings in a number of prototype homes in different          cities and apply those findings to the set of homes where          insulation retrofits were deemed plausible The first          step was to determine the number of homes in each state          that likely require increased insulation Using          information from the Residential Energy Consumption          Survey RECS     we estimated the total number of          homes by state in  RECS also provided the percentage          of singlefamily homes by census division yielding an          estimated  million singlefamily homes in the          continental US          We used the qualitative characterization of insulation          levels by age of home within an earlier version of RECS             to determine the proportion of homes where          insulation retrofits were viable Homes that were well          insulated were assumed to not require additional          insulation while homes with adequate or poor insulation          were assumed to require more insulation On average           of singlefamily homes had adequate or poor insulation          Lacking geographically resolved information on this          parameter we assumed that this percentage applied to all          states yielding the number of target singlefamily homes          at a state level and approximately  million homes          nationally It should be noted that an assumption of          geographic uniformity stratified by age of home yielded          essentially identical estimates ranging from  in the          SouthAtlantic to  in New England with census          divisions defined as in Table  so this is unlikely to          contribute to significant uncertainty in the          analysis          To quantify energy consumption under current          conditions and given insulation increased to IECC           levels we applied regression models we developed          originally for our new housing investigation     We          simulated prototype singlefamily homes in a number of          different cities and applied the energy model REMDesign          Architectural Energy Corporation Boulder CO to          estimate energy consumption given home configuration          climate and insulation levels We gathered current          practice insulation levels in ceiling wall and floor          from an earlier energy analysis     which assumed          existing home insulation levels to be uniform within          census divisions Table  IECC  insulation levels             are based on heating degree days rather than          geographic region and are represented in Figure           In addition window types metal versus wood door          thickness and shading factors varied by region Selected          home characteristics as well as heating and cooling          system features were assumed to be uniform nationally          This included unconditioned basements exposed ducts an          infiltration rate of  a heating set point of           degrees C  degrees F and a cooling set point of           degrees C  degrees F Remaining home characteristics          including floor area heating types and number of          stories by region were gathered from RECS              Additional specifications of house or heating and cooling          system characteristics are available from the authors          upon request          To ensure that the regression models represented the          physical realities of heat transfer the functional form          of our regressions and the covariates selected were based          on standard heat loss equations     For example          space heating energy consumption was predicted as a          function of two covariates  the product of heating          degree days and floor area and the product of heating          degree days floor area and an expression reflecting the          amount of insulation in the ceiling walls and floor R            Finally we calibrated the outputs from the          regression models against reported energy consumption          data from RECS to better reflect actual consumption          patterns                          Emission Reductions          Given statelevel energy savings by fuel type we          estimate emissions of primary PM             SO            as a precursor of sulfate          particles and NOx as a precursor of nitrate          particles This choice was based on the findings of past          studies in which PM contributed the vast majority of          benefits      As might be anticipated our          procedure to model emissions differs for direct          residential fuel combustion and electricity We summarize          our approach below and refer the reader to our earlier          analysis    for more detail          For direct residential fuel combustion given the fuel          type natural gas or fuel oil we estimate emissions          from the AP database prepared by US EPA     For          fuel oil emissions of both SO            and PM are given as a function of          the sulfur content in the fuel Although the sulfur          content of fuel oil can vary somewhat on a statebystate          basis lacking detailed information we assumed that a           sulfur content by weight was applicable nationally          as has been done previously              On the other hand for electricity we needed to          determine which power plants would be affected by          marginal decreases in electricity consumption since it          is likely that the marginal plants are not identical to          the average plants in the power pool In our earlier          analysis     we concluded that only noncombined          cycle fossilfuel plants with less than  capacity          factors were likely to be influenced by small demand          changes in the near term as any base load units running          at high capacity or units with supplyrelated constraints          eg nuclear hydroelectric could not respond to these          changes We applied these screening criteria to the          Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database          EGRID    to determine a subset of  power plants          potentially able to respond to demandside management          efforts Without a detailed simulation of the electricity          sector it is impossible to determine precisely which          plants would respond on the margin For our central          estimate we assumed that each plant with positive net          generation was equally likely to be affected regardless          of capacity or relative availability It should be noted          that this assumption resulted in lower emission rates          than a capacity or availabilitybased allocation          potentially biasing our estimates downward The magnitude          of this effect is considered in the Discussion          section          To link this information with electricity savings at          the state level we first quantified emissions of NOx and          SO            per unit output for each power plant          using data from EGRID Since primary PM emissions were          not incorporated into EGRID we estimated PM            emissions using AP emission          factors for PM            given power plant characteristics          and estimates of the PM            PM            emissions ratio We used this          information to determine emission factors by North          American Electricity Reliability Council NERC region          and determined statelevel emission factors based on the          proportion of electricity consumption provided by each          NERC region                              Exposure Reductions          As alluded to above a critical and difficult step          in accurately quantifying the health benefits of          demandside management efforts involves linking emissions          savings to exposure reductions given the substantial          number of sources and limited capacity of fate and          transport models Recently the risk assessment and          atmospheric modeling communities have recognized the          importance of developing approaches to extrapolate          estimates from other studies in situations where input          data are limited or comprehensive models are impractical          Multiple studies have developed and applied a concept          known as an intake fraction generally defined as the          fraction of a pollutant or its precursor emitted that is          eventually inhaled by someone      Mathematically          an intake fraction can be calculated using the following          equation                    where           iF  intake fraction           BR  populationaverage breathing          rate assumed to be  m day           C                       i             incremental concentration of pollutant at receptor                    i gm            N                       i             number of people at receptor           i  Q  emission rate of pollutant          or pollutant precursor gday If the health effect in          question has a linear doseresponse function with no          threshold above current ambient concentrations an intake          fraction provides an estimate directly interpretable from          a health perspective since the health impacts will be          proportional to the sum of the product of population and          concentration          To apply the intake fraction concept in our          investigation we used predictive regression models          developed in a recent study     This study took its          intake fraction estimates from an analysis    that          used CALPUFF a regionalscale Lagrangian puff model to          calculate intake fractions for primary PM             sulfate particles from SO             and nitrate particles from NOx          evaluating  power plants and  mobile sources          distributed across the US In general the intake          fractions were strongly predicted by population variables          eg population within  or  km of a source          stack height for primary PM            from power plants and          miscellaneous meteorological terms including annual          average temperature wind speed relative humidity or          mixing height          To apply these regressions to the power sector we          determined the values of the appropriate covariates for          each marginal power plant identified above resulting in          intake fraction estimates for each of  power plants          To assign a representative intake fraction for          electricity savings in each state we weighted the          plantlevel intake fractions by emissions within NERC          region and averaged across NERC regions in proportion to          electricity transmission patterns For residential          combustion sources we assumed that the mobile source          intake fraction estimates were applicable given          emissions at or near ground level and calculated intake          fractions for each Metropolitan Statistical Area MSA          across the US Statelevel intake fractions were then          estimated as a weighted average of MSAlevel intake          fractions weighting by number of homes          It should be noted that in addition to the          uncertainties associated with the regression model there          are overarching uncertainties associated with the          application of CALPUFF For example although it is well          established that changes in SO            emissions can influence nitrate          particle concentrations by affecting available ammonia          levels     CALPUFF does not capture this phenomenon          for an analysis of a small subset of sources The          importance of this effect and related model uncertainties          are considered in the Discussion section                          Public Health Benefits          As in our past investigation     we quantify          mortality and selected morbidity benefits associated with          incremental reductions in PM            exposures Premature mortality          associated with PM            has typically dominated public          health benefits when health endpoints were placed in          economic terms      but we include some morbidity          endpoints to illustrate outcomes with varying severity          Although excluding the complete array of morbidity          endpoints will result in a systematic underestimation of          benefits we adopt this approach for the sake of brevity          As mentioned above given the framing of our analysis we          determine reasonable central estimates for          concentrationresponse functions and consider the          magnitude of the uncertainty in the Discussion          section          For premature mortality we derive our central          estimate from a followup analysis of the American Cancer          Society cohort study     This investigation followed          approximately  individuals across a year          period evaluating mortality risk from air pollution          while controlling for numerous plausible confounders          including smoking alcohol consumption body mass index          diet and occupational exposures Using pollution data          averaged across the study period the authors report a          relative risk for allcause mortality of  for a           gm increase in PM            concentrations  CI            Alternatively using pollution data from the start          of the study period the corresponding relative risk was            CI   Based on these estimates and          given the desire to provide a parallel estimate with our          earlier investigation to improve comparability     we          apply a concentrationresponse function of a           increase in premature deaths per gm increase in annual          mean PM            concentrations We consider this          value to be a plausible central estimate as it is          bounded above by the concentrationresponse function from          the Harvard Six Cities Study    and below by values          from timeseries studies          As previously     we derive our selected morbidity          concentrationresponse estimates from recent US EPA          benefitcost analyses      This results in an          estimated  increase in daily asthma attacks among          asthmatics only and a  increase in restricted          activity days per gm increase in PM            concentrations          The application of concentrationresponse functions as          described above implicitly assumes that no population          threshold exists at current ambient concentrations in the          US and that all forms of particulate matter have          identical toxicity The former assumption is bolstered by          the lack of documented thresholds in both cohort              and timeseries mortality     investigations          Consideration of the latter issue is beyond the scope of          our analysis other than to state that lacking either          definitive evidence exonerating selected types of fine          particles or quantitative evidence supporting relative          toxicities an assumption of equal toxicity is a          reasonable default for a central estimate                          Economic Implications          Although the economic valuation of health endpoints is          highly uncertain we apply the central estimates used in          the US EPA benefitcost analyses     to illustrate          the potential magnitude of externalities avoided in          relation to the direct economic savings          Based on the findings of a number of labor market and          contingent valuation studies the US EPA determined a          value of statistical life of  million in  US          dollars which can be translated into an approximate          value of  million in  US dollars using Consumer          Price Index inflation rates We apply this value assuming          a fiveyear lag structure for deaths from cohort          mortality evidence     with  of deaths in each of          the first two years and  of deaths in the subsequent          three years          In the benefitcost analysis of the Clean Air Act              an asthma attack is given a central value of  in           dollars based on a willingness to pay study that          focused on avoidance of a bad asthma day To our          knowledge no willingness to pay study has been conducted          on restricted activity days Given values reported in the          benefitcost analysis of the Clean Air Act    of           for a minor restricted activity day which is more mild          than a restricted activity day and  for a workloss          day which is presumably more severe than a restricted          activity day we use  in  dollars as a          reasonable central estimate In the Discussion we focus          on the sensitivity of conclusions to the approach for          valuation of premature mortality          To quantify the incremental cost of insulation we          determined the average Rvalue increase in ceiling          walls and foundations and used this to quantify the          volume of insulation required per home given the square          footage of the homes and the assumption that  inches          of fiberglass corresponds to a unit increment in Rvalue          We quantified the value of insulation in dollars per ton          based on the reported value of shipment from the mineral          wool sector    and the mass of fiberglass production              along with an assumed density of fiberglass of           kginft  Annual economic savings associated with          the energy reductions were based on statelevel unit          prices for electricity natural gas and fuel oil              The real prices of all fuels were assumed to be          constant over time given forecasts of relatively small          price changes in upcoming decades     For all net          present value calculations we apply a  real discount          rate the central estimate used in US EPA benefitcost          analyses                                Results                  Energy Savings          Prior to calibration our predictive regression models          based on REMDesign outputs systematically overpredicted          energy consumption as summarized in RECS We considered          performance stratified by fuel type and combinations of          census divisions where Northeast corresponds to NE and          MA Midwest to ENC and WNC South to SA ESC and WESC          and West corresponds to MTN and PA Table  Natural gas          and fuel oil consumption were within  of reported          values in all regions but the West where the regression          model predicted energy consumption  times higher than          that reported in RECS The bias was somewhat greater for          electricity consumption a factor of  higher          across regions for gas or oilheated homes and a factor          of  higher for electricheated homes As          described in our earlier analysis     REMDesign has          been shown to somewhat overestimate energy consumption          so this performance and the need for a calibration factor          were anticipated We calibrated the model by simply          multiplicatively scaling the regression results to          reported RECS values stratified by region and fuel          type          According to our calibrated energy model increasing          residential insulation in the  million existing homes          where insulation retrofits are necessary would save          approximately  TBTU per year   MMBTU             BTU per household per year Of this total  is          related to source electricity savings with  related          to natural gas and  to fuel oil Approximately  of          the source electricity savings are associated with space          heating rather than cooling Thirtyfive percent of          energy savings occurs in electricheated homes with the          remainder occurring in gas or fuel oilheated homes          either through reduced fossil fuel combustion or reduced          electricity consumption for space cooling          Looking at regional patterns within electricheated          homes nearly  of the energy savings are found in the          South principally due to the number of electricheated          homes in the South relative to other regions Table           On a per unit basis the savings are greatest in the          Midwest and lowest in the West related to climate and          current practice insulation levels For homes heated by          natural gas or fuel oil nearly half of the energy          savings are found in the Midwest given both the number          of households and the higher per unit energy savings          Across all fuel types the annual per unit energy savings          for retrofitting existing homes are approximately four          times greater than the per unit energy savings associated          with increasing insulation from current practice levels          in new homes to IECC  code levels     a finding          that agrees with other analyses              An evaluation at the state level can provide some          insight about differentials in past energy codes as well          as withinregion differences that might be important from          an emissions and exposure perspective Unsurprisingly          the states with the greatest total energy savings          generally correspond to the states with the most          households  Texas New York Michigan Illinois and          Ohio represent  of the national energy savings and           of the total households On a per unit basis the          states with the greatest energy savings are North Dakota          Minnesota West Virginia and South Dakota while the          smallest per unit savings are seen in Arizona New          Mexico Florida and California a clear indication of          the importance of climate                          Emission Reductions          Given these energy savings the aggregate emission          reductions from residential fuel combustion and power          plants include approximately  fewer tons per year of          PM              fewer tons per year of          NOx and  fewer tons per year of SO            Table  For all three pollutants          the majority of emissions are linked to power plants           for PM              for NOx and  for SO             even though only  of energy          savings is related to electricity generation This can be          explained by the predominance of natural gas space          heating which has lower emissions of all pollutants          particularly SO             when compared with electricity          generation from marginal power plants that are often          fueled by coal          When we consider tons of pollutants emitted per unit          energy savings across regions it is clear that there are          substantial regional variations in emissions intensity of          energy consumption Figure  For primary PM             emissions per unit energy          savings are similar across regions for residential fuel          combustion but are somewhat greater in the Midwest and          the South for electricity Similarly for SO             the electricityrelated emissions          are greater in other regions than in the West where a          greater proportion of electricity available on the margin          is generated by natural gas For residential fuel          combustion the emissions intensity for SO            is far lower than that for          electricity with the exception of the Northeast where          fuel oil combustion is more prevalent Finally the          emissions intensity patterns for NOx are broadly          consistent with those for PM             indicating similarities in the          ratios of emission rates associated in part with          combustion temperature and efficiency          The rankings of states both on an aggregate basis and          on a per unit basis differ when energy savings are          translated into emissions reductions First considering          aggregate emission reductions for PM             the highestemitting states are          those larger states with substantial electric space          heating and higheremitting power plants  Texas          Virginia North Carolina and Tennessee The top four          emitting states are identical for NOx with Maryland          having the highest emissions of SO            followed by Virginia North          Carolina and Tennessee On a per unit basis West          Virginia Kentucky Delaware and Virginia have the          highest emissions for PM            and NOx with Delaware West          Virginia Maryland and Kentucky having the highest SO            emissions                          Public Health Benefits          Using our intake fraction estimates and          concentrationresponse functions for mortality and          morbidity the emission reductions of particulate matter          and particle precursors can be translated into health          benefits In total the emission reductions correspond to           fewer deaths  fewer asthma attacks and           fewer restricted activity days per year spread across          the continental US This represents an approximate           decrease in rates of the selected mortality and morbidity          outcomes The distribution of mortality benefits by          pollutant source and region is presented in Table           with identical patterns seen for the morbidity          outcomes          Of the  annual deaths averted more than half are          associated with reduced sulfate exposures due to SO            emission reductions This is largely          due to reduced electricity consumption for space heating          in the South Approximately  of the health benefits          are related to primary PM            emission reductions largely due          to reduced residential fuel combustion in the Northeast          and Midwest and reduced electricity consumption in the          South Nitrate particles due to NOx emissions play a          relatively minor role contributing only  of total          benefits          Because of differences in regional emissions          intensities meteorological conditions influencing          pollutant fate and transport and population patterns          the distribution of health benefits across regions and          states differs significantly from the distribution of          energy savings On a regional basis although the South          provides only  of total energy savings it is          responsible for nearly  of public health benefits In          contrast the West provides  of total energy savings          but only  of public health benefits As shown in Figure           the relative contributions of states to energy savings          versus public health benefits also vary substantially          States that contribute proportionately more to mortality          reductions than to energy savings eg Virginia North          Carolina Tennessee tend to have significant electric          space heating with electricity from power plants that          emit higher amounts of SO                      Looking at the benefits on a per capita basis there          are significant differences across states in both public          health and energy savings Figure  The two figures are          moderately correlated with one another r   with a          ratio that varies by a factor of ten with a minimum          mortality reduction per unit energy savings in North          Dakota and a maximum in Maryland This provides tangible          evidence that one cannot simply calculate public health          benefits given estimated energy savings as population          density climate fuel usage and emissions intensities          significantly affect estimated health benefits                          Economic Implications          In total the estimated cost of the increased          insulation is approximately  billion US or an average          of slightly below  per existing singlefamily home          available for retrofits The annual economic benefits          associated with the energy savings are approximately           billion per year indicating a payback period of slightly          over  years assuming no change in the real price of          fuel Since this includes an array of homes in different          regions and with different baseline insulation levels          the payback period clearly varies substantially across          homes If we apply a real discount rate of  then the          net present value of the economic savings conservatively          assuming a year lifetime for all homes is          approximately  billion implying a net economic          savings including the cost of insulation on the order          of  billion          When economic values are assigned to the mortality and          morbidity outcomes as described above the environmental          externalities averted through increased insulation amount          to approximately  billion per year Over  of this          total is related to premature mortality indicating that          the assumed value of statistical life is a key parameter          in this calculation although not all morbidity outcomes          were included in our analysis Adding this quantity to          the economic savings for the households would reduce the          payback period from over  years to approximately           years although this involves combining private and          public benefits has a simple characterization of the          time lag of benefits and does not include the upstream          emissions from insulation manufacturing or fuel          extraction and processing Nevertheless this calculation          provides a rough indication of the relative magnitudes of          environmental externalities and cost savings                            Discussion        Our analysis has demonstrated that it is viable to        calculate central estimates for the public health benefits        associated with reduced residential energy consumption        making use of previous dispersion models and        epidemiological studies Our model can provide insight        about the relative merits of alternative energy efficiency        policies as well as allowing for a comparison with source        controls or other public health interventions For example        our central estimate of  fewer premature deaths per year        from retrofitting existing homes can be compared with         fewer premature deaths per year from increasing insulation        in a single year of new homes     The ratio between        these values is greater than  which exceeds the energy        savings ratio of approximately  illustrating the        importance of geographic patterns of housing starts The        differential between these values clearly demonstrates the        substantially greater potential in the existing housing        market even given the fact that existing home retrofits        represent a one time opportunity while housing codes        influencing new homes would affect construction over        multiple years        To provide further context about the magnitude of        benefits retrofitting one million existing homes today        would have the same public health benefits as requiring         million new homes to meet IECC  standards Given the        rate of new home construction approximately  million        new homes per year this implies that a code change today        would yield identical annual benefits as the one million        home retrofit in about  years with identical cumulative        benefits in  years In addition a recent study estimated        that requiring nine older grandfathered coalfired        power plants in Illinois to meet new source standards would        yield approximately  fewer premature deaths per year            similar to the benefits of retrofitting all eligible        existing homes Costeffectiveness comparisons with other        interventions are not very useful as increased residential        insulation both reduces aggregate costs calculated as net        present value and health risks given the boundaries of        our analysis        While these comparisons provide some insight about the        implications of our analysis any riskbased calculation is        deficient without careful quantitative consideration of the        uncertainties inherent in the estimates We have deemed a        formal uncertainty analysis to be beyond the scope of our        investigation in part because uncertainties have been        discussed elsewhere    and in part because it is        difficult to accurately quantify many core uncertainties        However we can use the findings of our analysis to provide        some qualitative prioritization of future areas of study        We summarize the findings of our qualitative uncertainty        analysis in Table  which draws on past damage function        uncertainty characterization            First if the environmental externalities represent the        endpoint of our analysis it is clear that resolving        uncertainties related to mortality will be more important        than resolving uncertainties related to morbidity However        this is partly dependent on our underlying health and        valuation assumptions We have used the cohort mortality        studies and a value of statistical life VSL approach An        extreme lowerbound calculation for mortality would first        focus on the timeseries rather than cohort mortality        evidence This decision could either be based on the belief        that there is inadequate evidence of a longterm mortality        effect although reliance on cohort evidence has been        supported elsewhere      or the belief that        longterm effects involve significant lags and nearterm        benefits might therefore dominate externality estimates        Given this focus an additional lowerbound assumption        would consider a lifeyear measure more appropriate than a        VSL measure with a relatively short longevity loss assumed        in the timeseries studies        Using a value from the timeseries literature of an        approximate  increase in deaths per  gm increase in        PM                assuming that each        timeseries death represents a loss of only one lifeyear        and using US EPAs value of statistical life year of             our annual mortality benefit would be        decreased from  billion to  million In this extreme        case mortality still represents  of the benefits        albeit with a limited set of morbidity outcomes With the        inclusion of the suite of common morbidity outcomes        including chronic respiratory disease and hospitalizations        for cardiovascular or respiratory disease morbidity would        likely dominate monetized health benefits in this        scenario        Given the magnitude of this change it is clear that        improved understanding of the cohort mortality findings        would be paramount in refining the estimates within our        analysis Of similar importance would be issues related to        the relative toxicity of sulfate particles nitrate        particles and primary combustion particles from various        sources According to our analysis a majority of the        benefits is associated with sulfate particles indicating        that alternative sulfate toxicities would strongly        influence our findings On the other hand since nitrate        particles contribute only  of benefits changes in        conclusions about nitrate toxicity would not influence our        aggregate calculations in a substantial way Appropriate        economic values for premature mortality would clearly be        critical as well However improved understanding about        cohort mortality effects and lifeyears lost within        epidemiological studies would greatly inform valuation        with a significant portion of the remaining uncertainty        related to a value judgment about whether health outcomes        should be valued on a lifeyear lost or willingness to pay        basis        Other significant contributors to uncertainty include        the intake fraction estimates the emissions        characterizations and the predictive energy models Given        the relative importance of SO          emissions in the South the sulfate        intake fractions in this region would be most important to        resolve A recent analysis found that sulfate intake        fractions for power plants in Georgia were similar when        CALPUFF and an alternative dispersion model were applied            indicating that our estimates may not be        significantly biased However for residential fuel        combustion the uncertainties may be somewhat greater        Mobile source intake fractions may not be identical to        residential intake fractions and the values applied may be        underestimates given the importance of nearsource impacts        and the relatively low geographic resolution of models        underlying our intake fraction estimates     The lack        of characterization of the influence of SO          emissions on nitrate concentrations        also contributes uncertainty although this is likely a        relatively small bias on an annual average and nationally        integrated basis        Our methods for energy savings and emission reduction        estimation also contribute uncertainties to the analysis        although many of these uncertainties are likely        insignificant compared to the uncertainties articulated        above For example since our energy models were both        highly predictive of modeled energy consumption and were        calibrated to reported energy consumption stratified by        fuel type and region significant bias is unlikely This is        illustrated by the fact that our aggregate energy savings        estimate is within  of the value reported in a similar        analysis     with the difference explained in part by        differences in the assumed number of homes eligible for        increased insulation        On the emissions side many uncertainties are difficult        to quantify since AP does not provide quantitative        estimates of variability or uncertainty Our assumption        about the allocation of electricity reductions across power        plants could have contributed a downward bias with an        availabilitybased allocation increasing benefits to         fewer deaths per year and a capacitybased allocation        increasing benefits to  fewer deaths per year This        could theoretically represent a significant uncertainty        and one that could be resolved with more detailed power        sector models One piece of information provides an        indication that our baseline analysis may be the most        reasonable depiction of the marginal electricity sector A        marginal emissions analysis for the New England Power Pool        NEPOOL indicates marginal emission rates of  lbMWh of        NOx and  lbMWh of SO          in      the identical year as        our EGRID database These emission rates are within  of        our baseline values for the NPCC NERC region which        includes both NEPOOL and New York State and are        substantially lower than the emission rates from the        availabilitybased or capacitybased allocation        schemes        A final uncertainty is related to the limited scope of        our analysis We focused largely on the PMrelated        mortality benefits of energy savings but there are clearly        numerous additional benefits including reduced greenhouse        gas emissions health benefits related to other pollutants        such as ozone or morbidity endpoints decreased        dependence on oil imports and so forth Although many of        these endpoints are difficult to quantify they clearly        represent ancillary benefits of energy savings        In addition to the analytical uncertainties there are        broader limitations in applying our findings for policy        purposes As mentioned earlier the lack of formal life        cycle calculations impairs drawing conclusions about the        net public health benefits of increased residential        insulation However assuming parallelism with a life cycle        investigation in new housing     would imply that the        public health impacts of increased insulation manufacturing        would be far less than the public health benefits of        reduced energy consumption during the lifetime of the home        with a payback comparable to the economic payback period of         years Furthermore our analysis represents static        conditions although the housing market and emission        factors from sources among other assumptions are quite        dynamic For example if regulations were put into place        restricting emissions from power plants the public health        benefits of energy efficiency measures would be reduced In        addition insulation retrofits of this magnitude could have        significant market influences Although the energy savings        only represent  of annual US energy consumption given        the focus on only a subset of the residential sector the        amount of insulation required is substantially larger than        the current annual insulation market If all retrofits        occurred in a relatively short period this would        significantly influence the unit price of insulation Thus        although reduced energy consumption will have longterm        public health implications the uncertainties in benefit        calculations likely increase as a function of time        In spite of the uncertainties in our analysis our study        provides findings with potential policy implications and        demonstrates some important methodological advancements in        quantifying the public health benefits of energy efficiency        programs On the former point although it is clear that a        regulation mandating energy efficiency retrofits in        existing homes would not be tenable the magnitude of the        economic and public health benefits indicates that creative        public policies to encourage retrofits eg lowinterest        loans or tax deductions may be warranted On the        methodological side the application of a regression model        to estimate energy savings appeared reasonable and        illustrated the potential for evaluating numerous        alternative scenarios without extensive simulations The        intake fraction methodology yielded exposure estimates that        were both interpretable from a health perspective and        implementable for a largescale energy efficiency program        Although further study is needed to reduce some core        uncertainties within the analysis the model framework is        sufficiently flexible to allow for the integration of new        scientific information                    Conclusions        We have developed and applied a model to quantify the        public health benefits of reduced residential energy        consumption Retrofitting existing singlefamily homes in        the US would yield an estimated  TBTU of annual energy        savings which corresponds to net present value economic        gains of approximately  billion and public health        benefits that include  fewer premature deaths per year        While there are substantial uncertainties in many        components of our health benefits model our analysis        demonstrates an approach for integrating environmental and        public health benefits into energy efficiency policy        analysis                    List of abbreviations        EGRID  Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated        Database
