                                 Rain Oer Me            Summer visitors like to saythat it doesnt rain that much in Seattle With a thumb in the almanac theylltell you that the city collects less annual precipitation than New York Citywhich is true What they dont tell you is that come November as the lastsupersaver flies out of SeaTac the clouds roll in from the Pacific Ocean andhang around Western Washington like the stink of a dead rat in the wall Theinexorable damp persists until June and washes away the civility thatNorthwesterners wear like hand lotion Managers snap at their departments orturn scarily morose the cubiclebound browse Webzines hello reader andengage in marathon email bitch sessions It feels like nobodys showered orshaved for three days            Fewartists have captured the condition well Robert Altman came close in theopening scene of McCabe and Mrs Miller  his Western in which WarrenBeatty rides through a shower into a logging camp whose residents resemblenothing so much as wet cats However no account of the Northwests soakedmisery surpasses that of the great American explorer and abysmal spellerWilliam Clark who recorded his observations nearly  years ago Clark spenta winter on the OregonWashington coast which is to rain as the Antarctic isto snow Rained all the after part of last night rain continues thismorning he wrote in late  We are all wet cold and disagreeable Duringtheir coastal wintering Lewis and Clark and their Corps of Discovery enjoyed atotal of  days without rain At one point it poured  days straight withouta longer intermition than  hours at a time The word disagreeable isrepeated like a mantra in Clarks journal Its a curiously evocativedescription miserable would be the natural choice but Clarks word capturesa quality of the Northwestern damp that as Ken Kesey once wrote you have togo through a winter here to understand The stuff puts you on edge About theninth or  th day everybody looks at each other and says Goddamn its been raining This is what William Clark felt I think OnNov   he wrote The rainey weather continued  from the th in the morng untill the  th is eleven days rainand the most disagreeable time I have experienced  Cold wet cooped upand hungry I imagine Clark waking to the sound of skyspatter on the morning ofNov  and thinking I cant believe this shit            Ithought wed settled the fight between free will andpredestination with a sophomore reading of Erasmus but lately its popping upall over lifes syllabus For the past couple of years my family born of anAlzheimersafflicted grandmother has been cracking wise about who got Gramsgene Now they tell us that anxiety has its own causal gene which has spawnedso many jokes about worrying about carrying the worry gene that Ill spare youmy own The coming of the rain has only added weight to the sinking realizationthat Im about as free as Pavlovs best friend acting as it does as coldevidence of geographical determinismthe idea that the landscape shapes thehuman culture that thrives within it            There aretwo cultures in the state of Washington dry and wet Both are determined bythe raw fact of mountains and an ocean The Pacific Ocean generates warm moistair which flows into Western Washington and bumps into the Cascade MountainsThe air condenses into clouds it rains            The fact that were locked into this bowl ofrain has given rise to some of the Northwests distinctive read bizarresubcultures A few years ago writer Tim Egan branded as Northwest Noir thedark damp movements that creep out of this moldy greenhouse grunge musicTwin Peaks  serial killers The alternative to Egans alternative is theequally strange culture of people who given eight months of February chooseto fly straight into the teeth of the beast Im talking about the REI Armythose legions of gearobsessed soldiers who suit up every weekend and driveinto the hills dead set on hunting down and killing their Godgiven portion ofwilderness transcendence Over the past couple of years Ive joined theirranks Enlistment begins with the  purchase of a GoreTex jacket and rainpants and thereafter requires monthly tithes for boots socks glovesgoggles trekking poles interiorframe backpacks gas stoves and a reallycool wrist altimeter            REIrecently cashiered its funky Capitol Hill warehouse store for a palatialflagship pavilion visible from Interstate  the Space Needle and probably thespace shuttle too The stores prime attraction is a threestory climbingpinnacle that looks like a schmoo constructed of stucco Shopping in the newboothutcumthemepark is daunting a little like leaving the roadside chapelfor Robert Schullers Crystal Cathedral And while the soul of local outdoorculture still thrives at the new store this is not necessarily a good thingJust below the happy naturesbounty song promoted by REI lies the low hum ofoutdoor cultures ugliest trait a possessive paranoia that keeps outsiders outand insiders in A humorless sense of moral superiority is de rigueur fostered by the belief that those of us who go out and stomp the natural worldunder our Vibram soles are healing Gaea while the rest of the world is tearingher down Anyone who began hikingclimbingskiingboarding the day before youdid is considered an experienced pro you and all those who purchased theirfleece jackets the day after you did are pathetic wannabes A rock climber whotrains with some of the worlds most experienced craghangers recently told meshe still considers herself a novice I figure youve got to put in  yearsbefore you get past amateur status she said Nothing commands instant respectin Seattle like a low REI number The coops membership list began with No in  and now runs into the low  millions Jim Whittaker the first Americanto climb Mount Everest is No  I am No  I bear the shame everyday of my life            In Japan climbing Mount Fuji is a rite of the Shintoreligion A sign near its summit reads Only a fool has never climbed MountFuji only a fool has climbed it more than once Washingtonians havent baseda religion on climbing Mount Rainieryetbut in all other ways it assumesthe prominence of Fuji in local culture We name beers and baseball teams afterit which gives you some idea Like the Japanese peak Rainier draws fools every year who strap spikes to their feet and attempt to walk nearlythree miles in the sky Last summer I was No  Climbing Rainier is arite of passage for some Northwesterners an obsession for others Some fatherstake their sons up it before their  th birthday Local climberswith egoinsecurity issues often scoff at Rainier Nothing but a long hikethey say putting me in mind of the old Monty Python skit about who grew uppoorest Climbing with shoes on your feet Ooh luxury             In a sense the climbing ofRainier has become the sacred rite of REI culture It is a long brutal slog updangerous gablesteep glaciers in which at least  previous aspirants areburied Those who make it up summit as a verb are offered the cruelest sortof spiritual enlightenment the realization that there is no spiritualenlightenment on mountain tops If I had kept a journal on the summit it wouldhave read remarkably similar to William Clarks We are all cold wet anddisagreeable I may have added two words Get down Sometimes rites ofpassage like the experience of suffering lead to great wisdom And sometimessuffering in the wilderness is just suffering in the wilderness and the onlywisdom you gain is the knowledge that you dont want to do it again
