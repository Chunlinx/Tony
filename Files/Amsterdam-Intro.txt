Amsterdam and its peopleTheres no other city on earth like Amsterdam It is a city of superlatives having more canals than Venice and more bridges than Paris It is also one of the prettiest in Europe The more than  museumsfeaturing everything from the worlds most prominent artists to the history of hempquench the thirst for even the most ardent culture buff and with  buildings from the th th and th centuries the reflections of its illustrious history happily ripple on into the st century However the lure of Amsterdams bricks and mortar is only part of its excitement Its contemporary culture is vibrantits definitely not a city stuck in the past and the people are openminded easygoing and opinionated but also down to earth and welcoming to visitorsAmsterdam is situated in the north of The Netherlands and was set where the outlet of the Amstel River meets the salty tidal waters of the Zuider Zee With little dry land to build on exactly why a small group of settlers chose this unpromising spot is difficult to understand Yet it proved to be an excellent decision because Amsterdammers as the natives of Amsterdam are called soon came to control the waters of the river and the trade which flowed along it By the th century Amsterdam had become arguably the richest city in the world at the center of a huge Dutch colonial empire It traded in spices rum and sugar cane among other commodities and its residents demanded only the best The Amsterdam of this periodcalled the Golden Ageforms the heart of todays cityWithout doubt the initial lure of the city is its numerous historic buildings The lines of tall narrow houses with their pretty gables rest beside pictureperfect treelined canals They are connected by ornate iron bridges and cobbled walkways which have changed little for over  years in fact since they felt the footfall of such inhabitants as the artist Rembrandt and explorer Abel Tasman who gave his name to TasmaniaAmsterdam is a wonderful city for visitors Small enough to stroll around and with the canal side streets too narrow for tour buses you cant drive past all the best attractions at high speed Here there is no glass window between you and reality You have to feel the summer sun or see your breath on a crisp winter morning as you step out to see what Amsterdam is all about If you take a canal tour the quiet boats allow you to float slowly along away from the noise of the modern worldThe museums could keep you busy for weeks Art collections historic houses and memorials to heroes and heroines can all be found here For entertainment after the sun sets there are over  different performances in the city every evening The Netherlands National Opera and National Ballet are based here and there are numerous orchestral musical and comedy venues along with revues and dance shows Amsterdam also plays host to one of the most dynamic club scenes in Europe with several major venues drawing thousands of young people to the cityYet if the faades of the buildings hark back to the past the interiors do not Internet banking interactive information points and resource recycling advice centersthe concepts of today are alive and thriving all around the city This is no historic ghost town the city brims with people Its houses are still lived in although most are now apartments rather than singlefamily homes and its streets filled with bakeries delicatessens and wine merchants where people drop in to buy dinner on the way home in the evenings Its all part of the fascinating dichotomy you find at every turn here The city strides into the future while still holding hands with the pastThe historic heart of Amsterdam has remained unchanged mainly because of people power As in most cities in the world during the second part of the th century property developers eyed the old canal houses with relish The price of land was soaring and developers could make a tidy profit by demolishing them and replacing them with something modern Unfashionable buildings such as the warehouses of the old docks were simply left to the elements deemed to be worthless Amsterdammers though had other ideas They went out onto the streets to fight for their city barricading historic houses and occupying empty buildings in the warehouse districtThis was typical of the populace and it wasnt the first time in fact Amsterdammers have been standing up for what they believe in for centuries When Protestants were persecuted in the th century they flocked here from all around Europe to take refuge During WWII the dock workers of Amsterdam went on strike as an act of protest against the treatment of the Jews in the city Although in the end the protest was futile it shows the strength of feeling and social awareness that pervades every part of society here As the st century begins Amsterdam has over  different nationalities living within the city boundaries a situation which could be fraught with difficulty and strain Yet here it only adds to the cultural richness built up over centuries of exploration and tradeAmsterdammers seem to have the ability to find creative solutions to the problems of their world When there wasnt enough housing on the land they looked at the empty canals and decided that houseboats would help There are now over  on the waterways of the city When cars became a problem in the old town they gave the bicycle priority and now there are over  on the streetsand an estimated  at the bottom of the canal system at any one time Youll quickly learn to listen for the warning bells and stand clear as their riders pedal byPerhaps the most widely publicized acts of tolerance in recent history have been in the areas of sex and drugs Amsterdammers looked at feasible and practical responses to the issues and decriminalized some aspects of both This does not make the city one huge den of iniquity and these areas are still controlled and regulated in fact you could visit Amsterdam and be quite unaware of these activities Theres just a recognition here that provided no harm comes to you or others around you then you should be free as an adult to make your own choicesAmsterdammers fight for everyones rights against oppression or the right of David to stand against the faceless Goliath of bureaucracy In fact in Amsterdam several thousand Davids get together to form a pressure group and Goliath has to sit up and take notice This doesnt mean that Amsterdam is utopiait is a city of stcentury pressures particularly with continuing problems of traffic and litterbut it does mean that the problems are faced realistically debated passionately by the whole community and agreed solutions are put into action When the solutions dont work as they often dont the whole process starts over again It is all seen as part of a huge learning curveOf course Amsterdammers dont spend all their time waving protest banners They are as industrious and hardworking as their forefathers They enjoy galleries and exhibitions as much as the visitors doin fact it can be very hard to get tickets for performances because of local demand On weekends they head to the parks to picnic or out of the city in large groups to do more cycling They eat out in restaurants and cafswhere they have over  different types of cuisine to choose from They love to socialize and barsparticularly the famous brown barsare the place where they meet usually to put the world to rights In summer they sit out with a drink as bar owners put out tables in the squares and on street corners Sit at a table and youll soon find yourself engaged in conversation most Amsterdammers speak good English Within an hour youll feel like a localAmsterdam has many facets almost as many as the diamonds for which the city is famous Yet these seem to amalgamate into a coherent whole It is a city of history which shouts from every gable and street corner a city of cultureof museums and musicians and artists a city of learning with a large university a city of trade with banking at its core a multiethnic city of over  different nationalities a city of live and let live as minority groups are able to flourish and innovative ideas to develop and of course a city of tourism with over  million visitors per year The beauty of its buildings is undisputed but it is the sum of all these parts that makes Amsterdam an unforgettable city to visit
