                uh do you want to give a start on it   well i think for me i im from Alabama south Alabama and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement   uhhuh    uhhuh   uh in a pretty liberal family for for that area at the time   uhhuh   and so i was very much a part of all the uh  you know what was going on there uh   uhhum   my parents are pretty active and uh it was very scary and but now weve seen you know  uh black people have a lot more civil rights in that area and i guess all over than they did you know twenty years ago   oh definitely   theres still a lot to be  you know to be accomplished but   uhhuh   for me when i think about social change thats what i first think of because i can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything   uhhuh uhhuh you can relate to that now see we didnt we dont have any of that because well like we live in the country   uhhuh   in Clarion County and uh we really didnt have things like that going on that we you know uh ran into   uhhuh   so we kind of uh i guess when i think of social changes i think think more of uh   uh visiting habits of families and such uh uh   yeah well thats true thats a good one right there   yeah that theres less visiting done i think on a whole than there used to be used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not you went visiting and uh today you know people they do visit but its not quite the same as uh what it was say twenty years ago thirty years ago   right and i grew up in out in the country too basically in a rural area and with lots of family   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and so we were always at family in different people family members homes but even now you know they dont even do that   right uhhuh uhhuh well theyre so spread out i think has a lot to do with it   well and theyre so busy people peoples personal schedules are so busy   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   mainly because i a lot of it has to do i think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked and now uh almost all the women work   right right thats right yeah the majority yeah uhhuh   and so that means you know a lot of  a lot of the social visiting and all was i think probably instigated by women at that time right and now   probably because when you work you dont really care to go out and visit as much   thats right and now uh i mean my mother does not work and and she you know shes finds finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women   and uh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   but even just social visits people dont do that anymore youre right and people dont feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore   no huhuh they dont do as much uhhuh   theres a real   you have to make arrangements or have an invitation or   right you know you dont want to you want to make sure its okay or i guess we dont not to make invade peoples privacy or whatever   yeah yeah well that could be part of it i dont know for sure what it is i know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance so we really dont have that even we dont yeah   well out of out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us dont live within fifty miles   oh really   and that and most live within ten or or twenty so but thats you know that is rural its a rural family and   oh thats pretty good yeah uhhuh uhhuh   most people didnt go away im just one of the two out of fifteen that dont live in the you know even in the same state   uhhuh uhhuh well apparently there must be work available   yeah there is in that area   for those that are uhhuh because around here theres really nothing for the young people no good i mean theres jobs theres minimum wage jobs but uh to make a good living there really around here there just isnt too much   umhum and i guess you know that would greatly affect social change i use social change probably the job market has always and the the economy has always affected uh social change   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   probably   so  well theres the main things i can think of i really tried to think of some other things and i couldnt really   well i think just also you know   that   the womens movement too has affected a lot of social change uh people marry   yeah definitely some good and some bad   yeah people marry later   uhhuh   i mean basically i think now again where im from in in Alabama thats not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   but now out here in Texas where i am now thats very unusual   theyd rather get their life started first before uhhuh   most people get married i mean get go to college or at least get a job and even you know people are seem to a lot of people seem to   uhhuh   be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up   uhhuh uhhuh yeah well even to get school finished i think a lot of times its better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in because a marriage takes a lot of effort and concentration  and if youre busy with school its i think its really difficult for a family   right but probably uh you know more women being in in the work force also greatly greatly affects social change because it affects child care and uh   uhhuh uhhuh right right yeah i know my my daughter that lives in Pittsburgh she has two little boys and they theyve been in day care since you know ones four and ones one   but right   and theyve done well  now i wouldnt want to do it that way but uh shes quite happy and the children seem quite adjusted and uh   well and theyre you know theyre theyre saying right now we dont know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation thats just now coming into the work force and in their twenties   uhhuh thats right yeah uhhuh yes uhhuh   they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care and so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that what that does   thats right yeah uhhuh now im going to babysit my granddaughter shes just eight weeks old so this will be new for me   uhhuh   so uh but the others im too far away to help them out at all   where do they live   uh well i have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh one in Maryland and one in Connecticut a son in Connecticut   well theyre not too far though   no but like Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home and uh its too far to you know really go too often   uhhuh   Pittsburghs not quite so bad its just a couple hours Maryland maybe five hour drive   well i live like fourteen hours from home in fact im   thats uhhuh thats worse yet   im driving tomorrow im im driving home tomorrow so to go be there for the Fourth of July   oh are you really do you uh stay overnight on the way or you   no i can drive it all its just me so i can make it im thirty five   youre young how old are you okay well youre young enough yet to   although its its it is pretty i dont know i dont enjoy it that much its pretty much like get there and   uhhuh its work to get there yeah yeah huh   its just not that pleasant even with other people i basically just dont like to drive that far   uhhuh now my son they they flew he rebuilt a Aranca Chief airplane and they flew down last weekend they came down in it and it still took a long time because its not a fast its not a highspeed airplane   uhhuh   but they enjoyed in thoroughly so   when you say youre in the second phase of this project what is the second phase of it   im not sure but you have to change phones you have to call from another a different   oh
