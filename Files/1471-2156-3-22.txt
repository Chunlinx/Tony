                    Background        A causal association between squamous cell carcinoma        arising in the head and neck region HNSCC and exposure to        tobacco and alcohol is well established              However  HNSCC occur in patients without any        antecedent history of tobacco or alcohol exposure             Several studies have suggested that these patients have a        divergent clinical course compared to patients with tobacco        associated HNSCC which may be a reflection of differences        in the genetic composition       Empiric evidence        suggesting that nonsmokers may respond differently to        carcinogenic insults is offered in a report by Schantz et        al showing the highest levels of chromosomal sensitivity        in lymphocytes after exposure to the clastogen bleomycin in        HNSCC patients who were nonsmokers     Relatively few        studies have directly investigated the impact of        tobaccoalcohol exposure on the genetic composition of        HNSCC Amplification and expression of cyclin D p        mutation and deletions of p q and p are suggested to        be influenced by the degree of tobacco exposure              The largest effort on this topic has been reported by Koch        and colleagues who found significantly higher rates of p        mutation and loss of heterozygosity at p q and q as        part of allelotyping analysis of  individual loci            No studies have utilized true genomewide evaluative        measures to analyze the impact of carcinogen exposure on        the accumulated chromosomal abnormalities in HNSCC        Comparative genomic hybridization CGH originally        described by Kallionemi in  is an ideal screening        measure allowing the simultaneous detection of gains        losses and amplifications in genetic information in an        individual tumor     In addition several authors have        used the total number of chromosomal abnormalities as an        assessment of genomic instability     In this study        CGH analysis showed the presence of significant overlap in        genomic instability and in the individual chromosomal        abnormalities based on the degree of tobaccoalcohol        exposure in HNSCC with the exception of        gainsamplifications at q and p                    Results and Discussion        The study population was divided into   patients        with limited and  patients  with a significant        tobaccoalcohol exposure history Of the  patients in        lowlevel tobaccoalcohol exposure group  patients gave        no history of tobacco usage while  patients gave no        history of alcohol exposure Of the two patients with        tobacco exposure histories one gave a history of smoking        less than  packs of cigarettes in her lifetime and the        other had a history of smoking  pack years  years        prior to presentation with cancer Although patients        without significant tobaccoalcohol exposure were younger        in age there was no significant difference in all other        clinical tumor treatment and outcome characteristics        Table  The difference in age based on the severity of        tobaccoalcohol exposure has been previously described                    The median number of copy number abnormalities was  per        case ranging from  to  The most common sites for gains        were p q p p and q losses p q and q and        amplifications q q and qqter Figure         These results are congruent with those reported in the        literature for CGH analysis of HNSCC        The        level of genomic instability measured by the median number        of continuous copy number changes by CGH analysis was also        not influenced by the severity of carcinogen exposure        These findings are in contrast to allelotyping studies        which show higher rates of abnormalities in patients with        significant tobaccoalcohol exposure     Since tobacco        is known to cause single strand breaks it may be aberrant        repair of these changes that is detected by LOH which are        below the threshold of detection by CGH        Although the total number and general pattern of        abnormalities were similar the prevalence of individual        abnormalities was different based on the extent of        tobaccoalcohol exposure as outlined in Figure         Amplification at q p   and gain of p p          were significantly more common in patients with        carcinogen exposure A high prevalence of q amplification        has been reported in many studies on tobaccoassociated        cancers including those of the lung cervix and esophagus                 We and others have shown that         PIKCA is a candidate oncogene at q        in these tumors       Interestingly PIK pathway        has been suggested to play a role in modulating the effects        of benzopyrene a tobaccoderived carcinogen and its        metabolite        antidihydroxyepoxyterahydrobenzopyrene                   Although less frequent p gains are also common to many        tobaccoassociated malignancies         Work        by Racz and colleagues suggest that PAX and ENO may be        candidate oncogenes in this region     PAX is part of        a family of transcription factors known to be carcinogenic        Evidence suggests that gain of function in PAX triggers        neoplastic development by maintaining cells in a        deregulated undifferentiated and proliferative state as        is seen in alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas Loss of p was an        event unique to patients with no tobaccoalcohol exposure        This site may contain a factor protecting cells from        tobacco induced carcinogenesis including genes such as        MSH a gene involved in mismatch repair                        Conclusions        Several limitations must be taken into account when        assessing this work First the retrospective nature of the        data collection introduces inherent biases Second        although it is amongst the largest studies analyzing of        genetic differences based on carcinogen exposure the        sample size remains small limiting statistical power to        detect existing differences Finally CGH is limited in        resolution to copy number abnormalities  Kb making it        likely that smaller aberrations may exist that are        influenced by tobaccoalcohol exposure Taking the        limitations into account we identified no differences in        the degree of chromosomal instability and significant        overlap in the pattern of chromosomal aberrations occurring        in patients with HNSCC divided by the severity of        tobaccoalcohol exposure However several individual        differences exist including amplification of q and gain        of p which may represent specific sites of damage by        tobaccoalcohol carcinogens Further work is required to        refine the finding of this study and understand its        implications                    Methods                  Tissue aquisition and clinical information          Tumor samples from patients undergoing curative          treatment for HNSCC were obtained at time of biopsy or          surgical resection in the operating room following          guidelines established by the Institutional Review Board          Only patients with previously untreated HNSCC were          included in this study All samples were analyzed          histologically to confirm the presence of           carcinoma The study population included  patients          ranging in age from  to  years median  years          There was a predominance of males  The oral cavity           and laryngopharynx  were the most common          primary sites Overall   patients were treated          surgically with adjuvant radiation utilized for patients          with advanced TNM stage  cases or extracapsular          extension pathologically identified in nodal metastasis           patients Radiation alone was utilized in  patients          and in combination with chemotherapy in  patients The          median followup for the study population was  months          ranging from  months          Tobacco usage was assessed in packyears defined by          the number of packs of cigarettes smoked daily multiplied          by the number of years of active smoking For the          purposes of this analysis smoking  hand rolled          cigarettes  cigars or  pipes full of tobacco was          considered equivalent to smoking  pack of industrial          cigarettes Tobacco usage was coded as a dichotomous          variable and was considered positive if a greater than          pack year smoking history was reported Alcohol          consumption was also recorded as a dichotomous variable          and was considered positive when daily usage of two          alcohol equivalents on a daily basis or binge alcohol          usage repetitive use of  alcohol equivalents at a          single sitting was reported For the purpose of this          study patients were divided into two groups based on the          history of carcinogen exposure Group  had a limited or          no history of tobacco andor alcohol exposure while          group  patients reported significant tobacco andor          alcohol exposure          Outcome of treatment was evaluated on the date of last          patient contact by determining the presence or absence of          cancer and the vital status alive dead or unknown          The date and location of the first recurrence was          ascertained For patients who died the cause of death          was determined from review of the death certificate          physicians death summary andor tumor registry records          Diseasefree survival was determined as the differences          between time zero date of first treatment and the date          of first recurrence Causespecific survival was the          difference between time zero and the date of death due to          cancer                          Comparative genomic hybridization          CGH was performed using previously published methods              Seven to  separate metaphases were captured and          processed using the Quantitative Image Processing System          Quips Pathvysion system Applied Imaging Santa Clara          CA Red green and blue fluorescence intensities were          analyzed for all metaphase spreads normalized to a          standard length and statistically combined to show the          red green signal ratio and  confidence intervals for          the entire chromosome Copy number changes were detected          based on the variance of the red green ratio profile          from the standard of  Ratio values of  and  were          defined as thresholds for gains and amplifications          respectively and losses were defined as ratio of  or          lower                          Statistical analysis          Statistical comparisons were performed using the JPM          software SAS Institute Inc Cary NC Descriptive          statistics were used to summarize study data Statistical          significance was accepted at a twotailed p value of less          than or equal to  The pvalue for accepting          significance was not adjusted for multiple comparisons          Nonparametric qualitative and quantitative comparisons          were performed using Fishers exact test and          KruskalWallis analysis of variance respectively The          Chi square test was utilized for multigroup qualitative          comparisons Survival data was censored for patients lost          to followup surviving to the end to the study or dying          of causes unrelated to cancer Survival curves were          generated using the KaplanMeier productlimit method          to allow maximum use of censored observations Survival          comparisons were performed using the logrank test                            Authors contributions        BS was involved in the conception planning        organization
