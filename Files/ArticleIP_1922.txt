                                 The East Is in the Red            Want an easy way toeliminate the US trade deficit Just declare New York City a separateentity with its own balanceofpayments statistics I can almost guaranteeyou that the trade deficit of the rest of the countrycall it mainlandAmericawill disappear            Afterall if New Yorks numbers were counted separately we would no longer treatgoods imported into New York as debit items in the US balance of paymentsFurthermore all of the goods that mainland America ships to New York Citywould be considered US exports True the goods that New York ships to therest of the world would be struck off the export tally while the goods thecity ships to the rest of the United States would henceforth count as USimports But these would be minor adjustments New York City is basically notin the business of producing physical objects So we can be sure that the cityruns a huge trade deficitprobably bigger than that of the United States as awhole which is why splitting it off from the rest of the country would givethe mainland a surplus            Of course most if not all of New Yorks deficit ingoods trade is made up for by exports to mainland America and the worldat large of intangibles such as financial services and tickets to seeCats  and the city also has a disproportionate number of wealthyresidents who receive lots of income from the property they own elsewhere Itwould not be surprising to find that the city actually runs a surplus on itscurrent account a measure that includes trade in services and investmentincome as well as the merchandise trade balance But if its the trade deficityou worry about splitting New York off from mainland America will take care ofthe problem Nothing real would have changed but maybe it would make somepeople feel better            Whatinspires this idea is Chinas assumption of political control over Hong Kongwhich removes the last faint excuse for treating China and Hong Kong asseparate economiesand therefore offers a way to make some of the same peoplefeel better about another trade issue the supposed threat posed by Chinastrade surplus In recent years ChinasansHong Kongwhat we used to callmainland Chinahas been running large and growing surpluses in itsmerchandise trade although its balance on current account has fluctuatedaround zero But ChinaplusHong Kong does not run big trade surplusesIn the year ending in April China ran a trade surplus of almost billionbut Hong Kong as one would expect for a mainly serviceproducingcitystate ran an offsetting deficit of  billion reducing the total to afairly unimpressive  billion Chinas trade surpluses in other words arelargely a statistical illusion produced by the fact that so much of themanagement and ownership of the countrys industry is located on the other sideof an essentially arbitrary line            Pointing this out doesnt change anything realbut perhaps it may help calm some of the fears being fostered by underemployedJapanbashers who like old cold warriors have lately gone searching for newenemies            Professional trade alarmist Alan Tonelson gave a particularly clear statementof the new fears in his New York Times review of The Big Ten The BigEmerging Markets and How They Will Change Our Lives  a book by formerCommerce Undersecretary Jeffrey Garten The review caught my eye because someof it matched word for word a recent speech by House Minority Leader andpresidential hopeful Richard Gephardt After praising Garten for takingseriously the possibility that the growing ability of the  to producesophisticated goods and services at rockbottom prices could drag down thestandard of living of even affluent welleducated Americans Tonelson chidedhim for imagining that developing countries China included would provideimportant new markets for advancedcountry exports Consumer markets inthese emerging countries are likely to stay small for decades  if they dontkeep wages and purchasing power low they will have trouble attracting theforeign investment they require both to service debt and to financegrowth            Iam always grateful when influential pundits make suchstatements especially in prominent places for in so doing they protect usfrom the everpresent temptation to take people seriously simply because theyare influential to imagine that widely held views must actually make at leastsome sense            Tonelsons claim is that asemerging economies growthat is produce and sell greatly increased quantitiesof goods and servicestheir spending will not grow by a comparable amountequivalently he is claiming that they will run massive trade surpluses Butwhen a country grows its total income must by definition rise oneforonewith the value of its production Maybe you dont think that income will getpaid out in higher wages but it has to show up somewhere  And whyshould we imagine that people in emerging countries unlike people in advancednations cannot find things to spend their money on            In factone might well expect that emerging economies would typically run trade or atleast current account deficits  After all such countries willpresumably attract inflows of foreign investment allowing them to invest morethan they savewhich is to say spend more than they earn To put itanother way a country that attracts enough foreign investment both to servicedebt and to finance growth must by definition buy more goods and servicesthan it sellsthat is run a trade deficit The point again is that themoney has to show up somewhere             How can a country run a trade deficit when ithas the huge cost advantage that comes from combining First World productivitywith Third World wages The answer is that the premise must be wrong Whenproductivity in emerging economies rises so must wagesthat is the supposedsituation in which these countries are able to produce sophisticated goods andservices at rockbottom prices never materializes            I am sure that despite itslogic my position sounds unrealistic to many readers After all in realityThird World countries do run massive trade surpluses and their wagesdont rise with productivityright            Welllets do some abstruse statistical researchby say buying a copy of theEconomist and opening it to the last page which each week convenientlyoffers tables summarizing economic data for a number of emerging economies Weimmediately learn something interesting Of Gartens Big Ten six run tradedeficits as does the group as a whole nine run current account deficits Ofthe  economies listed  run trade deficits and  run current accountdeficits Wage numbers are a little harder to come by but the US Bureau ofLabor Statistics makes such data available on its Foreign Labor StatisticsWeb site There we find that in  workers in Taiwan and South Koreareceived only  percent as much per hour as their counterparts in the UnitedStates by  the numbers were  percent and  percent respectively            Surprise The facts fit the Panglossian economists visionquite nicely Emerging economies do typically run trade deficits wages do risewith productivity and actual experience offers no support at all for grimmervisions            But those grim visionspersist nonetheless For smart people like Tonelson or Gephardt this cannotbe a matter of simple ignorance It must involve ignorance with intent Afterall it must require real effort for a fulltime trade commentator who notonly writes frequently about the Third World threat but also decorates hiswritings with many statistics not to notice that most of those countries runtrade deficits rather than surpluses or that wages have in fact increaseddramatically in countries that used to have cheap labor It is I imagineequally difficult to pursue such a career without ever becoming aware of thearithmetical necessity that countries attracting big inflows of capital mustrun trade deficits            Butperhaps the uncanny ability not to notice these things is acquired by focusingmainly on  which does appear to run a huge trade surplus even while attractinglots of foreign capital Most of that trade surplus as weve seen is astatistical illusion But it is still at first sight hard to understand howChina can attract so much foreign investment without running a large currentaccount deficit Where does the money go            Auseful clue comes if we look again at the lastpage of the Economist and ask which country runs the biggest tradesurplus of all And the answer is  Russia  Obviously this isntbecause Russias economy is supercompetitive What that trade surplus actuallyreflects is Russias sorry state in which nervous businessmen and corruptofficials siphon off a large fraction of the countrys foreign exchangeearnings parking it in safe havens abroad rather than making it available topay for imports            China if you think aboutit suffers from a milder form of the same ailment The reason those inflows offoreign capital dont finance a trade deficit is that they are offset byoutflows of domestic capital In particular huge sums are being investedabroad to establish overseas nest eggs for honest Hong Kong businessmen just incase Hong Kong ends up looking like the rest of China and no doubt toestablish similar nest eggs for corrupt Chinese officials just in case the restof China ends up looking like Hong Kong To the extent that China does run atrade surplus in other words that surplus is a sign of weakness rather thanstrength            None of this should be takenas an apology for Chinas thoroughly nasty government I fear the worst in HongKong and worry as much as anyone about the effects of growing Chinese power onAsias political and military stability One thing I dont worry abouthowever is Chinas trade surplus Neither should you
