ITS  DO YOU KNOW YOUR IOLTA INTEREST RATEThe Supreme Court has historically provided mandates for thedeposit of client funds into attorney trust accounts Before federal law prohibited interest to be generated on checkingaccounts maintained by federally insured banks Therefore clientfunds were deposited into interestfree attorney trust accountsThe banks received a windfall shortterm interestfree loans fortheir useIn  banking laws changed For the first time banks couldoffer interest on checking accounts or NOW accounts Howeverattorneys could rarely take advantage of these interestbearingaccounts for their clients The purpose of depositing funds into anattorneys trust account was either for shortterm deposits withimmediate access to the funds or for small amounts whose interestwould not exceed the costs attendant to separate accountingTherefore individualized interestbearing trust checking accountswere unwieldy and impractical Clients could rarely if ever earna positive net interest In  New Jersey joined the ranks ofthose states that adopted the Interest on Lawyers Trust AccountsIOLTA Fund as a method of collecting and using the interest thatwould be earned on these deposits Rule A All  states nowhave similar IOLTA programsPursuant to our court rules participation in the IOLTA programis mandatory The type of funds to be deposited is strictlycircumscribed and the use to which that combined interest can beassigned carefully delineated As a result what might haveamounted to a pittance for a client in conglomerate became asubstantial fundAccording to information routinely gathered and analyzed by ourIOLTA fund in the year  the average balance of all IOLTAattorney trust accounts in New Jersey alone on any given day atany given time was  billion By the end of the third quarterSept   the last date for which this data is availablethat amount had increased to an average daily balance of billion in roughly  participating New Jersey banks That is billion that these banks can use to fund their mortgages homeequity loans automobile loans and other types of loans for whichthey receive approximately  percent or more on interest theychargeHave you checked the interest rate your bank pays on your IOLTAaccount The rates vary greatly from  percent to  percentdepending on the bank you choose Although this rate variation mayseem minimal if all the banks paid IOLTA interest at only percent the annual earnings on  billion would be only If every IOLTA account paid  percent a rate thateven IOLTA concedes is wishful thinking the earnings would be times greater or While many banks continued to pay the same rates in  thatthey paid in  others reduced the rates they pay In fact theaverage IOLTA interest rate paid in  by all of theparticipating banks was  percent Unfortunately the averageinterest rate paid through the third quarter of  dropped to percentA comparison of two of the major participating banksdemonstrates the disparity in their approaches to IOLTA One bankdropped its interest rate in November  to  percent The otherbank pays the fund interest based upon tiered account levels moretypical of a large commercial account As the balance in theaccount goes up the interest rate goes up as well to a highwater mark of  percent for accounts with balances of or more While a third major bank advertised its November moneymarket account rates to be between  percent for accounts with and  percent for accounts with  or more thatbank pays IOLTA a flat  percent Even its advertised passbooksavings accounts earned  percentMeanwhile some of the banks that have reduced interest rates toIOLTA also charge higher activity fees to IOLTA A few banks chargefees as high as  percent of the gross interest earned Onaverage the IOLTA fund repays  percent of all its earnings tothose banks that charge for these accounts These fees generallyinclude monthly account fees and per check and per deposit chargeson each transaction Yet only half of the IOLTA participatingbanks actually charge the fund these fees Half of the banks chargeno fees whatsoever simply satisfied to have these accounts as asignificant growing source of inexpensive money to use almostinterestfreeIn  IOLTA collected  million to fund its very narrowlyconstrued mission As designated by the Supreme Court the funduses the money to provide legal aid to the poor and education andbeneficial services to the public Legal Services of New Jerseyreceives  percent of the funds The New Jersey State BarFoundation receives  percent for educational lay programsrelating to law and justice and other public service programs suchas the High School Mock Trial Competition and numerouspublications The balance of the funds is granted to small entitiesthat provide legal services and assistance to the indigentRA For instance IOLTA grants money to several CourtAppointed Special Advocate Programs CASA for children in EssexMorrisSussex Mercer and AtlanticCape May The CASA program is avolunteer organization of people who assist and advocate for therights of individual children in foster care IOLTA grants go tothe Covenant House Youth Advocacy Program the advocate of legalrights of homeless youths who having reached the age of  are nolonger eligible to be in foster care In   million inIOLTA grants will support these and numerous other crucial programsthat offer priceless services to the poorThe  million raised for IOLTA is not enough Legal Serviceswhich provides civil legal services to the poor the disabled andthe most vulnerable citizens of the state can only represent atbest  percent of the people who are in need of assistance andwho meet the requirements for representation In a legal triagethey must select those most in immediate need The rest of theirapplicants must wait or give upEven the amount of the fund is not guaranteed In the pendingdifficult economic times when the rush to refinance has passedwill these accounts maintain their  billion average dailybalance If interest rates continue to decline or the dailybalances decrease the IOLTA fund will be curtailed With lessfunding for Legal Services what will happen to those so much inneed What will happen to the pro bono requirements already imposedupon attorneys in New JerseyWhat can we as members of the bar who control these accountsdo to protect the IOLTA fund The easy answer is Ask Ask yourbank what interest rate it pays to IOLTA Ask your bank what feesit charges to IOLTA Comparison shop Understand the spread betweenwhat your bank pays the IOLTA fund and what it charges yourclients Yet we only can control our own accountsBetter yet we call upon the New Jersey State Bar Associationand each county bar association to lend a voice to IOLTA The barassociations could consult with the IOLTA directors and thencontact banks to determine which ones are providing the bestreturns with the lowest costs to IOLTA The promise of morebusiness or the loss thereof would have far more impact comingfrom an association than any single law firmAttorneys hold the purse strings Why not turn them into reinsWe can with little effort steer our attorney trust accounts tothose banks that are willing to pay just a little more for theprivilege of receiving our trust deposits
