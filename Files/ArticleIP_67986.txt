DearPrudence                                                      My yearold son and I have always been veryclose Weve been a source of strength for each other ever since my husbanddied eight years ago However a recent humiliating experience now threatensthat close bond One weekend while I believed my son was away with his bestfriend I was trying on some swimsuits for an upcoming vacation I was checkingthem out in the mirror and I like to think that at  I look pretty damngood                                       While naked I wentto get something from the kitchen and who did I see but my son standing thereHis weekend had been cut short and he had let himself into our apartment Withmy hands full I couldnt even cover myself up Fortunately he ran from theroom right away but not before seeing me in all my naked glory Since thenhes hardly spoken to me He doesnt even look at me when he comes home fromschool I want to talk to him about this but what could I say                                       Thalia                        Dear Thal            You say that even hismother has one of these and two of those You werent vamping him after alland both of you made a swift effort to end the scene He wasnt even supposedto be there which you might point out to him The fact that your household hasbeen just the two of you since he was  years old may mean that hes had towrestle with his Oedipal feelings that his littleboy wish for his father to beremoved was granted You might also ask him why he thinks theres been a changein your relationship Try to bring up the uncomfortable encounter and tell himhe is making much too much of it With luck the very act of discussing it willdefuse the situation            Prudie rationally                                             DearPrudence                                                      Im a yearold college student living in amajor city and a few months ago I moved into an apartment building mostlyoccupied by adults Recently I asked a neighbor how I could keep my plantsalive when I went home for three weeks I didnt want to give anyone a key tomy apartment but wanted to know if there was another way She told me that shewould water them and in fact already had a key that the previous resident hadgiven her                                       The neighbor is friendly and seems trustworthyShe asked for a contact number for me in case something happened in thebuildinglike a water leakso I feel that she has good intentions Theproblem is that I dont want any neighbors having a key to my apartment I alsodo not wish to offend her by asking for the key back                                       Should I let thematter slide should I ask the manager to change the locks or should I ask forthe key back                                       Thanks                                       Looking for the Key to Keeping Safe Sorry for the bad pun                        Dear Look            As for wanting someone to water your plants withoutusing a key to get in your only hope is to engage one of those buildingclimbers to crawl in from the outsidebut then that person would stillbe inside your apartment If you are dead set against anyone gaining access inyour absence you might ask someone if he or she would be willing to let youmove your plants to their apartment for the three weeks            As for the neighborhaving your key given to her by the old tenant the woman should have coughedit up the minute you moved in If you decide she is a neighbor you would liketo have your key thats one thing but if you decide she is not the oneorthat no one isby all means ask for it back Tell her its nothing personalbut the setup made by the previous tenant is now moot and youve made otherarrangements There is no reason for you to feel shy about this It is yourapartment and your key            Prudie securely                                             DearPrudie                                        As a writer I feelfor  As a simple matter of course as soon as a manuscript is completed itsauthor should formally register it with The Gummint The copyright to anythingshe writes is hers the moment she writes it paperwork or no but registeringit gives added benefitsincluding a vast escalation of penalties if someoneswipes her work If she sent her one and only one copy of her novel to whatamounts to a total stranger her best course of action would be to go out andtreat herself to a fabulous lunch Then she should go home stand in front ofthe biggest mirror in her house and say to herself I promise never to tellmy hairdresser to make me look like a picture Ive torn out of Peoplemagazine I promise never to buy a secondhand car from a friend or familymember I promise never ever under any circumstances to allow there to be oneand only one copy of my manuscript on the planet                                       Creative in Cambridge                        Dear Create            Your
