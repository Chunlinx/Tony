                                 Requiem for a Liberal            This is my last StrangeBedfellow When I return from vacation Im going to take a break frompolitics and try my hand at a column about the arts To ease the transition Ithought it might be fitting to pay tribute to someone whose career spans thesetwo worlds He is Sidney R Yates the Democratic congressman who represents mybirthdistrict on the North Side of Chicago When Yates retires at the end ofthis congressional term at  he will have served in the House but for onetwoyear interruption since  Leaving with him I fear will be not only achunk of postwar history but much of the enlightenment that remains in thelower chamber            Im farfrom objective on this topic Yates gave me my first paid job as acongressional page many summers ago and the first writing I ever did aboutpolitics was answering constituent mail in his office But my real gratitude isfor what Yates example teaches that politicians arent required to preen andpander or to speak only for the parochial interests of their districts Yateshas held the esteem and affection of the people he has represented for half acentury by thinking about their good in a more elevated way He is a liberalone of the nearly extinct RooseveltTrumanKennedyJohnson variety But inanother way I think of Sidney Yates as one of the only true conservativesaround He has found his mission in preserving what matters in our culture andin standing in the way of attempts to coarsen and reduce it            Up on the Hill a few weeks ago I stopped by his office inthe Rayburn Building for lunch As ever I was greeted by his chief aide MaryBain who is an extraordinary story of liberal longevity in her own right Marycame to Washington to work on the New Deal National Youth Administration in and has been with Yates since  She and the boss were busy sorting years worth of files and packing them up for the Truman Library On the tablewere things they had found a note from Eleanor Roosevelt expressing outrageabout some now obscure postal reorganization bill and a yellowed copy of theChicago SunTimes from July   the day after Adlai Stevensondied            Siftingthrough these relics left Yates in a more wistful mood than usual Though hecan usually be counted on for a bit of patter from Gilbert and Sullivan mostof which he knows by heart he told me he felt it had been too long since hereread Edmond Rostands Cyrano de Bergerac in the classic translation byBrian Hooker He began reciting it for me from memory            I carry my adornments onmy soulI do not dress up like a popinjay But inwardly I keep mydaintiness            The linesapply to no one so well as the congressman from the  th District ofChicago who must be the only politician left in the House who avoids publicityand whose style is to follow the dictates of his conscience without making aspectacle of himself doing so            As Yates recounted over soup and sandwiches hedidnt go into politics to save the world He did it because he was boredworking for his fatherinlaws law firm In  he ran against the ChicagoDemocratic machine for a seat on the City Council and not surprisingly lostRecognizing that the only way in was with the blessing of the regularorganization he got it in  when he was allowed to run for Congress as asacrificial lamb According to the elaborate ethnic spoils system of thosedays the North Side House seat belonged to the Germans But the Germancandidate whod been slated to run decided in the face of a looming Republicansweep that hed like to be postmaster so Yates who is Jewish got his chanceHe ran on a Democratic ticket with Harry Truman for president Stevenson forgovernor and Paul Douglas for senator I was the tail on the dog and we allwon he said            Almost assoon as he was elected Yates attempted selfimmolation by voting against theMcCarran Act which placed McCarthyite restrictions on visitors to the UnitedStates Colleagues told him that if he voted against it hed be a one termcongressman and they were nearly right His opponent in  passed out pinkleaflets asking if the  th District wanted a congressman who votedwith the Communist Party But Yates wrote a thoughtful letter to hisconstituentsthe first of several hundred to comeexplaining why he thoughtthe bill was unconstitutional and eked out a narrow reelection Aftersurviving another close call in  he was regularly returned by lopsidedmargins In the House he continued to get excited about injustices thatbothered hardly anyone else Around the same time he saved the career of HymanRickover the father of the nuclear fleet when Rickover was passed over forpromotion to admiral in part because of antiSemitism in the Navy            Though he had the endorsement of Mayor Richard J DaleyYates was never a machine man In  he had become the leader of the Illinoisdelegation by virtue of seniority and Daley decided it was time for him to runfor the Senate in a kamikaze challenge to the Republican incumbent EverettDirksen Yates lost and a freshman named Daniel Rostenkowski assumed his placeas head of the delegation After a stint working for Stevenson at the USMission to the United Nations Yates returned But with his seniority erasedhe began to narrow his focus to the issues that truly motivated him Israelthe arts and the environment            The yearhe returned to Congress  the national endowments for the arts andhumanities were voted into existence When Yates became chairman of the HouseAppropriations Committees subcommittee on the Interior the national endowmentbudgets fell under his jurisdiction In the s he was known as atoughminded supporter who could be counted on for a meticulous review of howthe endowments were spending their money But after attempts to eliminate thembegan under President Reagan and intensified with the Mapplethorpe fiascoYates career became preoccupied with keeping them alive            He has managed to do so at times through sheerforce of will Other representatives invite Hollywood celebrities to testifybefore their committees Yates invited YoYo Ma to play a Bach suite beforehis soothing the savage breast of the NEAs opponents After Democrats lostthe House the NEA budget was cut in half This year Yates is battling to saveit once more He now leaves that mission to two New Yorkers Louise Slaughtera Democrat and Amo Houghton a patrician Republican Whether his successors inthis role succeed or not I suspect that Yates will one day be betterremembered for another accomplishment the US Holocaust Memorial Museumwhich he and his wife Addie worked for years to bring into existence            As we finished lunch Iasked whether I was right in assuming Yates thought term limits were a badidea To the contrary Jacob he declared Twentyfour terms is enough foranyone
