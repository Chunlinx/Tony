                    Background        In the s Charles Darwins investigation of the        Galapagos finches led to an appreciation of the structural        characteristics that varied and were conserved among the        birds in this landmark comparative study His analysis of        the finches structural features was the foundation for his        theory on the origin and evolution of biological species            Today  years later our understanding of cells        from a molecular perspective in parallel with the        technological advances in nucleic acid sequencing and        computer hardware and software affords us the opportunity        to determine and study the sequences for many genes from a        comparative perspective followed by the computational        analysis cataloging and presentation of the resulting        data on the World Wide Web        In the s Woese and Fox revisited Darwinian        evolution from a molecular sequence and structure        perspective Their two primary objectives were to determine        phylogenetic relationships for all organisms including        those that can only be observed with a microscope using a        single molecular chronometer the ribosomal RNA rRNA and        to predict the correct structure for an RNA molecule given        that the number of possible structure models can be larger        than the number of elemental particles in the universe For        the first objective they rationalized that the origin of        species and the related issue of the phylogenetic        relationships for all organisms are encoded in the        organisms rRNA a molecule that encompasses twothirds of        the mass of the bacterial ribosome ribosomal proteins        comprise the other onethird One of their first and most        significant findings was the discovery of the third kingdom        of life the Archaebacteria later renamed Archaea              Subsequently the analysis of ribosomal RNA produced        the first phylogenetic tree based on the analysis of a        single molecule that included prokaryotes protozoa        fungi plants and animals     These accomplishments        were the foundation for the subsequent revolution in        rRNAbased phylogenetic analysis which has resulted in the        sequencing of more than  S and Slike rRNA and         S and Slike rRNA genes from laboratories trying        to resolve the phylogenetic relationships for organisms        that occupy different sections of the big phylogenetic        tree        The prediction of tRNA structure with a comparative        perspective in the s        and subsequent        validation with tRNA crystal structures            established the foundation for Woese and Fox in the s        to begin predicting S rRNA structure from the analysis of        multiple sequences They realized that all sequences within        the same functional RNA class in this case S rRNA will        form the same secondary and tertiary structure Thus for        all of the possible RNA secondary and tertiary structures        for any one RNA sequence such as for         Escherichia coli S rRNA the correct        structure for this sequence will be similar to the correct        secondary structure for every other S rRNA sequence                    While the first complete S rRNA sequence was        determined for         E coli in      the first        covariationbased structure models were not predicted until        more S rRNA sequences were determined       The        first S rRNA sequence was determined for         E coli in      the first        covariationbased structure models were predicted the        following year once a few more complete S rRNA sequences        were determined       Both of these comparative        structure models were improved as the number of sequences        with different patterns of variation increased and the        covariation algorithms were able to resolve different types        and extents of covariation see below Initially the        alignments of S and S rRNA sequences were analyzed for        the occurrence of GC AU or GU base pairs that occur        within potential helices in the S     and S           rRNAs The S and S rRNA covariationbased structure        models have undergone numerous revisions                 Today with a significantly larger number of        sequences and more advanced covariation algorithms we        search for all positional covariations regardless of the        types of pairings and the proximity of those pairings with        other paired and unpaired nucleotides The net result is a        highly refined secondary and tertiary covariationbased        structure model for S and S rRNA While the majority of        these structure models contain standard GC AU and GU        basepairings arranged into regular secondary structure        helices there were many novel basepairing exchanges          eg UU  CC AA         GG GU  AC         etc  and base pairs that form        tertiary or tertiarylike structural elements Thus the        comparative analysis of the rRNA sequences and structures        has resulted in the prediction of structure and the        identification of structural motifs            Beyond the comparative structure analysis of the three        ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNA several other RNAs have        been studied with this perspective These include the group        I       and II     introns RNase P              telomerase RNA      tmRNA     U RNA            and the SRP RNA     The comparative sequence        analysis paradigm has been successful in determining        structure over this wide range of RNA molecules        Very recently the authenticities of the ribosomal RNA        comparative structure models have been determined Gutell         et al manuscript in preparation         of the secondary and tertiary structure base pairs        predicted with covariation analysis are present in the        crystal structures for the S    and S           ribosomal subunits Thus the underlying premise for        comparative analysis and our implementation of this method        including the algorithms the sequence alignments and the        large collection of comparative structure models with        different structural variations for each of the different        RNA molecules          eg S and S rRNAs have been        validated        The highly refined and accurate analysis of phylogenetic        relationships and RNA structure with comparative analysis        can require very large phylogenetically and structurally        diverse data sets that contain raw and analyzed data that        is organized for further analysis and interpretation With        these requirements for our own analysis and the utility of        this comparative information for the greater scientific        community we have been assembling organizing analyzing        and disseminating this comparative information Initially        a limited amount of sequence and comparative structure        information was available online for our S and Slike            and S and Slike ribosomal RNAs               and the group I introns     In parallel two        other groups have been providing various forms of ribosomal        RNA sequence and structure data the RDPRDP II            and Belgium SS     small subunit     and        large subunit      groups With significant        increases in the amount of sequences available for the RNAs        under study here improved programs for the analysis of        this data and better web presentation software we have        established a new Comparative RNA Web CRW Site        httpwwwrnaicmbutexasedu This resource has been        available to the public since January                     Results and Discussion                   Comparative structure models                      A Current structure models for reference            organisms            The first major category Comparative Structure            Models httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduCSISTRcontains            our most recent S and S rRNA covariationbased            structure models which were adapted from the original            Noller  Woese models S     and S               rRNA and the structure models for S rRNA                tRNA         and the group I    and group            II    introns as determined by others This            collection of RNA structure models was predicted with            covariation analysis as described at the CRW Site            Methods Section            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduMETHODSand in several            publications see below            Briefly covariation analysis a specific            application of comparative analysis as mentioned            earlier searches for helices and base pairs that are            conserved in different sequences that form the same            functionally equivalent molecule              eg tRNA sequences It was            determined very early in this methodology that the            correct helix is the one that contains positions within            a potential helix that vary in composition while            maintaining GC AU and GU base pairs As more            sequences for a given molecule were determined we            developed newer algorithms that searched for positions            in an alignment of homologous sequences that had            similar patterns of variation This latter            implementation of the covariation analysis helped us            refine the secondary and tertiary structure models by            eliminating previously proposed base pairs that are not            underscored with positional covariation and identifying            new secondary and tertiary structure base pairs that do            have positional covariation        Our            newest covariation analysis methods associate            colorcoded confidence ratings with each proposed base            pair see reference structure diagrams and Section A            Nucleotide Frequency Tabular Display for more            details One exception to this is the tRNA analysis            which was initially performed with the Mixy            chisquarebased algorithm     and thus the color            codes are based on that analysis            When implemented properly covariation analysis can            predict RNA structure with extreme accuracy All of the            secondary structure base pairs and a few of the            tertiary structure base pairs predicted with            covariation analysis            are            present in the tRNA crystal structure      The            analysis of fragments of S rRNA    and the group I            intron    resulted in similar levels of success            Most recently the highresolution crystal structures            for the S    and S    ribosomal subunits            have given us the opportunity to evaluate our rRNA            structure models Approximately  of the S and            S rRNA base pairs predicted with covariation analysis            are in these crystal structures Gutell             et al manuscript in            preparation This congruency between the comparative            model and the crystal structure validates the            comparative approach the covariation algorithms the            accuracy of the juxtapositions of sequences in the            alignments and the accuracy of all of the comparative            structure models presented herein and available at the            CRW Site However while nearly all of the base pairs            predicted with comparative analysis are present in the            crystal structure solution some interactions in the            crystal structure which are mostly tertiary            interactions do not have similar patterns of variation            at the positions that interact Gutell             et al manuscript in            preparation Thus covariation analysis is unable to            predict many of the tertiary base pairings in the            crystal structure although it does identify nearly all            of the secondary structure base pairings            Beyond the base pairs predicted with covariation            analysis comparative analysis has been used to predict            some structural motifs that are conserved in structure            although they do not necessarily have similar patterns            of variation at the two paired positions Our analyses            of these motifs are available in the Structure            Motifs and Folding section of our CRW Site            While the secondary structure models for the S            S and S rRNAs group I and II introns and tRNA are            available at the Current Structure Models for            Reference Organisms page our primary focus has been            on the S and S rRNAs Thus some of our subsequent            analysis and interpretation will emphasize only these            two RNAs            Each RNA structure model presented here is based            upon a single reference sequence chosen as the most            representative for that molecule Table  for            example             E coli is the preferred choice            as the reference sequence for rRNA S S and S            based on the early and continued research on the            structure and functions of the ribosome                 Each of the six structure models S S and S rRNA

     the secondary structure diagrams with nucleotides            Figures A B and C reveals our confidence for            each base pair as predicted by covariation analysis            Base pairs with a red identifier  for GC and AU            base pairs small closed circles for GU large open            circles for AG and large closed circles for any other            base pair have the greatest amount of covariation            thus we have the most confidence in these predicted            base pairs Base pairs with a green black grey or            blue identifier have progressively lower covariation            scores and are predicted due to the high percentages of            AU  GC andor GU at these positions The most            current covariationbased             E coli S and S rRNA            secondary structure models are shown in Figures A B            and C Note that the majority of the base pairs in the            S and S rRNA have a red base pair symbol our            highest rating These diagrams are the culmination of            twenty years of comparative analysis Approximately             S and Slike rRNA sequences and  S and            Slike rRNA sequences were collected from all            branches of the phylogenetic tree as shown in Section             Nucleotide Frequency and Conservation Information            and in Table  These sequences have been aligned and            analyzed with several covariation algorithms as            described in more detail in the Predicting RNA            Structure with Comparative Methods section of the CRW            Site httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduMETHODSand in            Section A All of the secondary structure diagrams            from the Current Structure Models for Reference            Organisms page are available in three formats The            first two are standard printing formats PostScript            httpwwwadobecomproductspostscriptmainhtmland            PDF            httpwwwadobecomproductsacrobatadobepdfhtml            The third named bpseq is a simple text format that            contains the sequence one nucleotide per line its            position number and the position number of the pairing            partner or  if that nucleotide is unpaired in the            covariationbased structure model                        Tentative In addition to the S            and S rRNA structure models we have also identified            some base pairs in the S and S rRNAs that have a            lower although significant extent of covariation            These are considered tentative and are shown on            separate S and S rRNA secondary structure diagrams            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduCSISTR These base            pairs and base triples have fewer coordinated changes            or positional covariations andor a higher number of            sequences that do not have the same pattern of            variation present at the other paired position            Consequently we have less confidence in these putative            interactions in contrast with the interactions            predicted in our main structure models            The             Helix Numbering secondary structure            diagrams illustrate our system for uniquely and            unambiguously numbering each helix in a RNA molecule            Based upon the numbering of the reference sequence            each helix is named for the position number at the             end of the  half of the helix For example the first            S rRNA helix which spans             E coli positions  is            named  the helix at positions  is            named  This numbering system is used in the            Nucleotide Frequency Tabular Display tables see            below The             Schematic versions of the reference            structure diagrams replace the nucleotides with a line            traversing the RNA backbone            The             Histogram and             Circular diagram formats            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduCSISTRboth abstract            the global arrangement of the base pairs For the            histogram version Figure D the sequence is            displayed as a line from left  to right  with            the secondary structure base pairs shown in blue above            the sequence line below this line tertiary structure            base pairs and base triples are shown in red and green            respectively The distance from the baseline to the            interaction line is proportional to the distance            between the two interacting positions within the RNA            sequence In contrast in the circular diagram the            sequence is drawn clockwise  to  in a circle            starting at the top Secondary and tertiary basebase            interactions are shown with lines traversing the            circle using the same coloring scheme as in the            histogram diagram The global arrangement and            higherorder organization of the base pairs predicted            with covariation analysis are revealed in part in these            two alternative formats The majority of the base pairs            are clustered into regular secondary structure helices            and the majority of the helices are contained within            the boundaries of another helix forming large            cooperative sets of nested helices The remaining base            pairs form tertiary interactions that either span two            sets of nested helices forming a pseudoknot or are            involved in base triple interactions            In the             Matrix of All Possible            Helices plot            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduCSISTR the same RNA            sequence is extended along the X and Yaxes with all            potential helices that are comprised of at least four            consecutive WatsonCrick GC and AU or GU base            pairs shown below the diagonal line The helices in the            present comparative structure model are shown above            this line The number of potential helices is larger            than the actual number present in the            biologicallyactive structure see CRW Methods            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduMETHODS For example            the             S cerevisiae phenylalanine tRNA            sequence with a length of  nucleotides has             possible helices as defined above only four of these            are in the crystal structure The             E coli S rRNA with             nucleotides nt has nearly  possible helices            only about  of these are in the crystal structure            For the             E coli S rRNA  nt there            are more than  possible helices with            approximately  in the crystal structure The number            of possible secondary structure models is significantly            larger than the number of possible helices due to the            exponential increase in the number of different            combinations of these helices The number of different            tRNA secondary structure models is approximately                there are approximately  and  possible            structure models for S and S rRNA respectively            see CRW Methods            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduMETHODS Covariation            analysis accurately

           structure models            An analysis of the evolution of the            NollerWoeseGutell comparative structure models for            the S and S rRNAs is presented here            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduCSIEVOLUTIONHB            Our objective is to categorize the improvements in            these covariationbased comparative structure models by            tabulating the presence or absence of every proposed            base pair in each version of the S and S rRNA            structure models starting with our first S               and S    rRNA models Every base pair in each of            the structure models was evaluated against the growing            number and diversity of new rRNA sequences Proposed            base pairs were taken out of the structure model when            the number of sequences without either a covariation or            a GC AU or GU base pair was greater than our            allowed minimum threshold the nucleotide frequencies            for those base pairs are available from the Lousy            BasePair tables that are discussed in the next            section New base pairs were proposed when a new            significant covariation was identified with our newer            and more sensitive algorithms that were applied to            larger sequence alignments containing more inherent            variation see CRW Methods            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduMETHODSfor more            detail            Although other comparative structure models and base            pairs were predicted by other labs those interactions            are not included in this analysis of the improvements            in our structure models The four main structure models            for S and S rRNA are very similar to one another            The Brimacombe     and Strasburg                structure models were determined independently of ours            while the De Wachter     models were adapted from            our earlier structure models and have incorporated some            of the newer interactions proposed here            This analysis produced two very large tables with             proposed S rRNA base pairs evaluated against six            versions of the structure model and  S rRNA base            pairs evaluated against five versions of the structure            model Some highlights from these detailed tables are            captured in summary tables Tables aand b and            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduCSIEVOLUTION that            compare the numbers of sequences and base pairs            predicted correctly and incorrectly for each of the            major versions of the S and S rRNA structure            models For this analysis the current structure model            is considered to be the correct structure thus values            for comparisons are referenced to the numbers of            sequences and base pairs in the current structure model             base pairs and approximately  sequences for            S rRNA and  base pairs and approximately             sequences for S rRNA Three sets of S and S rRNA            secondary structure diagrams were developed to reveal            the improvements between the current model and earlier            versions  changes since the  published structure            models  changes since  S rRNA or  S            rRNA and  all previously proposed base pairs that            are not in the most current structure models            HB            An analysis of these tables reveals several major            conclusions from the evolution of the S and S rRNA            covariationbased structure models First            approximately  of the S and nearly  of the S            rRNA base pairs predicted in the initial structure            models appear in the current structure models The            accuracy of these early models produced from the            analysis of only two wellchosen sequences is            remarkable Second the accuracy number of secondary            and tertiary structure interactions and complexity of            the structure models increase as the number and            diversity of sequences increase and the covariation            algorithms are improved As well some pairs predicted            in the earlier structure models were removed from            subsequent models due to the large number of exceptions            to the positional covariation at the two paired            positions Third the majority of the tertiary            interactions were proposed in the last few versions of            the structure models                                C RNA structure definitions            The RNA structure models presented here are composed            of several different basic building blocks or motifs            that are described and illustrated at our RNA Structure            Definitions page            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduCSIDEFSHC The            nucleotides in a comparative structure model can be            either base paired or unpaired Base paired nucleotides            can be part of either a secondary structure helix two            or more consecutive antiparallel and nested base            pairs or a tertiary interaction which is a more            heterogeneous collection of base pair interactions            These include any noncanonical base pair not a GC            AU or GU             eg UU lone or single base            pairs when both positions in a base pair are not            flanked by two nucleotides that are base paired to one            another base pairs in a pseudoknot arrangement and            base triples a single nucleotide interacting with a            base pair Each of these base pair categories has a            unique color code in the illustrations on the RNA            Structure Definitions page which provides multiple            examples of each category from the S and S rRNA            structure models In contrast to the nucleotides that            are base paired nucleotides can also be unpaired in            the comparative structure models Within this category            they can be within a hairpin loop nucleotides capping            the end of a helix internal loop nucleotides within            two helices or in a multistem loop nucleotides            within three or more helices                                     Nucleotide frequency and conservation          information                      A Nucleotide frequency tabular display            The nucleotide frequency tables appear in two            general presentation modes In the traditional table            the nucleotide types are displayed in the columns            while their frequencies are shown for each alignment in            the rows The nucleotide frequencies were determined            for single positions base pairs and base triples for            a subset of the RNAs in the CRW Site collection            detailed in Table  Single nucleotide frequencies            are available for all individual positions based upon            the reference sequence for every RNA in this            collection Base pair frequencies are presented for a            all base pairs in the current covariationbased            structure models b tentative base pairs predicted            with covariation analysis and c base pairs previously            proposed with comparative analysis that are not            included in our current structure models due to a lack            of comparative support from the analysis with our best            covariation methods on our current alignments named            Lousy base pairs Base triples are interactions            between a base pair and a third unpaired nucleotide            base triple frequencies are provided for a base            triples in the current covariationbased structure            models and b tentative base triples predicted with            covariation analysis            For each of these frequency tables the percentages            of each of the nucleotides are determined for multiple            alignments where the most similar sequences are            organized into the same alignment For the three rRNAs            the alignments are partitioned by their phylogenetic            relationships There is an alignment for the            nuclearencoded rRNA for each of the three primary            lines of descent  Archaea  Bacteria and             Eucarya     each of the two Eucarya organelles            no alignments yet for the S rRNA  Chloroplasts            and  Mitochondria and two larger alignments that            include all of the  nuclearencoded rRNA sequences            for the Archaea Bacteria and Eucarya and  these            three phylogenetic groups and the two Eucarya            organelles Table             For the tRNA and group I and II intron sequences            the most similar sequences are not necessarily from            similar phylogenetic groups Instead the sequences            that are most similar with one another are members of            the same functional andor structural class The tRNA            sequences are grouped according to the amino acids that            are bound to the tRNA Currently only the type I tRNAs               are included here the tRNAs are collected in             functional subgroup alignments and one total type I            alignment The group I and II intron alignments are            based on the structural classifications determined by            Michel group I    and group II     and Suh            group IE     The group I introns are split into            seven alignments A B Cl C D E and unknown            The group II introns are divided into the two major            subgroups IIA and IIB Table             For the standard nucleotide frequency tables            Highlight A HA the left frame in the main frame            window List Frame contains the position numbers for            the three types of tables single bases base pairs            and base triples Clicking on a position base pair or            base triple number will bring the detailed nucleotide            occurrence and frequency information to the main window            Data Frame HA The collective scoring data            HA used to predict the base pair is obtained            where available by clicking the Collective Score            link on the righthand side of the base pair frequency            table            As discussed in Section A we have established a            confidence rating for the base pairs predicted with the            covariation analysis a detailed explanation of the            covariation analysis methods and the confidence rating            system will be available in the Methods section of the            CRW Site httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduMETHODS The            extent of base pair types and their mutual exchange            pattern              eg AU  GC is            indicative of the covariation score This value            increases to the maximum score as the percentage and            the amount of pure covariations simultaneous changes            at both positions increase in parallel with a decrease            in the number of single uncompensated changes and the            number of times these coordinated variations occur            during the evolution of that RNA for the rRNAs the            number of times this covariation occurs in the            phylogenetic tree increases These scores are            proportional to our confidence in the accuracy of the            predicted base pair Red our highest confidence            rating denotes base pairs with the highest scores and            with at least a few phylogenetic events changes at            both paired positions during the evolution of that base            pair The colors green black and grey denote base            pairs with a GC AU andor GU in at least  of            the sequences and within a potential helix that            contains at least one red base pair Base pairs with a            green confidence rating have a good covariation score            although not as high as or with the confidence of a            red base pair Black base pairs have a lower            covariation score while grey base pairs are invariant            or nearly so in  of the sequences Finally blue            base pairs do not satisfy these constraints            nevertheless we are confident of their authenticity            due to a significant number of covariations within the            sequences in a subset of the phylogenetic tree or are            an invariant GC or AU pairings in close proximity to            the end of a helix            The covariation score for each base pair is            determined independently for each alignment              eg Three DomainTwo Organelle            Three Domain Archaea             etc  The collective score for            each base pair is equivalent to the highest ranking            score for any one of the alignments For example we            have assigned our highest confidence rating to the             base pair in S rRNA Figure C HA Note            that the entry for the  base pair HA in the            list of base pairs in the left frame is red in the C            or confidence column For this base pair only the T            Three Phylogenetic DomainsTwo Organelle alignment            has a significant covariation score HA thus only            the T alignment name is red Of the nearly             sequences in the T alignment  of the sequences have            a GU base pair AU base pair at  UA at             and less than  of the sequences have a GC CG UU            or GG base pair HA The collective scoring data            HA reveals that there are  phylogenetic events            PE for the T alignment while the CC score is             greater than the minimum value for this RNA and            this alignment a more complete explanation of the            collective scoring method is available at CRW Methods            httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduMETHODS Note that the             and  base pairs are also both red            Here six of the seven alignments have significant            extents of covariation for both base pairs and are thus            red Each of the red alignments have at least two base            pair types              eg GC and AU that occur            frequently at least three phylogenetic events and            CC scores                                  B Nucleotide frequency mapped onto a            phylogenetic tree            The second presentation mode maps the same            nucleotide frequency data in the previous section onto            the NCBI phylogenetic tree            httpwwwncbinlmnihgovTaxonomytaxonomyhomehtml                see Materials and Methods for details This            display allows the user to navigate through the            phylogenetic tree and observe the nucleotide            frequencies for any node and all of the branches off of            that node The number of nucleotide substitutions on            each branch are displayed with the number of mutual            changes displayed for the base pairs and base triples            Currently only the S and S rRNA nucleotide            frequencies available in the first tabular presentation            format are mapped onto the phylogenetic tree see Table             As shown in CRW Section B HB the left frame            in the main frame window contains the position numbers            for the three types of data single bases base pairs            and base triples Clicking on a position base pair or            base triple number will initially reveal in the larger            section of the main frame the root of the phylogenetic            tree with the frequencies for the selected single            base base pair or base triple The presentation for            single bases HB reveals the nucleotides and their            frequencies for all sequences at the root level            followed by the nucleotides and their frequencies for            the Archaea Bacteria and Eukaryota nuclear            mitochondrial and chloroplast Nucleotides that occur            in less than      and  of the            sequences can be eliminated from the screen by changing            the green percentage limit selection at the top of            the main frame The number of phylogenetic levels            displayed on the screen can also be modulated with the            yellow phylogenetic level button at the top of the main            frame Highlight B displays only one level of the            phylogenetic tree from the point of origin which is            the root level for this example In contrast Highlight            B displays four levels from the root The number of            single nucleotide changes on each branch of the            phylogenetic tree is shown at the end of the row For            single bases this number is in black For base pairs            there are two numbers The orange color refers to the            number of changes at one of the two positions while            the pink color refers to the number of mutual changes            or covariations that has occurred on that branch of            the tree HB For example for the S rRNA base            pair  there are  mutual and  single changes            in total for the Archaea Bacteria Eucarya nuclear            mitochondrial and chloroplast Within the Archaea            there are six mutual and five single changes Five of            these mutual changes are within the Euryarchaeota and            four of these are within the Halobacteriales HB            The base pair types that result from a mutual change            or strict covariation are marked with an asterisk                                            C Secondary structure conservation            diagrams            Conservation secondary structure diagrams summarize            nucleotide frequency data by revealing the nucleotides            present at the most conserved positions and the            positions that are present in nearly all sequences in            the analyzed data set The conservation information is            overlaid on a secondary structure diagram from a            sequence that is representative of the chosen group              eg E coli for the gamma            subdivision of the Proteobacteria or             S cerevisiae for the Fungi            HC All positions that are present in less than             of the sequences studied are considered variable            hidden from view and replaced by arcs These regions            are labeled to show the minimum and maximum numbers of            nucleotides present in that region in the group under            study              eg  indicates that all            sequences in the group contain a minimum of zero            nucleotides but not more than  nucleotides in a            particular variable region The remaining positions            which are present in at least  of the sequences are            separated into four groups HC  those which are            conserved in  of the sequences in the group            shown with red uppercase letters indicating the            conserved nucleotide  those which are conserved in             of the sequences in the group shown with red            lowercase letters indicating the conserved            nucleotide  those which are conserved in  of            the sequences in the group shown with large closed            circles and  those which are conserved in less than             of the sequences in the group shown with small            open circles            Insertions relative to the reference sequence are            identified with a blue line to the nucleotides between            which the insertion occurs and text in small blue font            denoting the maximum number of nucleotides that are            inserted and the percentage of the sequences with any            length insertion at that place in the conservation            secondary structure diagram HC All insertions            greater than five nucleotides are tabulated in            addition to insertions of one to four nucleotides that            occur in more than  of the sequences analyzed for            that conservation diagram Each diagram contains the            full NCBI phylogenetic classification            httpwwwncbinlmnihgovTaxonomytaxonomyhomehtmlfor

    two Eucarya organelles chloroplasts and mitochondria             the three major phylogenetic groups  the            Archaea  the Bacteria  the Eucarya nuclear            encoded  the chloroplasts and  the            mitochondria Longer term our goal is to generate rRNA            conservation diagrams for all branches of the            phylogenetic tree that contain a significant number of            sequences Toward this end we have generated S S            and S rRNA conservation diagrams for many of the            major phylogenetic groups within the Bacterial lineage                         eg Firmicutes and            Proteobacteria We will also be generating            conservation diagrams for the group I and II            introns            The CRW Site conservation diagram interface HC            provides both the conservation diagrams in PostScript            and PDF formats and useful auxiliary information The            display is sorted phylogenetically with each row of            the table containing all available conservation            information for the rRNA sequences in that phylogenetic            group For each of the three rRNA molecules S S            and S three items are available  the reference            structure diagram upon which the conservation            information is overlaid  the conservation diagram            itself and  the number of sequences summarized in            the conservation diagram which links to a            webformatted list of those sequences The lists for            each sequence contain  organism name NCBI

consult the CRW RDBMS see            below An equivalent presentation for intron            conservation data is under development                                     Sequence and structure data                      Structurebased alignments and phylogenetic            analysis of RNA structure            Analysis of the patterns of sequence conservation            and variation present in RNA sequence alignments can            reveal phylogenetic relationships and be utilized to            predict RNA structure The accuracy of the phylogenetic            tree and the predicted RNA structure is directly            dependent on the proper juxtapositioning of the            sequences in the alignment These alignments are an            attempt to approximate the best juxtapositioning of            sequences that represent similar placement of            nucleotides in their threedimensional structure For            sequences that are very similar the proper            juxtapositioning or alignment of sequences can be            achieved simply by aligning the obviously similar or            identical subsequences with one another However when            there is a significant amount of variation between the            sequences it is not possible to align sequences            accurately or with confidence based on sequence            information alone For these situations we can            juxtapose those sequences that form the same secondary            and tertiary structure by aligning the positions that            form the same components of the similar structure            elements              eg align the positions that            form the base of the helix the hairpin loop             etc  Given the accurate            prediction of the S and S rRNA secondary structures            from the analysis of the alignments we assembled we            are now even more confident in the accuracy of the            positioning of the sequence positions in our            alignments and the process we utilize to build            them                                Aligning new sequences            At this stage in our development of the sequence            alignments there are wellestablished and distinct            patterns of sequence conservation and variation From            the base of the phylogenetic tree we observe regions            that are conserved in all of the rRNA sequences that            span the three phylogenetic domains and the two            eucaryotic organelles the chloroplast and            mitochondria Other regions of the rRNA are conserved            within the three phylogenetic domains although variable            in the mitochondria As we proceed into the            phylogenetic tree we observe positions that are            conserved within one phylogenetic group and different            at the same level in the other phylogenetic groups For            example Bacterial rRNAs have positions that are            conserved within all members of their group but            different from the Archaea and the Eucarya            nuclearencoded These types of patterns of            conservation and variation transcend all levels of the            phylogenetic tree and result in features in the rRNA            sequences and structures that are characteristic for            each of the phylogenetic groups at each level of the            phylogenetic tree              eg level one Bacterial            Archaea Eucarya level two Crenarchaeota            Euryarchaeota in the Archaea level three gamma            alpha beta and deltaepsilon subdivisions in the            Proteobacteria Carl Woese likened the different rates            of evolution at the positions in the rRNA to the hands            on a clock     The highly variable regions are            associated with the second hand these can change many            times for each single change that occurs in the regions            associated with the minute hand Accordingly the            minute hand regions change many times for each single            change in the hour hand regions of the rRNAs In            addition to the different rates of evolution many of            the positions in the rRNA are dependent on one another            The simplest of the dependencies positional            covariation is the basis for the prediction of the            same RNA structure from similar RNA sequences see            Section A Covariation Analysis            We utilize these underlying dynamics in the            evolution and positional dependency of the RNA to            facilitate the alignment and structural analysis of the            RNA sequences Our current RNA data sets contain a very            large and diverse set of sequences that represent all            sections of the major phylogenetic branches on the tree            of life This data collection also contains many            structural variations in addition to their conserved            sequence and structure core The majority of the new            RNA sequences are very similar to at least one sequence            that has already been aligned for maximum sequence and            structure similarity thus these sequences are            relatively simple to align However some of the new            sequences contain subsequences that cannot be aligned            with any of the previously aligned sequences due to            the excessive variation in these hypervariable regions            For these sequences the majority of the sequence can            be readily aligned with the more conserved elements            followed by a manual visual analysis of the            hypervariable regions To align these hypervariable            regions with more confidence we usually need several            more sequences with significant similarity in these            regions that will allow us to identify positional            covariation and subsequently to predict a new            structural element Thus at this stage in the            development of the alignments the most conserved            regions              ie hour hand regions and            semiconserved regions              ie minute hand regions have            been aligned with high confidence The second and            subsecond              ie tenth and hundredth of a            second hand regions have been aligned for many of the            sequences on the branches at the ends on the            phylogenetic tree However regions of the sequences            continue to challenge us For example the  and             regions              E coli numbering contain an            excessive amount of variation in the Eucarya            nuclearencoded Slike rRNAs These two regions could            not be well aligned and we could not predict a common            structure with comparative analysis with ten Eucaryotic            sequences in  see Figures  in                However once a larger number of related Eucaryotic            Slike rRNA sequences was determined we reanalyzed            these two regions and were able to align those regions            to other related organisms              eg S cerevisiae with             Schizosaccharomyces pombe            Cryptococcus neoformans Pneumocystis carinii Candida            albicans and             Mucor racemosus  and predict a            secondary structure that is common for all of these            rRNAs see Figures and  in     While the            secondary structures for the fungal Slike rRNAs are            determined in these regions the animal rRNAs were only            partially solved We still need to determine a common            secondary structure for the large variablesized            insertions in the animal rRNAs and this will require            even more animal Slike rRNA sequences from organisms            that are very closely related to the organisms for            which we currently have sequences                                A large sampling of secondary structure            diagrams            We have generated secondary structure diagrams for            sequences that represent the major phylogenetic groups            and for those sequences that reveal the major forms of            sequence and structure conservation and variation New            secondary structure diagrams are templated from an            existing secondary structure diagram and the alignment            of these two sequences the sequence for the new            structure diagram and the sequence for the structure            that has been templated The nucleotides in the new            sequence replace the templated sequence when they are            in the same position in the alignment while positions            in the new sequence that are not juxtaposed with a            nucleotide in the templated sequence are initially left            unstructured These nucleotides are then placed            interactively into their correct location in the            structure diagram with the program XRNA Weiser             Noller University of California Santa Cruz and            basepaired when there is comparative support for that            pairing in the alignment otherwise they are left            unpaired            The process of generating these secondary structure            diagrams occurs in parallel with the development of the            sequence alignments In some cases the generation of a            structure diagram helps us identify problems with the            sequence or its alignment For example anomalies in            structural elements in the new structure diagram that            had strong comparative support in the other sequences            could be the result of a bad sequence or due to the            misalignment of sequences in the helix region In other            cases the new structure diagram reveals a possible            helix in a variable region that was weakly predicted            with comparative analysis However a reinspection of            a few related structure diagrams revealed another            potential helix in this region that was then            substantiated from an analysis of the corresponding            region of the alignment Thus the process of            generating additional secondary structure diagrams            improves the sequence alignments and the predicted            structures in addition to the original purpose for            these diagrams to reveal the breadth of sequence            conservation and variation for any one RNA type            Our goals for the Sequence and Structure Data            section of the CRW Site are to            A Align all rRNA group I and II intron sequences            that are greater than  complete and are available at            GenBank            B Generate rRNA and group III intron secondary            structure diagrams for organisms that are            representative of a phylogenetic group or            representative of a type of RNA structural element The            generation of S S and S rRNAs secondary            structures from genomic sequences generally has higher            priority over other rRNA sequences            C Enter pertinent information for each sequence and            structure into our relational database management            system This computer system organizes all of our RNA            sequence and structure entries

see Section  Data Access Systems for more            details            Due in part to the technological improvements in the            determination of nucleic acid sequence information the            number of ribosomal RNA and group I and II intron            sequences has increased significantly within the past             years As of December  the approximate numbers            of complete or nearly complete sequences and secondary            structure diagrams for each of these RNAs for the major            phylogenetic groups and structural categories are shown            in Highlight A At this time the actual number of            sequences that are both greater than  complete and            available at GenBank is greater than the number in our            CRW RDBMS            The sequences alignments and secondary structure            diagrams are available from several different web            pages which are described below in Sections AD and            AB                                A Index of available sequences and            structures            The top section of the Index of Available Sequences            and Structures page HA reveals the numbers of            available sequences for the Archaea Bacteria and            Eucarya nuclear mitochondrial and chloroplast groups            that are at least  complete and structure diagrams            for the S S and S rRNAs and group I and group II            introns The remainder of the index page contains the            numbers of sequences and structures for more expanded            lists for each of those five phylogeneticcell location            groups For example the Archaea are expanded to the            Crenarchaeota Euryarchaeota Korarchaeota and            unclassified Archaea These counts are updated            dynamically when the information in our relational            database management system is revised The numbers of            sequences and structures are links that open the RDBMS            standard output view see below for details for the            selected target set Secondary structure diagrams are            available in PostScript PDF and BPSEQ see above            formats from the structure links The organism names in            the output from these links are sorted alphabetically            The number of entries per output page is selectable                or

December  our data collection contains             rRNA S S and S and intron group I II            and other sequences The ribosomal RNAs comprise             of this total and S rRNA represents  of the rRNA            total the remainder is split between the S and S            rRNAs Intron sequences comprise  of our total            collection with approximately twice as many group I            introns than group II introns Of the  secondary            structure diagrams the majority are for the S             and S  rRNAs At this time tRNA records are not            maintained in our

into a compressed            tar file which can be uncompressed with appropriate            software on Macintosh Windows and Unix computer            platforms Note due to a limitation in the web server            software it is currently not possible to reliably            download more than  structures at one time This            limitation can be avoided by subdividing large

in the analyses presented at the CRW Site Sequence            alignments are available in GenBank and AE Macke            formats Table  These alignments will be updated            periodically when the number of new sequences is            significant Newer alignments might also contain            refinements in the alignments of the sequences For            each alignment there is a corresponding list of            sequences their phylogenetic placement and other            information about the sequences see conservation list            of sequences for conservation diagrams At present            only the rRNA alignments are available the group I and            group II intron alignments will be made available in            June                                 E rRNA Introns            The introns that occur in S and S rRNAs are            organized into four preconfigured online tables These            tables disseminate the intron information and emphasize

in rRNA Introns Table B HE allow            for a natural dissemination of the introns that occur            at each rRNA site For example of the  introns as            of December  at position  in S rRNA  of            them are in the IC subgroup HE these introns            range from  nucleotides in length all occur in            the nucleus and are distributed into four distinct

for details and  the expected            number of introns for each of the observed number of            introns per rRNA site            The highlights from rRNA Introns Table  are  As            of December  there are  publicly available            introns that occur in the rRNAs with  in the S            rRNA and  in S rRNA These introns are            distributed over  different positions  in the S            rRNA and  in S rRNA  Although S rRNA is            approximately half the length of S rRNA there are            more than three times as many introns in S rRNA            However this bias is due at least in part to the            more prevalent sampling of S and Slike rRNAs for            introns  The sampling of introns at the intron            positions is not evenly distributed               introns per position for a random sampling Instead            nearly   of the intron positions contain a            single intron and   of the intron positions            contain ten or less introns In contrast              of the introns are located at  of the            intron positions and the three intron positions with            the most introns   and  in S rRNA            contain  or   of the rRNA introns             rRNA Introns Table D compares the observed            distribution of rRNA introns with the Poisson            distribution for the observed number of introns The            Poisson distribution             Px              e              x             x  where  is the mean            frequency of introns for positions in a particular exon            and             x is the target number of introns            present at a particular position allows the            calculation of expected numbers of positions containing            a particular number of introns Based upon the observed            raw numbers of introns in the S and S rRNAs we            expect to see no positions in S rRNA containing more            than five introns and no positions in S rRNA            containing more than three introns However            thirtyfive rRNA positions fall into one of those two            categories We also see both more positions without            introns and fewer positions containing only one or two            introns than expected This observed distribution of            rRNA introns among the available insertion positions is            extremely unlikely to occur by chance  While a            single intron type occurs at the majority of the intron            positions several positions have more than one intron            type A few of the positions that deserve special            attention have IC and IE introns at the same position            S rRNA positions  and  and S rRNA position             The S rRNA position  has several examples            each of IC IIB and I introns                                E rRNA Introns Table  Intron Type            The introns are organized by intron type as defined

phylogenetic groups for each            intron type are tabulated The highlights of this table            are  Of the  known rRNA introns   are            group I   are group II introns and the            remaining   are unclassified see below While            only  of the rRNA introns are group II              of the nonrRNA introns are group II In            addition to the group II introns nearly all of the IC            introns do not occur in rRNAs  The majority of the            rRNA group I introns    fall into one of            three subgroups I  introns IC  introns            and IE  introns  As noted earlier there are            three times as many S rRNA group I introns than S            rRNA group I introns  vs   Among the three            cellular organelles in eucaryotes  introns             occur in the nucleus   in the mitochondria            and   in the chloroplasts  The subgroups IC            IC and IE are only present in the nucleus while the            IA IB IC ID and II subgroups occur almost            exclusively in chloroplasts andor mitochondria            The  introns described in rRNA Introns Table  as            Unclassified merit special attention All of these            introns do not fall into either the group I and group            II categories however two notable groups of introns            are included within the Unclassified category The            first is a series of  introns occurring in Archaeal            rRNAs the Archaeal introns Thirtyone of the known            Archaeal introns are found in S rRNA and the            remaining twelve are from S rRNA exons The Archaeal            introns range in length from  to  nucleotides            with an average length of  nucleotides The second            group contains  spliceosomal introns found in fungal            rRNAs  spliceosomal introns are from S rRNA and             are from S rRNA the lengths of these introns range            from  to  nucleotides A future version of this            database will include both of these groups as separate            distinct entries Both the Archaeal and splicesomal            introns occur only in nuclear rRNA genes and tend to            occur at unique sites the lone exception is the            spliceosomal intron from             Dibaeis baeomyces nuclear S            rRNA position  a position where a group IIB intron            occurs in mitochondrial             Marchantia polymorpha rRNA The            Unclassified group contains  introns that do not fall            into any of the four previously discussed categories            group I group II Archaeal or spliceosomal            including all four mitochondrial introns in this            group            rRNA Introns Table  expands the presentation by            providing links to twenty additional tables HE            each of which provides expanded information about a            specific intron type The organism name exon intron            position cell location and complete phylogeny are            accessible for each intron from these tables These            online tables are dynamically updated daily as            information about new introns is made available                                E rRNA Introns Table  Phylogenetic            Distribution            The distribution of introns on the phylogenetic tree            is tabulated in rRNA Introns Table A HE and B            HE rRNA Introns Table A reveals the ratio of            the number of rRNA introns per rRNA gene for the            nuclear chloroplast and mitochondrial encoded RNAs            for the major phylogenetic groups The most noteworthy            distributions are  The majority  of the rRNA            introns occur in Eucarya followed by the Archaea and            the Bacteria  Only one rRNA intron has been            documented in the Bacteria due to the large number of            rRNA gene sequences that have been determined the            ratio of rRNA introns per rRNA gene is essentially zero            for the bacteria  The frequency of introns in            Archaea rRNAs is higher with  examples documented as            of December  Within the Archaea there is a higher            ratio of rRNA introns in the Desulfurococcales and            Thermoproteales subbranches in the Crenarchaeota            branch  For the three primary phylogenetic groups            the highest ratio of rRNA introns per rRNA gene is for            the Eucarya and for the phylogenetic groups within the            Eucarya that have significant numbers of rRNA            sequences the ratio is highest in the fungi Here the            ratios of rRNA introns per rRNA gene are similar            between the nucleus and mitochondria  for the            nucleus  for the mitochondria A significant            number of rRNA introns occurs in the plants with            similar ratios of rRNA intronrRNA gene for the            nucleus chloroplast and mitochondria  for the            nucleus  for the chloroplast and  for the            mitochondria In sharp contrast with the fungi and            plants only one intron has been documented in an            animal rRNA occurring within the             Calliphora vicina nuclearencoded            Slike rRNA GenBank accession number K            Each of the two special Unclassified rRNA intron            groups has a specific phylogenetic bias Archaeal rRNA            introns which have unique sequence and structural            characteristics     have not yet been observed            within the Euryarchaeota or Korarchaeota in fact no            nonArchaeal introns have been found in Archaea rRNAs            to date Splicesomal rRNA introns have only been            reported in  different genera in the Ascomycota                rRNA Introns Table A also presents the numbers of            complete or nearly so rRNA sequences in the same            phylogenetic groups in order to address the question of            sampling bias Two important caveats to this data must            be considered First the numbers of rRNA sequences are            an underestimate since many rRNA introns are published            with only short flanking exon sequences and do not meet            the  completeness criterion for inclusion in this            rRNA sequence count The second caveat is that many            rRNA sequences contain multiple introns see rRNA            Introns Table  and related discussion below for more            information Of the  phylogenetic groupcell            location combinations shown in rRNA Introns Table             that may contain rRNA introns   have a            intronrRNA sequence ratio greater than  indicating            a bias toward introns within those groups Introns are            comparatively rare within the   groups that have            a ratio below  ten of these  groups contain no            known rRNA introns Ten  of the groups have            intermediate ratios between  and             A more detailed phylogenetic distribution is            available in rRNA Introns Table B HE The first

number of introns            per rRNA gene HE While more than  of the            documented rRNA genes do not have an intron  S            and  S rRNAs have at least one intron            Approximately   of these genes have a single            intron   have two introns   have            three   have four   have five two            rRNA genes have   or  introns and one rRNA gene            has  introns            To determine the amount of bias in the distribution            of introns among their exon sequences the Poisson            distribution here  is the mean frequency of introns            for a particular exon and             x is the target number of introns            per rRNA gene has been used to calculate the number of            rRNA sequences expected to contain a given number of            introns rRNA Introns Table  Based upon this data            no rRNA sequences are expected to contain four or more            introns in fact we see  sequences that contain            these large numbers of introns The observed numbers of            sequences exceed the expected values for all but one            category fewer rRNAs contain only one intron than            expected            The two molecules S and S rRNA show a            differing trend with respect to cell location for those            sequences containing large numbers of introns In S            rRNA only nuclear genes ten have been observed to            contain five or more introns indeed of the  genes            containing three or more introns only two are not            nuclear both of these are mitochondrial In S rRNA            the trend is both opposite and weaker of the thirteen            rRNA sequences containing four or more introns five            are nuclear containing five introns with four            chloroplast and four mitochondrial genes comprising the            remaining eight sequences            rRNA Introns Table  provides access to seventeen            additional tables HE which each present the            complete information for every intron within a            particular class              eg S rRNA genes containing            two introns grouped by their exons As with the other            online tables this information will be updated daily            to reflect new intron sequences that are added to this            database            The final components of the rRNA Introns page are            S and S rRNA secondary structure diagrams that show            the locations for all of the known rRNA introns            HE The information collected here on the rRNA            Introns page is the basis for two detailed analyses            that will be published elsewhere  the spatial            distribution of introns on the three dimensional            structure of the S and S rRNA Jackson             et al manuscript in            preparation and  the statistical analysis of the            distribution of introns on the

      introns and all other introns that occur in the            ribosomal RNA The Intron Distribution Data page            contains three tables that compare intron types            phylogeny exon and cell location            Intron Distribution Table  maps Intron Type vs            Phylogeny and Cell Location HF Group I and            II intron data are highlighted with yellow and blue            backgrounds respectively The phylogenetic divisions            are also split into the three possible cellular            locations nuclear chloroplast and mitochondria A            few of the highlights are             the Eukaryota contain the majority                 of the introns in the CRW RDBMS  The Archaea            have  introns that have unique characteristics and            are called Archaeal introns  Group I introns are            present in eukaryotes nuclear chloroplast and            mitochondrialencoded genes and in Bacteria Group II            introns have only been observed in Bacteria and in            Eukaryotic chloroplast and mitochondrial genes            Intron Distribution Table  shows Intron Type vs            Exon and Cell Location HF Again group I            and II intron data are highlighted with yellow and blue            backgrounds respectively In this table the exon            types are split into the three possible cellular            locations nuclear chloroplast and mitochondria As            of December  the most obvious trend is that the            exons with the most Group I introns are S rRNA             leucine tRNA  S rRNA  ribosomal protein            S  and ribosomal protein L             Intron Distribution Table  compartmentalizes the            intron data by Phylogeny and Exon and Cell            Location HF In this table color is used to            highlight the three phylogenetic domains Archaea in            yellow Bacteria in blue and Eukaryota in green As            in Intron Distribution Table  the exon types are            split into the three possible cellular locations            nuclear chloroplast and mitochondria            Each of these three tables is dynamically created            from a specific series of RDBMS queries on a daily            basis As of December  links connecting to the            specific RDBMS results are not available                                     Data access systems                      A RDBMS Standard            The Standard interface is the most fundamental of            our interfaces to the CRW RDBMS information While the            restricted specialized interface to the RDBMS            information in Section A requires minimal instruction            to use the standard interface with its ability to            cull out all arrangements of information from the            different fields with sophisticated search queries and            output field sortings requires a quick lesson for its            operation The selection process has three stages             selection of attribute fields to display             determination of values for the search and             adjustment of the output field sort order            A detailed explanation for each of the attributes is            available from the links to the attribute names This            information is shown in the right frame Additional            examples of this system are available online            Step  At the onset the user selects the fields to            be displayed on the screen and then clicks the Go            button While the user can select the individual fields                         eg Organism or Phylogeny            for most applications the QrRNA query rRNA            Qintron query intron or All options will            automatically click the appropriate fields that are            most important for searching for ribosomal RNA or group            I and II intron entries            Step  Select values for the fields or attributes            The acceptable values for the attributes in our RDBMS            system are shown on the main frame of the query page            for list and buttondriven fields or for text input            fields can be determined with the V values button            on the right side of the main frame the results are            displayed in the right frame see Figure and            HA             The values for cellular location are Chl            chloroplast Cya cyanelle Mit mitochondria Nuc            nuclear and Vir viral each can be selected by            simply checking the box to the left of its name             The values for the attributes RNA Type ORF open            reading frame Secondary Structures entries            withwithout secondary structure diagrams            ResultsPage and Color Display are also displayed on            the main frame and can be selected by clicking the            appropriate box or button            The values for other attributes such as RNA Class            Sequence Length and Exon can be determined by            selecting one or more of the values in the scroll box            The values for these attributes can also be found by            clicking the V button associated with each attribute            For example clicking on the Exon V button will            reveal in the right frame all of the exons that are            contained in our database The same exons are present            in the scroll box             The values displayed for any one attribute are            dependent on the settings of the other attributes For            example when only rRNA is selected for the RNA Type            then there are no values for Exon All of the            possible exon values are displayed when Intron is the            selected RNA Type while only a subset of the            possible exon values are shown when Mit mitochondria            is the selected Cell Location Note no selection for            an attribute signifies to this system that all of the            values are possible            The values present in our database for the            attributes Organism Phylogeny except for the            first level  Archaea Bacteria and Eukaryota  that            can be selected from the main frame Common Name            except for the first level Animals            FungiPlants Protists Accession Number            Intron Position and Comment can only be observed            in the right frame after clicking the V button             The values selected with the mouse in the right            frame will appear in the appropriate attribute            field             The values for each attribute are dependent on the            settings for the other attributes For example if            there are many values for the Organism field            selecting Archaea in the Phylogeny field will reduce            the number of names in the Organism field to just            those that are in this phylogenetic group             The number of possible values for an attribute can            also be constrained by entering only part of a value in            the field For example typing Esch in the Organism            field will output several organism names that contain            Escherichia when the V button is clicked Typing            coli in this field will list all organism names that            contain coli as either part of a name or a complete            word             Note that the system is case sensitive for all            fields except Common Name The text esch in the            same Organism field will not output Escherichia in            the right frame            The Phylogeny field with the values frame on the            right was developed to allow the user to navigate            through the phylogenetic tree The information for the            Phylogeny and Common Name fields is downloaded from            the NCBI see Materials and Methods this information            is downloaded daily to assure that we have the most            current version of this data There are two general            modes of operation            For mode one you can systematically navigate            through the phylogenetic tree to the selected goal            point For example to get to the last phylogenetic            group that contains             Homo sapiens and gorillas the            user would click on the Eukaryota phylogeny button            then click on the FungiMetazoa group link in the            right frame followed by the Metazoa Eumetazoa            Bilateria Coelomata Deuterostomia Chordata            Craniata Vertebrata Gnathostomata            Teleostomi Euteleostomi Sarcopterygii            Tetrapoda Amniota Mammalia Theria            Eutheria Primates Catarrhini and Hominidae            links The phylogenetic group Hominidae contains the            genera Gorilla Pan chimpanzees Pongo and Homo see            Figure  HA and HA This type of navigation            is useful when you know the links that will get you to            the desired goal point otherwise mode two can help            you jump to the appropriate node in the phylogenetic            tree            For the second mode you type all or part of the            name of an organism or phylogenetic group that is close            to the phylogenetic node you want For example type            Homo sapiens in the Phylogeny field and press the            V button in the Phylogeny field The right frame            will display a few names from these select Homo            sapiens The right frame now contains the entire            phylogenetic path from the base of the tree to Humans            Figure and HA            The Common Name attribute can also help identify            organism names in the CRW RDBMS As with the phylogeny            operation two general modes for determining the values            are available For the first the user would type the            presumed common name in the Common Name field and            click the V button A few general examples are worm            fish cat dog and human More specific examples are            common earthworm              Lumbricus terrestris  European            polecat              Mustela putorius  and duckbill            platypus              Ornithorhynchus anatinus  These            names must be in the Common Name database for the            sequence entry to be identified with this method In            contrast the second mode is intended to identify            larger groups of organisms The three buttons in the            Common Name field Animals FungiPlants            Protists HA each reveal various lowlevel            common names in the right frame that are arranged in a            pseudophylogenetic structure For example a few of            the lower animals sponges flatworms             etc  are listed when the            Animals button is pressed in addition to the            Protostomia Deuterostomia and organisms nested within            these groups Arthropoda chordates vertebrates            Mammals             etc HA Accordingly the            FungiPlants and Protists buttons reveal the            major groups of organisms within their respective            groups For the latter mode of operation the user            selects one of these common names such as Mammals            The phylogeny for this group then appears in the same            right frame cellular organisms Eukaryota            FungiMetazoa group Metazoa Eumetazoa Bilateria            Coelomata Deuterostomia Chordata Craniata            Vertebrata Gnathostomata Teleostomi Euteleostomi            Sarcopterygii Tetrapoda Amniota Mammalia along            with the two phylogenetic groups within the Mammals            Mammalia Prototheria and Theria Another example is            the common name Mosses in the FungiPlants            Selecting Mosses brings up the phylogeny for the            Bryophyta Note that these common names              ie mammals or mosses do            not appear in the common name field in the output for            the sequence entries that are within the Mammalian or            Bryophyta phylogenetic groups Thus the common name            field could be very useful to identify organisms and            phylogenetically related organisms when you dont know            their genusspecies organism name or the phylogeny for            that group of organisms            Step  The last critical step before submitting a            query is to select the sort order for the attributes in            the output While a query will yield the same number of            results with any sort order the choice of sort order            can make answering questions easier Take for example            a search for all Eucarya rRNA entries By default the            entries are sorted alphabetically first by their            phylogenetic classification followed by organism name            cell location and last by their RNA class In            contrast the sort orders phylogeny organism name            cell location and RNA class and organism name            RNA class phylogeny and cell location produce            significantly different orders and overall arrangements            for the same set of entries see online examples the            second sorting is more useful when searching for a            particular organism since its exact location on the            phylogenetic tree may not be known to the user The            output page HA reveals the search strategy and            attribute sort order at the bottom of the page The            default sort order for the attributes is shown on the            S or sort buttons on the right side of the main            frame Figure and HA The sort order is changed            by simply clicking the S buttons in the order the            attributes are to be sorted The resulting sort order            for the attributes are shown in the small text box to            the left of each attributes S button alternatively            you can type numbers into these boxes to set the sort            order The alphabeticalnumerical order for any            attribute can be reversed z  a high number             low number by checking the box in the R or reverse            column to the right of the Sort buttons Finally the            sortings can be reset to the default values by clicking            the Sort Reset button at the top of the query            page            Before submitting the query a few attributes            deserve more attention             Secondary Structures a comparative secondary            structure model has been developed for more than  of            the sequence entries see Section  The secondary            structure attribute near the bottom of the query page            is an option to output             all sequence and structure            entries only those entries             with a secondary structure or            entries             without a secondary structure            diagram             ResultsPage the number of entries per output            page can be modulated While the system defaults to             entries per page the maximum number of entries per            output page can be set to    and  The            user can scroll to those entries that do not appear on            the first page by selecting the Next button on the            left bottom frame in the output window and use the            Previous button in the same frame to move toward the            first page as necessary             Color Display to help distinguish the organism            names on the output pages the entries have the same            color when the organism names are the same The colors            pink and white alternate for changes in the organism            names in the output entries             Group ID and Group Class these two attributes are            currently not fully functional thus we do not            encourage their use at this time             RNA TypeClass currently we do not have data            entries for the following RNA Types and Classes mRNA            tRNA SnRNA and Other            After clicking the submit button at the top or            bottom of the query page a new window will open This            window distributes the results into three frames            HA The main frame contains the sequence and            structure entries that satisfy the search query The            frame in the lower left indicates the number of entries            shown in the window and the entry numbers currently            shown and if necessary contains buttons to scroll to            the next or previous set of entries The third frame at            the bottom middleright displays the total number of            entries that satisfy the query the search strategy and            the sort order for this query            The three formats for the secondary structure            diagrams PostScript PDF and BPSEQ see Section A            and the online help from the Secondary Structure and            StrDiags links on the RDBMS query and results pages            can be retrieved from the results window The system            defaults to PostScript when the secondary structure            link is clicked PDF or BPSEQ files can be obtained            instead from the structure link by selecting the            corresponding radio button at the top left section of            the main frame An explanation of the structure link            names d dl d d bIl and aI and the            longer names that are associated with the downloaded            structure files is also available online            The GenBank accession number for each entry is a            link to a new window that retrieves the specified entry            from NCBI Sequence entries with more than one GenBank            number contain a m to the right of the accession            number Clicking the m link opens a new window with            all of the GenBank numbers associated with this            sequence            Each entry is associated with a NCBI phylogeny            listing that can be retrieved in a new window by            clicking the m button in the Phylogeny column This            listing also contains the known common names associated            with each level of the phylogenetic tree HA The            phylogeny for all of the entries in the results window            is available in a new window when the M button in the            header line of the phylogeny field is clicked                                B RDBMS PhyloBrowser            The PhyloBrowser interface to the CRW RDBMS was            developed to facilitate the identification and            retrieval of sequence and structure entries that are            associated with specific phylogenetic groups While the            Standard interface will reveal all sequence entries for            any one phylogenetic group it does not show the            phylogenetic groups that do not have the requested            sequences the PhyloBrowser interface displays the            entire phylogenetic tree including those branches that            do not have corresponding entries This interface is            based on the Taxonomy Browser developed by NCBI            httpwwwncbinlmnihgovTaxonomytaxonomyhomehtmland            uses the NCBI taxonomy database      Here we            describe the PhyloBrowser interface ways to navigate            through the phylogenetic data and how to retrieve RNA            information using this system            The PhyloBrowser uses three frames Figure and            HB At the bottom of the page is the Results Frame            white background which displays the selected portion            of the phylogenetic tree and any RNA information In            the upper left is the Selection Frame pink            background where the user can select the phylogenetic            and RNA information shown in the Results Frame Help is            provided in the Help Frame at the upper right blue            background            Starting at the root the entire phylogenetic tree            can be navigated with this system The base            phylogenetic level name is shown in green The number            of phylogenetic levels displayed below the base level            can be modulated from one the default to five levels            using the Display Phylogenetic Levels control in the            Selection Frame The phylogenetic level number for each            group is shown in red preceding the phylogenetic group            name and common name information where available is            shown in black text in parentheses after the group            name Each phylogenetic group name is a link that            reveals additional phylogenetic levels Figure and            HB allowing the user to navigate onto the            branches of the phylogenetic tree            In addition to this mode of transversing the            phylogenetic tree starting at the root and knowing the            pathway to the desired end point this system has the            facility to jump to specific places in the phylogenetic            tree The user can enter a partial or complete            scientific or common name in the white text field in            the lower purplecolored panel of the Selection Frame                         eg

checking the            View box Clicking the appropriate name in the            Results Frame will enter that name into the text field            unchecking the View check box and clicking Submit            will reveal the phylogenetic branch for this organism            HB            To navigate toward the root of the phylogenetic            tree click the Parents button in the Selection            Frame This will open a new window with the complete            NCBI phylogeny from the root to the level of the            organism of interest This window HB also reveals            the phylogenetic level number and common names Simply            clicking on a node name in this window              eg the Eutheria node in            HB will reveal this section of the phylogenetic            tree in the Results Frame            RNA information can be mapped onto the phylogenetic            tree in the Results Frame at any time In the white            panel in the Selection Frame the user can choose to            view six RNA types S S and S rRNA group I II            and other introns from five cellular locations            chloroplast cyanelle mitochondria nucleus and

brackets link to the Standard RDBMS            results page as described in the previous section and            allow the user to view the available sequence and            structure information The PhyloBrowser page HB            reveals the             Homo sapiens phylogenetic group            with the number of sequences and structures available            in our CRW RDBMS for RNA types              eg S and group I introns            that are present in the selected cell locations              eg Chl Mit Nuc            Additional documentation for the use of this page is

           the attribute link or the additional information link            in the topright frame Figure and HB                                C RNA Structure Query System            Currently we are unable to reliably and accurately            predict an RNA structure from its underlying sequence            due in part to the lack of more fundamental RNA            structure rules that relate families of RNA sequences            with specific RNA structural elements Given this            limitation we have utilized comparative analysis to            determine that RNA structure that is common to a set of            functionally and structurally equivalent sequences            This analysis as mentioned earlier is very accurate            nearly  of the basepairings in our S and S rRNA            comparative structure models are present in the            highresolution crystal structures for the S               and S    ribosomal subunits In the process of            predicting these comparative structure models we have            determined a large number of S S and S rRNA and            group I intron comparative structure models from            sequences that are representative of all types of            structural variations and conservation Thus with the            correct rRNA structure models and a large sampling of            structurally diverse structure models we now want to            decipher more relationships between RNA sequences and            RNA structural elements Toward this end we developed            a system for the identification of biases in short            sequences associated with simple structural elements in            our set of comparative structure models The first set            of examples reveals a sampling of structurebased            sequence biases Recently we utilized this system to            identify and quantitate the following biases for            adenosines in the Bacterial S and S rRNA            covariationbased structure models                 approximately  of the adenosines are unpaired             more than  of the  ends of loops in the S and            S rRNA have an A  there is a bias for adenosines            to be adjacent to other adenosines  of these are at            two unpaired positions and  of these are at            pairedunpaired junctions and  the majority of the            As at the  end of loops are adjacent to a paired G            These results were discerned with this system and are            shown in part in Figure and HC            This RNA sequencestructure query system has three            primary fields of input to be selected by the user the            RNA type phylogenetic groupcell location and the            nucleotidestructural element The options for each of            these fields are listed in Table  The system            currently supports four RNA types S S and S            rRNAs and group I introns and five phylogenetic            groupscell locations Bacteria Archaea Eucarya            nuclearencoded mitochondrial and chloroplast Any            combination and number of RNA types and            phylogeneticcell location groups can be selected            although at least one RNA type and one            phylogeneticcell location group must be selected The            bacterial S and S rRNAs were selected for the            examples in Figure and HC Five nucleotide            categories are searchable single nucleotides two            adjacent nucleotides base pairs three nucleotides            and four nucleotides Each category can be searched            against a defined set of structural elements as            outlined in Table  The structural elements for these            nucleotide categories are based on  positions that            are paired and unpaired and  positions at the center            or  and  ends of helices and loops            The sorting function dynamically ranks the            nucleotide patterns The resulting output reveals for            any of the selected structural elements the most            frequent nucleotide pattern followed by other patterns            in descending order to the least frequent nucleotide            pattern For the A Story example mentioned earlier            adenosine is the most frequent nucleotide at unpaired            positions  followed by G  U             and C  Figure and HC These values are            contained in the orange columns and reveal the            percentages for each of the nucleotides within each of            the structural elements listed              ie paired unpaired             etc  This same figure reveals            that  of the  end of loops contain an A The            unpaired to paired ratio is shown in yellow in Figure            and HC this ratio is greatest for adenosines            where the value is nearly two              ie there are two unpaired            adenosines for every A that is paired and lowest for            C where less than three out of ten cytosines are            unpaired In contrast with the percentage values in the            orange boxes that reveal the percentage of nucleotides            within each structural element the percentages in the            green boxes reveal the distribution of nucleotides in            different structural elements for each nucleotide For            example  of the adenosines are paired while             are unpaired In contrast  of the Cs are            paired and only  of the Cs are unpaired            The most common adjacent nucleotides in any            structural environment in the Bacterial S and S            rRNAs are GG  HC while in loops the most            common dinucleotides are AA  HC followed            by GA  UA  AU              etc The most frequent adjacent            nucleotides at the loophelix junction are AG             HC followed by AC  GG              etc For the adjacent AA            sequences nearly  occur in loops while            approximately  of the AA sequences occur in helices            another  occur at the loophelix junction and            less than  occur in helixloop junctions Thus            these analyses of single and adjacent nucleotides            reveal several strong biases in the distribution of            nucleotides in different structural environments            The top section of the output page Figure and            HC displays the types of data RNA molecules and            phylogeneticcell location groups that were selected            and analyzed This section also reveals the number of            structure models that were analyzed  S and  S            rRNA structure models were analyzed in Figure and

     Conclusions        Nearly  years ago our initial goals for our RNA web        page was to disseminate some of the comparative information        we collected and analyzed for our prediction of S and S        rRNA structure with comparative analysis With dramatic        increases in the number of ribosomal RNA sequences we        developed a relational database system to organize basic        information about each sequence and structure entry to        maintain an inventory of our collection and to retrieve        any one or set of entries that satisfy the conditions of        the search In parallel with the significant advancements        in computational and networking hardware and software our        need for more detailed and quantitative comparative        information for each RNA molecule under study and our        interest in studying more RNA molecules beyond S and S        rRNA we have greatly expanded our web site and named it        the Comparative RNA Web CRW Site        The major types of information available for each RNA        molecule are         the current comparative RNA structure model         nucleotide and base pair frequency tables for all        positions in the reference structure         secondary structure conservation diagrams that reveal        the extent of conservation in the RNA sequence and        structure         representative secondary structure diagrams for        organisms from phylogenetic groups that span the        phylogenetic tree and reveal the major forms of structural        variation         a semicompletepartial collection of publicly        available sequences that are  or more complete and         sequence alignments        At this time we maintain the most current comparative        sequence and structure information about the S and S        rRNA The other RNA molecules we maintain S rRNA tRNA        and group I and II introns are not as advanced at the time        of this writing        Our future aims for the CRW Site are to  maintain a        complete collection of sequences in our database management        system for each of the RNAs under study  once or twice a

currently        supported                    Materials and Methods                  Sequence collection          The majority of the sequence alignments presented at          the CRW Site were assembled in the Gutell laboratory The          alignments that were based on another laboratorys          initial effort and enlarged and refined for the CRW          project are  the prokaryotic Archaea and Bacteria          alignments for S rRNA      the S rRNA          alignments     and  the tRNA alignments              The group I and II intron alignments were originally          based upon sequences collected by Michel               New rRNA and intron sequences were found by searching          the nucleic acid sequence database at GenBank using the          NCBI Entrez system httpwwwncbinlmnihgovEntrezat          least once per week with appropriate search criteria            eg rrna Feature key and          intron Feature key to find introns that occur in          rRNA While the majority of the RNA sequences of          importance to this database are available online at          GenBank a few sequences are only available in the          literature            eg the           Urospora penicilliformis intron              or in a thesis these sequences were manually          entered into the appropriate sequence alignment A few          sequences were found in GenBank with the sequence          similarity searching program BLAST     At this time          we are only trying to identify all sequences that are          more than  complete since all sequences that are less          than  complete are not currently retrieved with the          CRW RDBMS                          Deviations in GenBank entries          The majority of GenBank entries contain accurate          annotations of the RNAs However some GenBank entries          deviate from this norm in a variety of ways In some          entries the presence of the rRNA was not annotated and          the rRNA was found by searching for short sequences that          are characteristic of that rRNA a few examples          Sometimes intron sequences are not annotated and were          discovered during the alignment of the corresponding rRNA          exons            eg the unannotated intron in the          uncultured archaeon SAGMAB S rRNA AB and many          Fungi including AF     Other GenBank entries          contain incorrect annotations for the RNAs the          boundaries may be misidentified by a small or large          number of nucleotides                          RNA

analysis are            maintained by us at the University of Texas these            alignments containing all publicly available sequences            used in the analysis are or will be available from the            CRW Site httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduTable  rRNA            Type  tRNA and intron sequences were manually aligned            to maximize sequence and structural identity using the            alignment editor AE T Macke Scripps Clinic San            Diego CA The rRNA alignments are sorted by phylogeny            and cell location the intron alignments are sorted by            subgroup exon insertion point for rRNA introns and            phylogeny and the tRNA alignments are sorted by            aminoacyl type and phylogeny Alignment of the rRNA            exons when available between closelyrelated            sequences provided an independent evaluation of the            intronexon borders for each introncontaining rRNA            sequence the large number of rRNA sequences in our            collection and the high level of sequence conservation            at intron insertion points provide great confidence in            this evaluation                                Classification of introns            Group I and II intron sequences were classified into            one of the structural subgroups defined by Michel                or the more recently determined subgroup IE               based upon sequence and structural homology to            previouslyaligned sequences Uncertainties in these            assignments come from two main sources First some            introns are referred to in rRNA GenBank entries without            the intron sequence being provided in these cases we            represent the intron as having length NSEQ No            SEQuence information and accept the authors major            intron classification              eg group I or group II but            not the specific intron type              eg if an author classified an            intron as IA and did not publish the sequence our            system designates its type as I In the second case            we do have sequence information but cannot fully            classify the intron with confidence here we provide            the most plausible classification The classifications            I and II respectively are group I and II introns            of undefined subtype An intron described as IB has            the characteristic features of the IB subgroup but            cannot be subclassified as IB IB IB or IB Those            introns that do not belong to either group I or group            II are generally classified as Unknown in the RNA            Class field see Section A and Table  included in            this category are the Archaeal and spliceosomal            introns At present the Archaeal and spliceosomal            introns are identified with the phrases Archaeal and            spliceosomal respectively in the Comment field of            the RDBMS a standard designation for these introns            will be added to a future version of the system            Although the introns in our collection have been            judiciously placed into one of the intron subgroups and            are roughly correct these intron placements will be            reanalyzed to assure the accurate assignment of            subgroups                                Identification of unannotated or misannotated            introns with examples            Some examples of introns that were identified or            clarified by the alignment process are              Aureoumbra lagunensis U            the intron was annotated as an insertion              Exophiala dermatitidis X            the intron was not annotated and              Chara sp Qiu  AF            the intron annotations were shifted approximately             positions toward the  end of the rRNA sequence                                About TBD and NSEQ            Information that could not be determined either from            the GenBank entries or by using these methods is            represented in the RDBMS system as TBD To Be            Determined When a sequence is known but not available            for example when an intron is inferred from a rRNA            GenBank entry the sequence length and percent            completeness are instead represented as NSEQ No            SEQuence to show that the sequence itself is not            available                                    Database System                      Contents of the RDBMS
