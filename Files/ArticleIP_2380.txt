                                 The ABCs of Communitarianism            Sometime over the last twoyears someone somewhere must have decreed that the intellectual buzzword ofthe s was to be communitarianism Only five years ago communitarianismwas an obscure school of philosophy discussed in faculty seminars today itsideas are splashed across People magazine and on network TV Communityand civil society the two mantras of the movement are part of everydaypolitical discourse            Curiously in a climate of polarized political discourse everyone is acommunitarian The movements cheerleaders can be found across the politicalspectrum from Hillary Clinton to Barbra Streisand to Pat Buchanan On theleft large liberal foundations like Ford and Carnegie the bellwethers ofpolitical correctness throw millions of dollars into projects relating tothese ideas The result predictably is that the magic words community andcivil society are sprinkled liberally now in all proposals for researchgrants as in The East Asian Balance of PowerThe Neglected Role of CivilSociety On the right Policy Review  the journal of the resolutelyconservative Heritage Foundation announced last year that it was reorientingitself to focus on civil society            What is communitarianism Where did it come from How comeeveryone seems to agree it is good Its actually all quite simple You justneed to remember your ABCs                                       A Is for AristotleHe is probably started it all In his treatise on government ThePolitics  he famously wrote that man is by nature a political animalmeaning that human beings can best fulfill themselves as part of social andpolitical groups not as isolated individuals sitting at home watching TVwell the fourth century BC equivalent Usually regarded as the originalconservative philosopher Aristotle is popular now with troubled liberals whoworry that modern societies organized around an individualistic rightsbasedcreed leave human beings feeling hollow at the core            Ofthese troubled types Harvard University political philosopher Michael Sandelis perhaps mostly closely identified with communitarianism Along with seriousscholars like Michael Walzer and unserious publicists like Amitai EtzioniSandel criticizes minimalist liberalismthe tradition made most famous byJohn Stuart Millfor too easily celebrating individualism and materialism atthe expense of social and moral issues In his new book DemocracysDiscontent America in Search of a Public Philosophy  Sandel tries torevive an alternative American path the Republican tradition which he saysfocused on characterbuilding and citizenship While their critique ofliberalisms reluctance to introduce morality into politics is trenchantleftwing communitarians like Sandel themselves are reluctant to advocatestrong remediessay prayer in public schools or laws against divorceand relyinstead on vague statements about the value of community life andneighborhoods            Conservatives have few such inhibitions Former Reaganofficial and intellectual firebrand William Bennett agrees with everything thattroubled liberals say is wrong with modern society His answer however is notto talk about nice neighborhoods but instead to talk about Virtue Actuallyhe writes about it and since his Books of Virtues  collections ofmorally instructive tales from all over the world are relentless best sellersone has to assume someone is reading them            The advantage that Bennettand others like neoconservative writer Ben Wattenberg and Christian Coalitionspokesman Ralph Reed have is that while liberals spend a great deal of timeanalyzing the problemliberalisms valuefree politicsthey are wary ofactually filling the vacuum with any kind of absolutist morality They areafter all liberals By contrast conservative communitarians have solutionsBoth groups talk up abstract virtues like honor commitment and thrift butconservatives then propose specific policies that put into law their moral andreligious preferences in order to deal with all sorts of issues unwed mothersabsent fathers unruly schoolchildren gay lovers and so on Its a gameliberals cant win                                       B Is for Bowling One of the most important debatesamong academics and policy wonks over the last two years has been is it betteris bowl together or alone In Bowling Alone Americas Declining SocialCapital a nowlegendary article written in  Harvards Robert Putnampointed out that league bowling in America has been declining for decadeswhile individual bowling is on the rise This he contends is a symbol of thedecline of community spirit and the rise of atomistic individualism            Part of the reason thatPutnams article resonated so strongly outside elite circles Peoplemagazine profiled him in a bowling alleyis that in using the example ofbowling that staple of s Putnam touched on a powerful chord of nostalgiafor the America of that golden decade A new book by Alan Ehrenhalt TheLost City  is subtitled Discovering the Forgotten Virtues of Communityin the Chicago of the s             Ehrenhalts book may bethe best of the new literature on community because rather than waxing poeticabout community in the abstract he describes actual communities The result isa vivid picture showing that the strong bonds that developed in those fabledneighborhoods of yore were kindled by conditions that we might finddiscomforting todayfear of authority lack of choice and poverty Peoplestayed in neighborhoods for example because they could not afford to moveand because other neighborhoods would not accept them easily They attendedchurch services and neighborhood social events because small banks schoolsand other community institutions were run by a local elite that enforced acertain kind of conformity Porches and stoops those symbols of a vibrantsocial life stopped being used as gathering places for a rather practicalreasonair conditioning Ehrenhalt himself advocates a return to thechoicefree obedient life of the s but while seductive in the abstractit sounds more and more confining on close examination Imagine having to go toparties with your local bank manager so that you could get a mortgage            Hardcore leftwingers arehorrified by this rise in nostalgia about the s a decade that was seennot so long ago as a grim period of preenlightenment racist sexistcapitalist boredom The Nation s Katha Pollitt takes Putnams veryexample the shift from league bowling to ad hoc bowling and suggests thatthat story could be told as one of happy progress from a drinksodden nightof spouseavoidance with the same old faces from work to temperate andspontaneous fun with ones intimate friends and family Hmm Temperate andspontaneous fun sounds like something one might have to do in a work camp Andthe occasional drinksodden night of spouseavoidancefor both sexesisprobably key to enduring marriages            B by the way could alsobe for baseball but it turns out that baseball leagues have been growingsteadily over the last decades And the number of soccer clubs has been risingmeteorically as well The simplest explanation for this rise might be thedesire for a little exercise                                       C Is for Civil Society Civil Society has nothing to dowith Emily Post Its a term used to describe that part of society that existsbetween the family and the statevoluntary organizations choral groupsRotary clubs etc            Alexis de Tocquevillenoticed in the s that America was brimming with them and argued that theywere good for democracy This celebrated hypothesis has by now become atheological certitude in the minds of most American intellectuals It recentlyreceived powerful empirical support from Robert Putnam whose  bookMaking Democracy Work  documented that northern Italy is civilsocietyrich and southern Italy civilsociety poor Certainly the north has beenbetter governed than the south for centuries but that is not to say that ishas been a better democracy After all Italy has not been a democracy for thatlong There was that fellow Mussolini and before him the emperor Perhapscivil society is good for efficient government rather than democraticgovernment Memo to Lee Kuan Yew             Ofcourse civil society could also be the Mafia the Michigan militia Hamas theNation of Islam and other such groups involved in communal projects But whenmost civilsociety boosters talk about the concept they use it tomeanarbitrarilythose groups that they like So the left points inevitablyto nonprofit dogood organizations and the right talks about churchgroups            Consider the difference between the conservative writerFrancis Fukuyama and left winger Benjamin Barber who in their recent bookspraise civil society extravagantly In Fukuyamas Trust  he argues thatprivate companies are an important part of civil society and that nonfamilybusiness activity is a key indicator of a politically and economically healthysociety But for Barber the author of Jihad vs McWorld How the Planet isBoth Falling Apart and Coming Togetherand What This Means forDemocracy a book President Clinton has read and praisedbusiness farfrom being part of civil society leads the assault on civil society Who willget business off the backs of civil society Barber asks Now it isnt clearwhy firms dont fulfill most of the functions of civil society Indeed the termcivil society originated with writers like Adam Smith Adam Ferguson andDavid Hume in England and Scotland in the th century as a way to describeprivate business activity On the other hand you dont hear many conservativesproclaiming the virtues of Greenpeace            Communitarianism wassupposed to be a third way neither liberal nor conservative that charted anew course for philosophy and politics But as this primer suggests it hasbecome a collection of meaningless terms used as new bottles into which theold wine of liberalism and conservatism is poured Community means one thing ifyou are a conservative and another if you are a liberalthe same with civilsociety and even bowling Call it politics as usual                           Illustrations by RobertNeubecker
