                       ArguingWith The Argument Culture                                       In We DoUnderstand William Saletan quotes the following sentence from Deborah TannensThe Argument Culture  Disputation was rejected in ancient China asincompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage            Professor Tannen might besurprised to learn that one of the most wellknown introductory books onancient Chinese thought is called Disputers of the Tao PhilosophicalArgument in Ancient China  Indeed I think most students of ancient Chinawould agree that if there ever was a disputatious intellectual culture it wasthat of China in the Warring States period circa  BC Note the nameof the era Dr Tannen            In otherwords Tannens is pretty much the most egregiously misleading generalizationabout ancient China that I have ever read                           CJFraser University of Hong Kong                           LibrarianSays Keep Quiet                        I cannot recall a moregratuitous grouse than Sarah Kerrs questioning in an otherwise estimablepiece of the readerfriendliness of the Library of Americas Gertrude Steinvolumes What We Have Here Is a Failure to Communicate            The dimensions of thelibrarys books are perfect their typeface is elegant and eminently readablewithout being precious and most refuting of Kerrs odd complaint their pagesare of a thickness that affords pliability and easy separation whilemaintaining economy in bulk and weight One of the many marvels of the seriesis that vast collections of authors works are assembled in volumes soexquisite yet portable Even Benjamin Franklins  page tome is easilyhandled            It shouldbe noted of the librarys treatments of Mark Twain and Henry James which Kerrcovets for Gertrude Stein that their thinnest volumes comprise  and pages respectively If slightness in a Library of America volume is a mark ofesteem Kerr can be assured that the two svelte books she reviewed at under athousand pages each accord Gertrude Stein a measure of honor beyond mereinclusion in the series             Paul Coleman university librarianWest Texas AM UniversityCanyon Texas

statements can be reduced to psychology as if the disapproval of murderwere just another human taste like the preference for sweet over bitter foodsEven a diehard Ionian might think that our moral sense evolved to grasp alogic of morality that is outside our minds in the same sense that our numbersense evolved to grasp mathematical truths that are outside our minds            One difference betweenmathematical truths and moral truths is that grasping the former provides anobvious survival advantage We should expect an evolved number sense to discernmathematical truths fairly well we should not be so optimistic about theaccuracy of an evolved moral sense            Theevolutionary process will favor those moral intuitions that best spread thegenes responsible for themquite
