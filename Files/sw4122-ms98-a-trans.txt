        so do you work for an employer who uh       gives you health benefits   yeah we get um i have i have good health benefits actually   oh yeah   yeah i have uh all of them and theyre its pretty cheap per month and they i get to pick my own doctor and they have really good benefits   uhhuh uh um do you have any any interesting benefits aside from basic health coverage   uh besides basic uh no i have um some a little bit of uh life insurance benefits   um do uh do you get any kind of dental or optical coverage   uh no the the uh no optical the dental is fully covered um   uhhuh   except unless its major   uhhuh   but anything minor or just checkups thats all covered   and uh is your whole family covered or do   no thats just me but they can be i have that option but its more money   uhhuh   but theyre not they have their own   i see so through your husband or   oh no me im single its just through me   uhhuh oh i see   its its uh so its and it that makes it cheaper too since im single   okay do but do you have children   no no   oh okay so thats real simple yeah here uh   yeah     its just for the individual and if you want to cover your family you pay a little extra but not much   yeah not much not for the good but its really good the benefits are good   uh yeah i think its pretty significant benefit uh really uh   umhum   makes you wanna stick around   yeah yeah they have they uh it does   yeah thats just what you wanna hear about uh people who are individually insured you know once you get sick you can be booted right out   yeah umhum yeah   uh which seems kind of unfair uh   do do you work where you have benefits like that   yeah yeah we have we can choose uh a couple different plans they made they try to make it real flexible where if you dont use much you actually get cash back   oh really   um so you can choose all these different plans some of which pay you know like everything and some of which pay very little uh you can also choose an HMO uh well i used to have that when i was single and i was i found it very convenient uh and we have some optical and dental coverage thats i guess its optional but i think we can get one pair of glasses a year   yeah the umhum yeah really well thats good   thats so yeah its pretty good actually uh i think a anything under a hundred dollars we can get one pair of glasses a year but if you want something really fancy you pay the difference   uhhuh see thats see i wear glasses not all the time but when i read and stuff and um i wish we had some kind of optical   uhhuh   coverage but theres   yeah its nice   theres none whatsoever and it can get expensive   yeah it can uh at least its not like medical where it can really go through the roof you know at least somewhat limited um   yeah   lets see you have any kind of uh child care benefits or   um yeah for the um actually if youre i believe i i read up on some of it if youre pregnant   anything in uhhuh   they have really really good coverage they have um like well baby care its its pretty much covered   uhhuh thats a problem sometimes i understand when the babys not sick but you know you have these periodic appointments and   umhum especially when theyre younger   yeah the doctors end up having to come up with some ailment to cover the uh   yeah   the appointment even though theres not really one   umhum   yeah some seems more honest   and though and the pregnant mother has uh full coverage for well mother care   uhhuh well thats good thats good and do is there any kind of interesting uh what i mean what happens after the babys born is there some uh some maternity leave policy   um thats what i was trying to i think there is i dont really remember how long it is   uhhuh   but they do give you a certain amount of time to be home and get adjusted i guess   uh   and um most of the benefits are pretty good the hospital benefits and and they let you pick your own doctor you have your choice actually if um its better they give you a list   uhhuh   and if and if your doctors on that list then most of your benefits are better because those doctors are in a chain that works with the insurance company   i see so they theyre preferred providers or is that a   yeah but you can have your own doctor   right and you pay a little more or certain things arent as well covered but at least you have that option   yeah yeah umhum   thats nice because once in a while you find someone who deals specifically with you know what you have or or somebody just somebody youve dealt with already a   umhum yeah and and a lot of times because we just switched my company my uh company just switched insurance companies and before   and uhhuh   we did not have that choice   uhhuh
