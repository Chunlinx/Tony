                                 The iTimesi Sees Day Traders Everywhere                        As a rule the more investors trade the worse they do relative to themarket as a whole Frequent trading requires that you pull off thenearimpossible feat of consistently outwitting the collective intelligence ofthe stock market and do so well enough to outweigh the added burden ofcommission costs and taxes which are much higher on shortterm capital gainsthan on longterm gains There has never been a serious academic study infact that has shown anything different            So Gretchen Morgensons frontpage article in Saturdays New YorkTimes lamenting the boom in shortterm trading among individual investorswas right about the detrimental effects of such trading on the bank accounts ofthe people doing it But the evidence the Times offered for thewidespread nature of that boom was confused and not especially convincing Andthe attempt to draw conclusions about the broader negative effects of increasedtrading was even less plausible Shortterm trading as Ive arguedhere before is a fools game But its not a fools game that hurts thoseof us who arent playing it            The premise of Morgensons article was drawn from a new study by SteveGalbraith of Sanford C Bernstein which shows that the average investor nowholds shares only eight months whereas a decade ago heshe held shares for twoyears What we werent told though was whether the average here was themean or the median After all if most investors are still holding stocks foryears but a smaller group of investors are now holding stocks for  minutesor three hours and trading those stocks constantly the mean holding periodwould drop significantly even if the experience of most investors had notmaterially changed            The same problem is even more true of the statistics about share turnoverwith the Nasdaq shares turning over more than  percent of its shares in asingle year Day traders and technicaltrading firms now account for asignificant percentage of each days volume on both the Nasdaq and the NYSEand by essentially trading stocks among themselvesand serving as buyers andsellers for the rest of usthey have contributed massively to share turnoverBut its a mistake to say theyre emblematic of the investing world as awhole            Of course investors trade more now than they ever did If you drop the costof doing something by twothirds or more which is what the advent of theInternet did to commissions people will do more of it And as its becomeclearer and clearer that mutualfund managers and stockbrokers are no morelikely to have marketbeating knowledge than the average investor is its alsobecome harder to justify giving your money to either especially with the feesthey charge To be sure you shouldnt take your money from a mutualfundmanager and run it yourself You should put it in an index fund But evenlongterm investors think they can be Warren Buffett I know I do            All of this though is a far cry from saying that all of us who use the Netor discount brokers are day traders which is what the Times seemspositively bent on saying There is no evidence for that at all Moreimportant theres no evidence that all this trading is having detrimentaleffects on the capital markets Morgenson argues that excessive trading isresponsible for the increased volatility of the market But theres no controlgroup here The rise of individual investing has occurred simultaneous with thecreation of an entirely new industry the Internet which has spawned hundredsof new companies whose future prospects are incredibly difficult to evaluateIn that situation volatility is to be expected since the markets view ofthose prospects is more likely to change rapidly than will its view of sayCocaColas future And as I suggested acouple of weeks ago the more information you have the more noise youllhave in the stock market leading to more volatility Trading here may be asymptom more than a cause            In any case the thing to remember about all this is that every time someonesells a stock someone else is buying it And in terms of capital allocationits irrelevant whether the person selling the stock has held it for sevenyears or seven days All that matters is whether the price is higher or lowerthan the last trade Morgensons article is full of these vague forebodingsthat all this trading will lead to doom once the bull market ends But just ason the way up there have been no buyers without sellers on the way down if wedo go down there will be no sellers without buyers To reiterate a point Ivemade before the more people there are in the market though how much theytrade is irrelevant the deeper and more resilient it is and the smarter itis            So yes for our own sakes we should all buy and hold But for the marketssake well it doesnt really matter
