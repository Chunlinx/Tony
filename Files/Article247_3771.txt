                                 The Medias Substance Problem            QUEENS NYGeorge Bush began his visit to New York City yesterday with astop at a charter school in Harlem Afterward he gave an eloquent speech inwhich he unveiled a second major education policy initiative dealing withcharter schools reorganizing federal education programs and a proposal thatvaguely resembles national testing for third through eighthgraders TodayBush appeared with Gov George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at a citywelfareofficeturnedjobcenter People stood up and gave moving testimonyabout how the center and ones like it steer people away from welfare and intowork            After everyone spoke Bush held a press conference his only one of thetrip Here is what reporters asked            Q Gov Bush some conservative Republicans have said that your criticismlast week and again yesterday is undermining their credibility on Capitol HillHave you made a political calculation that you can afford to alienate the rightwing if that means courting more moderate voters            Q Gov Bush there are many New Yorkers who perceive that Pat Buchanan isantiSemitic antiblack and antiimmigrant Should he be read out of theRepublican Party            Q Is there room in the big tent for bigotry            Q Gov Bush Gov Pataki and Mayor Giuliani have both decried racism andantiSemitism  Your Louisiana campaign chair purchased mailing lists fromDavid Duke When you were asked about that you said you didnt even knowanything about it             Q Governor you talked earlier about the Republican Party and the image ofthe party There have been four national elections this decade Could you justtalk about each one and talk about how you think thats caused the partysimage to go off track and how that informs what youre trying to do now            Q You say the partys been mischaracterized  But last week there was anactual thing they were doing that was not mischaracterized ie attempting todelay payments under the Earned Income Tax Credit It was an actualpolicy            Q You said several months ago that you would not campaign against thisRepublican Congress But some people hear what you said over the last week asprecisely that            Bush was asked no questions about education and only one about welfare Thisconcerned a federal investigation into whether Giuliani was improperly denyingbenefits for some recipients In other words the questions he got fromreporters focused on politics and positioning to the total exclusion of hisactual policies and positions Reporters tried to provoke Bush into making newsor embarrassing his hosts while ignoring the social policy issues on hisagenda            Its not that the questions they asked werent interesting or legitimatethough most did fall under the category of already asked and answered Iveheard far worse at other press conferences dominated by local TV loudmouthsasking endless stentorian variations on the essential horserace query Whosgoing to win And a focus on pure politics is surely better than a focus onpersonal misbehavior or the issue of whether evangelical Christians should bealone with women not their wives But why cant reporters devote at least someof their time and intelligence to actual issues            I can think of a few reasons for the allergy to substance The first is theimperative for daily reporters to move the ball on an ongoing story such asBush vs Buchanan or Bush vs the congressional Republicans Advancing such aconflict automatically counts as news Some new detail about Bushs educationpolicy by contrast might or might not make the paper A second factor is thejournalistic culture of the news conference which rewards zinger questionsthat provoke newsand discourages anything that courts televised dullness Athird factor is the newsroom division between politics and policy Mostreporters covering the campaign are well schooled in the former and onlyminimally if at all knowledgeable about the latter They may understand thepolitics of school choice or welfare reform but tend to be far shakier on thesubstance            The chief complaint of reformers these days is that the power ofspecialinterest money is breeding public cynicism about the political processHorserace journalism has more or less the same effect It tells the publicthat all politicians ever do is quarrelwithout doing much to elucidate whatif anything they might be fighting about                           Bushism of the Week                May I finish please Iwas just getting to my peeroationQueens Job Center Oct
