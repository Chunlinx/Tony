nothing would delight Mr Clintonmore than a beautiful ending to his second term with a diplomatic success inthis part of the world where he has invested so much The Times of London wasrather less cheerful The outlook is too complicated to permit of excessiveexpectations it said For example an entente with Syria would make Barakslife more difficult elsewhere The paradox of the ArabIsraeli
