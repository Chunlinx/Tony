                                 Bomb Letter Bomb            The New York Times LosAngeles Times  and Washington Post each lead with the latest development inthe White Houses attempt to stave off a Senate defeat of the comprehensivenuclear test ban treatyPresident Clintons submission of a letter to SenateMajority Leader Trent Lott asking him to postpone his planned floor vote on thetreaty The papers report Lotts reaction The letter isnt enoughClintonmust also agree not to bring the treaty back to the Senate until January Which so far Clinton has not agreed to do USA Todayplays the story on Page  leading instead with its latest poll undertakenwith Gallup and CNN showing that Bill Bradley is  percentage points closerto Al Gore than he was in the papers last survey a month ago and that Bushwould beat both Democrats The only expert quoted in the story saysGoreBradley is headed toward a tossup and that Bush seems to have hispartys nomination wrapped up The story saves the number of peoplepolledfor the last sentence            The WP s account of Clintons letter to Lott makes it seem that thefate of the treaty is genuinely up in the air whereas the LAT s firstparagraph suggests a deal may be in the works that will avoid the treatyscertain defeat Ditto the NYT  which says even in its headline aplan is in the works that will achieve just that But even the Timessees a lot of brinkmanship yet to come and admits a vote could come as early astoday            Everybody explains that ratification which is what the Senate iscontemplating by the  perceived nuclear capable countries is required tomake it effective But the NYT helpfully adds that Russia and China havesignaled that they will take their lead from the Senate vote TheTimes also does the best job of explaining the politics in play rightnow noting that  Lott is tiptoeing between a majority of Republicans whoare probably against the treaty but dont want to give the US a diplomaticsetback on the one hand and hardliners in his party on the other who want tokill the treaty at all domestic and international costs and  Senate MinorityLeader Thomas Daschle has to contend with a minority of Democrats who want avote now so that once defeated the treaty becomes a viable campaign issue            But the LAT does better on the big picture explaining that Lottsadditional demand for postponement until  is designed precisely to immunizeRepublicans from the treaty during the  election And although everybodynotes that President Clinton signed the treaty two years ago its theLAT that explains where its been since then bottled up in Sen JesseHelms Foreign Relations Committee            The LAT and WP front the likelihood that today or one daysoon will mark for the first time ever the planets population totaling billion The thrust of the storiesand of a Wall Street Journal oped and of a NYT Week in Reviewtakeout a few weeks agois that in the shadow of the dizzying number thereis nonMalthusian news Its noted that thanks to education efforts and thewider dissemination of birth control the population growth rate in most placesis about half what it was a generation ago The Post  by the way makesthe point that this fact doesnt show that books like The Population Bombwere nutsit was because of such alarms that experts and governments startedattacking the growth rate problem The main storm cloud the Post seesis that food distribution  not food supply  which is generallyadequate needs to improve while the LAT wonders if governments willcontinue to stay on top of reproductive care            The WSJ runs a fine feature about the militarys obstinate attachment toantiSoviet era big ticket weapons systems and its concomitant failure to fullytap the potential of newer smaller ideas This is no clichspoutingeditorial but rather a long detailed narrative of whats become of unmannedaerial drones in the hands of the Pentagon in the past  years The primaryproblem has been that traditional weapons advocates in uniform have seen dronesas threats For instance in the Navy so the story explains the plan todevelop unmanned bombers ran into the formidable opposition of the carrieradmirals The upshot is that the Pentagon is still spending only millions onthis idea compared to say the  billion it wanted for the next Air Forcefighter            The WP reports inside that last week the US militarys AtlanticCommand held a formal ceremony where it was renamed the Joint Forces CommandThe change involved new banners and command insignia and new stationery Butthe regional area of responsibilitythe Atlantic Oceanremains basically thesame The point of the name change is to emphasize the importance of thevarious US service branches working together But its a real lapse for thePost not to have told the readers what the nonchange change costtaxpayers            The NYT fronts a Frenchman leading the revolt against McDonalds inhis country And off a frontpage picture the WP inside reports on theeggthrowing protest by French chefs in Paris against a new tax structure theyfeel hurts traditional cuisine and aids fast food These are interesting sortsof stories but one has to wonder if there isnt another reason why they arestaples of the big dailies to help justify having reporters stationed inFrance which although a great place to live produces virtually no realnews            Upon seeing the headline over NYT opedder Gail Collins effortTodays Papers braced for embarrassing personal revelations of anun Times ly sort The column which instead turns out to be about RonaldReagan being so profoundly solipsistic that he couldnt remember the names ofhis dogs or children is slugged My Boy Spot
