        on my fathers side weve really there uh     does your family normally have a reunion do you have one thats been   on my fathers side weve really there uh on my mothers side weve had several not its not really on a regular basis but usually sometimes every few summers   uhhuh uhhuh   well see all the family lives in one place except for a few of us that are scattered about so theyre pretty much just reunited always so its its   right umhum   just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together   uhhuh well it might be a good time for you to begin to to start a tradition you could be responsible for that yourself   i know thats they do that thats true how about your family   sure well in my family lets see last October was the forty fifth annual uh reunion the first Sunday in October the Jordan family gets together   wow youre a pro at this oh thats good   and all of the descendants of the Civil War i mean yeah the Civil War veteran come together and they come as far away as from California and theres usually oh between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people   and then where do you meet   in uh theres a big community hall in Vernon   okay   Texas and uh that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family   okay do you have relatives in Vernon   uhhuh   then okay   right uhhuh a lot of the older family lives in Vernon um all of his direct descendants descendants have now died and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties   right oh   so were talking about second and third great children here   right   uh i take my boys well i took them up till this year theyre grown and gone from home now so they take their family but uh   oh right   but uh lets see that would make them grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather okay so it would be the second great grandchild   okay so this town hall that you meet in is that like a um   its uh well its a community center its a community hall its a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen in it   okay   and uh you just bring the covered dishes every every family brings a a dish of some kind and you get all the wonderful old family recipes that have been handed down for years   potato salad and the   well we try to stay away from those things which might have uh salmonella in them   oh thats good   and we choose to bring congealed salad you can bring a congealed vegetable salad as opposed to potato salad and we are very conscious of most of us are very conscious of of uh   right   sanitation aspects whatever youve got to carry for any distance i always take home baked bread   right huh oh thats nice oh thats nice   uh that happens to be my specialty for that family i do other things very well but there are others in the family who do them better   do they always have  the the one person in the family who knows or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best and thats what they get to cook   uhhuh   thats good well i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions so i learned a lot about them i havent been to a lot but we talked a lot about the the rituals you she equated the family reunion with the Protestant   umhum umhum umhum   it was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage it was it was an interesting theory she talked about the um   umhum   that Catholics all its a home centered you know its all family centered anyway so you usually are living where your parents live and its all your you dont have to come home so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe but when the Protestant ethic happened in America there were people who ever went out and you know went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home   umhum   for the reunion so that became their version of the pilgrimage   umhum right   but she had it was interesting you know i  dont know how valid it is but she talked about that and how the the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and um you know about the bread and the ritual placement do you have a a certain way that everythings placed out on the table every every year is there kind of a you know salads go first and things like that   well its uh we have uh uh kind of a core group that that serves as quote officers of the organization and they plan the reunions they   right   organize the you know who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there whos going to rent the tables whos going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer uh and each year its done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles   thats pretty fancy   we have a biographer who who continues every year to save clippings on any family member and theyre entered into a a wonderful uh scrap book and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone And it keeps the family alive even you know even though its very fluid and theyre very dedicated to that   sure does thats wonderful   its been really wonderful it helps you hang on to your roots   yeah i wish wed   and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family his family was very scattered and very diverse   right   and i asked him i got to talking to him i said well how is his nephew doing well i dont know i havent talked to my brother in three years well hows your brother doing i dont know       um you know my son keeps in touch with him i think but i dont i said hey wouldnt you like to know whats happening with these people yeah but im you know its too much trouble   right   so i got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one   wow youre just uh oh thats incredible   to our place down at Lake Tawakoni liked to kill me because i had it was i didnt have that group cooperation i did it by myself   right   and uh nobody brought covered dishes we had a great big fish fry and you know i fixed a salad in a number three tub and  and uh   right   it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping and uh we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and i told him   have you have you done this repetitively or just once   we did it that year and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there we sent invitations we said please let us know if youre coming it was when uh his mother his step father had died the year before his mother was alone and so they came to support her and then one by one his brothers you know his sisters he began to lose family members   see thats weve we had a problem with that   and it was difficult to hold them together and then of course he died t wo years ago so and you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now   oh   and uh it i think thats what happens when they get scattered the the family unit you know falls into disrepair   right thats what was our problem we had uh the first reunion or the first you know major reunion was probably six or seven years ago and then the second reunion people who maybe you know   umhum   sacrifice things to come to the first one though oh well its not that big a thing this year and so it kind of wound down and then finally   uhhum umhum   youre lucky to get the Shreveport relatives there but no one else   uhhuh well see we manage those people who are at that core group manage to keep keep the vigor alive theyll send out news bulletins two or three times a year youll get a news bulletin hey guess who got   shows up   you know elected to the legislature or guess whos our local sheriff
