          uh yes i do believe that there is too much immigration now   well yeah  a well yeah living in Texas especially i see it  and and   did you well its not just that are there enough jobs for people here now   no no its terrible   and yet theyre letting more people in daily   yeah from everywhere too not just from Mexico you know just everywhere   yeah yeah i wasnt talking about just Mexico i was talking about Europeans the Eastern Block uh its terrible   yeah yeah i   theres and theres nothing we can do about it the government seems to do as they wish when they wish   yeah they dont ask us do they  no you know and its really hard i think on the immigrants because they come over here       all they you know thinking that theyre going to have money and jobs and success and everything and then they then there is no jobs and they end up homeless and not knowing anybody and no money and its terrible   yes living under a bridge so to speak now its true though that the bulk of of immigrants      yes   are successful   really and true how how how how do you figure   uh i saw it on the news uh i saw it on the news yes the bulk of immigrants legal immigrants to this country are successful you know they pay to end up as tax paying citizens   did you really   making uh above middle class income whatever that is in the the united states now   probably more than what im making  maybe i should become an immigrant and go somewhere else   well yeah you work for TI uh they say thats due to their work ethic now i dont know if thats true or not it just might be a matter of luck   well   but then America always has been for the immigrant   yeah well uh you know if it hadnt been for that i guess i wouldnt be here because  my family came from France and uh one side and one side came from Germany so   huh none of us would yeah there you know theres only a very few native Americans here   and then theyre treated rotten the actual Native Americans the Indians well theyve got they theyve got the worst deal around   yes they are well most of them youre right but then i drive through Riodosa and i think well not all of them have it desperately bad   ive never   you know youve youve driven by you know the Mountain Gods outside of Riodosa havent you   ive never been been out there   oh its beautiful country up there in the mountains of New Mexico   uhhuh   oh just just gorgeous and that inn is huge and but now uh like i say that one tribe is the exception not the rule   yeah   you know most tribes were treated dreadfully   yeah oh and still are   and still are yes   you know dont have good jobs and living on reservations alcoholics and oh its terrible it makes me really ill but ive never even been to Colorado   oh a native Texan   no a native Californian  but a twenty year Texan ive been here twenty years so   oh well im im im a native born Texan but uh you know how it is   yeah yeah   we go where the work is   thats true thats true well did you start with TI out here and then go to   uh in Lubbock   and oh okay and then went to Colorado   yeah in seventy four   so   so yes i am i am a long time TIer   so do you see a lot of uh well lets see whats in Colorado do you see a lot of immigrants of any kind like like we do here   uh the ones we see are Americans by marriage a huge number here in Colorado Springs theres an Air Force base and an army base   uhhuh   so theres people that marry GIs Korean Americans German Americans uh a few Japanese   oh okay yeah   few Chinese you understand   yeah yeah but then you know too on a its uh of course what i think about when we talk about immigrants i know theyre coming from everywhere but i think a lot about coming from Mexico because i guess im so close to that and if they close the well the borders are closed basically i mean theyre but we get all these people that come in illegally and stay   yeah well thats not really immigration   well no thats true its not but it is i mean theyre coming i mean weve weve got   yeah yeah you cant stop them and once theyre here to some extent we support them   theyre supposed to have all these laws passed where people arent supposed to hire illegal aliens and all this and whether thats working or not i dont know because i dont hear anymore about it   i dont either but uh what i suspect is that illegals were hired for a hundred and fifty years of Texas history i dont think they can stop it by a federal edict i dont think the federal government can stop it by making by waving their magic wand and saying it will happen no more its just too inbred in the culture you know     yeah   i grew up in Dumas and Lubbock and uh every roofing crew was illegal   i know  well all the restaurants here too at one time now its see how im not in the restaurant business anymore so i really dont know but at one time the whole kitchen crew and the busboys and everything were all illegals in in most of the restaurants i worked in as a waitress you know it whether that came to a halt i dont know   sure see uh still some migrant labor is legal you know   in California i know it is   it is in Texas too   is it too in Texas also i i didnt know   yes yeah during cotton harvest and whenever the the uh tomatoes and all are   but see theyll come in and do work that other people wont do now i dont know about this day and time when theres so many people out of work i know if i was out of work id do anything to make money   well   because its pretty scary when you own a home and you know   well the truth of the matter is i dont know what your home payments are but you couldnt make a living on what they earn   you could   you could not   you could not   have you seen how those poor people live   huhuh   migrant labor camps oh my God they live in cardboard boxes   oh its horrible isnt it   and these fine Americans take care of them   umhum see and they put their children to work and everything dont they   and i yes and i dont hold it against the people   no   theyre hard workers trying to make it   and no one and see Americans wouldnt do it wouldnt they wouldnt live like that   no   they wouldnt do it   no theyll theyll ask for a handout first   you couldnt get the street people i was just going to say you couldnt get these homeless people probably to do that i see them on corners with signs saying ill work for a meal but ill bet you if you stopped and you offered them a meal if theyd come and do your yard theyd get out of it some way they just really would   no no what theyre doing is theyre asking for handouts   thats right thats right   because if you took them into your home to to work in your yard or whatever theyd know where your house is and how to break in then   i know it   or now thats not true of all of them there are   but how do you know  the good from the bad   i i dont i dont know but im sure that times being as hard as they are and times are hard not everyones that way you know good people are being put out of jobs now   oh yes how well i know i was laid off last year but i was i was lucky because i was one of the first groups to go   from TI   well in in division one and i got uh went right to you know they have the job centers for us and everything and i just   oh so you dont oh and you got transferred to a different right   oh boy i worked hard through i went through the J O Bs and found this and was versatile enough had a little bit of office experience and they hired me and i was just real thankful and now theres nothing for all the people who are getting laid off now theres just nothing   yeah ive ive ive noticed   you know i know Colorado Springs has been hit also   uh rumors still persist i try not to believe them and listen to them but they still persist that the plant will close   i dont know i havent heard anything i dont hear much about Colorado Springs its kind of like theyre kind of trying to be invisible  forget about us forget about us   yeah so youre in division what now corporate corporate okay yeah that that must feel somewhat safer   im in in im in payroll division nine yeah corporate payroll so it didnt for a while there were a lot of rumors flying and uh i still hold a red badge and its still uh im still under five years so if they had a layoff in division nine   bumping and
