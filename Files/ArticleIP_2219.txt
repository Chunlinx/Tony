                                 Outrageous Fortune                           Outrageous Fortune                                       What a coincidence The Feb issue of Fortune magazine initiates a feature called the Fortune It is of all things a list of the  Americans who by the magazinescalculation gave the most to charity last year No doubt the editors ofFortune were completely unaware of a remarkably similar feature the                  Slate                 which this magazine has been publishing at intervalsfor a year and a half  Fortune published an unbranded list of  a yearago            To be sure the whole ideaof a list of the biggest givers originated with Ted Turner vice chairman ofTime Warner which publishes Fortune  And of course its a variant onthe venerable Fortune  list of biggest corporations via the Forbes  listof richest Americans the Animal Husbandry Quarterly  list of most prolificrodents and so on Still we did get there first If Fortune couldntresist ripping us off a bit of credit might have been nice                           Fortune s list is on the Web but were not even going to link to it Sothere Our                   Slate                 list from

        A couple of minidialogues inEMail to the Editors are worth calling to your special attention Paul Cameron originator ofthe statistic publicized by virtue expert William Bennett that gay males havean average life expectancy of  years defends and explains his calculation inresponse to a                   Slate                article by WalterOlson debunking it Olson redebunks right back

        Week about the New Economy Anyone who follows Krugmanat all will not be surprised to know that Paul responds unrepentant exceptfor having misspelled Shepards name which we guess is our fault too SorrySteve In fact Shepard and Krugman have been going at it in email since theexchange we published and its pretty darned interesting Were working onpersuading them to let us share the subsequent mail messages with you aswell                           InDefense of Crossfire                                                      The editor claims a fewcyberinches of this column on a point of privilege to defend his formeremployer                        Geraldine Ferrarosresignation as cohost of Crossfire  to run for the Senate from NewYork has occasioned the usual pokes at CNNs nightly politicalinterviewcumdebate program In just the past few days New York Times Walter Goodman characterized Crossfire as the CNN shout show andMaureen Dowd summarized Ferraros duties as blathering night after night withpolitical hacks            Ascohost of Crossfire for six and a half years  I am familiarwith the rap Its uncivilized its just show biz its not serious you alltalk at the same time no one gets to finish a sentence Pat Buchanan is amonster Bob Novak is a monster John Sununu makes me ill and they hearsimilar complaints apparently about the liberal hosts In the family ofpolitical talk shows Crossfire is considered the neerdowell cousinIn my Crossfire days I was patronized even by Sam Donaldson            Crossfire deserves more respect To start it is honest ina way the other shows are not Virtually all the political talk shows requirejournalists to adopt one of two dishonest postures agnosticism or omniscienceOn traditional QA shows like Meet the Press  journalists mustpretend that they are neutral observers who have no opinion about the subjectat hand This is not only dishonest but it also limits their ability to framesharp questions and to pursue evasive answers On opinionspouting shows likeThe McLaughlin Group  by contrast journalists often the samejournalists are free to have a point of view Indeed they are required tohave or to pretend to have a passionate and fully informed viewpoint on everysubject that comes along How many of those opining solemnly on the Indonesianfinancial crisis this past week know or care squat about Indonesianfinance                           Crossfire s basic fuel is the tendentious question As a host youneednt pretend to be impartial or pretend to be allknowing This is morehonest and its also more effective in getting at the truth Or at least thatis the premise of AngloAmerican jurisprudence which uses the same model Forthe neutralinterrogator approach try France One thing this method is not iseasy Walter Goodman smirks in the Times that Ferraros Crossfirejob was no doubt profitable and not arduous as these things go But its aheckuva lot more arduous to conduct in effect a nationally televisedcrossexamination than to spend night after night droning So Ms A what doyou have to say about what Mr B just said            Talkshow guests these days often have hadformal training in how to avoid answering questions and every yearold knowshow to deliver a prepackaged sound bite Guests are less likely to get awaywith that on Crossfire than on any other show Crossfire hostsnot only are freer to ask more pointed questions but theyre also free topoint out that a guest hasnt answered them to follow up two or three or fourtimes and ultimately either to extract an answer or to make vividly clear thatthe guest is ducking            There isnot nearly as much shouting on Crossfire as its reputation wouldsuggest But the show does get cacophonous sometimes to the point of makingthe discussion unintelligible Thats not on purpose Its the price ofCrossfire s approach The opposite approach has a price too Otherinterview shows may retain a smoother veneer of Socratic dialogue but theemphasis on maintaining a civilized atmosphere actually dulls the intellectualrigor of the discussion Many politicians who are regulars on the other showsdecline to appear on Crossfire  blaming the shouting Its not theshouting that scares them Its having to face a Pat Buchanan who will puncturetheir postures and snare their sound bites            For the hosts too Crossfire is a moreintellectually rigorous experience than the other showsor in a way thanprint punditry Where else does a pundit face one or more people dedicated todemolishing his or her arguments on the spot and making him or her look like afool Not on The McLaughlin Group  where opinions are flung into theMixmaster and issues race by like movie credits Not in the sedate andagreeable discussions on Washington Week in Review  And not in the pagesof the New York Times  where you may opine away with nothing moreimmediate to fear than a distant letter to the editor or at worst a politelydissenting oped piece            To be sure Crossfirecan be aggravating Theres the strain of finding something to argue about inevery big news event the artifice of dividing every controversy into two sideslabeled left and right There are the many points of argument and fact thatflit past undigested And of course theres the overtalk the producersterm for two three or four people talking at once Like all these showsCrossfire often falls for spin serves the establishment legitimizesphonies and in general misses the point completely But its no worse than theothers and in some ways its better            Anyone wanna argue withthat
