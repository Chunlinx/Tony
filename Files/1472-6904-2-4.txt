                    Background        The expression first pass metabolism FPM refers to        the metabolism that an ingested compound undergoes in its        passage through the gut and liver before reaching the        systemic circulation It is a useful concept for a drug        because it provides information about the relative        therapeutic effect of an orally administered drug relative        to its intravenous administration IV The standard        approach to quantitate FPM is to compare the area under the        curve AUC for equal IV and oral doses The fractional FPM        is then defined as the fractional difference in these two        areas                The mathematical basis of this definition is based on        the following arguments Given some time dependent input to        the systemic compartment It and some removal rate from        the systemic compartment Qt the integral over all time        of these two rates must be equal                If the removal rate has a linear dependence on        concentration Qt  KCt then this total input can be        related to the AUC                Since the total input to the systemic compartment is        proportional to the AUC eq  the fractional difference        in the AUC for an oral and IV dose eq  is a measure of        the amount of the oral drug that never reached the systemic        compartment because of FPM        This standard operational definition of FPM eq  is        crucially dependent on the assumption that the removal rate        is linear If this assumption is invalid then use of this        definition can return very misleading results A recent        review has described the confusion that has resulted from        applying this definition to human ethanol pharmacokinetics        a compound that has extremely nonlinear liver metabolism                   For the nonlinear case the intuitive idea that FPM is        equal to the fraction of the absorbed drug that is        metabolized in its first pass through the liver is no        longer valid     Consider the case where GI absorption        is occurring at a time when the systemic drug concentration        is so high that the liver metabolism is completely        saturated and the metabolic rate is constant independent        of concentration Clearly at this time the rate of drug        metabolism for an oral input must be identical to that for        an IV input so that FPM must be zero even though a large        fraction of the absorbed drug may be metabolized in its        first pass through the liver This metabolized GI component        is simply displacing systemic drug that would otherwise        have been metabolized        In order to avoid these problems Lieber and colleagues           introduced a new definition of FPM based on        estimating the Peripheral Availability PA of ethanol        The PA is defined as the total amount of ethanol that        reaches the systemic circulation Gentry et al           estimated the value of PA by assuming that the tail of the        IV ethanol venous concentration curve can be approximated        by a one compartment model in which the ethanol rate of        metabolism M was defined by a MichaelisMenten function        M  VmCKmC The values of Vm and Km are found by        curve fitting and then PA is defined as the integral of M        from time  to a long time when no ethanol is present        Thus PA is defined as the total amount of ethanol that was        metabolized from the systemic circulation The FPM is then        defined as the difference between the PA for an IV infusion        and the PA for the oral intake of an identical dose This        one compartment definition of FPM has become the standard        definition in some laboratories            This definition of FPM of Gentry et al    is        inaccurate because it is a poor approximation to treat        ethanol metabolism as a one compartment system see below        Levitt and Levitt    described an approach to estimate        PA using a two compartment model They distinguished the        liver ethanol that came directly from the GI tract from the        recirculating ethanol and derived an accurate        approximation for this recirculating component This         compartment approach provides a significantly more accurate        and smaller estimate of FPM than the one compartment        model        The  compartment model still makes some simplifying        assumptions These assumptions are eliminated in PKQuest            a new generalpurpose physiologically based        pharmacokinetic PBPK software routine The approach used        by PKQuest is to first use the IV input data to find the        PBPK parameters for ethanol and then using these        parameters solve for the time dependent IV input function        that would produce a blood time course identical to the        time course observed with the orally administered drug        This IV input function is a direct measure of the rate that        the oral dose reaches the systemic circulation ie the        PA Using as input just the PBPK parameters and the blood        ethanol levels produced by an oral dose PKQuest outputs        in both tabular and graphical form the time course of the        intestinal absorption and the PA see    for the        mathematical and computational details        The difficulty in defining the FPM of ethanol has        created a controversy over the question of the magnitude of        ethanol metabolism that occurs in the stomach before        reaching the liver     It has been observed that the        FPM is significantly reduced when ethanol is infused        intraduodenally compared to the standard oral        administration and this difference has been interpreted as        representing gastric mucosal metabolism              Clearly if there are errors in the measurement of FPM then        this estimate of gastric metabolism may be spurious In        addition to providing a value for FPM PKQuest also        provides a direct measurement of the rate and amount of the        orally administered solute that reaches the liver In this        paper PKQuest will be applied to investigations of human        ethanol pharmacokinetics providing information about the        FPM the time course of intestinal absorption and the        total amount of ethanol reaching the liver This is the        first human PBPK model for ethanol incorporating intestinal        absorption and FPM Pistino and Conolly    have        previously developed a rat PBPK that quantitated ethanol        FPM        The PKQuest program and all the examples used here are

the figures shown in this paper are direct          copies in jpeg format of standard PKQuest output          PKQuest makes several simplifying assumptions see             for details It is assumed that each organ can be          modeled as a single wellstirred compartment In          addition for the two solutes investigated in this paper          D            O and ethanol it is also assumed          that the bloodtissue exchange is flow limited so that          the unbound water concentration in the tissue is equal to          that in the vein leaving the tissue This is clearly an          approximation and effects such as diffusion gradients          countercurrent exchange and heterogeneous organ blood          flows      will produce small deviations from          this assumption                          Standard human parameters          The PBPK parameters used here are identical to those          used in all the other applications of PKQuest                The procedures used

   measurements of the Schloerb et al    of the          arterial serum concentration after a  second bolus          injection The results are for one experiment on one male          subject JO total body water of  liters Table I              The amount of D            O injected was back calculated from          the total body water and the concentration after           minutes when the D            O had equilibrated          A baseline ethanol PBPK model was developed based on          the careful and detailed measurements of Norberg et al             of the simultaneous breath and venous blood          concentrations for a  minute constant IV ethanol          infusion The concentration calculated from the breath          measurements was in good agreement with the direct venous          measurements The breath results were used here since          they should be closer to the ideal of an arterial sample          then the venous measurements from the cubital vein The          total body water for each subject in this study was          directly measured using D            O The time course of the mean          values for all  subjects figure      was          modeled using PKQuest The data of DiPadova et al             was used for the determination of the rate of absorption          of oral ethanol along with calculations of the PA and          FPM PKQuest was applied

     without a breakfast or IV on alternate days          The experimental data points were obtained by using          UNSCANIT Silk Scientific Corporation to read the data          from the published

determined by fitting the D            O data of Schoerb et al    in          which the arterial D            O concentration was measured after a           second venous injection of D            O As described previously              each compound modeled by PKQuest is characterized by a          short Maple wwwmaplesoftcomprocedure that lists the          model parameters that are unique for that solute The          procedure for D            O is very simple because it          corresponds to the default case so that very few          parameters have to be input          dschoerbproc

flow to optimize the fit to          the data using the Powell minimization procedure of          PKQuest The agreement between the PBPK prediction solid          line and the experimental measurements squares is very          good          This agreement is sensitive to the value used for the          muscle blood flow For example fig Bshows the effect          of doubling the total muscle blood flow from this          default best fit value of  to           litersminkg increasing the cardiac output from  to           litersmin for a  Kg man Muscle blood flow can          vary many fold and one would expect that it would depend          on the specific experimental conditions such as whether          the subject was supine or ambulatory In any case muscle          blood flow is routinely varied when fitting data with          PKQuest This variation may have some physiological          significance andor it may be just a fudge factor                          Standard Ethanol PBPK parameters          The recent measurements of Norberg et al    of          the time course of ethanol blood levels after an IV input          were used to determine the standard ethanol PBPK          parameters PKQuest was used to model the time course of          the mean blood values of the  subjects  men           women This data was expressed as the concentration in          the blood in units of millimolesliter of blood water          Both breath and direct venous sampling results were          reported and they were in very good agreement The          results shown in fig use the breath measurements since          they should be closer to the ideal of an arterial sample          then the venous measurements from the cubital vein The          PKQuest procedure that is

human The muscle blood flow was the same as the          default value that was used in fig Afor the D            O data Since liver metabolism          accounts for greater than  of ethanol removal it is          assumed that the liver is the only site of ethanol          elimination     The liver metabolic constants Vm            millimolesmin for  Kg man Km   mM were          adjusted using the Powell minimization procedure of          PKQuest to give the best fit to the data These values          refer to the free water concentration in the liver see             for details There are a number of isoenzymes of          alcohol dehyrogrenase ADH in the human liver and this          model Km of  mM is consistent with the in vitro Km of           mM observed for one of these isoenzyme     It          is assumed that ethanol distributes in the total body          water which is the default in PKQuest The parameter fw          lipid   represents the inverse of the oilwater          partition coefficient and indicates that the equilibrium          ethanol concentration in the body fat is  of the          concentration in body water     The ethanol dose was           gmKg given as a constant  minute infusion          corresponding to an infusion rate of  millimolesmin          for an  Kg human This Maple procedure          ethanolnorberg completely specifies the PBPK          parameters All the other model parameters are set by the          calls to defaultpar and standardhuman Figure shows          the output of PKQuest for this input Again the          agreement between the PBPK prediction for the arterial          blood concentration solid line and the observed breath          data squares is quite good                          Quantitation of ethanol first pass metabolism          FPM          DiPadova et al    measured the blood ethanol in          subjects that were given the same dose of ethanol either          IV  minute constant infusion or orally over           minutes on consecutive days Figure shows the venous          concentrations as a function of time when a low dose of          ethanol  gKg equivalent to approximately  oz of          beer was given at the same time as a standard breakfast          either IV black or orally red The area under the          oral dose curve is only  of that for the IV dose This          would correspond to a FPM of  if metabolism was linear           ie only  of the orally ingested ethanol reaches          the systemic circulation As will be shown below the          actual FPM is much less than this          The data in fig was analyzed using PKQuest Figure          Ashows the agreement between the PBPK model and the          venous plasma ethanol concentration for the IV input          data The PBPK parameters used in this calculation were          identical to those used for figure except that the          portal blood flow was increased  because of the          coincident meal       the liver Vm was increased          from  to  because of the induced ethanol effect              and the muscle blood flow was doubled Also the          parameter concunit vein was set   indicating that          the whole blood venous concentration was used as the          input data          Figure Bshows the output of PKQuest when the          findabsorption    option was applied to the oral          ethanol input data Since the IV and oral data used for          figs Aand Bwere collected in the same subjects under          identical conditions exactly the same PBPK parameters          where used for both calculations The open squares show          the time course of the predicted GI ethanol absorption          amount entering the liver in the portal vein              The solid line is a  parameter approximation to the          absorption data absorption at time t  A t Ht HT H          where A  total absorption H  Hill exponent T  half          time          It can be seen that the intestinal absorption fig          B is complete within about  hours The total predicted          absorption of  millimoles is slightly less than the          actual total oral dose of  millimoles Although this          is consistent with a small amount of gastric mucosal          metabolism  millimoles it is probably not          significant The calculation of the total absorption for          this low dose is critically dependent on the accuracy of          the venous blood measurements at long times Since the          liver has such a low Km  mM significant amounts of          intestinal absorption could be occurring at long times          even though the venous concentration remained close to          zero because of the high rate of liver clearance The          fluctuation in the total absorption points at long times          in fig Bis caused by errors in these long time blood          measurements          When the findabsorption option is used PKQuest also          routinely calculates the time course of the Peripheral          Availability PA indicated by the diamonds in fig          BThe PA is defined as the equivalent IV input that would          produce the observed venous concentration Thus an IV          input with the time course of the diamonds in fig          Bwould produce exactly the same blood concentration as a          function of time as the GI absorption represented by the          open squares PA is related to FPM by the relation FPM           Total Dose  PA Thus for the data used for fig B the          PA of  millimoles corresponds to a FPM of           millimoles total dose   This represents  of the          total dose about half the value of  using the          classical AUC approach          The FPM for this data was also estimated by using the          one compartment approach     Figure Ashows the          optimized one compartment MichaelisMenten fit to the          tail of the venous ethanol data Vm

model does not          provide an accurate fit to the ethanol data The fit is          better for the large input dose Using these values of Vm          and Km the PA was determined for the IV and oral dose by          assuming a one compartment model and integrating the          liver metabolism  VmCKmC where C equals venous          blood concentration over the time For the data of fig           this one compartment method yielded a FPM of  This          is less than the  estimated from the AUC but          significantly greater than the  using PKQuest          DiPadova et al    also measured the blood levels          resulting from an IV or oral input of a larger ethanol          dose  gmKg total dose of  millimoles for the           Kg model subject and this time they also compared the          fasting and standard breakfast case Figures Aand Bshow          the PKQuest output for the IV and oral data when the          ethanol was taken with the same standard meal as was used          for the data in figs Aand B The parameters were          identical to those used in figs except that the liver          Vm was reduced from  to  a different set of          subjects were used in the two sets of experiments It          can be seen from fig Bthat for this higher dose the          total peripheral availability diamonds is only about           millimoles less than the total dose of  millimoles          corresponding to a fractional FPM of  This is much          less than the FPM value of  determined by using the          AUC approach or of  using the one compartment          approach The time course of the intestinal absorption          for the two doses compare fig Band fig B has the          same shape eg same Hill coefficient but occurs over a          slightly longer time for the larger dose Hill half time            minutes for  gmKg dose and  minutes for           gmKg dose presumably because the larger oral dose was          ingested over a longer time  minutes for  gmKg          versus  minutes for  gmKg          Figures Aand Bshow the PKQuest output for the same          ethanol dose  gmKg given to fasting subjects The          PBPK parameters for these experiments had the portal          blood flow reduced back to the default fasting value          Also the liver Vm was reduced back to  the same          value that was used for the fasting data of Norberg et al             in fig  This change in ethanol metabolism is          consistent with earlier observations that the rate of          ethanol disappearance from the blood is increased by a          coincident meal      It can be seen in fig Bthat          the PA diamonds is nearly identical to the GI          absorption squares so that FPM is close to zero for the          fasting subjects The AUC and one compartment approach          also indicate a small FPM for this case                            Discussion and conclusions                  Validity of the PBPK model          The philosophy behind the use and development of          PKQuest differs from that of the standard PBPK          applications PBPK models have usually been applied to          animal data where it is possible to accurately measure          and control the relevant parameters tissue distribution          organ blood flows etc In contrast for human studies          not only are the PBPK parameters poorly characterized          but they are subject to large individual variation The          impetus behind PKQuest is to try and develop a standard          set of human PBPK parameters that can be applied in the          absence of this detailed information For this reason          the application of PKQuest to human data should be          regarded as a first approximation          Since muscle represents roughly  of the body mass          the muscle blood flow which can vary  fold or more          depending on experimental conditions is the single most          important PBPK parameter and the parameter that limits          the accuracy of the PBPK model The pharmacokinetics of D                     O or other tracers of water are          especially simple since the rate of elimination is very          slow and it distributes simply in the organ water As          shown by figs Aand B the D            O kinetics are sensitive to the          muscle blood flow and the data of Schloerb et al             was used to determine the resting muscle blood flow value           litersminKg for the standardhuman Although          it is problematical to base such an important parameter          on just one set of measurements on one subject this          represents the only published measurement of this type          that I could find It is also an approximation to treat          the muscle as a single compartment with a uniform blood          flow and in some human PBPK models    two muscle          compartments resting and working are included For          the PKQuest modeling the muscle blood flow is usually          treated as an adjustable parameter and not as a strictly          determined PBPK constant          The ethanol data that was modeled are the mean values          averaged over a number of individuals Because of the          nonlinear nature of the pharmacokinetics it is an          approximation to treat these mean values as          representative of an equivalent average human              However it should provide a first approximation to the          PBPK parameters of an average human For the common          case where the published mean values are the only data          that is available there is no other option          In the PKQuest modeling of ethanol it is assumed that          ethanol distributes freely in the tissue water This          seems like a reasonable assumption given the          physicalchemical properties of ethanol Measurements of          plasmawhole blood concentration ratios show that this          assumption is valid for red blood cells     However          Norberg et al     has shown that the ethanol          volume of distribution estimated using a  compartment          model is significantly less than the total water volume          and they have reviewed the literature that suggests that          the tissue ethanol distribution may be restricted          Despite this the agreement between PKQuest results and          the Norberg et al data figure  indicate that this          assumption is a useful approximation given the          limitations of using the mean data                          Ethanol first pass metabolism and intestinal          absorption          The definition of FPM implemented in PKQuest is both          rigorous and intuitive It is based on defining a time          dependent peripheral availability PA that is equal to          the rate of IV input that would produce the observed time          course of the plasma ethanol concentration This PA is a          direct quantitative measure of the amount of ethanol that          has reached the systemic circulation The FPM is then          defined as the difference between the total dose          administered and the PA The classical procedure of          determining FPM from the AUC eq markedly          overestimates the FPM For the case of the small ethanol          dose  gmKg taken with a meal the AUC estimate of          fractional FPM of  was about twice the value           obtained using PKQuest For the higher dose  gmKg          the error was even larger  versus  Although the          more recent one compartment approximation provides a          better estimate of FPM it is still significantly larger          than the PKQuest values  versus  for  gmKg          dose and  versus  for  gmKg dose          The error in both these approximations to FPM results          primarily from the fact that the systemic appearance of          the oral ethanol taken with a meal is slow compared to          the  minute constant infusion that was used to obtain          the IV AUC Since the liver ethanol metabolism saturates          at low concentrations the shorter dose will have a          higher average blood concentration and a corresponding          lower value of fractional metabolism The error would be          less if the time course of the oral absorption was          similar to that of the IV input This explains why the          AUC calculated FPM    was greatly reduced when the          subjects were fasting so that the gastric emptying rate          was increased and GI absorption was more rapid compare          figs Band B and closer to the rate of IV infusion          The critical dependence of the AUC on the rate of          systemic ethanol input was first pointed out by Wagner              He showed that the AUC for the oral input was          equal to or even larger than the IV AUC if the IV          infusion was administered at a slower rate for  hours          than the rate of intestinal absorption          Failure to appreciate the problems inherent in using          the AUC or one compartment method to measure FPM has led          to the concept that the gastric mucosa metabolizes a          significant fraction of oral ethanol Lieber and          colleague observed that the FPM was reduced when          ethanol was infused intraduodenally compared to the          standard oral administration and concluded that the          difference must have resulted from gastric mucosa          metabolism      This decreased FPM for the          intradudenal dose is probably a result of the much more          rapid time course of absorption when the ethanol is          administered directly into the duodenum PKQuest provides          a direct estimate of the amount of ethanol reaching the          liver As shown by figs B Band B the total amount          of absorbed ethanol reaching the liver does not differ          significantly from the total oral dose indicating that          gastric mucosa metabolism is negligible          In addition to providing a direct measure of PA and          FPM PKQuest also provides for the first time          quantitative information about the rate of intestinal          absorption of an orally administered drug that has          nonlinear metabolism A comparison of figs Band          Bprovides a dramatic view of the decreased rate of          ethanol absorption when it is accompanied by a meal In          the fasting state ethanol is almost completely absorbed          within  minutes fig B while the ethanol          administered with a standard breakfast takes  or more          hours for complete absorption fig B Levitt et al             simultaneously measured the rate of human gastric          emptying and ethanol blood concentration with and without          a meal and concluded that the rate of ethanol absorption          was primarily limited by the rate of gastric emptying          The similarity between the time course of ethanol          absorption seen in figs Band Band the gastric emptying          time course observed by Levitt et al    supports          this conclusion                          Simulation of ethanol blood levels after oral          intake          Another feature of PKQuest is that it provides a          simple interface that can be used to make quantitative          predictions of the blood levels produced by different          oral doses As shown in figs B Band B PKQuest          routinely fits the time course of the intestinal          absorption with a  parameter Hill type equation          Absorption at time t  A t Ht HT H where A  total          absorption H  Hill exponent T  half time This           parameter input function can then be used as the input          into PKQuest For example the intestinal absorption          input function that was determined for the  gmKg dose          of ethanol ingested with a meal see fig B can be used          for a model simulation using the following settings for          finput

Hill          coefficient hn of  and a half time tend of           minutes Figure shows that the simulated blood          level for this input function solid line slightly          underestimates the peak value but otherwise is in good          agreement with the experimental data squares that was          used to determine this input function In Figure this          feature is used to illustrate the dramatic effect of a          concomitant meal on the blood levels resulting from an          oral intake The figure shows the blood levels for an          oral intake of  millimoles of ethanol
