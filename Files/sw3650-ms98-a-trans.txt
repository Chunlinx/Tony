        kind of a heavy topic tonight right about uh     thats you have to start the new year out by the way Happy New Year   thank you same to you what do you think about the uh  that idea that theyre recommending for the young people   i hadnt really heard that before um   uhhuh   i had at one point thought about doing the Peace Corps myself many years ago um   yeah   you know many years ago it seemed like they had uh um involuntary enlistment and mainly like in the fifties i know a lot of uh men that were into the military you had to go into the military   uhhuh   um i dont know about that a lot of people i dont think would like it because its gonna interrupt college plans but a lot of people dont have plans so for them it might give them a little help to uh   uhhuh   get uh some kind of more awareness about the world and be of some use for a while   uhhuh i i personally think it would be a a good idea um  i have kind of a same well its not a really a Peace Corps experience its a little bit similar you may assume that being from Utah member a member of the Mormon church and we do a lot of missionary work and i spent two years when i was nineteen in Argentina   umhum umhum um   and uh ill tell you that gives you a different perspective of uh you know some of the things we have here in this country that uh people really uh dont appreciate and seeing a different culture and uh getting to know a kind of a different a different people i think was a good experience for anyone regardless of uh you know their particular  endeavor theyre engaged  engaged in i think just getting out of the country is a great benefit to anyone so have you ever lived abroad or spent anytime outside of the United States   umhum i havent no but um i had known of the Peace Corps because i had a cousin in the Peace Corps course you know it was much more publicized in the sixties i dont even know if they have it today   uhhuh yeah   i had a friend though in the seventies join uh Vista   uhhuh   which is a similar program although you stay within the US which can be very beneficial too i mean a lot of times theres a lot of help we can do within the US um and that   yeah oh sure you bet   it program i thought was excellent   umhum   um i just dont think they even i dont know if they have those programs anymore or if they even try to publicize it and recruit and i think thats a shame because both of those programs programs are excellent and uh hopefully dont   and i it seems like they excuse me but it seems like they used to advertise it on TV in the the Peace Corps   i dont remember i just i havent seen it recently   yeah so   not that you know not down here any i dont  i dont remember seeing anything about Vista or or the Peace Corps recently   umhum well i think it would be a good idea is a it is kind of a delicate time but by the same token at that age they havent really settled down dont have a family or other commitments as well and so theres some divantages to going at that particular time in your life   right right   and uh well well  i think   yeah i think it would be extremely beneficial to just about everybody   yeah   um i i could see that thered be some people that you know would throw up their arms about it and go im going to Harvard and i you know this isnt something i wanna do but       uh youre right it would give everybody a better perspective of uh you know ourselves and what we have maybe make us appreciate  what we have a little more so   yeah umhum yeah thats thats certainly my was my experience just uh it was like the the uh clock had been turned back about ten or fifteen years   umhum   you know just the difference in the technologies in the two countries the  kinds of cars they drove the you know simple things like  central heating and uh and having a gas fired um water heater you know things that that we really appreciate are are not commonplace in in every uh in every uh city that i was uh living in   um right i had uh twice now been a big sister  youve heard of big brothers big sisters   uhhuh yeah   and uh i have had uh two little sisters and even though they were local to me it was almost being in a different world because both of my sisters little sisters came from very poor backgrounds   uhhuh   and of course they dont have usually normal families i mean  theres not a a mother and a father and   yeah right   they live in pretty poor housing and um their education is very lacking because their parents you know dont uh  encourage them to go to school   umhum   um so that was beneficial to me as well as the child because uh made me appreciate my background a little more and i helped to give this person um  a more one on one idea of there can be a different life than what theyve had and it to uh experience some things that otherwise they wouldnt be able to get out and do   umhum yeah  is that uh a program where youre you uh commit for a certain number of  months or or you youre assigned a  a child and you you stay with them for as long as you can   its usually a year um and they try to find somebody in the local area to you and um you know the age group that you wanna work   uhhuh
