                so what magazines do you subscribe to   uh the only one i subscribe to well i did subscribe to two i subscribe to INC at the office   umhum   and then i get Cosmopolitan at home   oh thats kind of fun   yeah it gives me a little variety anyway   yeah well thats fun thats kind of fun well we have like every magazine in the world my dad is kind of a chronic magazine subscriber he gets uh   oh really   oh gosh Bird Watcher Digest and i mean just almost  anything any interest he ever has for like a week he will subscribe to the magazine of it   wow     so we have got every magazine that that there is and then i get uh New Yorker because i like the the literature in it and um   yeah   uh uh i read Newsweek and US News   yeah   i like Newsweek   yeah they are always real interesting i remember even in high school that was one of our assignments to read Newsweek and i kind of got hooked on it then and then um through college then i kind of had too many other things going on   oh yeah yeah i understand when i first got in college my dad       set up subscriptions for all these magazines because he could get them at the student cheap rate that we had   oh wow   tons of magazines   thats neat well do you spend a lot of time reading them or do you just pick out what you want     i pick pick out what i want usually   yeah   read uh  read those cartoons in the New Yorker read the little synopsis find out who died in Newsweek and look at like celebrity pictures and im not     yeah   the best informed person i guess but       uh you know if there is a news name that you dont know you can flip through the Newsweek and try to find who it is   yeah   that is a little bit helpful but   oh thats neat well um i read the INC magazine mainly for my company my company its not my company personally obviously but uh   umhum   we have been selected as INCs top five hundred for the last two years yeah so its really its exciting to see your name in print and they do um   oh thats great yeah   the other things that i read are kind of they are all computer related because thats what my company is about but um   right   they are not really magazines they are periodicals but i do not know if they would really qualify as magazines i guess so because they have advertising and news print so   right are they like PC World or beyond that   yeah that stuff and Mainframe Journal and Computer World all that boring stuff but its stuff you got to keep up with or else you you start falling behind     right i know yeah that sounds good   and then yeah its real funny because my husband um gives me trouble still about getting Cosmopolitan and because thats mainly or not mainly but i think he thinks as it   uhhuh   as more of a single girls magazine type of thing and i am like well i am going to get this until i start getting like uh Better Homes and Gardens   really until you start getting those old magazines that   yeah i cant see that   Retirement Digest   yeah   so i said that ill keep subscribing to a magazine until i started wanting to get Readers Digest and then at that point if you just cut it off   yeah that and Parenthood and   really Golf Digest its   yeah really   these are the bad signs   i cant see any of those   so i dont know where i dont what we do with all our magazines we probably   you recycle them   cut down all all well we do we take them to the library and they sell them there you can not recycle the shiny paper of the magazine   oh really yeah yeah   so we recycle everything but the paper of the magazines go back to the library and they resell them which i cant imagine who would want like back issue of Newsweek but   well   i guess maybe there are people in the world   all those people doing all that research   thats right people can get them and have their children do craft projects cut the pictures out and     well when i i was doing some research for a product i was doing at the office and i went to the library and read the magazines on the microfiche which was really pretty neat   oh which is bad i dont like those microfiche i i we had this last year of school i had my last paper of college and i am writing this paper on Bette Midler i was decided i was not going to be very academic finally and uh   yeah   but you had to look through all these old periodicals and use microfiche and i just got seasick the little things zipping by your face so it was   oh yeah     i just thought i was going to throw up right there in the library it was       not a good day   well   so   i guess i went slow enough that it did not make me nauseous   yeah well they have like the the automated machines now you just press the button and the   oh and it zooms   words just go zipping by and   oh yeah i do not think i could do with that   it its bad uh   but it was really neat cause i was doing this this project i had to read American Demographics which you know i had never even knew that magazine existed but it had some really neat stuff in it   right yeah thats um we did a lot of demographic stuff at school   huh i was amazed i did not know that kind of magazine was even out there   i know its something you never thought you would care about there is perhaps a magazine for every interest in the world   yeah cause even like in the grocery store you know i do not ever go over and look at the magazines but i was getting some pictures developed at the grocery store and it was taking longer so i was hanging out over there and i was amazed at the different kinds   umhum   yeah there is its a lot out there we have Modern Maturity that was the worse mom and dad dad turned fifty so we got Modern Maturity         like this is not good       it has all these like health tips and ways to fix prunes and   oh really oh God   what a good magazine   oh that would be awful   so yeah and so we are   i do not know what my parents get i think uh my dad is retired Army so i know that they get something along those lines   right   but uh and he is real big into genealogy but i dont know if there is any genealogy magazines   oh no doubt there is i am sure im sure of it   really yeah well that is probably true i had not thought about that   theirs i never knew all the specific things they had in magazines     yeah they are fun though i mean at least it kills time while you are at the doctors office     i know really all the try do the word find in Highlight magazine     oh yeah i was real surprised though my doctor carries tons of magazines i mean he has like Tennis World and i mean stuff that normally i mean a doctors usually have US News or World Report and People magazine and that is about it   right my doctors have the worst magazines i   really   have to change doctors but then i might need to get that   you want my doctors name  well i mean if you get that many at home you probably would not want them   i know um were not at any loss for reading material here you you pretty much you can read like the table of contents before the next one comes and then     yeah i bet you are youre   that there is like a big pile these are the magazines we are going to read sometime and so its     yeah your mailman is probably not real happy with yall huh   no i uh no  get we have the jumbo truck that comes by our house to drop off the mail       oh wow   its a mess but       thats okay we keep the publishers  magazine publishers in business   yeah really   in the midst of the recession were       supporting Americas publishing economy   yeah well thats what a friend of mine um was getting the Wall Street Journal and she wasnt taking the time to read it so she just had this huge pile and we were like what are you doing saving up for a puppy   umhum really       line a bunch of bird cages   yeah really   with that okay well i guess thats about all on magazines nice talking with you have a good evening sorry to interrupt your dinner  bye   well okay well you too thanks you too thats fine byebye
