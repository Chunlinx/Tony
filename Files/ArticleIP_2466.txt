                                 FundRaising Phone Tag            Nothing exposes the sham atthe heart of the campaignfinance hearings like the obsession over what type ofphone was used to solicit contributions The phone rule asks not howmuch money was promised over the line It asks what kind of phonewas used in the solicitation Was a cellular phone used Thats kosher Carphone Thats OK too A phone in a rented room steps away from the CapitolStill OK In the office Off with your head and into the arms of an independentcounsel            Meanwhile as the hearingsmade headlines the Republicans delivered a billion tax break to thetobacco industry which just happened to have given the party  millionDont expect congressional hearings on that giveaway while the Republicans havephone calls to prosecute            Thiscurrent phone obsession illustrates our declining standard of behavior forWashington politicians We once imposed sanctions on them for theirimproprieties Then we started punishing them for the appearance ofimpropriety Today well tolerate almost any outrage as long as itsperpetrators maintain the appearance of propriety Genuine propriety wouldstill be nicer But in its absence we settle for politicians who abide by therules like the phones rules which are devised to cloak impropriety inpropriety            Most scholars and the Congressional Research Servicebelieve that the Pendleton Actthe law Republican senators believe prohibitsofficeholders from calling from federal property for donationsdoesnt applyto the president and vice president Whats more the act which was passedonly a few years after Alexander Graham Bells invention didnt reallyenvision phones The legislation was designed to keep elected officials fromusing the majesty of their surroundings to shake down visitors or employeesTodays potential donor doesnt know if a politician is calling from theCapitol or the carand he doesnt much care The ethics committees of theHouse and Senate have spelled out very specific rules for members tofollowone of which prohibits making or taking fundraising calls All thisexcess of zeal in using the right phones at the right time lets members ofCongress pretend theyre cleaning up the system without actually stemming theflow of money            This guile over whatconstitutes a legal solicitation explains the existence of several hotsheethotels on Capitol Hill where some lawmakers go to makeand takeall theirfundraising calls About  steps from the portal of the Rayburn House OfficeBuilding on the second floor of the annex to the offices of the RepublicanNational Committee stands a maze of cubicles separated by padded tealgreendividers of the type you see separating the operators who take your call forthe Ginsu knives Between less pressing businesslike running thecountrymembers of Congress hunch over foot wide slabs of Formica workingup a sweat dialing as many donors as they can Like most of us they rarelyreach their prey on the first try If theyre lucky Mr Moneybags returns thecall but usually by that time the importuning politician is back in hisCapitol office Does he put up his feet and take the call from Moneybags whenMoneybags is ready to talk Or does he race down the stairs and cross thestreet to his padded cell and call his benefactor back You be the judge            Itsabsurd to think everyone uses the setup for dialingso many members so littlespaceand most members fudge when asked pointblank Rep Dan Burton chairingthe House investigation into finance abuses had to equivocate when asked twoweeks ago whether he hadnt indeed taken fundraising calls in his office Icant say never  many times they potential donors will call back at youroffice and therein as Shakespeare said lies the rub             A number of members have admitted that theytake and make the calls from the Capitol Sen Phil Gramm cash is acandidates best friend bragged in an interview about raising money from hisoffice using a credit card When challenged on the legality of that he pointedout correctly that the Justice Department had never prosecuted anyone under thelaw so the Ethics Committee stood down There were calls to hold an inquiry atthe time but according to the Wall Street Journal  the matter diedbecause Sen Mitch McConnell adamantly opposed opening an investigation becauseso many other senators were probably guilty of the same thing A former staffmember of Sen Al DAmatos says that when a donor called the New Yorker usedto try to stretch the phone cord into the bathroom like a teenager trying tokeep his parents from overhearing his conversation A consultant to Sen DonNickles the pitbull questioner at Sen Fred Thompsons hearing says that hewitnessed Nickles taking calls from potential donors in his office Sen BobSmith considering running for the Republican nomination for president lefthis office number on an answeringmachine message asking for a donation Whenit was reported Smiths office said it was a onetime mistake Politicalcrossconsultant Dick Morris said on CNN Would you like me to embarrass  ofmy former clients by telling you when I sat in their offices and they madefundraising phone calls            Congressmay have agreed that calls should be made from an annex but the executivebranch never did In the immortal words of Vice President Al Gore there is nocontrolling legal authority that says elected officials cant make calls fromfederal property Putting aside the fact that both he and the president live onfederal property the Congressional Research Service and a host of other legalscholars said that the law does not apply to phoning from either office            Of course officeholders shouldnt dial for dollars fromtheir official digs Not because dialing is evil but because they shouldnt behustling money at all As long as members of Congress continue to divertattention from the fact that money flows in at the same rate that favors flowout the televised fight over their fundraising methodologies will allowthem to pretend theyre reforming the system            Meanwhile the Capitol is upfor sale Operators are standing by
