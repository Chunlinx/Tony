                uh so my favorite team is about the Rangers   is it id have to agree with that theyre my favorite team too been a little disappointing the last few years   yeah im telling you you think theyll sign Ruben   you know   no   i really dont i just dont think you know with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money twenty seven or  twenty nine million or whatever it was i just dont think that theyre gonna be able to sign Ruben Sierra and its just gonna be a shame for you know our area   right yeah i think its gonna have a big effect if they dont on the other uh Hispanic players   oh i do too i just the main thing is that   i think thats gonna be the big problem   its just gonna have an effect on the the team you know   right   we just cant seem to you know i think weve been in this spot i think we finished second once or maybe even twice i dont know i   yeah   i havent been to a baseball game in a couple of years just its just too disappointing i just watch them fall every year   right   i was a Pete Incaviglia fan and uh   oh   i liked him but of course i understand baseball decisions are all just decisions like that have to be made by someone glad its not me making them   right i think theyre just want a stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here     well they say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentinell be there   but right right yeah   so and thats the name of the game too you got to make money you know they pay these players so much money now its just   right right   its frightening you and i should be so lucky to you know to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that   thats true but uh theyre talking about trading him if theyre not able to sign him and uh use the money that it would take  to sign the guy you know to pay for pitchers or you know what it what it what they what else they need because theyve got the hitting but they need the pitching   yeah they really do   um   i think they uh i think they need them all i just dont understand i understand the big cities like in New York or LA or somewhere because big cities and you know a guy a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a   oh i know   at a at a mens clothing store or something or sporting goods store but i realize the difference but i just dont understand   yeah its sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working you know your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game   oh i know i tell you     thats real aggravating but   but i one thing i dont understand is why a group you know headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them because i tell you we need a winner in this town looks like our Cowboys are coming back but   thats right   so thats thats going to be a big help to Dallas but you know in the past half a dozen years all weve had is the uh   its always got yeah its always   yeah the soccer team   its always wondered me why i mean they act as though this area is not you know a big metropolitan area but you think wed someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the the the players we need   oh i know thats a   just real aggravating to  because ive lived here you know since well i was born and raised here so ive been a Ranger fan since about seventy seven so its a lot of losers  its about to get you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever you know   oh i know ive been one yeah ive been ive lived here since seventy four and ive really been a Ranger fan for the longest time and excuse me i dont miss a time picking up the morning paper and checking the box scores i mean i follow them and i follow them like i follow the Mavericks and like i follow the Cowboys but and i want to see them win because   right   you know damn it they the fans deserve it i mean it you know we have pretty uh great fans to put two million people in that stadium   right im telling you   i love Nolan Ryan i guess you probably love him too   right i think this townd go crazy if they ever got a even a playoff team time i mean it would be packed and they got that new stadium theyre building so at least at least thatll be exciting  when we get that but   oh i do too it will well where do you think theyre heading this year   uh its hard to say its gonna be depending on where the what they do with Ruben Sierra and uh i mean im getting tired of them going into each year saying you know Bobby Witts the answer and Kevin Browns the answer and man thats getting old you know these guys have been pampered i mean   right   its time to to either you know put out or shut up   yeah Bobby Witt gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever and they have the later ten game winning streak and they give him all kinds of money and then he just goes right down the tube   and right and and Valentine and Greave theyre about to get you know theyre about to get old but i like this Sandy Johnson
