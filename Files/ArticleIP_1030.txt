                                 Clintons Drug War            Republicans charge thatPresident Clinton has forsaken the war on illegal drugs They plan to make thisan issue in the fall campaign  How has American drug use changedduring the Clinton presidency  How has government drug policychanged  Is there any connection                           Drug use amongteenagers has risen steadily in recent years According to the best studyIn early   percent of high school seniors reported having used anillicit drug during the previous year up from  percent in early  Butthis rise began before Clinton took office Reported teenage drug usestarted climbing during the last year of the Bush presidency after a dozenyears of decline In early  the figure was  percent                           Marijuana isdriving these numbers In early   percent of seniors reported havingsmoked pot or taken hash during the previous year up from  percent in early But teens also report using more LSD up from  to  percentmore inhalants up from  percent to  percent and more crystalmethamphetamine  or ice up from  percent to  percent All theseincreases began during the third or fourth year of the Bush administrationMany drug experts believe that teen drug use today portends a higher rate ofadult drug addiction in a decade                           Adult drug use hasbarely changed during the Clinton years In   million Americansreported having used an illegal drug during the previous year up a tick from million in  But a previous rapid decline has stopped Reported adultdrug use fell by half during the s from a high of nearly  million usersin  The number of hardcore cocaine and heroin usersbetween  million and  million has been stable during the Clinton yearsBut methamphetamine speed deaths more than doubled between  and and experts believe the drug is gaining popularity            Thebest available FBI numbersnone of which are much goodsuggest that drugcrime has neither surged nor receded during the past three years Federalstate and local arrests for drug offenses rose slightly to  million in The number of drugrelated murders fell a tiny bit in  and                           Drug policy The federal government will spendabout  billion on drug programs in fiscal  divided among departments and dozens of agencies The drug czars office officially known asthe Office of National Drug Control Policy is supposed to coordinate thisspending State and local governments disburse another odd billion to fightdrugs most of it on police and prisons            Clinton drug policy hasbarely differed from Bush drug policy in either scope or action Total federaldrug spending has increased every year of the Clinton presidency though moreslowly than it did under Bush and Reagan Drug spending rose  percent duringthe Bush years from  billion in  to  billion in  Total federalspending by contrast rose only  percent during that period Most of thedrugspending increase occurred during the first two years of the Bushadministration During Bushs last year drug spending rose only  percentUnder Clinton drug spending has risen  percent in three years comparedwith an increase of  percent in the federal budget as a whole But Clintonhas asked for a  percent increase to  billion in fiscal             UnderClinton the United States spends about twothirds of federal drug money onsupply reduction and onethird on demand reduction the same ratio as underBush Prevention programs receive about  billion every year roughly thesame as they did under Bush Criminaljustice costs eat  percent of the drugbudget about the same percentage as they did under Bush The Bushadministration opposed federal funding of needleexchange programs TheClinton administration has continued that policy            Two policy shifts have occurred under Clinton First theadministration cut spending for interdiction and international supplyreduction from  billion in  to  billion in  But the Clintonadministration has had the same success or lack of it interdicting drugs asits predecessors Cocaine seizures averaged  tons annually from through  exactly the same as during Bushs presidency And the fedsare seizing more heroin and marijuana than they did underBush                           Drug prices havefallen slightly in the last three years But given the global supply gluttheUS government seized about a ton of heroin in  compared with worldwideheroin production of  tonsmany experts question whether interdiction hasany effect on street prices In any event Clinton is now reversing theinterdiction cuts He has asked Congress to increase interdiction funding by percent and international program funding by  percent in             SecondClinton hasnt used the bully pulpit to speak out against drug usenearly as often as his two predecessors did The drug issue hasnt figured highon the presidents domestic agenda until this year            Drugpolicy experts and social scientists seem to agreethat social and cultural factors are driving up teen drug use A decadeago kids were bombarded by antidrug messages Journalists and filmmakersrelentlessly publicized the horrors of crack addiction and drug violence thedeath of college basketball star Len Bias in  drove home the dangers ofcocaine Nancy Reagans Just Say No campaign and the Partnership for a DrugFree America propagandized ceaselessly about the perils of drugs            In  the big three TVnetwork newscasts aired  stories about the issue By  that figure hadplummeted to  The Gulf War drove drugs off the newscasts and the storynever returned The Bush and Clinton administrations kept spending billions ondrug prevention but the frenzy of the s dissipated and the culturechanged Rock and hiphop music increasingly celebrate marijuana and otherdrugs Television radio and print outlets are donating less time and space toantidrug advertising Surveys suggest that baby boomers many of them formermarijuana users themselves may be reluctant to warn their kids aboutdrugs            To the extent that apresident can and should keep the drug issue at a roiling boil in society atlarge President Clinton has not done so            A summary of
