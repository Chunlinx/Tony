                    Introduction        AS is an inflammatory rheumatic disease mainly involving        the axial skeleton Forty percent of AS patients develop        periphery monooligoarthritis          The SM of inflamed peripheral joints in AS Fig  in        certain cases resembles RA with intense mononuclear cell        infiltration forming foci similar to germinal centers GC        that contain B and T lymphocytes as well as plasma cells           Recent immunohistologic analysis of five AS SMs        demonstrated B cell rich infiltrates in two cases whereas        no B cells were detected in the three others          The VH germline repertoire consists of          functional VH segments subdivided into seven VH families        see supplementary material Antibodies are encoded by one        VH segment rearranged to one or several of  heavy chain        diversity segments DHs and one of six JHs   The locus        of rearrangement individual for each B lymphocyte clone        is the CDR   Only rearrangements with translatable        nucleotide triplets lead to antibody formation others are        nonfunctional There is a biased use of particular germline        VH genes in the VH repertoire An overrepresentation of        VH genes in the autoimmune repertoire has been described           A negative selection of VH takes place in the        peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy individuals as a        means of avoiding autoimmunity          An antigendriven immune response characterized by a        ratio of mutations leading to amino acid replacement to        silent mutations RS ratio    within the        complementarity determining region CDR takes place        within the GC of lymphatic organs Similar clonal        development of antibody VH genes has been demonstrated in        the SM in RA patients       and in reactive        arthritis ReA patients   The B cell subset in AS        joints has not yet been characterized We analyzed the        repertoire and distribution of rearranged VH genes to        elucidate B lymphocyte involvement in AS and to        investigate similarities to and differences from RA                    Materials and methods                  Tissue preparation and staining          A SM of the right hip was obtained from a yearold          man who had suffered from AS for  years requiring          total endoprothetic joint replacement Frozen sections           m of the immediately snapfrozen tissue sample were          screened for B and T cells by double immunohistological          staining with antiCD and antiCD monoclonal          antibodies using the alkaline phosphataseantialkaline          phosphatase and streptavidin biotin horseradish          peroxidase technique    The stained B lymphocytes          from serial sections taken at m intervals were          isolated by microdissection and DNA preparation followed          see supplementary material                          VH PCR          DNA was subjected to a seminested PCR for VH genes          see supplementary material Thirtyfive cycles of PCR          using a mix of six oligonucleotides specific for the          different VH families as primers at the  end and a mix          of oligonucleotides corresponding to the known JH          overlapping to a part of the intron sequence as primers          at the  end were followed by  cycles with  l of          the first PCR products and individual VH and JH primers          at a more  position  Table  A similar PCR without          DNA was run as a negative control                          Template generation and sequence analysis          PCR products of the expected  base pair bp length          were detected by standard agarose gel electrophoresis and          purified The purified DNA template was bacterially          subcloned followed by plasmid isolation and sequencing          Sequences were analyzed by homology comparison with the          EMBL and GenBank gene databases see supplementary          material                            Results                  The VH gene usage          Except for the negative control all VH PCRs led to a          product of the expected length  bp All sequences          reported in the present paper are accessible on the EMBL          database          Seventy individually rearranged VH genes were          characterized by sequence analysis Table             belonged to the VH family   to VH   to          VH   to VH and   belonged to the VH          family No sequences corresponded to VH Fig           Twelve genes in all were nonfunctionally rearranged          with the highest proportion in VH  about  in          VH VH and VH and none in VH                          VH genes          Fourteen individual rearrangements represented VH          genes The most often represented VH gene was DP four          products followed by DP DP DP and DP two          products each Out of  distinct VHDHJH sequences           were nonfunctional  CDR lengths varied between           and  bp mean  bp          Four of the VH products Fc Fa Fb and          cm deriving from different slides had an identically          rearranged CDR and consecutively represent members of an          expanding B lymphocyte clone Fig a With  homology          to DP they shared three mutations within the framework          region FR          Five productively rearranged genes were highly mutated          with a range of  Fa to  mutations to their          respective germline gl gene The RS ratio for the CDR          was  and lower for the FR indicating antigendriven          mutation                            VH genes          Three different VH rearrangements were determined          All were potentially functional and   homologous          to the respective gl gene The number of mutations ranged          from  cVHs to  cVHs RS ratios were quite          low with a maximum of  in the CDR cVHs CDR          lengths varied between  and  bp mean  bp                          VH genes          Thirtyeight different VH rearrangements were          characterized eight were most homologous to DPV           five to DP  four each to DP and DP           respectively and three each to DP DP DP          and DP  respectively Seven  VH genes were          nonfunctionally rearranged CDR lengths varied from  to           bp mean  bp          One case of clonal expansion within the VH genes was          observed represented by the VHJH rearrangements          am and cm Fig b These genes with           homology to DP shared four replacement mutations and          six mutations each were localized at different          positions          Twentythree of the VH sequences were highly mutated           mutations Except for one case most of the          mutations were localized in the CDR with RS ratio           Three of seven nonfunctionally rearranged genes also          revealed a pattern of antigeninduced mutation                          VH genes          Seven different VH rearrangements could be          characterized six were potentially functional CDR          lengths ranged from  to  bp mean  bp          The gl genes HUMIGHCAK HUMIGHCAG and DP were          represented twice each and DP once No homology to          DPVHVH was seen Five of the sequences had          few mutations one to eight with a RS ratio higher in          the FR than in the CDR Two VH rearrangements had a RS          ratio  in the CDR cVHa and bVHa                          VH genes          Eight distinct VH rearrangements could be determined          seven were potentially functional CDR lengths ranged          from  to  bp mean  bp          The aVHs gene was unmutated There were           mutations in all other sequences For five sequences          four were potentially functional the mutational          pattern revealed antigen induction                            Discussion                  VH PCR          Analysis of rearranged VH genes from B lymphocyte DNA          by PCR and sequencing enabled characterization of the          clonal expansion and mutational patterns without bias due          to cell isolation procedures By seminested PCR          otherwise used for singlecell analysis   one sole          VHDHJH rearrangement might be identified Besides the          extreme sensitivity there is a high risk of artificial          amplifications because of contamination A negative          control without DNA was run with each PCR as a          precaution no contamination was detected We cannot          exclude the fact that highly mutated genes are amplified          less efficiently   However since the respective          data concerning RA and ReA have been established by          similar PCR approaches        a          comparison is possible                          The VH gene usage          Within  VHDHJH rearrangements characterized in          this study all known human VH families except VH were          represented The descending order of representation was          VH  VH  VH  VH  VH           Compared with the germline representation   an          overrepresentation of VH and an underrepresentation of          VH genes were remarkable The representation of VH VH          and VH genes corresponded to their respective germline          representation Our previous studies of the VH gene          repertoire in RA SM   and studies using a hybridoma          approach   revealed an overrepresentation of VH and          a biased set of represented VH genes A positive          selection of VH genes particularly within the plasma          cell subset was recently demonstrated in RA and ReA            The DPVHVH gene encoding antiI and          antii specificity of cold agglutinins    as well          as antiDNA antibodies in lupus erythmatosus   was          not detected within the VH genes from AS SM          Another autoimmunityprone gene the DPV gene          was also predominant in AS All of eight Vderived          genes were potentially functional rearrangements with           mutations to the gl sequence and four reveal a          RS ratio  within the CDR that indicates a selection          by antigen V was also predominant in RA SM   A          comparison of the peripheral repertoire revealed that          V was more often somatically mutated in RA than in          healthy controls              Except for VH VH and VH the representation of VH          genes was similar to results from the peripheral VH          repertoire from healthy donors    as well as from a          RA patient                            Clonal expansion          Only two cases of clonal expansion characterized by          identically rearranged segments were detected on          different slides An accumulation of further point          mutations in the course of intraclonal diversification          was seen in two offspring of a VH clone both share four          mutations and differ in six point mutations Studies on          plasma cells in ReA and RA SMs   reveal clonal          expansion In RA SMs clonal B lymphocyte expansion in          different areas of the tissue samples    and          recirculation within different joints and blood were          reported                            The CDR          The CDR lengths of genes from the AS samples were          short with a median of  nucleotides A high          variability particularly in the productively rearranged          subset and in the VH family was noted A similarly high          variability was shown for polyreactive antibodies and          rheumatic factors in RA   Our data from RA SM          revealed almost homogeneous CDR lengths of intermediate          size   CDR were much longer in the healthy          peripheral repertoire particularly within nonfunctional          rearrangements mean  nucleotides                            Mutational pattern          Only nine rearrangements were not mutated RS ratios           within the CDR were observed in  genes two were          nonfunctional Members of the VH VH VH and VH          families carried more somatic mutations than the VH          genes          Mutational pattern and frequency determine about one          half of the characterized genes as memory B cells that          probably stay in contact with persistent antigens in the          microenvironment of the synovial foci   A similar          accumulation of memory cells in RA SM has been reported                      Besides the highly mutated genes already described          one half of the characterized genes showed no evidence of          antigeninduced mutations with low RS ratios within the          CDR There was a bias to silent mutations in four highly          mutated genes cmb cm am and cm          This pattern of mutations has been described for cold          agglutinins   as well as for rheumatic factors as a          mechanism of selection against amino acid replacement to          prevent the generation of highaffinity autoantibodies                                     Nonfunctional rearrangements          Except for VH none and VH  nonfunctional          rearrangements had an equal proportion of  in each          family within the genes characterized in the present          paper Except for a bias to VH a similar overall          proportion of nonfunctional rearrangements was seen in          the peripheral blood of healthy donors using singlecell          PCR of genomic DNA   In contrast no bias to elevated          CDR lengths was seen                            Conclusion        An active immune reaction with GC formation occurs in        the inflamed SM in AS B cell affinity maturation with        generation of somatically mutated antibodycoding genes        characteristic for memory cells occurs in these GC        formations indicating an antigendriven response        Comparable with RA and ReA there is a biased repertoire of        selected VH genes whereas the panel of represented genes        is different and clonal expansion was observed less        frequently                    Supplementary material                  Introduction          By sequence homology of at least  the VH gene          segments are classified into
