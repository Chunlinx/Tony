          okay camping my camping experiences are uh using a trailer a Terry eighteen foot uh mobile trailer and and thats you know like going to lakes and stuff like that   i see sure   setting up the trailer for a weekend or a week or ten days or whatever uh whats whats your thoughts on camping   uhhuh well for me camping ive never owned a trailer so for me camping is more more more has a lot more to do with backpacks and tents   uhhuh   but i guess that this camping two kinds of camping that um ive done one is to throw a a tent and food food and the like in the back of a car and drive to a campsise and setup the tent and have the the car right next to me   umhum   the other is to actually you know carry everything on your back ive done camping out in at in the Aspen Mountains in Colorado where     yeah thats up here in New England thats we call that backpacking which is the same thing which is youre youve got everything on your back you know an aluminum camp frame uh   right right exactly   uh uh yeah that well um the older you get the more convenience you try to bring with you i guess so im up to dragging the trailer around which is my next step is going to be probably Winnebago i hope if i only can afford one but that   i understand oh yeah oh   of course camping again is is is like you say that that your your backpacking is i guess what i would call true camping im not   right   im not sure that the other camping type of camping is nothing more than a leisure or   well either way its get i guess maybe we can define it as living away from the home   thats right thats right we have we have uh around the lakes and ponds up here and stuff we have uh campsites that are uh barriers set aside for each like the each individual trailer and you have a sewer hookup and water and electricity   but exactly   and you back in you know and or just pull into your spot and uh some you can rent by the year some you can rent daily or nightly or by the week or whatever   umhum yeah when when i mentioned ive done this camping out of the car ive actually done of the situation just like that but whats interesting is its through Texas Instruments   oh really   yeah TI has a little uh owns a piece of land on the edge of a lake that borders that the lake is on the border of Texas and Oklahoma its called Lake Texoma     yeah they what Lake Texoma theyve got a big uh  big rec centers up there right   yeah thats right so thats where ive done most of that actually     is that a pretty nice place   it is its really beautiful the the lake is is outstanding its a huge huge huge lake   yeah i spent about ten years in Abilene for TI i i worked out there in Abilene in west Texas and i never did get a chance to get over to Lake Texoma i i wished i had uh   oh yeah oh yeah i think you well if you every get to Dallas you can probably you know borrow you can go up there and get a space for the night for two bucks   thats unreal yeah   yeah so its easy to do im actually interested in getting one of those kind of my wife has been talking about this in the past couple of years one of those kind of campers that popup so its about uh maybe eight foot square and but only about two feet tall and when you get to where youre going it raises up and theres tenting material   oh yeah that folds out from it its like a crank up top thing you yeah its youre talking of a trailer type that you pull huh yeah okay   yes exactly exactly exactly my wife has a lot of interest in those and ive actually been keeping my eye on the paper and they seem to be running between one and two thousand dollars which   yeah yeah you can thats about the price of them up here theyre theyre uh uh Sears sells them Coleman sells them   sure   they have some some good buys on them and those are pretty nice i theyre theyre have a little galley a little uh sink thats got some compressed air and water in it and uh and a little stove thats like a propane stove   yeah uh umhum   couple of little cabinets and and uh sleeping  on either end of the the canvas when you open it up its just all screened in so its pretty neat uh   oh yeah yeah that   the nice thing about dragging that is that its very very convenient to travel on the highway with because its very low   i see   mine is like pulling a big house behind you you know   oh yeah you said yours is eighteen feet long what   yeah an eighteen foot Terry uh its completely selfcontained i mean i have everything a shower a TV everything in it you know but   oh yeah you you the brand is Terry   yeah T E R R Y Terry   oh i never heard of it   well theyre i guess theyre pretty popular up this way yeah its a pretty rugged trailer its a tandem wheel even though its only eighteen foot long so theres it drags pretty good you know with a car but   yeah     ive got a big Oldsmobile that i pull it with when i   yeah   uh if i get rid of that ill have to get rid of the trailer because i dont im not sure what else will be able to lug it around the hills up here   well thats neat   oh yeah thats something   kind of hilly country up through this way but   yeah   um   yeah well thats great   well uh i i like camping i i did a lot of it i when my kids were small of course theyre all grown now and gone ive got four boys and theyve kind of all gone and we dont really do that together much anymore as theyve out two are out in California and two are still in Texas so we kind of dont get together but maybe once a year and then we just do a little fishing but   right   i wished i had the opportunity to do camping because i used to love to live at the lake all summer and into the fall and   oh yeah yeah   uh it was kind of pretty nice but uh i just wish that i had an opportunity to do a little more   thats right   the thing that i i then again i i tried pulling the trailer one year and i went everywhere with the trailer like to beaches and to stuff but that got to be a hassle you know breaking down and setting up and breaking down so i decided that   and and right   i would lease a spot a spot on this particular lake here in northern New England and go there every every spring and stay there all summer and it really worked out good for me   umhum and and you can and you still do that   oh yeah yeah   and so you drive to work from there or you just take the summer off   yeah no i d rive from the campground   oh wow thats nice   which uh it adds maybe twenty miles uh you know uh each way but its not all that much uh   yeah   twenty miles is going is just going a little different way its probably twenty miles longer than my normal way to work i live in Rhode Island work in Massachusetts but   i see   its uh it just adds about twenty miles to it but its worth it to get to the campground and be just be out in the country and the woods all by yourself or you know with just a few neighbors around or so   right   and thats thats pretty nice because you can fish and just   well i envy that what a great life   yeah well  like i say it just uh i i enjoy doing it i wished i had more time to do it but hopefully i can get up a retirement here before too much longer and then   yeah huh   ill be looking forward to to like i say with a Winnebago because as the older you get the less things you want to do   i understand and   i dont want to let the i dont want to let the canopy down i dont want to jack it up i dont want to do all that stuff anymore  and just turn the key off and get in the back and do whatever you know     thats right just want to get in and yeah yeah thats funny well   but uh its been nice uh like i really appreciate talking with you and i thought id uh give you a call on my lunch time here today and worked out good   nice talking to you too well i appreciate it and and good luck with your uh your future your hopes of buy a Winnebago   yeah uh i thank you very much youre ever up this way look me up here at TI in Attleboro   ill do it nice talking to you Ray byebye   thanks sir
