Session Intervening with Alcohol Problemsin Emergency SettingsCarlo C DiClemente PhD Carl Soderstrom MDExcessive alcohol consumption plays an important role in many ofthe medical conditions accidents and injuries that cause visitsto emergency departments and trauma centers Many studies havedocumented the presence of alcohol among patients admitted toemergency department and trauma center settings Otherstudies have demonstrated that even blood alcohol concentrationBAC determinations underestimate the extent of alcohol problemsamong the patients who are triaged and treated in emergencysettings The prevalence of this cofactor to the emergencyadmission and the fact that alcohol is a risk factor both for thefirst visit and for a return visit to the emergency setting haveoccasioned a call for an effective method of intervening withalcohol problems in these settings Although there are problemswith and barriers to intervening in these settings a number ofstudies and a few controlled trials indicate that interventionsfocused on patients drinking can reduce the amount of drinking aswell as injury episodes including repeat readmission for injuryand other negative consequences of drinking This review willexamine the rationale for intervening types of interventions andinterveners and barriers and concerns that need to be addressedThen we will offer suggestions for research and practice related tointervening effectively with alcohol problems in emergencysettingsMotivational considerationsThe rationale for interventions in the emergency setting is thatthe medical condition or injury prompting admission provides awindow of opportunity when the individual may be more vulnerableand more open to seeing the connection between current consequencesand his or her drinking or drug abuse and may be more motivated tochange PresenterThe presence of an adverse consequence that can be linked todrinkingsuch as gastrointestinal vascular renal or othermedical problem an automobile crash unintentional injury orinvolvement in a violent incidentfacilitates intervention amongpatients with alcohol problems encountered in the emergencysetting In an emergency department ED study of injured crashvictims who had been drinking Cherpitel found that more thanonethird linked their drinking to being injured and thus weredeemed good candidates for brief intervention In another studyby Sommers and colleagues involving two trauma centers patientswho were injured in vehicular crashes and had a positive BAC wereasked To what extent do you believe your alcohol consumption wasresponsible for this injury Overall  attributed being injuredeither somewhat  or mostly or totally  to be theresult of drinking This attribution may be less endorsed withmedical conditions such as liver disease or pancreatitisWhether this awareness is viewed as a hitting bottomphenomenon or in more traditional motivational terms there doesseem to be a connection between readiness to change and recognitionthat negative consequences can be directly linked to a behaviorReports from emergency staff and anecdotal descriptions of someinterventions support the results of the above studies indicatingheightened motivation in the initial period of time in theemergency setting However it is not clear how long this initialopenness to change lasts There are also reports that after acouple of days spurred by concerns about legal responsibilityfamily member advice or rationalizations patient openness todiscuss drinking and other problem behaviors decreasesdramaticallyWe do know that alcohol consumption changes for many problemdrinkers after their visit to an emergency setting Several studieshave documented consumption changes not only in the interventioncondition but also in the minimal intervention control groupsHowever changes in alcohol consumption are often not sustainedamong participants in control conditions After the emergencyvisit there seems to be a reduction in drinking that graduallyreturns to baseline problematic levels for many untreated patientsChanges in drinking that are produced simply by the visit to theemergency department seem to dissipate without an alcoholspecificintervention Although there may be somenatural or unaided salutary effect on drinking resulting fromthe medical emergency or injury and the ensuing visit to theemergency setting that effect appears to be shortlived for manypatientsReinjury and readmission to an emergency or other medicalsetting is much greater for problem drinkers than for otheremergency patients It is clear from the literature that withoutsome intervention that can facilitate enduring reductions indrinking simply giving medical treatment alone to the problemdrinker admitted to the emergency setting will not reduce the ratesof readmission or prevent reinjury related to alcoholconsumption Although it is still not clear what the nature andextent of the intervention must be some type of interventionspecifically for drinking needs to be givenInterventions in the emergency department a reviewVarious types of interventions have been proposed and examinedfor the emergency medical setting Figure  These range frombrief interventions delivered by the physician to more extensivecounseling during the admission that includes referral to intensivetreatment after discharge Gentilello and colleagues conducted apilot intervention at a Houston emergency department that consistedof a substance abuse counselor mobilizing the family and at timesthe employer to intervene with the patients drinking and toarrange for immediate entry to a residential substance abusetreatment program after discharge This program appeared to besuccessful in getting problemdrinking patients to treatment butonly with families who could be engaged and for patients who hadresources or insurance This and other seminal studies encouragedmany professionals to call for some type of consultation service orbrief intervention to be employed with patients in emergency roomsor trauma settingsMany of the early studies that documented the efficacy ofinterventions with problem drinkers in emergency settings wereevaluations and not controlled studies Nevertheless thedocumented outcomes have been impressive Several studies haveexamined the outcomes achieved by substance abuse counselors oralcohol workers intervening with problem drinkers A briefintervention in an emergency department by alcohol health workersdemonstrated a mean reduction in drinking of  for a subset ofpatients who were enrolled in the study The pilotprogram in Texas described above demonstrated a  successfulreferral to alcoholism treatment for patients and families whoagreed to be in the program A substance abuse consultation teamin a trauma center reported acceptance of referral for drug oralcohol treatment in  of the  consecutive casesretrospectively evaluated Hemphill Bennett and Watkinsreported successful referral of patients to treatment with nearlyhalf of the  patients referred for treatment remaining for theduration of the treatment program Early reports of screening andreferral of patients have been promising in terms of reduction indrinking or in successful connection with appropriate alcoholtreatment programs For the most part these interventionshave used blood alcohol concentration as one of the criticaldefining features in screening for the interventionInterventions for drinking problems have also been successful inreducing reinjury In a recent review of intervention trials forproblem drinking that measured injury outcomes DinhZarr andcolleagues identified  studies that measured injury outcomesamong participants in a variety of settings They reported thatreductions in a variety of injuries injury hospitalizations anddeaths ranged from a  reduction in drinkingrelated injuriesand accidents to a  reduction in accidental and violentdeaths However in this review there was no clear evidence thatthe mechanism of action of these interventions was reduced alcoholconsumption These interventions appeared to affect risk taking inaddition to or instead of reductions in drinking and includedindividuals who had legal charges pending Most of the studiesreviewed were not well controlled and the numbers of participantsand effect sizes reported in these studies were modestUntil recently no wellcontrolled intervention studies haveaddressed whether interventions in emergency settings would reducealcohol consumption and consequences Several current publicationshave begun to remedy this lack of prospective randomized trialsGentilello and colleagues at the Harborview Medical Center inSeattle Washington conducted a randomized controlled trial in aLevel I trauma center Patients who screened positive on acombination of blood alcohol concentration BAC serum gammaglutamyl transpeptidase GGT and SMAST scores and who agreed toa followup study were randomized into an intervention or controlprocedure The intervention was a single motivational interviewthat lasted approximately  minutes witha doctorallevel psychologist trained and certified inmotivational interviewing techniques A letter was sent summarizingthis session one month later A total of  patients were randomlyassigned to the intervention condition but nearly  of thesepatients were discharged before the intervention could be givenand nearly  refused the intervention At the month followupthe intervention group demonstrated an average reduction indrinking of  drinks per week compared with a reduction of drinks per week for the control group Most of the drinkingreduction occurred among the patients with mild to moderate alcoholproblems and not in the heaviest drinking subgroup There were alsosignificant reductions in new injuries of about  at one year anda reduction in inpatient hospital readmissions for injurytreatment of  at the threeyear followup The authors suggestthat this type of intervention alone is insufficient for patientswith more chronic and severe alcohol dependence Another limitationof this seminal study is that  of participants were lost tofollowup at  months However this trial demonstrates that arather brief intervention delivered by a trained professional inthe emergency setting can produce significant reductions indrinking and repeat injury episodesA controlled trial of a similar motivational intervention witholder adolescents ages  to  years treated in an emergency roomfollowing an alcoholrelated event randomly assigned  of the eligible patients Patients were assigned to a motivationalintervention or a standard control of a handout about drinking anddriving and a list of alcohol treatment agencies The interventionwhich lasted  to  minutes was delivered in the emergencydepartment either immediately or within a couple of days of thevisit About  of the eligible patients were discharged beforethe intervention and another  refused to participateNevertheless drinking and driving moving violationsalcoholrelated injuries and alcoholrelated problems weresignificantly reduced at the sixmonth follow up with theintervention group experiencing onethird to onehalf fewer eventsthan the control group Although drinking decreased over time forboth intervention and control groups their drinking levels werenot significantly different Bachelors or masters level staffwith one to two years of experience and extensive motivationalinterview training delivered this interventionFollowup was limited to six months so this study would havemissed any rebound back to baseline at later time points and therefusal rate was rather high in this study However the evidencewas strong for a harm reduction effect across various indicators ofrisk and reinjuryWho delivers what type of interventionMost of the interventions described previously were conducted byspecialists trained in alcohol or substance abuse counseling or inmotivational interviewing techniques These interventionists metwith the patient discussed drinking and substance use openly anddirectly and offered some advice and assistance Substance abusecounselors typically offered advice and referrals to treatmentfacilities or selfhelp programs Motivational interview counselorstypically discussed the perceived consequences readiness tochange pros and cons of change and plans to reduce drinking andavoid alcoholrelated injuries in the future Substance abusespecialists of one type or another typically delivered drinkinginterventions in emergency settings with a few exceptions Nostudies have compared different types of intervention providers inthese settingsIn contrast physicians or nurses in a variety of primary caresettings have delivered brief alcoholfocused interventions Theseinterventions also appear to be effective in reducing drinking andrisky behaviors One recent study demonstrated that abrief patientcentered alcohol counseling intervention deliveredin the context of a regularly scheduled internal medicine visitproduced significant reductions in alcohol consumption among bothmale and female highrisk drinkers Based on these interventionsin other medical settings a number of researchers have recommendedthe involvement of the physician in the emergency setting in thealcohol intervention However few studies ofphysiciandelivered interventions in an emergency setting existClearly none of the extant studies could be done without thesupport and involvement of emergency medicine physicians and traumasurgeons However it may be difficult to get physicians to deliverthese alcoholfocused interventions for a variety of practicalphilosophical orientation and training reasonsTo some degree all interventions described in the emergencysetting are motivational Each intervention attempts to highlightproblematic alcohol consumption the connection between injury anddrinkingand patient plans to address excessive drinking Prototypicsubstance abuse interventions focus on motivation to entertreatment because the patients are severely dependent heavydrinkers Referral to appropriate treatment is the critical endpoint of this type of intervention and compliance with the referralthe important outcome Change of drinking and risky behaviors isleft to the treatment program and almost always abstinence fromalcohol is the goal of these treatment programs On the otherhand motivational interviewing approaches view change as theprovince and responsibility of the individual and work with theindividual at whatever level of motivation or stage of change isappropriate to promote consideration of change and anindividualized plan of action that does not necessarily includeadditional treatment or selfhelp groups like Alcoholics AnonymousBrief motivational interventions have been used with a wide rangeof problem drinkers and have been found to be effective in reducingdrinking and its consequences Goals for this treatment arearticulated by the client and can include reduction as well asabstinence from alcoholNearly all interventions delivered in emergency settings consistof a single intervention visit It is difficult to prescribemultiple visits unless the patient is admitted to the hospital fromthe emergency department or has an extended stay in a traumacenter Some researchers have suggested that the followup visit tothe clinic for extended treatment would be the best place foralcohol interventions However postponing intervention to thefollowup visit poses great logistical problems Scheduling offollowup visits depends on type of medical problem or injuryMoreover these visits are not consistently attended by the patientor delivered by the same physician who saw the patient in theinitial visit to the emergency setting Although many singlevisitalcohol interventions in medical settings have been effectivethe context of the emergency setting does increase the importanceof considering follow through after the initial contact Gentilelloand colleagues sent a letter home one month after discharge as areminder of the intervention conversation A currently fundedtrial at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center inBaltimore is using a feedback letter and two or more followupphone calls to extend the intervention beyond the emergency settinginterview This extension into the postdischarge period is mostrelevant for interventions that do not rely completelyon referral to treatment However postdischarge followupcould also be used to solve problems related to treatmentrecommendations and enhance compliance with therecommendationsIssues and challenges for interventions in emergencysettingsSubstantial evidence indicates that interventions with problemdrinkers in emergency settings can produce significant change indrinking behavior andor reduce risk of reinjury The number ofstudies that have demonstrated effects either with volunteer orrandomized participants is modest but increasing and the effectsrange from minimal to very sizeable reduction in risks that havesignificant public health importance Evaluation and referralinterventions have been able to get a number of emergencydepartment and trauma center patients into alcoholismtreatment It is not always clear whether there were longtermpositive outcomes from these trials since referral has been theoutcome variable most often studied However one can assume thatsome patients referred to treatment had very positive outcomes interms of reductions in drinking and of risk profiles Motivationalinterventions in emergency settings have more recently demonstratedimportant clinical outcomes in terms of risktaking negativeconsequences of drinking and at times reductions indrinking The number of participants who were not screenedwho refused who were discharged early or who were ineligible waslarge in some studies However when the intervention was deliveredto patients in emergency settings and compared with standard orminimal interventions intervention patients had significantlybetter outcomes on relevant measures It is important to note thatminimal interventions are not insignificant since they include ofnecessity an assessment of drinking behavior and a followupcontact and they are often much more than ordinarily occurs in theemergency setting Screening or assessment alone however does notappear to be as effective as some type of specificinterventionBringing research to practiceThis review of interventions focused on addressing alcoholproblems among patients in various medical settings highlightsseveral important issues and offers a perspective on the challengesto creating sustained effective intervention programs in theemergency setting Strategies andinsights from clinical trials should be gathered and madeavailable to practitioners to help every emergency department andtrauma center implement a coordinated effective and feasibleprogram of screening and intervention for problem drinkersHowever several conceptual and practical issues need to beclarified so they can be resolved in a future research andimplementation agendaAlthough an opportunity exists to intervene with patients whohave alcohol use problems and there are published guidelines foremergency department and trauma centers concerning interventionthat opportunity has not been seized Gentilello andcolleagues noted that although trauma centers are uniquelypositioned to implement programs of alcohol screeningintervention and referral and despite emphasis on injurycontrol and prevention little has been done to incorporate alcoholintervention programs into care of the injured patient Thisobservation was based in part on the results of a national surveyof trauma centers which revealed that blood alcohol testing whichis often a precursor for any intervention was routinely conductedat only  of centers despite a published guideline by theCommittee on Trauma of the American College of Surgeons indicatingthat testing was an essential characteristic for those centersThe survey also found that although  of the centers hadsubstance abuse counselors only  used screening questionnairesto identify patients with alcohol use problemsAlthough we know of no studies assessing clinical practicesregarding alcohol problems in emergency departments a survey of emergency medicine physicians by Chang and colleagues foundthat most physicians favored testing and reporting injuredalcoholimpaired drivers However ambivalent attitudes wererevealed concerning alcoholics and alcoholism On a scale of strongly disagree to  strongly agree the statement alcoholicsare difficult to treat received a mean score of  and thestatement alcoholism is a treatable disease received a meanscore of  In an earlier report Chang and Astrachan documentedlow BAC testing rates for intoxicated drivers by emergencydepartment physicians One of the reasons they cited wasdefeatism about alcoholism management In a recent survey ofemergency medicine physicians  agreed that alcoholabusedependence is a treatable disease but more than indicated that there was a lack of time to perform interventionsand only  supportedemergency department interventions These attitudes andpractices are similar to those found in a national survey ofphysicians practicing internal medicine family medicineobstetricsgynecology and psychiatry Most physicians reportedasking about alcohol use but few used recommended screeningprotocols or offered formal treatmentThe first challenge for implementing recommended screening andinterventions for problem drinking in emergency settings involvesconvincing staff of the importance and efficacy of suchinterventions Although the research to date supports the efficacyof these interventions clinical trials are needed to confirm thesefindings and to set the stage for the next logical step ofeffectiveness studies Feasibility and successful disseminationmust be demonstrated Prototype interventions that can reach themajority of problem drinkers motivate them to change drinkingpatterns or enter appropriate treatment and produce positivelongterm outcomes should be introduced into several emergencysettings of differing size and staff composition These multisiteeffectiveness studies can then be used to promote change instandard practice in all emergency settingsWhat we have learned from the research to date gives us somedirection as to how to implement interventions in emergencysettings to reduce drinking and alcohol related risks The firststep to developing an effective and efficient intervention programwould be to create a screening procedure integrated into theadmission and triage system of the emergency settings Alcoholproblems can be identified along a range of alcohol use andconsequences However it is important to clarify what type ofproblem interveners are attempting to address The screeningprocedure can have a net with larger or smaller mesh that can beset for more or less severe alcohol problems However whatever thetitration of the screen the procedure must be clearly delineatedand uniformly applied to every patient admitted to the emergencydepartment or trauma center The primary screen must be integratedinto the standard intake procedure of the emergency setting andmust be the responsibility of the staff to administer to allpatientsThis preliminary screen should trigger a more indepthassessment and a brief intervention that can be delivered eitherseparately or as a package Figure  The assessment is criticalfor evaluating motivationand decisional considerations and for determining the need forand appropriateness of referrals to treatment The success ofmotivational and patientcentered approaches seems to indicate thatit is critical to take into account the motivation of the patientand his or her readiness to change Once motivated thepatient may need a variety of options depending on the nature ofthe alcohol problem and the needs of the patient Many treatmentproviders believe that intensity of treatment should be determinedby level of alcohol problem although controlled trials do notalways support the assumption Greater dependence andparticularly greater support for drinking in the environment mayindicate a need for more intensive treatment such asdetoxification inpatient or residential treatment or intensiveday treatment Selfhelp groups like Alcoholics Anonymous Womenfor Sobriety or Rational Recovery outpatient treatments andguided selfchange may also be appropriate for a wide range ofdrinking problems In any case the broader the net cast by thescreening instrument that identifies individuals with alcoholproblems the more flexible and wideranging should be the referraland postdischarge optionsThe assessment and intervention could be delivered by a varietyof trained professionals who have some expertise in motivationalinterventions understand alcohol problems and are armed with aseries of viable options to assist the patient The interventionby necessity needs to be brief and limited in contact consistingof  to  minutes of interaction Interventions and the staff whoconducts them need to be flexible and creative in adapting tosituations created by the injuries and the noisy and often chaoticnature of emergency settings Communication rather thanconfrontation concern rather than condemnation and facilitationrather than force or law enforcement should mark the interventionsIf there is a legal aspect to the case it should be separated fromthe clinical intervention as much as possible Multiple feasiblereferral options that vary in intensity and scope should beavailable as part of the intervention Since data from otherstudies indicate that facilitating the referral and making theconnections increase compliance the intervention ideally shouldhave a component of compliance enhancement if it includes referralto community treatment programsNext stepsResearch is needed to confirm and extend the findings to dateabout interventions in emergency settings Unresolved questionsabout the nature and format of the intervention that could useinput from research are enumerated below Should there be several types of interventions for differinglevels of severity Individuals with less severe alcohol problemsmay benefit from a brief intervention with little or no followupor referral Are there subpopulations that benefit more frommotivational or brief interventions Should we triage the mostsevere problem patients into a more intensive intervention in theemergency setting What are the longterm outcomes  months ormore of various interventions with patients of differing levels ofseverity Who can best deliver the intervention How involved shouldthe patients attending physician in the medical treatment be inthe intervention for alcohol problems Most emergency departmentphysicians do not believe that physicians or nurses would be thebest persons to provide effective treatment There are a varietyof professionals that could be trained to deliver the interventionincluding physicians nurses psychologists social workers andsubstance abuse counselors However it may be more a matter ofskill and ability to work in this setting and deliver the neededtype of intervention rather than of profession that shoulddetermine who should deliver the intervention Should the intervention include the family Are familymembers a help or hindrance in the intervention Family members andpartners can be of significant assistance in the interventionHowever they can also interfere with the interview by suggestingnoncooperation interfering with the candidness of theselfreport and trying to protect the patient from theintervention in some misguided attempt to help Including familyshould be done carefully and thoughtfully if at all What are the constraints regarding the timing of theintervention Must the intervention occur in the first  hours orcan it be included in discharge planning and delivered afterdischarge We need to know more about the closing of this windowof opportunity and whether delay interferes with motivation How can emergency staff be trained to facilitate thescreening and intervention Would particular approaches to trainingbe more effective in reaching emergency physicians and nurses How does extent of injury or severity of illness affect theintervention It is clear that some injuries create barriers tointervention in the emergency setting Is a separate protocolneeded for individuals who are admitted to the hospital for surgeryor other medical treatments that necessitate a hospital stay Should all interventions triage and intervene based onpatient readiness to change The perspective of the stages ofchange model appears to be an appealing one to help staff andinterventionist understand the process of change for addictive andhealth behavior Incorporating this perspective intointerventions in the emergency setting has been suggested byseveral researchers Are there significant policy issues that must be resolved tomake interventions for alcohol problems more feasible For examplemany clinicians do not routinely obtain a BAC test because of afear of denial of payment for medical care by thirdparty payorsfor injured patients who test positive This fear is well groundedRivara and colleagues in a survey of insurance commissioners foundthat  of  respondents indicated that intoxication at the timeof injury allowed for exclusion of coverage A review of statestatutes including those of the District of Columbia revealedthat  states have a provision that allows thirdparty payors toissue policies that deny payment for injuries sustained whileintoxicated While Rivara and associates note this option seemsto be enforced rarely by most companies we are aware of anecdotalreports of emergency departments and trauma centers that haveceased testing because of the fears of nonpayment However ourinquiry to billing department staff at the Maryland Shock TraumaCenter which admits nearly  patients annually revealed not asingle case of denial of payment There is also a need for health services research to examinetechnology transfer and explore ways to disseminate researchfindings to emergency settings of differing size and complexityImplementation is as important as the intervention in thesesettings Unless screening andintervention becomes an integral part of the emergency triageand treatment system it will be an appendage that will beinconsistently applied or tried and discarded An interventiontemplate with options incorporating the alcohol problemintervention into the various settings should be developed andevaluated As we have indicated guidelines and best practices havebeen published that deal with alcohol dependence and abuse andemergency medicine The challenge now is to discover how governmentagencies and professional organizations can promote adoption andimplementation of intervention guidelinesThe opportunityA combination of basic research program implementation andevaluation studies and policy and procedure evaluations are neededto resolve the issues outlined previously Twenty years ago JosephZuska a surgeon with an interest in alcohol problems among injuredpatients noted The crisis that brings the alcoholic to thesurgeon is an opportunity for intervention in a progressive oftenfatal disease More recently the Substance Abuse Task Forcefrom the Society of Academic Emergency Medicine led by DOnofrioand colleagues emphasized that in the emergency department settingEarly intervention and appropriate referral of patients withalcohol problems have the potential to reduce alcoholrelatedmorbidity and mortality An accumulating body of evidencesupports these calls for intervention However systemic andpractical barriers must be overcome and additional researchconducted to take full advantage of this opportunityReferences Cherpitel CJ Screening for alcohol problems in theemergency

theemergency department ED with alcohol problems We have just heardcompelling evidence regarding the efficacy of brief intervention ina variety of settings including primary care inpatient traumacenters and emergency departments and for multiple populationsranging from adolescents to adultsWe now know several truths First screening and briefintervention SBI does work A recent evidencebased review of theliterature on SBI conducted by Dr Linda Degutis and me revealed studies  randomized controlled and  cohort with a positiveeffect demonstrated in  of these studies We also know that theED visit offers a potential teachable moment due to the possiblenegative consequences surrounding it and that in essence we asemergency physicians have a captive audience In addition we knowthat patients presenting to the ED are likely to need our help morethan those who present to primary care Cherpitel recently comparedpatients presenting to an ED with those presenting to primary carein the same metropolitan area She found that ED patients were oneand onehalf to three times more likely than primary care patientsto report heavy drinking consequences of drinking alcoholdependence or history of treatment for an alcohol problemIt is now time for us to adapt the information we have learnedfrom these efficacy trials to the ED setting and move on toeffectiveness trials In doing so we face unique challenges Theseinclude time pressures competing priorities few formal followupprotocols negative attitudes of the staff and a multitude ofsystems problems in an environment that at best can be described ascontrolled chaos Perhaps the largest hurdle is the fact that EDpractitioners have not yet bought into the idea that SBI is part oftheir role or responsibilityTo be effective our research strategies must be brief andclear In real life there is not a cadre of researchers to screenand administer lengthy interventions Therefore protocols must becapable of being integrated into existing systems with availableresourcesI am going to show you a clip from a video entitled TheEmergency Physician and the Problem Drinker Motivating Patientsfor Change Actual ED scenarios are used to demonstrate commonproblems or traps that arise when physicians attempt to counselpatients about their alcohol use The intervention featured thebrief negotiation interview includes establishing rapport raisingthe subject of problem drinking providing feedback and assessingthe patients readiness to change Specific strategies tointervene based on the patients readiness to change aredemonstrated to help the patient start the process of finding hisor her own solutions to change Two versions of a physicianpatientinteraction are depicted one that is likely to be unsuccessfuland one that is likely to be successfulTo be successful in developing effectiveness trials in the EDsetting researchers must be very clear about a number of issueswhen developing their proposals These issues includeWho should be screenedShould we target certain populationsthe injured or noninjuredthe atrisk harmful or hazardous drinker or the dependentdrinker Should we concentrate on the life cycle from adolescenceto older age or should we concentrate first on more definedpopulations It is unrealistic to assume that one intervention willwork for everyoneWhat should the intervention includeThe message of the intervention is vital It should be briefscripted and reproducible Exactly what constitutes brief Theexact time of the intervention should be recorded What is includedin the intervention should be clearly stated Should we be sure toinclude the acceptable components of brief intervention as outlinedin the acronym FRAMES feedback responsibility advice menu ofstrategies empathy and selfefficacy Is making a connectionbetween drinking and the ED visit important Is there aprescription or recommendation given to the patient Does themessage include advice or add a component of motivationalenhancement therapy Does the research protocol monitor adherenceto the message and howWho should provide the screening and interventionWhich provider actually screens for problems and provides theintervention Different sites can be creative about who conductsthe interventions Is it best done by nurses physicians or healthpromotion advocates Is it possible that patients can be screenedby completing computer programs while waiting in the ED withresults then relayed to the physicianHow can we motivate practitioners to changeWhat can be done to motivate physicians and other health careproviders to change their behaviors and incorporate SBI into theirpractices What are the motivators Are they patient driven so thatdocumentation of a decrease in recidivism and morbidity andmortality must be proven to convince practitioners Or are theytied to reimbursement Are emergency physicians more likely toinclude counseling in their practice if it is a billable serviceWhat other barriers must be removed or systems changes made beforeSBI is successful in an ED Available resources are essential aswell as perceived support and role models A great deal of time isspent developing continuous quality improvement projects in EDs forproblems with far less prevalence Return visits and deaths areoften tracked Why not include patients with alcohol problems inthis processWhat exactly is included in educational programs forprovidersStandard didactic educational programs have not been shown tochangephysician behavior and subsequently improve patient careHoweverevidence indicates that skillsbased interactive sessions canchange practiceHow do we measure successWhat outcomes are we measuring Do they include a decrease inalcohol consumption or decreases in negative consequences such asdrinking and driving violations or school and work problems Adecrease in morbidity and mortality may be more difficult tomeasure and require a lengthy followup period but it providesmuch more meaningful data to the practicing emergency physician Itis also possible that trackingreferrals to primary care or specialized treatment programs maybe an important outcome Rates of enrollment in treatment programsand compliance with appointments may be meaningful outcomesHow long one brief intervention may affect patients behavior isunclear ED providers have no formal relationships with thepatients beyond the index visit and it is entirely plausible thatthe effect of the brief intervention may be short lived Thereforecertain outcomes may need to be measured early at one or threemonths However one may also argue that it is possible that theremay be a sleeper effect or delayed emergence of treatmentefficacy as described by OMalley and Carroll making itimperative that assessments be continued for one year or moreAll of these questions need to be answered in future studies ifwe are to prove that SBI is effective in the ED setting It iscrucial that researchers are clear on all aspects of their researchprotocols so that future projects can either replicate or build onpast experiences These aspects include exclusion and inclusioncriteria the specifics of the intervention ie what how andby whom and the specific outcomes to be measured Adherence tothe protocol should also be assuredIn conclusion there is no silver bullet or one exactintervention that will work for everybody We must focus on smallincremental steps and realize that the entire process will be along one Fortunately the number of ideas and research

Soderstrom ArticleKristen Lawton Barry PhDReducing death and disability related to alcohol remains anational health status goal Cherpitel and others have suggestedthat the emergency department ED may be the ideal place toidentify alcohol problems and to begin interventions particularlywith patients who enter the ED with an injury Severalcompelling reasons make the ED an important setting for alcoholinterventions First a large number and variety of patients areseen in EDs every year Second many of the patients who use the EDdo not have their hazardous drinking detected or treated in otherprimary or tertiary care settings Third most patients withalcohol problems are released from the ED rather than beingadmitted to hospitals where detection may be more likely Finallyfor patients seen in the ED there can be an immediacy between theevent bringing them to this setting eg injuries and possibleidentification of and intervention for an alcohol problemLogistical challenges to brief interventions in the EDThe ED presents unique challenges however for identifying andintervening with patients who drink at a hazardous level The ED isa fastpaced environment with many competing demands that do notallow for concentrated periods of personnel time devoted tointervening with longterm problems even if the problems arerelated to a particular ED visit It is of great importance todevelop intervention strategies that can be used easily andefficiently in this settingMedical care challenges in the EDIn addition to the practical problems generally associated withscreening and intervention in this venue pressing problems in thedelivery of medical care will affect how we intervene in the futurewith ED patients at risk for and currently experiencing problemdrinking By  there will be a serious shortage of nursingpersonnel available to work in this and other medical settingsThis shortage will come at a time when theBaby Boom generation is reaching retirement age and having morehealthrelated problems that lead to greater use of urgent care andemergency facilities In fact EDs are already seeing greaternumbers of patients at a time when hospitals are closing Thiscritical health care shortage could exacerbate a vicious cycle ofneed for care and difficulty providing that careDiClemente and Soderstrom have produced a wellcraftedstateoftheart article and presentation about the need forimportance of and challenges in conducting research on theefficacy and ultimate effectiveness of brief alcohol interventionsin the ED for persons who are atrisk drinkers problem drinkersor alcoholdependent drinkers It is clear from their manuscriptthat a spectrum of alcohol problems presents in the ED and that aspectrum of solutions is necessary to meet the challenges ofproviding best practices careIssues raised by DiClemente and SoderstromThis response to DiClemente and Soderstroms conferencepresentation briefly addresses issues raised by Dr DiClementiprimarily the need for considering the use of technology to augmentor deliver brief alcohol interventions in the ED Previous researchhas shown that brief interventions for hazardous drinking areeffective in reducing drinking levels across of variety of healthcare settings including the ED However the sample sizesattrition rates types of interventions levels of alcohol useoutcomes measured and effect sizes have varied greatly across thestudies In addition the target of the intervention atriskdrinkers problem drinkers alcoholdependent drinkers and themechanism of intervention physician nursing staff socialworkers technology with or without provider advice remain openquestionsBrief alcohol interventions have generally included feedback bya health care professional based on patients responses screeningpositive to questions about alcohol consumption or consequencesThese results indicate that while this approach is effective for apercentage of hazardous drinkers it is not effective for everyoneeffect sizes of  to  The intervention studies based onprovider feedback and advice to the patient have had mixed resultsin the ED In addition it remains difficult to engage health careprofessionals in conducting brief interventions in this venuebecause of the volume of patients and the urgency of otherpresenting problems It is becoming clear that to be widelyeffective an EDbased brief alcohol intervention model thatrequires providers to give advice and written materials to thescreenpositive patients will need some modificationTwo concepts that appear often in the literature may be usefulin informing future research First the ED potentially provides anideal teachable moment for patients who have problems withalcohol use It is thought that this is particularly true if thepatients use can be tied to the reason for the ED visit Howeverit may also be anticipated that using the ED visit as a teachablemoment may be effective for noninjured persons who drink at riskexcessively Second the ED is a fastpaced environment in whichproviders cannot easily find time to conduct brief alcoholinterventions even if they have the training skills and desireto do so The concept of the teachable moment although only aconceptualization at this time provides part of the seminalinterest in doing alcohol interventions in the ED On the otherhand the fast pace of the ED may play a role in why providers findit difficult to address alcohol issues at all particularly forthose patients who do not present in the ED with problems orconditions clearly linked to alcohol consumptionThe implementation of brief alcohol intervention systems inreal world emergency medical practice has not been easy This hasbeen true in primary care settings as well Efficacy trials are thefirst step but implementation of proven alcohol screening andbrief intervention systems in hospital and communitybasedsettings has been the most difficult part of the process Seriouslogistical challenges remain in developing systems that facilitatethe use of these techniques on a regular basisThe combination of the potential opportunity to affect thealcohol consumption of atrisk drinkers and the limited time forproviders to intervene along with the higher volume and projectedshortages of nursing personnel necessitates the need to expandresearch on brief alcohol interventions specifically with the useof new technology The use of technology may reduce the time neededfor providers and staff to personally provide screening andintervention services and target patients who can derive benefitfrom the brief intervention messagesIn addition because of the effect sizes shown by the studies todate there is also a need to target responses and elements of thebrief intervention to the problems specific to each individualpatient who scorespositive for atrisk drinking or more serious alcoholrelatedproblems The use of new technologies for individualizing briefintervention materials and feedback may help to fill gaps in thesystem of care for patients with atrisk and problem drinkingpatternsThis is a large challenge and a large expectation for any onesystem of intervention Just as there is a spectrum of alcohol useproblems there may be a family of solutions These solutions willneed to address both the types of interventions that best fit eachED and medical center and the specific problems of the patientOne size fits all does not work in brief interventions just asit does not work in clinical practice in general Taking a publichealth perspective methods are sought that are the most effectiveclinically and financiallyNew directions in brief alcohol interventions in emergencymedicineOne of the innovations being tested at this time is the use ofautomated computerized screening with realtime production of briefworkbook content tailored to specific problems The use ofcomputerized tailored messaging represents an important techniqueto provide targeted individualized feedback to patients consideredmost open to change messages Tailored messaging systems have beenfound effective in the areas of depression smoking cessationdietary intake and use of mammographyOther technologies that may be useful in the future include theuse of interactive voice recognition IVR technology to facilitatescreening delivery of educational interventions and followup ofpatient progress by telephone IVR telephone availability hoursday could facilitate followup of ED patients Interactivecomputer programs on laptops or palm computers webbasedinterventions computerized bundling of brief health messages formultiple health risks eg smoking alcohol use seat belt useand audio interventions tailored to specific problems and deliveredthrough headsets are also being posited as potential approachesin emergency and urgent care settingsSome of these technologies have been raised because of systembarriers to providerbased interventions The use of technologyeg handheld computerized screening interactive headphonedelivery of messages tailored messaging booklets to assist ininterventions in acrowded busy venue may allow a level of privacy that addressesthe shame and stigma many individuals feel about problems relatedto alcohol misuse and abusePatients in the emergency setting range from those with noalcohol problems to those with severe dependence In the next fewyears a variety of exciting intervention techniques will be testedin EDs and urgent care clinics Drs DiClemente and Soderstrom haveset the stage for us to think about what is needed in the future toprovide best practices care to patients with problems related toalcohol use Any methods that are developed with researchers andclinicians working together will help to overcome barriers

Longabaugh commented on how much remains unknown aboutwhat motivates patients to change their use of alcohol He notedthat researchers at Brown previously had found that readiness tochange was predicted by whether or not patients attributed their EDinjury visit to their drinking They expected the same result intheir new study with hazardous drinkers who had a positive BAC atthe time of their injury visit However they were surprised tofind that regardless of whether the injury was attributed toalcohol or not patients did equally well at followupConsequently the motivational mechanism is not clear Anothersurprise was that in the new study a single intervention sessionat the time of the emergency visit made no difference in anyoutcome measures at either  months or  year Patients whoreturned  to  days later for a second intervention session didnot improve on outcomes at  months but they did improve onalcoholrelated negative consequences and injuries at  yearTwothirds of the patients returned for a second session but thatproportion varied from onethird to  across the differentinterventionistsKristen Barry noted that in primary care studies one sessionseems to be enough to foster change However she found itinteresting that booster sessions worked in this setting Eventhough the intervention did not decrease drinking it did decreasedrinkingrelated consequences which may be part of what werelooking for in this settingCarlo DiClemente said the message needs to be reinforced afterdischarge In his work they are using a feedback letter and phonecalls at two weeks and six weeks He noted that Longabaughs dataindicate there is benefit from a postdischarge contact and that wewill see if other studies confirm thatHerman Diesenhaus added that there must be some type ofmaintenance activity if we are dealing with a chronic relapsingcondition The research questions are how to determine whichpatients need maintenance activities what types of activities theyneed and when or how often they are neededChristopher Dunn related that his research interventions took to  minutes but his interventions outside the research arenatook about  minutes because the process did not have to be socomplicated and uniform and there was less data collection Heobserved that the first question of the SMAST Do you think yourea normal drinker forced people to label and marginalizethemselves This had created many difficulties during hisinterventions He noted that he prefers the AUDIT An original goalof the study was to encourage postdischarge alcohol treatment butonly  to  of study patients went to at least one treatment orAlcoholics Anonymous session Consequently he questioned howimportant that goal should be Very few patients refused to speakto him or had problems with privacy during the interview Familymembers were present less than  of the time and their impact onthe intervention varied He noted that even though interventionsare evidencebased organizations and interventionists innonresearch settings will make an intervention their own In anycase he observed even in the existing randomized trials ofinterventions that use motivational interviewing we cannotevaluate the effect of counselors skill levels In future trialshe recommended that the fidelity of the intervention and variationsamong interventionists be more closely monitoredBarry agreed that we have not monitored closely enough whatintervention is being delivered by the interventionists we trainThe good news is that across many trials the interventions beingdelivered seem to work She also agreed that the first question ofthe SMAST is problematic She noted that the short and long MASTfor geriatric patients have been modified eliminating theproblemsPeter Monti agreed with Dunn that measuring treatment fidelityis extremely important He cited a brief report and an upcomingchapter in a book about interventions with adolescents thatdescribes how studies at Brown evaluate fidelity He also notedthat none of the three clinical trials Gentillelos with traumapatients his own with adolescents and Longabaughs in the EDused physicians or ED staff to conduct interventions Herecommended that future research evaluate whether using physiciansor ED staff is more cost effective than using specially hiredstaff He wondered if using ED physicians could increase treatmentefficacy enough to offset the added cost of training and possibledecreased delivery of interventions He also noted that giventhe costs and difficulties of the ED setting the relativeefficacy and cost of booster sessions is another important issuedeserving further research In his continuing trial he should beable to address this question because adolescents will berandomized to booster sessions or a single session Although hisstudy of adolescents found reductions in risky behavior andalcoholrelated harm he was disappointed to find no effect ondrinking Given the harmful levels of drinking among adolescents inhis studies he remarked that it is irresponsible for interventionsnot to focus on drinking as well as harmGail DOnofrio noted that her planned study will use physiciansphysician assistants and senior emergency medicine residents todeliver brief interventions for injured and noninjured harmful andhazardous drinkers The study will allocate resources to promoteadherence to the treatment protocol and monitor treatment fidelityIt also will control for ancillary treatments that might influenceintervention outcomeEdward Bernstein noted that Project Assert adapted areadinesstochange instrument for use in the ED Patients wereasked to place themselves on a readiness scale of  to  Ifpatients rated themselves on the low end of the scale researchersthen asked them what would bring them to a higher scoreDiClemente commented that such adjustments to instruments areoften necessary In assessing change interventionists can usethree markers to help them importance confidence andreadinessBarry praised the use of a linear method to measure stages ofchange She added that an inhome brief intervention linked withprimary care found no association between stage of change andoutcome She thought more research is needed on this issueDaniel Hungerford noted that there are operational realities inthe emergency department that must be considered in order toimplement interventions At the same time some central questionsneed to be submitted to empirical testing The screening and briefintervention trial he and colleagues conducted in West Virginia didnot include a booster session and had a mode intervention time ofabout  minutes Although outcomes for the experimental andcontrol groups were not significantly different at  monthsoutcomes improved for both groupscompared to baseline At  months outcomes for both groupswere still not different but the percentage of patients who hadimproved had decreased and was no longer significantly differentfrom baseline He concluded that a brief intervention might have ashortlived effect that degrades over time Consequently a boosterintervention might be helpful His second point was that there isan easy assumption that a brief intervention is more appropriatefor patients with mildtomoderate problems than for patients withsevere problems It is thought they are more likely to respondsuccessfully The West Virginia project is on a college campusMany of the college students who visit the ED have mild alcoholproblems and are confident they could overcome their alcoholproblems if they wanted to However most of them do not feel thisissue is important enough to address At followup it is thenonstudents and students with more severe problems who are morelikely to improve He concluded we should not trust easyassumptions but instead treat them as empirical questionsBarry reinforced the importance of looking at this issue by agegroups noting that young adult males were least affected byinterventions in the Wisconsin early intervention study Sheconcurred with Hungerfords observation that intervention effectsseem to wear off after a period of time She suggested thatalthough booster interventions are needed perhaps they are notneeded very often particularly in primary care settingsMaintenance of effect might be possible with yearlyconsultationsDiClemente noted that some trials have found patients with moresevere problems being helped others have helped patients with moremoderate problems Readiness to change may or may not be related toproblem severity Similarly readiness to cut down may not coincidewith readiness to abstain Patients who are more ready to cut downare generally less ready to abstain There is strong evidence thatreadiness to change and confidence especially before treatmentare unrelated Sophisticated research is required to tease apartthe complex interactions between these variablesDOnofrio agreed that methodological issues are extremelyimportant She noted that research studies often attempt to controlso many variables and follow up with patients so frequently thatcontrol groups receive so much attention focused on alcohol that itmay constitute anintervention particularly when compared with patients whoreceive standard care Even if the assessment is embedded in ageneral healthneeds survey patients know they are being askedabout alcohol and that could affect their answers Thesemethodological problems can mask valid intervention effectsMonti believed that a decision to screen only for patients withsevere alcohol problems is premature In his study of adolescentshe saw a decrease in drinking among all groups However the onlypatients who showed a differential effect from the briefintervention were precontemplators in the  to yearold groupFor younger children he concluded the emergency room visit was apowerful eventRobert Woolard related that many ED patients they approached toparticipate in research still had measurable blood alcohol levelsBrowns IRB required a mental status exam to ensure patients couldunderstand the research dimensions of the project before they couldbe enrolled in the study Therefore the study was able tocorrelate mental status exam scores with alcohol levels at the timeof consent Patients with BACs of  and  gdl had impairedmental status mostly in shortterm memory He wondered at whatblood alcohol level patients could remember an intervention Ifthey had had to wait until patients were sober many would bedischarged because in his ED patients are discharged when staffestimate their BAC is below  gdlDiClemente reported that most of the people who got the longerintervention in his study remembered the interventionist at thetwoweek followup so there was some recallRichard Brown commented on high upfront costs required todevelop technological means of delivering these services such ascomputerbased screening He said funding mechanisms such as smallbusiness grants were not always appropriate for researchers andwondered whether there were other funding mechanisms that might bemore appropriateBarry replied that her group had used the R grant programs tohelp develop or adapt technology but she admitted that R grantscan be difficult and timeconsuming to obtainBrown replied that only a certain proportion of the funding canbe applied toward development in R grants and some of thetechnology for example interactive videos can be quite expensiveto developElinor Walker reminded the group that the Agency for HealthcareResearch and Quality has an R program with a  capincluding both direct and indirect costs She noted that theseprojects are reviewed by a study section but one that may be moreforgiving than R study sections However the program is stillquite competitive and the project would probably have to involvetesting as well as developmentLongabaugh noted that R grants which are available fordevelopment of treatments could be used to developtechnologiesMary Dufour observed that there are few applicants who areskilled at both the research and the business aspects of a projectso small business grants seldom go to people in the scientificcommunity If applicants want to go that route she recommendedthey get help from someone wellversed in businessMarilyn Sommers related her experience from two clinical trialsamong hospitalized patients In both nurse clinicians all femaleimplemented the study Because the trauma population is mostlyyoung male and not always easy to work with the gender of theinterventionist could be important Perhaps physicians especiallymale physicians have more authority in that population which mayaffect whether patients take advice She observed that the genderof both interventionists and patients has not been well documentedin studies This can make it difficult to standardizeinterventions She hypothesized that understanding the patientsperception of the interventionists capabilities might be asimportant as having detailed measurements of intervention fidelityacross interventionists She noted that many researchers feelrushed to move these interventions into clinical settings becausethey know we need to be addressing alcohol problems She asked thepanel how to balance this need with the many important scientificquestions that still need to be answeredDiClemente observed that Project MATCH had examined associationsbetween gender and treatment outcome and found that females didbetter in step programs However to examine the effect ofmatching interventionists and patients would require randomizinglarge numbers of patients to a large number of interventionists Heagreed that the authority issue is important but he suggestedsmaller targeted research studies could address that question Hecautioned that not every study has to be a clinical trial focusedon outcomes To examine the issue of gender patients could berandomized to interventionists and both could be asked to evaluatetheir perceptions of the interaction He noted that the balancebetween research and clinical practice is always a challenge Heposed the following questions Do we wait until we know exactly howthe intervention works before we move interventions into practiceOr do we start in a practice setting and keep refining as we goalong His sense was that the field would benefit from starting inthe practice setting to learn how interventions work in realworldclinical settings As research evidence accumulates it can informbest practicesBarry described two intervention trials among older adults inprimary care Interventions performed by physicians in one trialhad results as good as interventions performed by social workersand psychologists in the other Although she thought age of theinterventionist could be an influential factor she was unsurebecause there are so many interactions and factors that we have notlooked at very carefullyDOnofrio in response to Sommers concerns suggested that apatient might be more receptive to nurses than physicians becausethey are less authoritative and more nurturing and they listenbetter So the reverse hypothesis could be just as validSommers suggested that some of these questions could beaddressed by pooling data sets from existing clinical trials andhoped this conference would be a step in that directionLongabaugh noted one matching effect that persisted throughoutthe posttreatment period in Project MATCH Clients with high traitanger who were therefore likely to resist directive interventionswere more successful with a motivational enhancement interventionOther clientswere more successful with directive treatment interventions suchas a step approach or cognitive behavioral therapy He remarkedthat it would be possible to evaluate this association by matchingpatients likelihood to accept directive interventions to eitherbrief directive physicianimplemented interventions orspecialistbased motivational interventions He added that theliterature shows client outcomes and costbenefits are improved byeither research followup or a brief monitoring phone callFinally he suggested that the patients level of distress couldinfluence motivational level as much as the severity of a patientsalcohol problemsRobert Lowe speculated that the current situation representsboth a unique opportunity for an intervention in the emergencydepartment and a failure of the primary care system The ED seemslike an appropriate venue for alcohol interventions because many EDpatients have alcohol problems and the ED visit may represent ateachable moment However primary care is responsible for thefirst contact as well as comprehensive continuous care If manypatients have no primary care or primary care providers do notscreen for alcoholrelated problems then primary care has failedWhen the ED is essentially making up for the failures of primarycare perhaps focusing on the ED for interventions is not the moststrategic approach He then asked how EDs should use their limitedresources Should they be screening for patients with the worstproblems Or are these patients the least likely to respond tointerventions available in the ED If milder cases are more likelyto respond perhaps they should be a higher priorityDOnofrio noted that many young healthy patients do not go totheir primary care provider even if they have one Even withmanaged care efforts to decrease expensive ED visits the number ofED patients has increased so primary care and EDs have to worktogether Since brief intervention does not work with severelydependent patients EDbased interventions should refer patients totreatment She added that when she has not been able to reacheveryone she responds to patients who request help Howeverpatients who have not considered asking for help may make progresstoward getting help because of a connection made by an EDinterventionBarry agreed that difficult cases do take most of the time andresources currently spent on alcohol problems in the ED She notedthat we have to help patients who have severe alcohol problemsHowever she believed that it is also important to use resources toreach as many people as possible and that systems currently existthat once refined can be fairly easy to implementDiClemente pointed out that in an ideal world primary carewould provide consistent contact and interventions could happenover time However until that happens other systems will have topick up what falls through the cracks Providing resources in theemergency setting has implications for the primary care setting Weneed to be figuring out how to connect primary care and emergencycare settings rather than splitting them apartGordon Smith described difficulties he had had with his IRB in astudy on drinking and boating injuries He suggested that the finalreport from the conference include a section that addresses thedifficult human subjects issues involved in working withintoxicated patients such as protocols and procedures that IRBsfound unacceptableBarry noted that because of human subjects violations and theway human subjects committees have handled their paperwork wholeprograms have been shut down As a result human subjectscommittees have been under intense scrutiny She pointed out thateven ongoing programs have been rescrutinized and required to makeprotocol changes However standards seem to vary acrosscommitteesSmith noted that this variation is the problem and why he wantsthese concerns to be addressed by the conference in writtenformCharles Bombardier noted that the rate of spontaneous remissioncould minimize the differences between experimental and controlgroups This problem makes it difficult to determine theappropriate time to schedule outcome assessments and boosterinterventions He suggested a number of factors that mightinfluence spontaneous remission such as an injury type andseverity of injury degree of alcohol dependence readiness tochange and marital or employment status He thought naturalhistorystudies or pooling of control group data might better identifypredictors More data on this issue could help us plan bettercontrolled trialswho to target when to follow up and when togive boostersRonald Maio reported that other investigators shared theirprotocols with him and this helped his IRB clearance process gomore smoothly He noted that most brief intervention studies in EDshave focused on injured patients but that  to  of EDpatients do not present with an injury He wondered how much ofwhat we learn from the injury patients can be applied to patientswho are not injuredDOnofrio replied that her study was looking at both injured andnoninjured patients She noted that primary care studies and EdBernsteins ED project do give us experience with noninjuredpatientsDiClemente added that his study was also for both groups andmost primary care studies involve noninjured patients He thoughttheir findings help support work with noninjured patients in theemergency department setting as wellPatricia Perry reported that one alcohol intervention project inNew York State was implemented in  hospitals but in a differentway in each one She observed that after interventions have beenshown to be effective they will have to be adapted to newsettings She suggested we must identify the essential elements ofinterventions that are required in any new setting Another lessonfrom the New York project was that each site must have a championShe observed that it would be useful to know in advance how toidentify whom that champion might be She added that physicianbuyin is critical to overcoming professional resistance and thatit is important to identify additional partners who can moveintervention services forward in a particular setting orinstitutionDOnofrio remarked that when it comes to brief interventionsmany physicians are precontemplators She suggested that changingphysician behavior can incorporate the same concepts that areapplied to changing patient behaviorJean Shope expressed her belief that addressing alcohol problemsin the emergency department is the failure not just of primarycare but of many systems Her work has been in substance abuseprevention in schools where she encountered many social and legalbeliefs that ran counter to her prevention education efforts Shebelieved that the ED setting is just one of many where alcoholproblems should be addressedThomas Babor wondered whether a couple of unquestionedassumptions had arisen during discussions at the conference Thefirst was that because time and resources are limited in theemergency department interventions should be simplified andlimited in scope The second was that we may have difficultyselling alcohol interventions because they are in competition withother types of interventions such as helmet use seat belt use orsmoking prevention He suggested that making interventions moreambitious and partnering with other programs that also are lookingat behavioral risk factors might get us a more prominent place onthe agenda He suggested that the scientific question is whether wecan intervene effectively and simultaneously for the top two orthree risk factors that often overlap in these populations If thescience showed we could the policy question would be whether wecould get a bigger place on the agenda if we partner with otherprogramsDiClemente recalled that we used to think a patient could notquit smoking and drinking at the same time Recent data have shownthat not to be true He also observed that patients who screenpositive for one risk factor often have multiple risk factors Thepatient could decide how many risk factors could be addressed atone time A problem arises when the factors the patient wants towork on are not the same ones the provider thinks are mostimportant or is most prepared to deal with There are few purealcoholics anymore Most use other substances as well so it isimportant to be able to intervene for a variety of problems Thisis a real challenge for policy institutional systems andprofessionals We will have to change our thinking and consider themany conditions for which we could interveneBarry surmised that grant proposals to look at more than onehealth behavior at a time had already been submitted but she didnot know if they had been fundedIn response Dunn described a minute EDbased interventionfunded to change six behaviors among youth not wearing bikehelmets failing to use seat belts carrying a weapon bingedrinking riding with a drinking driver and drinking and drivingHowever the protocol did not ask patients which behaviors theywere motivated to change The intervention led to a small change inbike helmet use and a slightly larger change in seat belt use butit did not lead to changes in alcohol variables or weaponcarryingDOnofrio observed that both Project Assert and her projectfunded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation provided interventionfor multiple behaviors and that brief interventions for allbehaviors were based on the same principles She reasoned thatthere were so many risk factors that should be addressed that somesort of bundling would be necessary She said that the prevalenceof alcohol problems was higher than other risk factors Physiciansfrequently ask about tetanus immunizations even though almost nonehave ever seen a case of tetanus They readily ask about seat beltsand distribute handouts about various behaviors She believed thattime is not the issue as much as redirecting the focus of theinteraction during their time with the patientBarry suggested that funding sources may have to become partnersbefore support for the bundling of interventions could become arealityDavid Lewis commented that during the last five years patientshave been bringing a great deal of information to medicalencounters People actually bring printouts of questions to asktheir primary care physicians Due to the amount of information nowavailable power has shifted from the physician to the patient Hewould like to see more thinking about how these changes should beincorporated into research and more strategies that piggyback onthis information revolution and shift in powerGuohua Li disagreed with DiClemente that the efficacy of briefintervention in emergency settings had been established Hebelieved studies from England and New Zealand should be viewed verycritically because access to health care is easier than in theUnited States He believed thatstudies in American emergency settings have providedinconclusive evidence that brief intervention works He cautionedthat literature reviews generally do not include all relevantstudies because studies with negative results are seldompublishedDiClemente agreed that efficacy in the ED setting had not beentotally established He noted that many practices that do not haveefficacy or effectiveness studies behind them are adopted andbecome guidelines for standard practice Once that happens it isvery difficult to get support to reevaluate them so it is true wemust be careful when evaluating social science and psychosocialinterventions However we are so sophisticated psychometricallyand methodologically that virtually every piece of research can bedissected revealing flaws and problems If we continue to do thatwe will never make any changes in services He recommended abalance between the rigor of research and the application processthat needs to happen
