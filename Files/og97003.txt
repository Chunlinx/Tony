promulgated by Department ofHealth and Human Services Food and Drug Administration entitledMedical Devices Current Good Manufacturing Practice CGMP FinalRule Quality System Regulation RIN AA We received therule on October   It was published in the Federal Registeras a final rule on October    Fed Reg The final rule revises existing current good manufacturingpractice requirements for medical devices and incorporates theminto a quality system regulation The quality system regulationincludes requirements related to the methods used in and thefacilities and controls used for designing manufacturingpackaging labeling storing installing and servicing of medicaldevices intended for human use The rule adds preproduction designcontrols and is intended to achieve consistency with quality systemrequirements worldwideGAOOGCEnclosed is our assessment of the Food and Drug Administrationscompliance with the procedural steps required by sectionsaBi through iv of title  with respect to the

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FOOD ANDDRUG ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED MEDICAL DEVICES CURRENT GOODMANUFACTURING PRACTICE CGMP FINAL RULE QUALITY SYSTEMREGULATION RIN AAi Costbenefit analysisThe Food and Drug Administration FDA performed a cost andbenefit analysis evaluating the economic impact of the finalruleThe estimated total annual incremental cost to the industry is million The majority of the costs  million representthe establishment of design controls for new products Most of theremaining costs are attributable to extending the quality systemand requiring appropriate documentation evaluating suppliers andcontractors and management reviewThe benefits to the public health are estimated to be  to fewer deaths per year and  to  fewer serious injuries peryear attributable to designrelated device failures FDA assumed aneconomic value of  million per fatality avoided so that themonetary savings per year would be  to  million per yearThese figures do not include any monetary savings associated withthe reduction in serious injuries Additionally the FDA statesthat the rule will result in fewer product recalls and betterproduct qualityFinally since the final rule is designed to harmonize with theinternational standards device manufacturers will not have tomaintain two different quality systems to compete both nationallyand internationallyii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and The FDA has concluded that the rule will have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities becausealmost all medical device establishments are classified as smallunder the Small Business Administrations definition of size Aninitial regulatory flexibility analysis and a final regulatoryflexibility analysis have been prepared and included in thepreambles to the proposed rule and the final rule noticerespectively as required by sections  and  The analysescomply with the informational requirements of the sectionsGAOOGCincluding the classes of small entities subject to the rule andalternatives considered to reduce the burden on the smallentitiesThe FDA in drafting the rule to ease the burden on smallentities has not applied the design requirements to all Class Idevices and component suppliers have been removed from the rulescoverage Also the requirement for traceability of components hasbeen limited to where the agency believes it is necessary toprotect the public health In addition other revisions were madeto make the final rule less prescriptive and to allowestablishments greater flexibility in meeting the requirementsFinally the FDA will conduct workshops issue guidance manuals andvideotapes and hold teleconferences to aid small entities incomplying with the ruleThe analyses use both quantifiable and general descriptions ofthe effects of the rule on small entities as required by section and numerous small entities participated in the rulemaking asrequired by section  by submitting comments on the proposed ruleand by attending an open public meeting in August  and theSeptember  meeting of the Good Manufacturing Practice AdvisoryCommitteeiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  The FDA examined the final rule as prescribed by the Act andfound that no mandate will be imposed on State local or tribalgovernments and it believes that the burden on the private sectorwill be below the  million annual expenditure level to requirecompliance with the Act However while the cost estimated by theFDA on the private sector is  million in view of theuncertainties in the estimates FDA has followed the requirementsof the ActAs required by section  FDA considered regulatoryalternatives to the requirements of the rule but determined thatthe provisions of the final rule constituted the mostcosteffective and least burdensome alternative that would meet theobjective of the ruleTo ease the regulatory burden the FDA has extended theeffective date of the rule to June   and will not takeregulatory action for an additional year on the design controlrequirement Also FDA exempted almost all Class I devicesHowever FDA rejected suggestions that lowrisk devices be exemptedbecause the cost of implementation will exceed the public healthbenefits gained FDA found that all Class II and III devices eventhose devices from firms with excellent past records should becovered because their failure could adversely affect publichealthPage  GAOOGCiv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts andExecutive ordersAdministrative Procedure Act  USC   et seqThe rule was promulgated using the notice and comment proceduresof  USC   and the procedures contained at  USC jf concerning the establishment of an advisory committee toadvise and submit recommendations to the Secretary regardingregulations concerning good manufacturing practicesMeetings of the Device Good Manufacturing Practice AdvisoryCommittee

proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on November   Fed Reg  soliciting comments from the publicIn addition various papers and working drafts of the rule weremade available to the public

controls to the Current Good ManufacturingPractices regulation  USC jfAExecutive Order No The rule was determined to be an economically significantregulatory action under Executive Order No  requiring reviewby the Office of Management and Budget Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs OIRA OIRA approved the final rule ascomplying with the requirements of the Order based on informationsupplied by the FDA including a planned regulatory action documentdescribing the reason for the rule and an assessment of the costsand budgetary impact of the ruleExecutive Order No  Intergovernmental PartnershipThe FDA has reviewed the rule under Executive Order No and finds that the Order does not apply because the rule is notapplicable to government facilities but to finished devicemanufacturers However regarding consultation with State localand tribal governments the FDA notes that there were two stategovernment representatives who were members of the GoodManufacturing Practices Advisory Committee in  which exploredthe need to revise the Current Good Manufacturing PracticesregulationPage  GAOOGC
