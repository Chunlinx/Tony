                                  Janet Maslin                           The Phantom Menace  A film with half aplot no engaging characters to speak of and actors who speak ininhibitedzombie monotones as if the director had warned them to keep quietwhile someone on the set took a nap A film that introduces the noxious scificreature Jar Jar Binks whose bug eyes lazy shuffle and minstrelly speechsuggest an alien Stepin Fetchit A dull and annoying and occasionally ratheroffensive film in other words Yet here was the New York Times  leadreviewer Janet Maslin almost alone among major critics in showering praiseIt sustains the geewhiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbucklingextragalactic getaway  jubilant ingenuity  sweetly unfashionably benign no better tour guide for a trip back to the future            Maslin did acknowledgein passing the films ethnic stereotypes the overstuffed plot EwanMcGregors blandness the foolish spectacle of Liam Neeson acting oppositerobots and Natalie Portmans resemblance to a costumed block of wood But inher inimitable way Maslin folds all these complaints into an overall rave Itwas a bad piece and a telling one For more than a decade Maslin has stood outamong critics for being what critics those curmudgeons so rarely are She isupbeat and forgiving often to a fault As the Johnny Mercer song instructsshe accentuates the positive and eliminates the negative Or as in the case ofthe latest Star Wars episode she buries her list of negatives so latein the piece that it barely registers This habit of combining compensatorypraise with dismissals makes it difficult to know what Maslin actually thinksHer pan of Forrest Gump  for example was deadon and brave in itscriticism but also packed to the gills with compliments            The question not burning perhapsexcept for the poordupes who suffered through the charmless Phantom because theTimes recommended it is how Maslin comes by this generosity Theparanoid explanation is that the papers growing dependence on movie adscompels her in some oblique and unconscious way to be an industry booster Orit could be that Maslin is a little too well connected for a film critic assome detractors have charged and afraid to hurt her friends feelings Ormaybe she is just as people who know her tend to comment exceptionallynice            The question grows morecurious when you look back at Maslins career and realize that she once had astrong voice She started off in the s writing about rock n roll forRolling Stone and especially for the Boston Phoenix  At the timethe Phoenix and the nowdefunct Real Paper were at the epicenterof alternative journalisma training ground for critics and reporters whowould graduate to big city dailies and the slicks Joe Klein passed through thePhoenix  Real Paper scene as did The New Yorker s DavidDenby the Times  Frank Rich Newsweek s David Ansen film criticturned Vanity Fair  New Yorker profiler turned Lolitascreenwriter Stephen Schiff journalistwonk Sidney Blumenthal and                  Slate               s own David Edelstein to name just a few            Its unfair but true that a woman who started out at such atime and place in such an atmosphere of heady debate pot scant female andplenty of male colleaguessuch a woman will inevitably be noticed and talkedabout So lets get the gossip out of the way Maslin was attractive early onshe dated Steven Spielberg she got married to Jon Landau a fellow rock criticwho attended a small concert by a dynamic young man from New Jersey and wrote afamously prescient piece announcing I saw rock and roll future last nightand its name is Bruce Springsteen and eventually quit his writing job tomanage the Boss In the s Maslin married Benjamin Cheever son of JohnCheever and also a novelist            Whats interesting hereisnt Maslins personal life but the fact that her youthful writing on JoniMitchell say or Elvis Costello carries more conviction and therefore moreweight than her mature work on the movies Maslin had a voice As gungho asshe is today but more deeply felt more confident while still refreshingly freeof the insider smugness of so much writing on rock But for some reason whenshe migrated from music to movies first for the Phoenix  then brieflyfor Newsweek  and since  for the Times  she seems graduallyto have inched away from her personal reactions The pattern was set longbefore she became the Times lead critic in  A  Sunday thinkpiece on a rash of Anglophilic white flannel costume dramas was typical Formuch of the piece Maslin seemed to criticize the way films like A Handful ofDust distorted the novels they set out to adapt the way they reeked ofsnobbery and voyeurism the way they substituted rarified Ralph Lauren dcorsfor content Then she turned her argument upside down praising a trifle calledA Summer Story precisely because of its cynical emptydecorativeness            To read a Maslin piece can be a disconcerting at timeseven haunting experience One senses her scrambling to fill the piece witheverything but her own analysis More often than not she leads with a lengthydetailed visual description of a scene or a character For paragraphs at a timeshe leans on plot summary of the timid undergraduatebookreport variety Sherelies heavilyvery heavilyon adverbs which serve to pepper hernoncommittal reviews with small emphatic bursts and to jack up her celebrationsfrom a word review of Velvet Goldmine  dazzlingly surrealbrilliantly reimagines spectacularly reborn dramatically presidedstunningly pretty fabulously charismatic hilariously decadenttypically wicked            When she does give thethumbs up especially for an anticipated blockbuster certain key words andphrases such as audience appeal and escapist fun suggest that she is notwriting from her own point of view so much as shes gauging in advance thepublics reaction The lead to her review of Twister called the film agaleforce movie with the energy to blow audiences right out of the theaterThis sounds more like publicity copy than criticism what it expresses is theimpression the studio hopes the film will have on an audience            To be fair there is much to be said in Maslins defenseShe is hardly the first good writer to be slightly stifled by the Timesnor by any means is she the first frustrating critic to work there On thecontrary Vincent Canby wrote from high atop a pedestal panned TheGodfather Part II  and indulged in an inexplicable love of Blake EdwardsBefore Canby Bosley Crowther ruled the roost for three decades He wieldedimmense power but who recalls a single thing he wrote today especiallycompared with the memorable work of James Agee or Andrew Sarris or above allPauline Kael            And these are tough times for reviewers in generalDavid Denby has expressed the disappointment of a generation of critics whoentered the field during the feverish Kaelinspired s Once upon a timethey wanted to grab readers by the hand and lead them to passionate works ofart but no one would aim so high today Great movies are fewer and fartherbetween at least in this writers opinionat least for the time being andthese days even the media that employ the critics measure a movies success notby the critics reaction but by opening weekend gross Critics just dontmatter as much as they used to and Maslinthough shes still at the top ofthe heap influencewiseis no exception Very much to her credit she hasntbecome bitter about her shrinking influence shes not stuck in whiny nostalgiafor the way things were But she has developed a disembodied ghostly way ofwriting about moviesa criticism of lowered expectations Her main defense ofthe disappointing Phantom Menace  Its only a movie Exactlyandwhile were at it Maslin is only a critic who asks for too little
