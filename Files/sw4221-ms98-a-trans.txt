        so do you do any kind of regular exercise     uh what i do most regular is swim lap swimming   uh   and um of course ive been indoors a lot lately weve been having some really cold weather here but i prefer swimming outdoor   uhhuh   um for the i think i find the our door atmosphere more inspiring for my exercise really   uhhuh a little less claustrophobic   yeah yeah and um i just thought i always fill a little more lively um i think when i the times when i do   uhhuh   or wouldnt having to pass on to the gym maybe to work with weight the weight machine um   uhhuh   it just a little more spacious yeah like you said claustrophobic   uhhuh   what do you do for exercise   well very little lately what i do  i walk about a mile to the bus     well that a mile a good way each way   in the morning yeah and and then then a mile back   well thats good two miles a day is nothing to  at   its its a lot better then nothing i think   oh yeah ive just recently um something i tried to incorporate into life style just recently is walking when im going short distances like when im at work if im going to go to a restraint for lunch just choosing one close enough to walk   uhhuh yeah thats nice i think it really clears your head a little bit     yeah and i think one of the um probably i i think that one of the most important thing about  enjoying your exercise and getting it regularly just to have it in your life style like and not be like   uhhuh   six oclock at night and well now ive got to go   well thats one thats one reason i actually do the walking where i tried other thing is it has a point to it   oh yeah   its really is part of what i need to do anyway you know i need to get to the bus   yeah and its finite too you know you eventually reach the bus you dont reach your two miles and say well i really should walk that extra mile     its find i right right right its something i had to do where when i tried you know running around the track i felt just a little pointless   yeah   and it was very easy to avoid   yeah   um   very easy   and im im trying to do some um       some you know calisthenic type thing at home   oh are you really   but its very easy to avoid   yeah um one calisthenic type thing that i i feel like i i feel like i have gotten to do and eventually with out having to think about it do is just squatting down when i going to pick something up instead of bending over at the waist   uh ooh   and um i can i think i fill like i can already tell the difference in my thighs just i have a little more definition   thats very interesting  something probably better for you anyway   yeah and i yeah and that what that what started it with a little bit of back trouble i was having and of course i didnt want to do leg lift or anything   yes right are those are then  of the painful and sort of artificial category     thats right  thats right   well i was just i one of the issues i want to do is try to avoid some back pain or try to i mean i have it every once and a while and i know when i do this exercise i dont get it which is it call it crunches   yeah oh yeah   we kind of do a situps   yes       together im just going to ignore that call waiting if you heard it   yeah okay um       yeah where you sort of try to put ribcage into your pelvis and do it over and over again     that would defiantly fall in the unnatural category   yes it does it does and i always find a good reason not to do it um   yeah   but i can tell that i havent done it   no this girlfriend of mines got a pretty flat stomach not i dont really but i dont i was asking her because she does not shes one of those who just doesnt exercise you know   uhhuh     and um but she said she you know just you know hold her stomach in all day i mean you know just constantly holds it in all day   oh yes i trying to decided if that was good or not good   well im sure it would be good for your back it seems like it might impede impede you know impede your breathing a little bit in less  really use to it   uhhuh um   what do you think   yeah i i mean i found myself doing it i mean i sort of been in that habit through out my life and  lately its uh lately its not   oh really   hasnt been happen quit as much   yeah i i was in it for a while um when i was in high school i took um choral and you have to hold your you know just to regulate your breathing  you had   uhhuh you dont stand very carefully   yeah but i found like the top half of my stomach above above my belly button was getting you know was always tone but then the the trouble spot below the belly button       never never quit tone you know  and you know that was the part i was concern about so i just blew it all off all together   uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah um  and what else lately along with the crunches i was trying to do some pushups   oh really   uh well my wife is were expecting a baby in May   oh   and i know that from the last time what she really like is to have a lot of very hard back rubs during the whole thing and im just not ready for it   uhhuh     and i thought well if i can do a bunch of pushup then i should be able to get through these this time but uh i have the problem now where we have a son who is almost three and he think that it is great fun to try to climb on my back while im doing the pushup so     well that could you know slow you down a little bit its just that extra resistance and   its slows me down a little it makes each one a little more meaningful but i cant quit do any     um do you do any exercises for your hand the little muscle in your hand   um no what what what are you thinking
