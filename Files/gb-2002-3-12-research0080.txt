                    Background        One of the goals of the Berkeley         Drosophila Genome Project is to        define experimentally the transcribed portions of the        genome by producing a collection of fully sequenced cDNAs        We have previously reported the construction of cDNA        libraries from a variety of tissues and developmental        stages these libraries were used to generate over         expressed sequence tags ESTs corresponding to        approximately  of the predicted proteincoding genes in        the         Drosophila melanogaster genome           We used computational analysis of these ESTs to        establish a collection of putative fulllength cDNA clones        the         Drosophila Gene Collection DGC           Here we describe the process by which we sequenced the        full inserts of  cDNA clones from the DGC describe        the methods by which we assess each clones likelihood of        containing a complete and accurate proteincoding region        and illustrate how these data can be used to uncover        additional cases of RNA editing We have confirmed the        identification of  cDNA clones that can be used with        confidence for protein expression or genetic        complementation                    Results and discussion                  Sequencing strategy          Current approaches to fullinsert sequencing of cDNA          clones include concatenated cDNA sequencing   primer          walking   and strategies using transposon insertion          to create priming sites       We adopted a          cDNA sequencing strategy that relies on an           in vitro transposon insertion          system based on the MuA transposase combined with primer          walking see Materials and methods for details          The production of fullinsert sequences from DGC cDNAs          is summarized in Tables and  For DGCr clones were          sized before sequencing Small clones   kilobases          kb were sequenced with custom primers and larger          clones were sequenced using either mapped or unmapped          transposon insertions For DGCr clones were not sized          and a set of unmapped transposon insertions was sequenced          to generate an average of  sequence coverage For both          DGCr and r custom oligonucleotide primers designed          using Autofinish   were used to bring the sequences          to high quality To date we have completed sequencing           of the DGCr clone set and  of the DGCr clone          set The strategy used for sequencing DGCr clones          appears to be more efficient because on average they          required fewer sequencing reads than DGCr clones          However we were able to reduce cycle time and increase          throughput using the shotgun strategy adopted for          sequencing the DGCr clones The average insert size of          the  highquality cDNA sequences that have been          submitted to GenBank is  kb and they total           megabases Mb of sequence The largest clone SD          is  kb and is derived from a gene            CG  that encodes a          aminoacid ankyrin repeatcontaining protein                          Evaluating the coding potential of each cDNA on the          basis of its fullinsert sequence          For many potential uses in proteomics and functional          genomics     it is important to establish cDNA          collections comprised only of cDNAs with complete and          uncorrupted open reading frames ORFs To determine          which of our sequenced clones meet this standard we          compared them to the annotated Release  genome sequence             using a combination of BLAST   and Sim            alignments see Materials and methods for          details          We grouped the cDNAs into four categories Table           The first category contains a total of  cDNA clones          or  of the sequenced clones We are confident that           of these clones contain a complete and accurate          ORF as they precisely match the Release  predicted          protein for the corresponding gene An additional           clones are from the SD GM and AT libraries which were          generated from fly strains that are not isogenic with the          strain used to produce the genome sequence The predicted          ORFs from clones from these libraries were required to be          identical in length to the Release  predicted protein          with less than  aminoacid difference to be placed in          this category We cannot at present distinguish whether          these differences result from strain polymorphisms or          reverse transcriptase RT errors However our own          internal estimates of RT errors see below based on the          observed nucleotide substitution rate in cDNAs derived          from the same strain as the genomic sequence and          published estimates of strain polymorphisms   lead us          to believe that the majority of these changes are the          result of strain polymorphism          The second category represents  clones that are          known to be compromised in one of a number of ways The          sequences of the largest class of compromised clones           align to the Release  predicted transcripts but          have nucleotide discrepancies that are most likely the          result of errors generated by RT during library          construction These include missense and frameshift           or  nucleotide difference changes in the predicted          ORF relative to the Release  predicted protein Clones          placed in this class can show up to  amino acid          differences from the Release  peptide for isogenic          libraries and up to  difference for nonisogenic          libraries We estimated the error rate of an          RNAseHdeficient RT SuperScriptII Invitrogen Carlsbad          CA by comparing the nucleotide sequence of cDNAs from          isogenic libraries to the genomic sequence For the GH          HL LD and LP libraries   we observed an error rate          of  in  for the RE and RH libraries   we          observed an error rate of  in  This difference is          likely due to the different RT reaction conditions used          in these two library construction protocols             Although these numbers are higher than the  in           figure reported for SuperScriptII Taurai Nenguke          personal communication the           in vitro assay used to obtain this          error rate is based on assaying a single site for          mutations that revert an           amber codon          The next largest class of compromised clones           consists of clones apparently truncated at their  ends          as judged by comparison to the Release  predicted ORFs          of the corresponding genes The  short clones          represent  distinct Release  annotated transcripts          For  of the short clones  from DGCr and eight          from DGCr we were able to identify clones with longer          ORFs by additional EST sequencing The remaining           clones are assumed to be  short because they do not          possess a  inframe stop codon and the corresponding          annotated ORF in Release  extends further  This class          of clones represents approximately  of all finished          clones consistent with our original estimates that           of the DGC clones would contain the full ORF                      The remaining six classes of compromised clones          consist of a total of  cDNAs  of all finished          clones see Table  Eightythree clones encode ORFs          that are truncated at their carboxytermini and are most          likely the result of priming from internal polyA          tracts Seventyseven clones contain two unrelated ORFs          and are almost certainly the result of two cDNAs being          cloned into the same plasmid vector during library          construction Seventy clones contain ORFs of less than           amino acids One hundred and eleven clones overlap a          Release  predicted gene but are transcribed from the          opposite strand from that of the mRNA encoding the          Release  predicted protein and are considered antisense          transcripts a number of such cases were documented in          the reannotation of the genome   and have been          reported in many organisms   Twentyone clones          correspond to transcripts of transposable elements on the          basis of their sequence similarity to identified           Drosophila transposons            Finally six clones contain a bacterial transposable          element Tn IS or IS that most likely inserted into          the clone during propagation in           Escherichia coli bacterial          contaminants          The third and fourth categories consist of clones that          may represent alternative transcripts  and clones          that are currently computationally unclassified           respectively The summary of the analysis of these clones          is described in Table                           Improving the DrosophilacDNA resource          We have identified and sequenced cDNA clones that          contain a complete and accurate ORF for  of all          predicted           Drosophila genes We plan on          extending this project in two ways First we intend to          increase the number of genes represented in this set of          fully vetted cDNA clones using a combination of          experimental approaches We can use sitedirected          mutagenesis to correct clones that carry single          nucleotide changes or other small localized defects For          the majority of the compromised clones we have candidate          replacement clones available that were identified as part          of our EST sequencing and analysis efforts            Generation of the Release  annotation of the genome made          extensive use of our fullinsert sequence data   In          the course of that effort human curators identified a          total of  clones that have become the DGCr The          DGCr currently includes  clones chosen to replace          clones with truncated ORFs  clones for genes that are          not currently represented in the DGC and  clones that          represent alternative splicing forms To identify cDNAs          for the remaining genes we plan on using a combination          of additional EST sequencing reverse transcriptase PCR          RTPCR and cDNA library screening Second we plan on          transferring ORFs to a universal cloning system see             for examples in order to generate a standard          reagent for proteomics and other functional genomic          experiments In collaboration with Orbigen   we have          already generated  baculovirus expression clones from a          set of Gateway Invitrogen Carlsbad CA clones encoding          transcription factors                          mRNA editing          RNA editing is a welldocumented mechanism of          generating nucleotide diversity beyond that directly          encoded by the genome Adenosine deaminase ADAR targets          doublestranded regions of nuclearencoded RNAs          catalyzing the deamination of adenosine A to inosine          I   Inosine mimics guanosine G in its          basepairing properties and the translational machinery          of the cell interprets I as G In this way an AtoI          conversion in the mRNA can alter the genetic information          and consequently protein function Null mutations in          the single           ADAR gene in           Drosophila dADAR suggest that the          function of premRNA editing is to modify adult behavior          by altering signaling components in the nervous system             Among the mRNAs known to be edited in           Drosophila are those encoded by           cacophony a calcium channel gene                      paralytic a sodium channel gene            and           GluCla a chloride channel gene            all of which have multiple editing sites in their          coding sequences          In the course of evaluating the quality of the DGCr          and DGCr cDNAs described above we compared their          translation products to those of the recently completed          Release  genomic sequence Such comparisons should          reveal cases of RNA editing In cases in which the          predicted protein sequences disagreed we examined the          corresponding nucleotide sequences in search of          sitespecific AtoG variation between cDNA and genomic          sequences We identified over  candidates consistent          with RNA editing however additional cDNA or EST data          will be required to distinguish RNA editing from RT          errors or strain polymorphisms In a few cases we had          enough cDNA and EST data to indicate that RNA editing is          the most likely explanation for the observed variation          One such example is shown in Figure  The gene           CG encodes a Gproteincoupled          receptor of the rhodopsin family containing a          seventransmembrane protein domain with similarity to             adrenergic receptors of mouse and          human    Ten potential sites of RNA editing were          revealed by comparison of the genomic sequence with those          of two cDNAs and three ESTs We validated these  sites          by genespecific RTPCR using RNA isolated from heads of          isogenic animals and identified  new sites see legend          to Figure  We are now in the process of a more          rigorous and thorough analysis of potential RNAediting          targets                            Materials and methods                  Sequencing strategy          The           Drosophila Gene Collection DGC          consists of two releases DGCr and DGCr A process flow          diagram of our sequencing strategies is available online            and is summarized below The clones in DGCr were          arrayed by insert size   and sequenced accordingly          clones in DGCr were not arrayed by size DGCr clones          less than  kb were assembled using phrap   and          analyzed with custom scripts to determine whether they          were complete Autofinish part of the consed computer          software package was used to automatically design custom          primers   for clones that needed quality improvement          Clones that did not finish in the first two rounds of          Autofinish were sent to a manual finishing queue for more          sophisticated finishing cDNA clones larger than  kb          were divided into three groups  to  kb  to  kb          and greater than  kb All clones were sequenced using          the           in vitro Template Generation System          TGS tmFinnzyme Clones  to  kb in size were          sequenced using a minimal path of transposonbearing          clones Clones  to  kb and those greater than           kb were sequenced with  and  unmapped          transposonbearing clones respectively After the          initial cycle of transposon sequencing the clones were          analyzed using inhouse scripts and Autofinish to          determine their state of completeness and quality DGCr          clones were sequenced using  unmapped          transposonbearing clones After an initial cycle of          transposon sequencing the clones were analyzed for          completeness and quality as described above for DGCr          clones using inhouse scripts and Autofinish DGCr          clone sequences were screened for transposable element          sequences cases of coligation and presence of a          polyA tail before any finishing work was ordered                          In vitrotransposition and mapping insertion          sites          Transposon insertion reactions were carried out in          well format using the Template Generation System TGS          tm according to the manufacturers recommendations          Finnzyme Transposon reactions consisted of  l           ng plasmid DNA isolated from Qiagen or Revprep          DNA isolation robots  l  reaction buffer  ng          Entranceposon Kan R  l MuA transposase and          deionized water to bring the final volume to  l          Reactions were carried out in PCR plates and incubated in          an ABI thermocycler according to the manufacturers          instructions After heat inactivation of the MuA          transposase  l of the reaction were used to transform           l of DH chemically competent cells Invitrogen in          well format Following incubation at C for  h in           l SOC medium cells were plated onto appropriate          medium selecting for vector and Entranceposon antibiotic          resistance Plates were incubated at C overnight          Colonies were picked into ml polypropylene titer          tubes EK Scientific containing  ml LB medium          supplemented with  glycerol and the appropriate          antibiotics and incubated at C overnight These stocks          were then used to inoculate  ml XYT medium in well          square deepwell plates EK Scientific for culture          and DNA plasmid preps Transposon insertion sites were          mapped relative to the vector ends by PCR essentially as          described   Fortyeight transposonbearing clones          were picked for PCR mapping using the MuEnd primer          present at both ends of the tranposon in combination          with vectorspecific primers resulting in  PCR          products Agarose gels were imaged using custom software          developed inhouse Earl Cornell LBNL and analyzed          using an algorithm Supertramp    to identify a          minimal path of transposonbearing clones to be          rearrayed and sequenced                          DNA sequencing          Purified plasmid DNA from transposonbearing clones          was sequenced using  l ABI BigDye II Dye terminator mix          Applied Biosystems in a l reaction Sequencing          reactions were processed through well Sephadex G SF          plates Multiscreen filter plates Millipore and loaded          onto ABI Prism  DNA Analyzer Sequencing primers          specific for each end of the Entranceposon were used in          the reactions ATCAGCGGCCGCGATCC and          TTATTCGGTCGAAAAGGATCC Sequencing of  and           cDNA ends was carried out as previously described            The sequencing reported here was carried out over a          year period during which we made several major          modifications to the strategy for example switching          from sequencing mapped transposon insertions to random          transposons These changes improved throughput and cycle          time but made the process less efficient in terms of the          required number of sequencing reads Because of these          changes it is not possible to give a meaningful single          efficiency estimate however our overall efficiency is          comparable to other efforts using a similar strategy                                      Data processing and assembly          cDNA clone data management relied on custom scripts          and an Informix database Sequences were processed using          phred    and assembled using phrap    and           EST endreads were combined with the transposonbased          reads to generate cDNA clone assemblies We adopted the          sequence qualitycontrol standards defined for the          Mammalian Gene Collection project   Custom scripts          evaluated assemblies for  and  EST reads in a single          contig in the proper orientation at least  bases of           polyA tail phrap estimated error rate of less than one          in  bases and individual base quality of at least          q Doublestranded coverage was not a criterion for a          clone to be considered finished however we have          determined that  of all submitted bases are          doublestranded and  of clones had complete          doublestranded coverage Autofinish   was used to          design primers to improve quality or extend sequence from          multiple sequence contigs cDNA clones with an estimated          error rate greater than one in  bp were          automatically identified and processed with additional          rounds of Autofinish designed finishing work If          Autofinish could not design primers custom primers were          designed manually using consed Custom scripts were used          to manually order primers to generate a further round of          sequencing          The sequence data described in this paper have been

also compared the          nucleotide sequence of each clone to the Release  genome          sequence   using Sim and to the Release  predicted          CDS with the highest BLAST score                          mRNA editing          We confirmed the sequence quality of the genomic          region encompassing CG  bp by independently          assembling an  bp contig consisting solely of          wholegenome shotgun WGS traces The assembled sequence          contig has an average of  sequence coverage The          phrap estimated error rate for each genomic base          corresponding to a mRNA edited base is q Similarly we          determined the phrap estimated error rate for each mRNA          edited base to be q We manually inspected          chromatograms for highquality discrepancies in the          genomic sequence and found none indicating that the          edited bases are not due to population heterozygosity To          validate the editing sites total RNA was isolated from          heads from a mixed population of male and female adult          flies from the isogenic strain           y            cn            bw            sp using the Concert Cytoplasmic          RNA isolation reagent according to the manufacturers          guidelines Invitrogen Nine independent genespecific          RTPCR reactions were performed using the Superscript          onestep RTPCR kit according to the manufacturer          Invitrogen and PCR products were cloned into the PCR          vector Twentyfour independent subclones from each of          four independent RTPCR products were sequenced and          twelve independent subclones from an additional five          independent RTPCR products were sequenced we considered          amplicons to represent independent transcripts if they          arose from different RTPCR reactions or if they differed          in sequence The genespecific primers used in the RTPCR          experiments were
