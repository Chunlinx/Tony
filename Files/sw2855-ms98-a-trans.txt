                okay so do you enjoy camping   i used to love camping but since weve got two little kids our camping styles have changed dramatically   yeah well   weve tried to go camping with them and the last time it wound up with  my husband the only one that couldnt stand them left in the tent because the kids wouldnt calm down they wouldnt go to sleep they were crawling all over us they thought it was just party time all night long you know   yeah we really havent tried camping with with our daughter yet we wed like to now shes getting a little bit older shed enjoy it   yeah yeah   but uh i used to i was in Boy Scouts all through college and everything else so i was involved in a lot of camping you know when i was younger but   oh boy so youre an old hand at it yeah   even my desires for camping have changed uh used to be from roughing it and sleeping outside to now to to tents and motor homes and things like that   yeah yeah i like cabins theyre real nice also ive found that when weve gone camping weve had some bad experiences sometimes when you even have seem to have uh   so   you know tent sites that are a little bit off the beaten path but theres a cluster of them and we wound up with people like you know four feet away from us that are just bombed out of their minds or something all night long partying and thats not my idea of going out you know and being with nature so   yeah plus nowadays you just have to worry about being where you dont cant get behind locked doors even because you know somebody come up and knock you in the head in the middle of the night or you heck you never know   oh yeah its frightening yeah yeah   but uh you know if i if i can get way way up you know way up in the mountains or you know way out someplace i probably be a little bit uh  you know less concerned but uh   yeah we went to Yosemite and um we went we got a little cabin there and that was really nice but uh someplace like that where you like you say you can get way out in the middle of nowhere you know where you can really be away from civilization i i would feel safer there than i would some of these little uh tent site areas you know   uhhuh yeah i wouldnt mind i know my brothers hes a big camper uh backpacker and everything and i id like to try that sometime with him where they they actually just take the sleeping bags and whatever food they they hike in someplace you know up to you know ten fifteen miles and then they they   umhum oh wow oh my goodness my body cant handle that anymore i want a queen size air bed you know to go in the tent or something   they yeah yeah really and truly thats thats thats more desirable course with my wife and daughter you know any kind of outing is is would be good just to get away and do it uh   yeah yeah i found a problem here too since we moved to Texas three years ago i was feeling like theres places with without fire ants or that arent like all summer long its so hot i you know i dont want to be out there when its a hundred and ten degrees out trying to sleep   well thats the thing theres really only a few months that you can really get out and really do anything and uh   yeah and its so wet in the early part of it   and you know unless you know like i say unless you have a trailer or motor home and that and thats really what i would like to do someday id like to be able to afford a a trailer uh   yeah yeah   you know not a real big one but just something that that would have you know airconditioning and a and an icebox and stuff like that so you can you can feel you can feel like youre outside but yet you know have a few conveniences   contained yeah yeah yeah i can relate to that   uh but uh you know   we had some friends invite us to go to a place on a couple weeks thats uh four miles of dirt road and they have a trailer that they keep permanently there a little travel trailer and they said we could just camp out but with a two year old and a three year old three days without running water without the toilets i mean   thats a little tough   i cant imagine you know the diapers after three days forget it   yeah thats thats a little extreme i   yeah so you know i think well pass on that one but   but now you know uh i know wed like to maybe you know Disneyworld has those little campsites out there where you can you can rent a trailer or you know pull one or whatever and that might be kind of fun you know to spend you know spend a week doing all that stuff   oh really thatd be nice yeah yeah yeah that would be fun   but i dont think uh my wife or my daughter are quite  ready for you know hiking into a campsite and sleeping under the stars and all that kind of stuff cooking over a campfire you know   yeah     im not sure im up to it either really yeah   fishing and then going and you know eating what you caught and all that good stuff huh   when i was younger i used to love doing that king of stuff it was a challenge you know because you were with a bunch of other guys and you know you it was almost a competition but   yeah   nowadays i dont care   yeah give me the Ramada Inn   yeah yeah   yeah well i can understand that well we well have to get more supplies too i mean thats why it would be hard for me to imagine backpacking in because it seems like our cars just totally loaded down with everything we have to go camping its like   well of course you know youve got uh you got a whole different set of problems you still you know you need a stroller and   yeah my well my husband said next time we go camping with the kids were just going to strap them in their car seats at ten oclock at night and then well go back to the tent theyll fall asleep and well be able to enjoy nature yeah   uhhuh thats about right oh i remember just like when we traveled you you end up carrying everything uh everything that you own just about to you know take care of the baby uh   yeah it seems like it we need a van or something to get i mean even with if we take the dog forget it theres no room for anything else   yeah     so yeah its hard to do without the creature comforts sometimes   but yeah im pretty rusty at it anyway i dont i dont know how id fare nowadays   well last time we tried we bought a Coleman camp stove that was practically new at a garage sale for next to nothing and then we brought it home and tried one night to get it going and we could never get an even heat off of it so we need somebody you know with experience to go with us sometime or come over and show us how to get it you know going so   well nowadays everythings so expensive i know like you know a good sleeping bag nowadays because like i you know all ive outgrown all that stuff and and its been its  worn out anyway but to go out and buy a decent sleeping bag you know youre talking you know hundred dollars and   yeah oh good grief   and then then a you know a decent tent youre looking at a hundred fifty two hundred dollars and backpack all that kind of stuff i mean you could   yeah you could stay really nicely at a spa somewhere for a week for what it would cost you to buy all that   yeah exactly i mean by the time you get through outfitting yourself and then having to go sweat doing it uh you could you could go on a Club med uh  everything inclusive vacati on     really  oh gee   which id enjoy better anyway   yeah  well it   but uh but i used to be a real good camper when i was younger i i mean i used to just we just you know carry canoes and and uh we used to hike all summer long we used to go up to New Mexico and and we would uh we would do nothing but hike and camp for three months   oh thatd be fun oh gosh   and uh you know wash your clothes wherever you are and you you really get used to the outdoors   yeah yeah   nowadays to for me to think even think about doing something like that i mean its just kind of like no no not m e       yeah its amazing how when you get older you get smarter   i guess id like to think that anyway     people actually call that fun yeah   i cant see that being really fun but   yeah   i guess i guess you know like i say if you know if youre going on a big hunting trip and youre going with two or three other guys that were good at it and that kind of stuff you know it might be okay for a few days   yeah well they have these vacation packages i had a friend that went on where she went uh now what do they call it when you go down the rapids like in these rubber boats and stuff rafting or whatever yeah   oh the white waters   and she went oh gosh to Colorado or someplace and i mean they had like a a a gourmet chef that put you know the meal on for them wherever they tied up at night and i mean it was a whole different ball game wasnt like eating beef jerky or something   yeah some of those things are pretty good yeah yeah some of those things would be okay   yeah just expensive   that would be a little probably a little drastic with kids but for you know two adults it its rough enough   yeah unless you just go and wear them out so badly that theyd collapse by the time they got off the raft theyd be wouldnt be any problem at all for the rest of the evening     um   oh boy   boy id even id enjoy doing that myself   yeah yeah that would be fun   but everybody i everybody ive talked to that has done that they say after about three or four days of that   uhhuh   it takes them uh i mean theyre sore for a week because you know youre all the tensing and the bouncing and everything else you use muscles you havent used in years and   oh really from all the bouncing yeah thats true   and uh it you know that they end up staying home you know another three or four days when they get home just to recuperate from it     oh gosh thats funny     so i dont know       but i you know like i said i used to enjoy camping but anymore you know just the whole atmospheres changed you you dont you dont hear of many people thats taking their families and just going out go camping   yeah yeah thats true   you know now its boating or or you know uh uh going on these uh uh white rapids or whatever the white water you know raft rides and stuff like that   yeah yeah well i have you know hear like most of these people say things like going to you know Walt Disneyworld and stuff like that with their families its more of a luxury kind of vacation than it is the the roughing it or whatever but     yeah well they have that i had its like a water country or something where they have this in the wilderness park its close to it where you can take the kid and and kind of just let them go wild in that water country   hum   and uh you know and you and you kind of camp out and they got little little kitchens in the trailers and stuff but   oh that sounds neat   sounds like it sounds like it would be okay for a few days   yeah yeah well maybe when ours get a little older and we really want to get elaborate we could do something like that but for right now they think its a thrill to put put a pool in the backyard you know one of those little five foot KMart specials give them a glass of juice and boy theyre ready for the afternoon you know   yeah         yeah yeah they are fun   yeah     little toots   yep   sometimes you know i i think it would be kind of neat maybe if she just wanted to get a little tent or something and you know once we get a fence in the backyard and uh and just let her camp out maybe until till   yeah yeah just roast marshmallows and   twelve or one oclock in the morning till she gets scared and wants to come in you know   how old is she     shes six   oh yeah   but she yeah she she looks like she might be an outdoors person eventually but   oh   they both my wife and daughter take after each other they they get hot real easy and just being outside during the summertime   theyll just pass out huh   yeah and you know i i can go out and mow the grass and everything else and and stand it just fine and uh but my wife shes real hot natured She she would uh she just gets gets outside for five ten minutes and shes ready to come back in So i dont i dont think camping this time of year would i dont even think shed think about it   oh gosh yeah no no that doesnt sound too   it would have to be November early December     yeah when we were living in California people all the time went in the winter you know up in the mountains and stuff i dont know i cant see that either um south of San Francisco   where in California oh yeah so that that was thats nice there because you do have some cool weather and some mountains   in Sunnyvale yeah yeah oh yeah the weathers really nice and then you go you know you can go up in the mountains and itll drop thirty degrees just on your drive up there so thats kind of   i used to go to uh Fairfield   umhum umhum   and uh thats real pretty country up there   yeah theres a lot of nice
