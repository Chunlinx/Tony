                    Background        A wellstudied megabasescale region of DNA on distal        mouse chromosome  Chr contains multiple genes subject        to parental imprinting Nearly all genes in this region        show conserved synteny with genes on human Chrp The        extended imprinted region appears to have a bipartite        structure in that it contains at least two separate        imprinted subdomains Each of these subdomains is        regulated by a distinct imprinting control element These        correspond to short differentially methylated DNA sequences        DMRs  one immediately upstream of the         H gene and another within an intron        of the         Kcnq gene These two elements        control respectively the allelespecific expression of        the         HIgfIns gene cluster and the        second gene cluster containing         Kcnq the antisense transcript         Kcnqot p         Kip          Cdknc Slcal IplTssc and        possibly additional genes      There is good evidence        assigning one border of the overall imprinted region to the        DNA immediately downstream of         H     However the other        border which must lie upstream of         Ipl is less welldefined     Here        we show evidence for weak imprinting of a gene         Tnfrh  which is located upstream of                Ipl in mice and which encodes a        putative decoy receptor in the TNF receptor family We also        map the tissue distribution of         Tnfrh mRNA and discuss the        significance of our findings in terms of possible functions        of this gene in placentation                    Results and Discussion        Maps of the chromosomal region containing         Tnfrh and         Tnfrh and the exons of these genes        are shown in Figure ab These two genes have a similar        intronexon organization suggesting that they arose by a        local gene duplication     They are also  percent        identical in their cDNA sequences with  percent overall        amino acid identity Fig  The proteins encoded by         Tnfrh and         Tnfrh share a conserved arrangement        of multiple cysteine residues characteristic of the        extracellular ligandbinding domains of other TNF receptor        family members Fig          Tnfrh and         Tnfrh lie  kb distant from the        KvDMR imprinting center Two other genes         Cars and         Napl  lie between the strongly        imprinted gene cluster regulated by this DMR and the                 Tnfrh Tnfrh gene pair The         Cars gene is not functionally        imprinted and the         Napl gene shows a weak expression        bias in some mouse tissues but not in several human        tissues examined to date      The         Obph gene which shows a strong        allelic bias in mRNA expression in the placenta but not in        other tissues is located upstream of         Tnfrh  Since assessment of allelic        bias in the placenta is complicated by the presence of        maternal cells it is not known with certainty whether         Obph is imprinted Searches of the        genomic and expressed sequence databases using the         Tnfrh nucleotide and protein        sequences did not uncover any strongly similar genes in        humans and low stringency hybridization of Northern blots        of human tissue RNAs with the         Tnfrh cDNA probe did not yield        specific bands Moreover in the interval of the human        genome between         CARS and the human orthologue of         Obph the         OSBPL gene there were no sequences        with detectable similarity to         Tnfrh         Previously Engemann et al described         Tnfrh as having ubiquitous        expression     Consistent with this northern blotting        using         Tnfrh specific probes matching the        relatively divergent  end of this gene showed easily        detectable         Tnfrh mRNA transcripts in nearly all        adult tissues as well as in late fetal organs and        structures Fig  However by far the strongest signals        were seen in the pregnant uterus and whole placenta Fig         Measurements by PhosphorImaging showed that         Tnfrh mRNA in whole placenta was        fold more abundant than in the nonpregnant uterus and        fold more abundant than in the whole fetus Two classes        of transcripts were present the smaller transcript which        migrated at  kb based on other blots with size        standards matches the size predicted from the cDNA        sequence The larger transcript which migrates at  kb        must contain additional sequences but these have not yet        been mapped To evaluate the relative expression of         Tnfrh and         Tnfrh in various organs and tissues        we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain        reaction RTPCR in multiplex reactions using a shared        downstream primer and         Tnfrh  and         Tnfrh specific upstream primers        This showed that both genes are expressed in most fetal and        adult organs and structures but that the expression in        several structures including placenta and muscle is highly        skewed in favor of         Tnfrh Fig         The whole placenta after dissection from the uterus in        midgestation contains both a fetal component the        placenta proper consisting of the labyrinth        spongiotrophoblast and giant cell layers and a maternal        component the decidua basalis as well as maternal blood        vessels We were therefore interested to determine the        precise localization of the         Tnfrh positive cells in this organ        To this end we first dissected each of two frozen        placentas obtained at  dpc into a superficial half        enriched in the superficial fetal components and a deeper        half enriched in deep fetal and superficial maternal        components and extracted RNA from each half This        procedure crudely separates the labyrinthine trophoblast        from all of the deeper tissues Hybridizing the northern        blot with a probe for Ipl mRNA Fig  validated this        procedure         Ipl is specifically expressed in the        placental labyrinth      and this probe gave a strong        signal only in RNA from the superficial halves The same        blot rehybridized with the         Tnfrh cDNA probe gave the opposite        pattern clearly showing that         Tnfrh mRNA is restricted to layers        of the placenta deep to the labyrinth Fig         To determine whether         Tnfrh is expressed in the deep fetal        component or alternatively in the maternal component of        the placenta we next carried out in situ hybridization        with a digoxigeninlabeled         Tnfrh cDNA probe As shown in Figure        abc this gave a detectable signal only in a narrow        band of cells situated immediately deep to the trophoblast        giant cell layer This restricted distribution of         Tnfrh positive cells was observed        both at  dpc when the definitive placental layers have        recently formed and at  dpc after these layers have        begun to mature Fig abc At high magnification the                Tnfrh positive cells were seen        closely juxtaposed to trophoblast giant cells Fig d        The morphology of these cells and their location deep to        the giant cell layer suggested decidual parenchyma These        cells did not coincide with PASpositive granulated uterine        natural killer lymphocytes or with CDpositive        infiltrating Tlymphocytes data not shown However        additional characterization will be necessary for a        definitive assignment of cell type        The expression of         Tnfrh only at the fetalmaternal        boundary obviously suggests that this gene may play a role        in modulating either immune or trophic interactions between        the invasive placental trophoblast and the uterine host        tissue Since         Tnfrh encodes a receptor in the TNFR        family lacking a cytoplasmic domain ie a decoy        receptor this gene might function to block the action of        TNFrelated ligands A similar scenario has been proposed        by Phillips et al     for another TNF ligandreceptor        system namely TRAIL and TRAIL receptors which are        expressed in human placentas However in their studies the        major decoy receptor for TRAIL DcR was found expressed        in trophoblast not in decidua while another decoy        receptor DcR was expressed by placental macrophages Fas        ligand is also highly expressed by human and murine        trophoblast although its functional role in the placenta        is unknown             To investigate potential imprinting of         Tnfrh and         Tnfrh  we next searched for genetic        polymorphisms in these genes that would allow us to        distinguish maternal from paternal alleles in interspecific        mouse crosses We failed to identify polymorphisms in         Tnfrh  but we found multiple        singlenucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in the         Tnfrh gene Table  Using cDNAs        from fetal and adult tissues derived from interspecific        crosses we amplified a region of         Tnfrh containing several of these        SNPs The PCR strategies generated products that crossed        either  or  exonexon boundaries thereby eliminating the        possibility of genomic contamination Fig b Since one        of the SNPs that distinguished the standard CBL        laboratory strain from the divergent strain         M m castaneus CAST created an         Mbo II restriction site in the CAST        sequence we used RFLP analysis to assess allelic        representation in cDNAs from F progeny of BL  CAST and        CAST  BL reciprocal crosses This indicated an obvious        but partial maternal bias in the fetal liver and a nearly        complete bias towards the maternal allele in placenta Fig         This was confirmed by direct sequencing of the cDNAs        and the parentoforigin dependence of this effect was        emphasized by the opposite patterns observed in the        reciprocal crosses Fig  The bias in fetal liver must        reflect parental imprinting of         Tnfrh  but based on the information        from Northern blotting and ISH the pattern seen in the        placental cDNAs in these experiments reflects expression        from maternal cells not imprinting        Other fetal and adult tissues were also assessed in        these crosses and showed a maternal expression bias but        weaker than that observed in fetal liver data not shown        The parentoforigin dependent allelic bias in         Tnfrh mRNA was superimposed on a        baseline bias towards hyperexpression of the BL allele        Fig  This most likely reflects the effects of        polymorphisms in regulatory promoter andor enhancer        sequences Indeed sequencing of the BL and CAST         Tnfrh promoter sequences revealed        multiple SNPs in the region  to  relative to the        transcriptional start site data not shown The        alternative trivial explanation for the baseline bias        polymorphisms within primer binding sites was excluded by        direct sequencing of genomic DNAs        We next repeated the imprinting analysis using cDNAs        from reciprocal crosses between BL and another divergent        strain         M m mollosinus MOLD Since the        polymorphisms present in MOLD do not affect restriction        sites this experiment was done using SSCP to distinguish        the alleles The results again showed an incomplete bias        towards expression of the maternal allele in several fetal        and adult tissues reflecting parental imprinting as well        as a stronger bias in the placenta reflecting expression        from maternal cells Fig  Direct sequencing of cDNAs        confirmed the SSCP data Fig  As was true of the BL         CAST crosses the parentoforigin dependence of the        allelespecific expression was superimposed on a baseline        bias towards hyperexpression of the BL allele As was        true of CAST the MOLD         Tnfrh promoter region differed from        BL at several SNPs thereby providing a possible        explanation for this constitutive bias data not        shown        As a control for these assays we assessed the        allelespecific expression of the         Obph gene using the same cDNA        preparations Consistent with the previous report from        Engemann et al     this showed equal allelic        representation in cDNAs from various fetal and adult        tissues and a strong maternal bias in the placenta Fig         As mentioned above additional work will be needed to        determine whether the results in the placenta reflect        imprinting of         Obph  or alternatively indicate        expression from maternal cells                    Conclusions        The findings described here include leaky but        consistent imprinting of         Tnfrh in several organs and        highlevel expression of this gene in a distinctive        population of cells restricted to the interface between the        placental trophoblast and the uterine lining The absence        of identifiable orthologues of         Tnfrh and         Tnfrh in the human genome suggests        that both of these genes arose subsequent to the divergence        of placental mammals This fact together with our        observation of preferential expression of         Tnfrh mRNA in cells at the        fetalmaternal boundary highlights         Tnfrh as a potential example of the        rapid evolution of genes with functions specific to the        placenta a process postulated to be driven by conflict        between fetal and maternal alleles Anecdotal examples        including pregnancyassociated glycoproteins trophoblast        interferons the         Pem and         Psx homeobox genes and the placental        lactogen genes support the notion that placental genes        evolve rapidly          but counterexamples        can also be adduced Two imprinted genes with        placentaspecific expression and function namely         Ipl and         Mash       are highly        conserved This contrasts with the lack of conservation of         Tnfrh  and the speciesspecific        imprinting of at least one placental lactogen gene            Of more immediate interest is the biological function of         Tnfrh  which will need to be        determined by knockout experiments Since the sequence of        this gene predicts that it encodes a TNF decoy receptor a        likely possibility is that it acts to dampen immune        responses to the fetal semiallograft        Imprinting of genes on mouse distal Chr is controlled        by two DMRs which act as imprinting centers Of these        two control elements the closest to         Tnfrh is KvDMR located in an        intron of the         Kcnq gene and giving rise to the         Kcnqot nontranslated RNA This        element which is  kb distant from         Tnfrh  is essential in cis for the        imprinting of at least  genes         Kcnq          Cdknc          Slcal and         IplTssc       and M        Higgins personal communication All of these genes are        relatively repressed on the paternal allele and active on        the maternal allele The simplest explanation for our        finding of weak but consistent functional imprinting of         Tnfrh  with relative        hyperexpression from the maternal allele is that the        KvDMR control element exerts distancedependent effects        However studies using KvDMRmutant mice will be necessary        to confirm this                    Materials and Methods                  Genomic and cDNA PCR
