                                 The Ebonic Plague            I mean really it seemlike everybody and they momma done had something to say on the subject Thesentence comes from Geneva Smitherman a professor of English the director ofthe AfricanAmerican Language and Literacy Program at Michigan StateUniversity the author of the books Talkin and Testifyin  andBlack Talk  and one of the people quoted most frequently byreporters and commentators seeking context for the national controversy overebonicsa form of Black English recently granted official recognition as aseparate language by the Oakland Calif school board            As ithappens though Smithermans words have nothing to do with the Oakland schoolboards action They were written two decades ago when the vernacular used bymany blacks in Americas inner cities and the rural South was receiving itsfirst round of national attention partly as a result of influential works ofscholarship such as JL Dillards Black English   A few yearslater in a widely publicized ruling a Michigan court ordered local schooldistricts to take account of Black English The most remarkable element of thisstory in other words is how unchanging it is The central pedagogicalproblems low achievement by large numbers of black students and how to reachthese students the scholarly arguments how should Black English becharacterized the flashes of racial feeling the sober and dyspepticpublic commentaryone could transplant it all from one era to another withoutrisk of anachronism            To recap the events of the present era thenbriefly OnDec   the Oakland Unified School District unanimously endorsed aresolution whose ulterior intentions remain unclear but which at the veryleast declares that the primary language spoken by many of its  blackstudents is not English It is a distinct languagenot a dialect notnonstandard speechcalled ebonics a combination of ebony meaningblack and phonics The resolution asserts that deficiencies in blackeducational achievement cannot be remedied unless the prevalence of ebonics isrecognized and somehow dealt with What might somehow dealt with involveRepresentatives for the Oakland schools have given answers that sometimesconflict with the wording of the resolution itself on such issues as whetherebonics would or should be a language used in formal instruction as opposed tosomething that teachers simply should be given financial incentives to be awareof and conversant in whether ebonics would itself be taught as a subject andwhether claiming the status of a distinct language for ebonics was in fact aploy to shake loose federal bilingualeducation dollars an outcome immediatelyruled out by Richard W Riley the secretary of education            Needlessto say the confrontational language of the Oakland resolution and theilladvised statement that ebonics is genetically based did nothing tostifle criticism Click to read the full text of the resolution Theeducational politics of this issue will no doubt play themselves out in theusual messy American wayand with luck they will do so beyond the glare ofpublicity that being where experimental educational programs that involve theinnercity vernacular but avoid the manifestos are already taking place            Two points deserve mention            Firstthe word ebonics which dates back to the early s and has been used evenin some publicschool settings without controversy for years may seem to beputting on airs but what many linguists prefer to call Black EnglishVernacular or AfricanAmerican Vernacular English is a major linguisticstream that has been flowing within recognizable channels for centuriesBenjamin Franklin and before him Cotton Mather left simulations in theirwritings of the speech of some American blacks that anticipate vernacularrenderings today There is of course no single Black Englishthere arevarious black Englishes in Africa and the Caribbean for instanceand BlackEnglish Vernacular is not considered a separate language by most languagespecialists or for that matter ordinary people As one commentator hasrecently noted the complaint about rap lyrics is not that they cant beunderstood But the black American speech at issue in Oaklandhowever onecategorizes it as a language or a dialectnot only is pervasive but alsodisplays features that one finds nationwide owing to its roots in the blackmigration from a common region the South There are telltale characteristicswidely if not universally present the replacement of an initial th with ad sound dis dem and of a medial or final th by

The ancestry of vernacularelements such as these is diverse and includes antique forms of English andslavetradeera maritime lingua franca but an African origin for many of themhas been persuasively argued for West African languages to give just oneexample also tend not to make use of a th sound            Second disagree as one might with the highhanded approachtaken by the Oakland Unified School District the linguistic challengeconfronting urban schools defies armchair comprehension Discussions around theholiday dinner table in Greenwich or Grosse Pointe may characterize ebonics asan issue mainly of laziness or sloppinesssomething whose rectification shouldbe a matter merely of better habits or selfcontrol like standing up straightor looking another person in the eye The frontline
