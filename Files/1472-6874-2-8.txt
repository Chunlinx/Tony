                    Background        Premature ovarian failure is a condition characterized        by cessation of normal ovarian function before the age of         In most cases a precise mechanism for the ovarian        failure is not identified however there is evidence        suggesting a genetic mechanism in at least some cases                     Normal ovarian function in reproductiveaged women is        dependent upon the presence of a store of functional        primordial follicles This store develops from primordial        germ cells a small population of cells that differentiate        from other cell lineages in very early embryonic life           Premature depletion of primordial follicles is a known        mechanism of premature ovarian failure            Studies in mice have demonstrated that ckit a        transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor plays a critical        role in hematopoeisis melanogenesis and gametogenesis        The ckit receptor kinase and its ligand KL kit ligand        stem cell factor are encoded at the white spotting W and        steel Sl loci of the mouse respectively Various        mutations at the W and the Sl loci have been shown to cause        anemia pigmentation defects and sterility    Point        mutations in the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase in mice can        selectively impair fertility without inducing detectable        abnormalities in hematopoesis or pigmentation           Studies employing cultured mouse primordial germ cells have        demonstrated that the SteelKit interaction is required for        germ cell survival             These observations in mice suggest that mutations in the        human         KIT gene MIM  might be a        cause of premature ovarian failure in women The human         KIT gene is located on chromosome         at map locus q Mutations in the human         KIT gene have been identified as a        cause of Piebaldism a rare autosomal dominant disorder of        melanogenesis characterized by patchy absence of        pigmentation of the skin and overlying hair     Here        we test the hypothesis that specific human         KIT mutations might be a cause of        spontaneous premature ovarian failure even in the absence        of detectable disorders of pigmentation or        hematopoesis                    Methods                  Subjects          Our

ovarian failure two          patients had sisters with premature ovarian failure one          patients mother had premature ovarian failure one had a          paternal aunt with premature ovarian failure and one          patient had a paternal aunt a grandmother and a          greatgrandmother who were thought to have the          condition All patients underwent a history and physical          examination and laboratory screening to confirm the          diagnosis of premature ovarian failure                          Cytogenetics          Karyotypes were obtained on all patients Peripheral          blood specimens were cultured for  hours using          standard methods and methotrexatethymidine          synchronization    Harvesting and GTWbanding were          also performed according

of the patients          had clinical or laboratory findings to suggest a stem          cell deficiency in melanogenesis or hematopoiesis Two          women were found to have partial monosomy of the X          chromosome that was felt to be related to the          presentation of spontaneous premature ovarian failure          For this reason they were excluded from further analysis          These findings highlight the usefulness of careful          cytogenetic screening of women with spontaneous premature          ovarian failure The remaining  women had a normal          XX karyotype analysis          One woman of normal stature had a karyotype analysis          showing X recX dupXp invXp q ish          recX dupXp invXp q KAL In all cells          examined there was one normal X chromosome and one X          chromosome that had most of Xp XpXpter replacing a          portion of Xq XqXqter This rearrangement was          confirmed with a FISH study A probe to the Kallman          syndrome region Oncor Inc Gaithersburg MD at Xp          was hybridized to patients metaphases and showed signal          on both ends of the abnormal X chromosome as well as the          normal X chromosome confirming the Gband impression          that both ends of this chromosome was comprised of Xp In          summary the patient had partial trisomy Xp and partial          monosomy Xq as demostrated by Gbanding and FISH          A second woman of normal stature had a karyotype          analysis showing X derX t X qq          All cells examined in this patient had extra material on          Xq which was q in origin FISH was performed using          whole chromosome probes to the X and  Oncor          Gaithersburg MD The X probe showed signal covering the          entire normal X as well as Xp and the proximal half of Xq          on the derivative chromosome Whole chromosome probe           showed signal on the normal  as well as on the          derivative X chromosome These results are consistant          with partial monosomy Xq from qq terminus and partial          trisomy  from q q terminus Given the lack of          symptomscharacteristics associated with trisomy           multiple congenital anomolies with severe cognitive          delays we hypothesize that the derivative X chromosome          is the inactivated X thus sparing the patient the          expected phenotype                          Screening of the KITgene          All the exons of the gene Figure A were          successfully amplified by PCR in all  controls and all           patients with XX spontaneous premature ovarian          failure Except for product  which carried only the          coding region each PCR product contained one complete          exon All PCR products were of the expected size As          shown in Figure B the size of the  PCR products          ranged from  to  bp and all appeared as a single          clear band          The PCR products were screened for mutations by SSCP          analysis We found mobility shifts in the PCR products          from two of the patients and none of the controls As          shown in Figure  patient  had a mobility shift in the          products from two exons  and  patient  had a          mobility shift in the product from exon  In patient           both the polymorphisms were determined by sequencing to          be within intron regions and would thus not change the          sequence of the cKIT protein In the polymorphism           nucleotides upstream of exon  substitution at          nucleotide  replaced the normal T with an A          IVSTA In the polymorphism downstream of exon           there was a deletion of  T nucleotides from within a          normal series of  consecutive T nucleotides IVS          delTTTTT Figure  In patient  sequencing          uncovered a mutation at codon  however the mutation          CT was silent with no change in amino acid sequence          Isoleucine                          Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism          Analysis          The CT substitution in exon  of patient           generates a new restriction site for           Ssp I AAT ATT To determine if          this mutation was homozygous or heterozygous we analysed          restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP on PCR          products As shown in Figure  the mutant PCR product           bp for exon  was digested with SspI to yield two          shorter DNA fragments only  and  bp These data          suggest that this mutation is homozygous We did not          perform RFLP analysis on the mutant PCR products from          exons  and  because no new restriction sites were          generated by the mutations Other methodologies such as          forced RFLP and sequencing of multiple cloned products          could be applied to determine if these mutations are          homozygous or heterozygous                            Discussion        Primordial germs cells originate from a small number of        progenitor cells that arise in very early development        Thereafter complex factors that are not well understood        direct their proliferation survival migration to the        genital ridge differentiation into oocytes and the        subsequent expenditure of oocytes via ovulation or        apoptotic death        Mutations or deletions in        any of the genes involved in this complex process could        theoretically be a cause of premature ovarian failure on        the basis of germ cell deficiency either due to a        deficient initial endowment of primordial follicles or an        accelerated expenditure of this endowment        Evidence that genetic factors play a role in some cases        of premature ovarian failure has been around for a long        time      However the small pedigrees necessarily        associated with this condition make it extremely difficult        to conduct genetic linkage analysis that can be used to        identify candidate genes    One approach to this        dilemma has been to evaluate candidate genes based on        existing knowledge of ovarian physiology as has been        reported in the case of inhibin    Other candidate        genes are those that when mutated are known to cause germ        cell deficiency in other species for example the        diaphanous gene of drosophila    Numerous growth        factors have been associated with primordial germ cell        behavior during migration in mice using         in vitro studies but in most cases        it is unknown whether these factors function         in vivo     One exception is the        SteelKit interaction         Steel and         W are genetic loci identified in        strains of mice that exhibit sterility on the basis of germ        cell deficiency The products of these two loci are now        known to be the tyrosine kinase receptor Kit          W  and its ligand Steel factor          Steel  It was on this basis that we        set out to examine patients with premature ovarian failure        for mutations in         KIT         The SSCP technique has been used successfully for        mutation searching in other genes       Using        the PCRSSCP technique we were able to detect only one        polymorphism in the entire coding regions of the         KIT gene and this polymorphism did        not change the amino acid sequence at codon  Therefore        these results suggest that mutations in the coding regions        of the         KIT gene are unlikely to be a common        cause of premature ovarian failure The upper         confidence limit of the proportion  is  no        mutations found in  women with XX spontaneous        premature ovarian failure The DNA polymorphisms that we        identified within intron regions upstream of exon  and        downstream of exon  would not change the amino acid        sequence of the cKIT protein However we cannot exclude        the possibility that these changes in nucleotides that are        close to exons might alter cKIT transcription or that        mutations in the regulatory regions of the         KIT gene might be a cause of        spontaneous premature ovarian failure Furthermore it        should be noted that SSCP methodology does not detect all        mutations of PCR products Although in this report using        this technique we were able to detect a single nucleotide        mutation in a PCR product of  bp most laboratories        would suggest that SSCP detects approximately  to  of        mutations Screening a larger group of patients with a more        sensitive technique such as denaturing highperformance        liquid chromatography might detect more mutations                    Conclusions        We were unable to detect any significant mutations in        the entire coding region of the         KIT gene in  patients with XX        spontaneous premature ovarian failure Therefore mutations        in the coding regions of the         KIT gene do not appear to be a common        cause of XX spontaneous premature ovarian failure in        North American women                    Competing
