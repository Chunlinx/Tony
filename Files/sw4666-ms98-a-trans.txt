            actually im in like i said im in Minneapolis and the big thing up here of course is the Twins um   i imagine you cant escape it   no its its pretty pervasive it kind of goes into about all aspects of society i think up here but um actually i dont know how much of the World Series you caught last year but that was a lot of fun   well of course it was fun for you   well to be honest with you im not from Minneapolis in fact ive only been up here a few months and im going back at the end of next month   to   uh Orlando Florida   oh really   so im not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything but   i was born and raised in uh near Miami and uh spent the last twenty years in Dallas   oh yeah oh   uh where the Rangers played   uhhuh   and uh for the last uh what year  roughly year ive been in San Francisco where therere two teams the Oakland As and the San Francisco Giants     right   uh but honestly you know i uh i do my duty and watch the sports on uh the newscast     oh okay   but thats about all the exposure i have to sports   yeah yeah i havent followed it real closely at all um except like i said last year when the World Series rolled around i did i did follow that pretty religiously went out to the bars you know drank a beer watched the game sat a girl a good time that way   umhum well yeah sure well i guess the uh San Francisco Giants and the Oakland As were like the leading teams a couple years ago   but uh is that right   well i think i dont know well thats sort of what i gather   umhum   um and uh i dont know what is the prognosis for uh this year   uh real good as far as i can tell people are pretty excited about   oh good i i assume that means good for the Minnesota   well yeah  sorry about that yeah uh as far as the Twins are concerned it seems to be real good       um my roommate went and saw them play um their season opener uh a couple of nights ago and they they won that one seven to one so um thats pretty good i guess it looks like theyll be doing pretty well are you still there   yep   okay i heard some noise on the line didnt know what happened   i think a train went by   oh okay all right   but i know a train went by i dont know what the noise was but i think it probably was the the train   yeah   well i dont know i i i dont even know uh who who has been winning in uh as far as the uh San Francisco Giants and the Oakland As but i think they both won their opener i sort of gathered that in my uh subliminal memory   uhhuh  well maybe that has has good tidings for their uh for their season coming up ive actually got a friend thats living in San Francisco right now uh hes doing the same thing im doing which is basically uh an internship we were both doctoral students and hes doing his with IBM and im doing mine with Honeywell but um i i think he kind of follows the sports and i think hes mentioned um the Oakland As a couple times   hm umhum   uh he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good   i guess theyre in different leagues is that right the As   as far as i know yeah and in the major leagues i guess theres a couple of different divisions and then of course theres the minors um   yeah   i dont know i i guess im one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball   umhum   um but i was talking to my roommate a couple nights ago right after that game and he offered you know to take me to one of the games because apparently hed bought uh he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat or a row of seats actually   umhum umhum   for the home games but the the thing is theres like eighty six home games per year so theres no no way you can ever use them all     eighty six   eighty six i was amazed to hear that you know thats just the home games and i i thought it was a mistake but he goes no see eight     well they must play every day then   yeah well just just about yeah   i mean eighty six times two   yeah   is a hundred and sixty   and thats you know yeah thats almost   and thats Lord thats uh over five months worth   thats a lot of baseball   even if they play every day thats over five months worth   well you you if you if you consider it the season starts well its the season started about a week and a half ago and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place i believe in December or January   no   yeah i think so it did last week year didnt it or was it November   that was the Super Bowl   maybe it was November im thinking about i know it was doggone cold up here um   i dont feel so bad i think you you dont know all that much more than i do about baseball   well i know for sure it was i know it was after September       because thats when i got up here   i see okay   and it and it was at least two months after i got up here   oh really okay well   yeah so it had to be November anyway   well i i i know uh the Super Bowl
