              okay   hi do do you have lots of credit cards   yeah we well we have quite a few but we dont really use them a lot we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards because we like to be able to stop you know when were traveling and stuff wherever theres a station but as far as like MasterCard and Visa   uhhuh   we dont use those too often what about you   um i used to have a ton of gas credit cards and now i have one or two of them but i think ive even let some of them expire but i was living out of the country for a while so i wasnt using them too much and i dont drive that much but i have   uhhuh   you know MasterCard and Visa and you know i have a MasterCard and an American Express now i got rid of the Visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen million cards but as long as like my   right   MasterCard is um free as long as you spend about i dont know three thousand dollars a year or something like that and so i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card when i have the choice   umhum yeah   and um i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff the stores around here dont let you do it too much   oh really   and so i dont but i was living in France and there you pay for everything by credit card but its not really a credit card   huh oh is it like an automatic debit or something oh huh   its a its a debit card yeah and um just you know its  many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash  bye thanks  um yeah because theyre just so well set up with it   really yeah we use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase but we always have the money set aside already to and then we just pay it off the next month we never pay we dont like to pay interest on the credit cards at all   right well yeah i i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i occasionally do   yeah   and you know ill forget to pay the bill by the due date or this last month i mailed the check to them on the twenty second and they didnt get it until the thirtieth and it was due the twenty fifth   gosh uhhuh   and yeah so i thought i and so i got hit up with a credit uh finance charge on it which pissed me off   yeah   because um you know i really did mail it in time   right yeah   but they have no proof of that i dont i dont want to ill probably talk to them some more discuss it but i i never um usually never pay finance charges   yeah that yeah we we screwed up one time like that too we mailed it and they just never did get it and we had to finally mail them another check     i had that hassle one time and i that went on for months and months and months because and they eventually found the check and deposited it and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that and i said well i mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it   huh   so you know i guess i dont know who the the burden of proof is on   yeah i dont either   you know its kind of a because you never do when i pay bills i dont make a Xerox copy of it or i dont   no you figure youll get your check back if you have to   um right or i dont get a i dont mail them all a signed receipt whatever i you know at the bank   yeah   to have a proof of when i mailed it and i mean you cant do that itd be ridiculous   really i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i dont do real often or something from out of state you know where if somethings wrong   right   you dont want to end up having to pay for it a couple times ive had to write big credit card companies and say you know i didnt really get this or   well you can   i dont know what this is   right or i returned it so dont charge it yeah well thats basically what happened with us is we bought a computer and the computer um   yeah   didnt wasnt didnt do what these people said it would do we need to just put external cards in and it wouldnt do that so he brought it back to them and theyre supposed to modify it   uhhuh   and so i called the credit card company and said well we havent really taken possession because its not useful for us we cant use it   uhhuh   and then they said well then dont pay it and then a month later i had to dispute it in writing and i was out of the country and got back and i took care of it as soon as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay i mailed off a check but then it was too late so now theyre hitting   with a finance charge   oh   but its sort of you know its its half our fault   yeah since it well yeah if you filed that letter with them then theyll kind of   and so we right if i had filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually it would have been okay   yeah   so i learned that for the next time yeah   i am like you too about the yearly fees i dont uh i dont like to pay the yearly fee for a card right now both the MasterCard and the Visa we dont have to pay a yearly fee on and   uhhuh   since we dont pay the interest it doesnt really matter what the interest rate   right yeah   is to us as long as we dont have to pay that yearly fee now we had American Express cards and my husband had always had that before we got married and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something like that i cant remember but we decided let that one go and   yeah well my husband and i both have that and i dont know what we pay for his card i pay i think i have a gold one so i think its like seventy five dollars for me   uhhuh yeah   and im not quite sure what it is for him but i had really like there nowadays im not sure so sure that its worth it but um in the past there you know there are some places that only take American Express   umhum yeah   and then they dont have the credit limit because ive over done the credit limit on the other card if my husband and i both travel   yeah   if it you know a couple of plane tickets and a little bit more and youre over the limit on the credit card and um with the American Express they say there is no limit there really is but they tell y ou that but then that was one advantage but thats thats like i dont i think its seventy five dollars for me and forty for him   uhhuh   for a year which is a lot   yeah   be   but yeah like you said if you really if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff   yeah well we should probably get another um Visa card yeah one another one thats free because there are some like i think ATT has one thats free if you make two purchases a year   its more worth it uhhuh oh   well so   yeah that wouldnt be too hard to do   yeah and so thats easy enough to do and if thats true thats um it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit   yeah   and get rid of the American Express because it costs so much   have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to be stuck with that weve never had that problem either   no no i and i dont understand i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it but i dont understand yeah because people think it doesnt really cost them anything to pay i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process   umhum   and sometimes it comes in right away and its like oh well i guess i have to pay that too   yeah   because like many times ill try ill buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey i wont get that bill until the next bill not this bill and it will come in on the next one you have to pay for it right away anyway   right yeah   but sometimes the  is long like ive had things that i didnt get billed on for two or three months   yeah i guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something lot of places have   yeah   those i guess theyre called those pointed sale terminals where its like it goes in the minute you charge it yeah   immediately yeah but thats what happened with us like we bought a washing machine seven months ago and then i got billed like the next day   oh oh gosh   it didnt matter because we couldnt have paid for it by check but we prefer  like with the credit card you get the automatic um one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that   yeah thats nice   you can uh return it so like the washing machine we bought it in October and you know if something goes wrong with it within the first year weve got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturers guarantee   right   and somethings like that are   yeah i like that feature and the insurance like if you break it yourself even you know if you buy something thats breakable   right or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so thats you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use but like if your baggage but things like if your baggage gets lost   yeah     you get money for that   oh really   to buy new bags and things like that   oh i didnt know that   and yeah when you rent a car you get that and sometimes you get discounts with the cards and so
