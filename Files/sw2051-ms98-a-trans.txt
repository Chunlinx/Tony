        all right um i think the topic was crime in the city   right   i do not live in a city i live in a real small little place   where is that   uh its about thirty miles from Sherman   north south east or west   its north of Sherman   well you live almost in Oklahoma   uh it not too far   yeah thats kind of ironic because i dont live too far from Oklahoma either   huh   you know where Saint Joe is   uh ive been through there   im about eight miles south of it   okay oh yeah i had been through Saint Joe but um just as far as you know watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad   well you know ive ive seen those statistics and everything and you know what frightens me is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert   umhum   with high tech weaponry you know i mean the Iraqis didnt have a lot of hightech weaponry but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that   oh yeah sure   and they didnt kill as many people in in forty five days and they were intending to kill people i mean that was their job   uhhuh   as they killed in Washington DC   oh i know i know i know um people i think nowadays people just really just murder is nothing to them you know   well i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years i guess and ive come to the conclusion and this is a pretty scary thought to me even that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime rather than put them in prison because prisons proven not to work just let them go say okay youre convicted   uhhuh   and just let them go   yeah   and if they get convicted again well just kill them   umhum yeah because uh most likely that will happen wont it that you know   well i think that the best hope to eliminate crime as we know it today   umhum   is to eliminate the criminals from society   uhhuh   if someone is known to have been in prison they cant get a job   no   you know they cant be accepted into society   yeah   you know if theyre not going to be accepted into society then everybodys going to become sociopathic   umhum   and you know whos to put the limit on it i mean i was watching a thing last night up in Washington State if you get convicted of uh sexual offenses on a regular basis i mean some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions   uhhuh   and theyre still let out on the street after one or two years well in Washington State if youre a habitual sexual offender they just dont let you out   hum   uh you serve your prison term and then you go into the mental hospital and if youre pronounced cured theyll let you go   uhhuh   well they may find a cure for it but there is no known cure now   hum so youre youre kind of thinking in other words if you get if you do something the first time thats not real bad you know   hey people make mistakes   yeah to go ahead and let them go but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh   well yeah use that or you know theres other consequences rather than killing them you know you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against   oh umhum umhum   you know at least they might be some benefit in that and if the people they committed a crime against   yeah   feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them   uhhuh   but uh you know with the technology technology we have today you can put a collar on a guys leg that will knock him down if they leave the property i mean it will just in incapacitate them   uhhuh   and you can put a collar around a guys leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of you know prohibitive act   uhhuh   but you know putting them in prison my God that doesnt work   no apparently not because look how many years theyve been doing that and look  i mean yeah   well you look at places like Turkey Turkey has death penalty for just about everything   umhum uhhuh   i mean if you get convicted of uh you know drug trafficking they just kill you you get convicted of uh you know uh heinous crimes they just kill you i mean theres no two ways about it   uhhuh   and uh you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few you know and you look at our society almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times   three or four times yeah   right i mean you know   that is true i know   you know the way to stop that kind of behavior is this two fold one you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven i i think thats very important   oh im i agree very much so on that i yeah   and then if a parent has proved to be unfit for any reason   umhum   take t he kids away from the parents   yeah   because you know we are what we teach   umhum   because thats what our society becomes i mean we have a just a bunch of people   comes yeah   and ive and ive ive lived in that that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work you know and these guys they come to work every morning and theyre stoned to the bone i mean their so high they could fly up to the top of that building and they work all day and they go home and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money and then they go back to work on Monday   umhum   and the kids of these people   sure they just think thats the normal thing to do dont they   are phenomenally theyre sociopathic   yeah yeah   and i worked in a first grade uh classroom for one full semester   umhum   and these kids were more foul mouthed than ive ever been i had one kid threaten my life first grader   in the first grade   threaten my life told me that daddys going to whoop me to death   oh no   you know and they flipping me the finger and all that   umhum   and i just said to this kid i said you got two choices kid you can step into mainstream society or you can die   uhhuh   because you will eventually be killed and  you know i just im just totally aghast aghast at a whats going on   oh i know i know um  i work in school you know thats huhuh something i do and i it really is im like you astonishing what the younger ages know and they react to what they see at home You know if they see violence at home thats what youre going to get from the kids at school you know it really is   exactly   and thats kind of sad   well you can see it in the work place you know used to be when you had a personality conflict you just you worked with it and you got through it   uhhuh   now you know people get fired or whats even worse is they promote them into a position that they cant handle and let them get fired   yeah   or one thing or the other you look at another kind of society like the Japanese you put that many people on that small of a space theyve learned to live together okay its in their culture   umhum   and one of the things thats in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while Japan was becoming a great power financially the people that worked for those companies worked for the same company they worked for at sixty five as they did when they were eighteen   teen   and the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people if they werent fit for the job they were hired for they didnt just can them they made a position for them some where   huh uhhuh   uh you look at uh Frito Lay my wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist you know transcribing stuff into the computer   uhhuh   well she can type about one hundred and five words per minute but she dont like it she she just doesnt like to do that i mean she will   cause yeah   but you know her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is
