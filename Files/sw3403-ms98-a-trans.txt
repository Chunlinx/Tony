        well whats your favorite baseball team Rita   well i suppose i supposed to say the Rangers right  is that what i is the million million dollar question here     well this isnt a a a true false or right or wrong test here   yeah uh um you know i would like to say the Rangers but  unfortunately theyre not i was from Illinois and my favorite team was the White Sox   not a Cubbies fan huh   no no my family my dad was but i turned out to be a White Sox fan   well thats all right how do you expect them to do this year   lived in Chicago yeah they did pretty well   okay   whatd you think the World Series   well ill tell you i just uh moved down from South Dakota in July and uh in South Dakota the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where i was living   umhum   and so everybody was a Twins fan and i was  kind of uh didnt have much interest in the Twins you know it was it was kind of pathetic i mean we only had two radio stations and one of them broadcast every Twins game live you know  and the other one was country   so you didnt really have a lot of choice did you   so thats right it was Twins there or you know Skip Williams   or country yeah oh uh and i was routing for the Twins myself because uh they a couple of Ranger players that i had watched when we first moved here uh went to Minnesota and we used to tease about my son and i used to have a bet going because about some of the players that had moved from here to Minnesota but it was interesting it certainly was an exciting series anyway   it sure was it sure was   what do you thinks gonna happen to the Rangers how can we predict   well i would i would like to assume assume assume that theyre gonna do do better this whole this coming year i would sure hope so anyway when we moved down uh i was able to go to my first you know baseball game and   umhum   thought this is great this is incredible so i i became a Rangers fan i i didnt really have one in South Dakota so i adopted the Rangers or rather they adopted me i guess   umhum   and uh it was just exciting you know you can watch baseball on TV and they hit the long ball and it looks like wow they really hit that ball but when you go to the ballpark its really not all that far   no   you know and its so much more exciting watching a ball come at you and   oh isnt it though you know but oh i i think going to ballpark it really really makes it because then you watch it on TV you feel like youre more a part of it too   thats right thats right   you know well im a great sports enthusiast so i love you know baseball teams and they in fact on the news tonight Nolan Ryan was on there he was being he was put in the which id never knew exist the Restaurant Hall of Fame   the Restaurant Hall   the Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight   huh   and he uh says hes coming back you know and he doesnt know how many years i mean to pitch hell be at least one more and he said hes been saying one more and its been two and three might be two and three more  he likes it   right thats right and hes still doing great still doing excellent   yeah thats right you know and he said i get a kick out of it uh you know hes hes such a nice man   well didnt he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers   yeah and he you know when he quits at being active he will go into you know being a managing and yeah you know being a coach im sure   management right   but hes uh he certainly is a good example uh for the kids   thats right   you know you like to have someone like that you could point to to say see what a fine man that he is   you know some of the like uh Ivan Rodriguez wasnt even born when when uh Nolan Ryan started pitching   thats right   and its just incredible to think that theres uh there are players who are the sons of ballplayers that used to play against Nolan or with Nolan   umhum   you know and now their sons are   oh hes been a legend for so many years you know and i dont know were you here had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at UT with his son his son pitched for UT and he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers   huhuh i wasnt   yeah it was a i think it was a a little early part of the summer and uh   was it Nolan against uh oh it it was Ryan against Ryan huh   Nolan against Ryan against Ryan yeah his son pitched for UT   well that is neat   and uh only uh Ryan didnt want too much publicity on it because he didnt want the son getting too nervous about this whole thing game is a game you know well the Rangers   uhhuh   really uh knocked the socks off of them which you would expect you know anyway but Nolan i think took himself out after a couple of innings or something   right   you know of the game to let
