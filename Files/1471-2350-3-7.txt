                    Background        In spite of advances in surgical and pharmacological        treatment about half of the aneurysmal subarachnoid        hemorrhage SAH patients die and many who survive need        rehabilitation to maintain independence causing        significant economic losses to medical and social care        About  of SAH cases are caused by a ruptured IA            Percase mortality for ruptured IAs is about  to  and        morbidity about  as opposed to about  mortality and         morbidity for elective surgery of unruptured IAs in        asymptomatic lowrisk patients      Given the marked        contrast between the outcomes of elective versus emergency        surgery the goal has to be identification and treatment of        IAs prior to rupture        There is substantial debate regarding the costbenefit        ratio of population screening         Restricting        screening to those individuals at high risk both for        developing IA and for rupture would improve the        costbenefit ratio Characterization of environmental and        genetic risk factors would allow not only reduction of risk        through behavior modification but also significantly        improve detection Additionally some environmental and        genetic risk factors may be amenable to pharmacological        intervention Simple tests for genetic risk factors would        permit the identification of individuals at high risk for        development and rupture of aneurysms consequently allowing        diagnostic effort to be concentrated on a smaller group        that is at higher risk        Currently several risk factors have been identified        including cigarette smoking arterial hypertension gender        aging atherosclerosis and heavy alcohol consumption               Initial indications of a genetic component were        based on collections of case reports that suggested that        IAs are associated with some rare simple Mendelian        disorders eg autosomal dominant polycystic kidney        disease Ehlers Danlos syndrome type IV and the Marfan        syndrome     More recent systematic prevalence        estimates indicate either absence of association or        markedly reduced prevalence of IA among patients with rare        simple Mendelian disorders      Also genetic        analyses of genes known to cause some simple Mendelian        disorders have proven negative for collections of patients        with IA      The familial occurrence of IAs not        associated with known simple Mendelian disorders was first        noted in     and since then nearly one hundred        case reports and review articles have been published        Populationbased studies of SAH probands show that  to         have a family history of IA a higher percentage than        previously appreciated       These familial IA        FIA families have no signs of any other simple Mendelian        disorders predisposing to IA supporting the possibility        that some or all IAs have a genetic component and that FIA        is a genetic disease separate and apart from previously        defined diseases The inheritance patterns of FIA have not        been determined partly because IA is a late ageatonset        disease and partly because it is likely to be a        multifactorial disease for which simple Mendelian models        will not fit well                           Methods                  Study subjects          Eightyfive families with at least two members with          ruptured or unruptured IA and no family history of          polycystic kidney disease were ascertained from a          sampling frame of  consecutive patients treated          between  and  for aneurysmal SAH by the          Department of Neurosurgery at the University Hospital of          Kuopio which serves a genetically homogenous population          of  in eastern Finland     Initially family          history was assessed by a short questionnaire and all          putative cases were confirmed from medical and autopsy          records Due to the high mortality of IA and lack of          prerupture symptoms surviving relatives with known IA          were rare We therefore used magnetic resonance          angiography to screen  siblings over the age of  of          the IA probands     Positive magnetic resonance          angiography findings were then confirmed using digital          subtraction angiography Upperabdominal ultrasonography          was performed on all screened individuals and confirmed          that none of these individuals had evidence of polycystic          kidney disease In this manner we detected  siblings          with asymptomatic IA giving a total of  affected sib          pairs from  sibships  extended families families            and  had two sibships each Figure and Table           One nonsib pair was detected in one of the sibships          in family  see Statistical analyses below Figure           and eliminated from the analyses leaving  ASPs for the          genome scan The ASPs were comprised of  males and           females Blood samples were obtained from affected family          members unaffected siblings and parents where          possible Due to the late age at onset parents were          available in only a few of the families All family          records were confirmed through registries kept by the          Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland          The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the          Institutional Review Boards of both the University          Hospital of Kuopio and Wayne State University                          Study design          Wholegenome scans are laborintensive and costly          since each individual in the study must be genotyped for          all markers Reduction of the number of samples          genotyped or the number of markers or both has been          shown to be efficient         We used a          twostage design In stage  samples are genotyped at          low density and subsequently at higher density in stage           thereby reducing the overall number of markers          genotyped Stage  data were analysed using a liberal             lod   Regions exceeding the threshold were          genotyped in stage           Power was computed assuming a twostage design           ASPs and a map density of  cM For stage I alone we          had at least  power to detect significant linkage          lod score of     to a locus with a          locusspecific relative risk to siblings of  and at          least  power to detect suggestive linkage to a locus          with a locusspecific relative risk of                           DNA isolation and preamplification          Blood was collected into EDTAcontaining tubes          Genomic DNA was isolated either by an automated procedure          Genepure DNA extractor Applied Biosystems Inc Foster          City CA or manually Puregene DNA isolation kit Gentra          Systems Inc Minneapolis MN Genotyping was performed          using genomic DNA either untreated or amplified linearly          using primerextension preamplification               Approximately  g genomic DNA was used for          preamplification with an N            primer      The resulting          preamplified DNA was then used as a template in marker          PCRs with specific primers                          Genotyping          Most of the initial genotyping was performed by the          National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Mammalian          Genotyping Service at the Marshfield Research Foundation          using the  cM Weber version  screening set              Primer pairs for additional markers were obtained from          Research Genetics Inc Huntsville AL For the          additional genotyping PCRs were carried out with one of          the primers radioactively labeled PCRs were set up using          a laboratory workstation Biomek  Beckman Palo          Alto CA and performed in PEC  thermal cyclers          Perkin Elmer Cetus Foster City CA The alleles were          scored visually from autoradiographs and entered into an          Oracle database Oracle Corp Redwood Shores CA          Population frequencies for each marker were estimated          from a sample of  to  unrelated Finnish subjects                          Statistical analyses          A Markovprocessbased test of genetic relationship             using all the marker data across the genome was used          on each nuclear family to confirm the sibpair          relationship one nonsib pair was detected in one of the          sibships in family  Figure  and eliminated from the          analyses The results were consequently derived from           sibships Figure           The genotype data were analyzed for genetic linkage          with both singlemarker and multipoint modelfree ASP lod          score analysis    using the computer program          MAPMAKERSIBS                                Results                  Genomewide linkage analysis          We performed stage I of a twostage genome scan using          the  Finnish ASPs Due to the genetic homogeneity of          the Finnish population        the probability          of identifying genetic risk factors in a complex disease          such as FIA may be substantially improved                In the first stage a  cM genome scan was performed          using the Weber screening set     and the data          analyzed using both twopoint and multipoint ASP linkage          analysis Seven regions on chromosomes   p q            and X with multipoint lod scores exceeding           pointwise Pvalue   were identified Table  Two          regions had MLSs exceeding   on chromosome            on chromosome X Twopoint lod scores exceeded           for two adjacent markers in each of these regions ruling          out substantial genotyping error in one marker as the          cause of the high lod scores Three additional regions          with multipoint lod scores exceeding  chromosomes            and q also had substantial twopoint lod scores at          more than one marker For two regions p and q          however only one marker had a high twopoint lod score          In both cases the significant marker was either the          first or the last marker typed on the chromosome          Following conventional guidelines we considered an MLS          of  or greater to be significant linkage and an MLS          of  to be suggestive linkage              In stage  we genotyped additional markers in the          seven regions identified in stage  Four additional          markers flanking DS on p and nine additional          markers flanking DS on q were typed and the          resulting maximum MLSs were  p and  q          indicating that the previous linkage signals were likely          due to the increased statistical variability commonly          seen in the multipoint signal at the most extreme          markers We therefore eliminated regions p and q from          further consideration Additional markers were typed in          the two regions on chromosome  and X with maximum MLSs          exceeding  A multipoint plot for the chromosome  is          shown in Figure  the maximum MLS was  at DS           DS The maximum MLS for chromosome X decreased from           at DXS to  at DXS about  cM          centromeric from DXS The MLS for the region on          chromosome X decreased considerably with the addition of          several new markers and consequent improvement in the          accuracy of the multipoint allelesharing estimates          which were clearly overestimated when only the initial          scan markers were included in the analysis All the          evidence for linkage in this region was due to           brotherbrother pairs the  sistersister pairs and the           brothersister pairs gave maximum MLSs close to zero          in this region                            Discussion        The relatively high prevalence of IAs and aneurysmal SAH        place the disease in the group of moderately common        disorders Consequently it shares some of the features        that make common disorders complex with respect to genetic        analysis These include low sibling relative risks due to        the high population prevalence presence of multiple        genetic loci each contributing a small portion of the        sibling relative risk incomplete penetrance of genetic        loci environmental risk factors late age at onset and        phenocopies ie disease due to purely environmental        factors Additional complexity for genetic analysis arises        due to diagnostic uncertainty Several measures were taken        to increase the probability of success We used robust        modelfree allelesharing genetic analyses to address the        complexity we studied a relatively genetically homogenous        population and we verified that all putative IAs were        saccular         It is expected that a        genetically homogeneous population particularly one with a        recent population bottleneck      segregates for        fewer disease loci thereby allowing a smaller sample size        to be informative Additionally our study design was        costeffective twostage design with  ASPs We are        collecting an additional  ASPs for further study        The most promising locus with a maximum MLS of  was        on chromosome  The peak is located approximately in        q a generich region containing a number of loci        related to cerebrovascular cardiovascular and membrane        physiology and pathobiology These include

another        recent genomewide scan for IA susceptibility genes            Although our study found evidence for a region with        tentative linkage on chromosome q the region identified        in this study is near the telomere and does not overlap        with the region of suggestive linkage near the centromere        on q identified in Onda et al     The populations        that were studied are distinct Finns as compared to        Japanese however both samples were small and it is        therefore possible that there may yet be some overlap in        genetic predisposition                    Conclusions        We detected two regions of suggestive linkage one on        chromosome  and the other on the X chromosome in a sample        of Finnish ASPs Although we initially detected regions of        tentative linkage on chromosomes   p q and  the        regions on p and  were excluded upon additional        genotyping None of the regions detected in this study        overlap with the regions detected in a sample of Japanese        ASPs                        Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        Author  JMO
