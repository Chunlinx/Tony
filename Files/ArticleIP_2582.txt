the PittsburghTribuneReview  Richard Mellon Scaife who owns the TribuneReviewand a fortune of  million is dubbed the Wizard of Oz behind the Fosterconspiracy industry in the White House report Scaife certainly does seemobsessed Although the TribuneReview is a small suburban daily lots ofzoning and highschool sports Scaife employs Ruddy as a fulltime VinceFoster reporter The TribuneReview posted the forgery story in itsonline archive of Ruddys work            The LondonTelegraph also promoted the forgery theory with a story headlinedVince Foster Suicide Note Forged Say Experts The Telegraph is theonly newspaper that matches Ruddys Fostermania Its principal scandalreporter Ambrose EvansPritchard has published lots of stories on thesuicide All of them are stored on the Telegraph s snazzy
