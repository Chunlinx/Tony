                    Background        During positive inotropy there is an increase in ATP        utilization and thus myocardial oxygen consumption related        to increased crossbridge cycling and calcium handling            Heat measurements of isolated heart muscle have        assigned approximately  of total energy consumption to        crossbridge cycling and  to calcium cycling            However recently studies in both isolated hearts and        myocytes      examining the energetic effects of        increasing inotropy with the calcium sensitizing agent EMD         have suggested that the energetic cost associated        with increasing inotropy is largely related to calcium        cycling In these studies EMD  resulted in only small        increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and this was        felt related to the ability of EMD  to increase        inotropy without increasing calcium cycling though        intracellular calcium was not directly measured        Consistent with this Brandes et al    have studied the        contribution of mechanical work and calcium cycling to        total mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis as measured by NADH        levels using fluorescent spectroscopy of rat cardiac        trabeculae They concluded that there was an equal        contribution of mechanical work and calcium cycling to        total ATP hydrolysis In the present study we hypothesized        that energy consumption during altered inotropy is largely        to related calcium handling To study this we directly        measured developed pressures myocardial oxygen consumption        and used a newly developed technique to measure        intracellular calcium in perfused mouse hearts with the        calcium sensitive fluorescent dye rhod     during        calciuminduced inotropy and with dobutamine In addition        we studied the perfused mouse heart as the ability to        manipulate the murine genome will likely provide important        information about the molecular determinants of energy        consumption in the heart        The mechanisms controlling calciuminduced inotropy are        probably several fold and include activation of protein        kinase C     of which several isoforms are calcium        dependent Protein kinase C decreases maximal actomyosin        MgATPase activity through phosphorylation of troponin I            This would be predicted to result in a reduction in        force or developed pressure relative to intracellular        calcium resulting in an energetically inefficient state        Thus we predicted that high perfusate calcium positive        inotropy would result in lower developed pressures relative        to both intracellular calcium and myocardial oxygen        consumption compared to dobutamine and that high perfusate        calcium would be associated with evidence of protein kinase        C activation though not dobutamine                    Results        During increases in perfusate calcium    mM        there were stepwise increases in developed pressure and        developed pressures with dobutamine were significantly        higher than perfusate calcium  mM Figure A Peak        systolic intracellular calcium increased minimally between         and  mM despite significant increases in developed        pressures indicating increased myofilament responsiveness        to calcium at perfusate calcium  compared to  mM        Figure B Also indicating reduced myofilament        responsiveness to perfusate calcium  mM compared to        dobutamine levels of peak intracellular calcium were        similar for these  interventions despite higher developed        pressure with dobutamine Increases in myocardial oxygen        consumption reflected the changes in peak intracellular        calcium in that there were minimal changes between  and         mM perfusate calcium and myocardial oxygen consumption        was not significantly different between perfusate calcium         mM and dobutamine Figure C Thus the ratio of        developed pressure to myocardial oxygen consumption an        index of economy of contraction significantly increased        between  and  mM perfusate calcium and was        significantly higher with dobutamine compared to high        perfusate calcium Figure D        To further explore the differences between dobutamine        and high calcium positive inotropy analysis of pressure        and calcium transient waveforms and phaseplane plots        relating pressure to calcium was performed Pressure        waveforms were significantly abbreviated with dobutamine        compared to high perfusate calcium total waveform        duration    vs    ms p   The time        from onset of the pressure waveform to peak pressure was        not significantly different between dobutamine and high        calcium    vs    ms pNS though the time from        peak pressure to fall to baseline was significantly shorter        with dobutamine compared to high calcium    vs           ms p   An example of a normalized pressure        waveform is shown in Figure  No significant differences        were seen with calcium transient durations at any level of        perfusate calcium or dobutamine examples Figure ABand        C Total transient duration at  mM perfusate calcium        was    ms and with dobutamine was    ms pNS        and there was also no significant difference in the time        from onset of the transient to peak  mM perfusate        calcium    vs dobutamine    ms pNS or        difference in the duration between the peak of the        transient to return to baseline  mM perfusate calcium           vs dobutamine    ms pNS Phaseplane plots        illustrate that high perfusate calcium results in a similar        increase in intracellular calcium compared to dobutamine        though relatively smaller increase in pressure Figure        DE and F Thus the ratio of pressure to calcium at        the point of peak systolic pressure is significantly higher        with dobutamine compared to high perfusate calcium           vs    mmHgnM p   Figure  The        increase in the dynamic trajectory of the phaseplane        plot between peak calcium and peak pressure may relate to        underlying changes in the steadystate forcecalcium        relationship as proposed by Hunter            The specific protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine        significantly inhibited high calcium positive inotropy         to  mM p   though had no effects on        dobutamine or with lower levels of perfusate calcium         to  mM Figure A The effects of chelerythrine were        mediated through preventing the expected increase in        systolic and diastolic intracellular calcium figure B        The difference in myocardial oxygen consumption between         and  mM perfusate calcium was significantly reduced with        the addition of chelerythrine   to  mM alone           vs   to  mM  chelerythrine           molesming dry wt p   Also chelerythrine had        no significant effects on developed pressures at a constant        perfusate calcium of  mM    to    mmHg        pNS                    Discussion                  Measurement of intracellular calcium and myocardial          oxygen consumption in the perfused mouse heart          Isolated perfused mouse heart measurements of          intracellular calcium and energetics have been performed          using other methods by other investigators               The unique aspects of the present study are that we use          the calcium sensitive fluorescent dye rhod to measure          intracellular calcium      and that we have related          these measurements to both myocardial oxygen consumption          and developed pressure An appreciation of the strengths          and limitations of these techniques is required to          critically evaluate the results For instance          measurements of intracellular calcium are taken from the          outer layers of the left ventricular free wall though          our measurements of myocardial oxygen consumption and          developed pressures are global measurements Differences          between the epicardium and endocardium have been          described    and our measurements of intracellular          calcium do not take this into account and regional          differences in myocardial strains and oxygen consumption          are also not accounted for However one advantage of          using rhod is that its long excitation and emission          wavelengths relative to other calcium sensitive dyes          results in minimal filtering of excitation and emission          light and autofluorescence      At these visible          range wavelengths light may penetrate between  and           mm into the myocardium    which may be significantly          deeper than shorter wavelength dyes This is          approximately  of the total wall thickness in the          mouse     and thus our measurements are from the          outer  of the myocardium          Measurements of intracellular calcium and myocardial          oxygen consumption have been performed in different          hearts due to the difficulty in obtaining these          measurements in a single experiment and this may          introduce variability into the results We have also          performed only  interventions per heart The time taken          to obtain stable measurements of effluent oxygen          saturations used in the calculation of myocardial oxygen          consumption is approximately  minutes and the mouse          heart preparation is usually not stable beyond           minutes so that only  interventions can be obtained          Furthermore when comparing different inotropes such as          high calcium and dobutamine it is desirable not to use          the same heart As we have postulated that different          signaling pathways may be activated by these inotropes          serially administering these to a single heart may result          in persistent activation of a protein kinase even after          washout of that agent          Coronary flow does not increase with inotropes in this          study though other studies with perfused mouse hearts          have shown an increase     The reason for this is          unclear though oxygen delivery to the heart is not          compromised We have the advantage with the use of the          absorbance spectrum between  and  nm used in the          calculation of intracellular calcium that this is also          sensitive to the presence of deoxy or oxygenated          myoglobin     With our technique the myoglobin          spectrum is invariably consistent with full oxygenation          and any rare hearts that do not show this pattern are          discarded By using physiological heart rates and          temperatures we have attempted to reproduce normal murine          physiological conditions As the mouse heart has a          negative forcefrequency response at physiological heart          rates     developed pressures in our studies are          lower than might be expected with lower heart rates          Nevertheless the developed pressures in this study are          quite consistent with other studies       That          pressures in perfused mouse heart studies are generally          low may relate to the resistance of the murine myocardium          to extracellular calcium     Diastolic calcium          levels are relatively high with this method especially          with dobutamine or  mM perfusate calcium table           This appears at least in part related to the limited          sampling of  time points per beat in the current paper          and may also relate to motion artifact associated with          the positive inotropes These limitations are especially          prominent in the small and rapid beating mouse heart          Recently improved analogue to digital capabilities and          software acquisition has significantly improved our          ability to record many more time points during the          cardiac cycle and with this we have noted slightly          higher differences between peak and diastolic calcium          levels MacGowan and Koretsky unpublished data It          appears unlikely that this is related to a calcium          overload state as diastolic pressures do not rise with          high perfusate calcium or dobutamine and pressure          waveforms abbreviate with dobutamine                            Conclusions        In the perfused mouse heart high perfusate calcium        positive inotropy compared to dobutamine results in reduced        myofilament calcium responsiveness decreased energetic        efficiency and is dependent in part on protein kinase C        activation It must be recognized that agents that increase        the amplitude of the calcium transient through activation        of protein kinase A such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors        are associated with adverse outcomes in congestive heart        failure patients     and so our findings with        dobutamine are unlikely to translate into clinical benefit        Nevertheless these results illustrate the importance of        calcium handling in the energetic efficiency of an        inotrope and these methods will be useful in studying        genetically engineered mouse models with altered        myofilament calcium responsiveness                    Materials and methods                  The isolated perfused mouse heart and myocardial          oxygen consumption          Experiments were performed in  groups In one group          developed pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption were          measured in the perfused mouse heart In another group of          perfused hearts intracellular calcium and developed          pressure were measured Male mice SV ter strain          mean weight    g were used Anesthesia was          induced with  to  mg of intraperitoneal          pentobarbital sodium and the animal was anticoagulated          with  units of heparin The heart was removed from the          chest and the aorta was cannulated with a  gauge          needle Retrograde coronary perfusion at a constant          perfusion pressure of  mmHg with oxygenated modified          Krebs solution was started The Krebs solution consisted          of mM NaCl  KCl  MgSO             NaEDTA  NaHCO             Glucose  Pyruvate           CaCl              M octanoate and pH was          adjusted to  For some studies the concentration of          calcium was varied to produce an inotropic effect The          concentration of NaCl was adjusted accordingly for these          experiments to maintain osmolality To eliminate the          effects of cathecholamine release by pacing esmolol           M Du Pont Wilmington DE was added to the perfusate          The temperature of the perfusate entering the heart was          set at C Flow was monitored with a glass flow meter          A rubber latex balloon on the end of a plastic cannula          was inserted into the left ventricle through an incision          in the left atrium This was then connected to a Gould          pressure recorder Gould Cleveland Ohio for          measurement of left ventricular pressure The left          ventricular diastolic pressure was set at    mm Hg          using a microsyringe Hearts were paced at  Hz which is          physiological heart rate for the mouse using a          stimulator with one lead inserted into the right          ventricle and the other adjacent to the epicardium In          the myocardial oxygen consumption experiments the          perfused mouse heart was placed in a glass water          jacketed chamber which was sealed at the top Myocardial          oxygen consumption was determined from influent and          effluent oxygen content measured by blood gas analyzer          ABL Copenhagen Denmark and flow rate                          Measurement of Intracellular Calcium          The methods used to measure intracellular calcium with          rhod in perfused hearts have been previously          extensively described       Rhod Molecular          Probes OR  g was dissolved with dimethylsulfoxide          DMSO  L and dH            O  L and loaded through the          coronary perfusate After the washout period serial          measurements of fluorescence alternating with absorbance          were taken Fluorescence scans were taken at high time          resolution to allow quantification of changes in          fluorescence during the cardiac cycle Excitation at           nm and emission at  nm was used for fluorescence          measurements          Quantification of the relative amount of rhod in the          heart using absorbance measurements was done by taking          the ratio of absorbance at  nm rhod sensitive to           nm rhod insensitive which eliminated the effect          of motion as both wavelengths would be equally affected          by motion though only  reflected the concentration of          rhod     These wavelengths   nm were          chosen as these were isosbestic points not effected by          changes in absorbance of myoglobin induced by oxygen          desaturation     In solution maximal rhod          absorbance is at  nm However this wavelength is          effected by changes in oxygen saturation the relative          absorbance compared to  nm is decreased due to inner          filter effects and it does not adequately correct for          changes in scattering     Dye absorbance A           rhod  was calculated according to          the formula          A           rhod  logR            R                        R            R                       rhod             where R            is the reflectance intensity at          the rhod sensitive point of  nm and R            is the rhod insensitive point          before             and after            rhod loading          At the end of the perfusion protocol maximal          fluorescence used in the calculation of Ca i was          determined by tetanizing the heart with a bolus of          calcium chloride  mM without any energy substrate          and with cyclopiazonic acid Sigma Chemical Co  M          which is a potent inhibitor of Ca ATPase and thus          blocks calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum              Fluorescence and pressure were monitored          continuously and the point of maximal fluorescence was          taken as the point were pressure stabilized at a steady          state To account for changes in light scattering          properties from the heart during tetanization the          maximal fluorescence was corrected by multiplying by the          ratio of R            pretetanization to R            during tetanization              Intracellular calcium was calculated using the          formula          Ca i  K           d F           t  F           o F

           and confirmed by invivo manganese quenching ref              and is  nM F           t  fluorescence at time t F           max maximal fluorescence from          tetanized heart and the

counts from the          heart prior to dye loading and           a  rhod fluorescence in the          absence of calcium  rhod fluorescence in the presence          of saturating calcium For rhod the value of           a is approximately  thus for          rhod F            was assumed to be equal to F           b           To account for changes in dye concentration formula           needs to be

       max is not determined when heart has          tetanized because of the marked influence of the shape          change and desaturation of myoglobin on the reflectance          spectrum                          Interventions          For each heart only a baseline and one intervention          was used and N   for all groups The time to achieve          a stable state particularly with respect to effluent PO            concentrations or load rhod and          then acquire baseline data and perform  intervention is           minutes beyond which the preparation is not stable          and so more than  intervention per mouse heart was not          undertaken In the developed pressureoxygen consumption          experiments the following interventions were used           varying perfusate calcium from baseline  mM to            baseline perfusate calcium  mM to  mM  baseline          perfusate calcium  mM and then addition of dobutamine           M  to antagonize the effects of protein kinase          C the specific antagonist chelerythrine ref   nM          CalbiochemNovabiochem Intl La Jolla CA was added to          the perfusate when inducing positive inotropy In all of          these the chelerythrine was added to the perfusate          containing the higher level of perfusate calcium or          dobutamine This dose was chosen to reduce the expected          increase in pressure with perfusate calcium  mM by           after dose ranging studies  nM to  nM In addition          in another group of experiments during constant infusion          of perfusate calcium  mM chelerythrine was added          without changing perfusate calcium concentration In all          experiments the control period was followed by the          intervention and repeated measurements of both developed          pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption were taken for          a period of approximately  minutes Measurements of          intracellular calcium were performed  at perfusate          calcium concentrations at baseline of  mM increasing          to  mM  decreasing from  to  mM and            mM baseline with subsequent addition of dobutamine           M The effects of chelerythrine on intracellular calcium          was only determined for those interventions with which          chelerythrine had significant effects on myocardial          oxygen consumption and developed pressure                          Data and Statistical Analysis          One way analysis of variance with the Scheffe test was          used to test significance of differences between groups          Developed pressure data from the myocardial oxygen          consumption and intracellular calcium experiments were          combined as this was obtained under the same experimental          conditions The ratio of developed pressure to myocardial          oxygen consumption was derived as an index of economy of          contraction Data are expressed as mean  standard          deviation
