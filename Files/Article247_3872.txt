                                 The First Republican Debate            The first of the  Republican debates which took place this evening inDurham NH was a little like a production of Hamlet without HamletIf you tuned in to CSPAN you got to see what all the remaining minorcharacters were up to But absent the central reference point of the GOPcontestGeorge W Bushit was a performance of dubious value              Heres how the five candidates who showed up were running                           Gary Bauer was running against Steve Forbes Bauer like Forbeswants to be the conservative alternative to Bush So right out of the blockshe laid into Forbes flattax plan criticizing it on the grounds that under itsome rich people would pay no tax at all Bauer hit him again on the issue ofmostfavorednation status for China asking Forbes directly if he supportedkeeping it An agile debater Bauer drew a bit of blood with these thrusts Hisother strategy for wooing conservatives was to mention constantly hisrelationship with Ronald Reagan whom he served in the White House for eightyears Bauers low moment came at the end when he made a craven plea to PatBuchanans supporters I wish he would stay Bauer lamented I certainlywant his supporters to stay and quite frankly Id like his supporters to votefor me                           Steve Forbes was running away from Gary Bauer Forbes appears tobelieve against all evidence that he has a chance of winning the GOPnomination so he doesnt want to be drawn into an intramural rightfringefight for third place So he ignored Bauers attacks on taxes and China andtried to demonstrate his conservative credentials by getting as far to theright on abortion as Alan Keyes He did this by asserting that constitutionalprotections should apply to fetuses from the moment of conception thusimplying that women who use the morningafter pill as a form of birth controlshould be prosecuted for capital murder Despite the best coaching millionscan buy Forbes still comes across as a robot running low on battery power Heemits his words metronomically His hand gestures are dissociated from hiswords He raises his eyebrows and forgets to take them back down again With million less he would have been laughed off the stage                           John McCain was running against Bill Bradley McCain hopes to attractDemocrats and independents who in New Hampshire can choose to vote in theRepublican primary His first answer to a question about child povertydecried the growing gap between rich and poor in America McCain laterpointed out that  million children dont have health care which he called adisgrace He also framed education as a civil rights issue and repeatedlydenounced corporate welfare especially for ethanol Asked a blunt questionabout abortion he suggested continued if tepid support for overturningRoe vs Wade  This ticked off Keyes who responded By the waysenator I think that the abolition of Roe vs Wade would deserve alittle louder affirmation that that McCain held his own but his appealdoesnt really come across in a debate format He has Bob Doles problem Tolet fly with his caustic wit risks a boomerang effect But restraining himselfhe seems too restrained                           Alan Keyes was running against Vladimir Illych Lenin Keyes thinksthat the other side actually won the Cold War and that he is the only one whoknows about this We must get rid of the socialist structures that control ourgovernment beginning with the income tax itself he declared at the outsetexplaining that he would prefer to fund the federal government with tariffsduties and excise taxes He then tried to pick a fight with Cokie aboutwhether the Catholic Church had gone socialist too Wearing a TVunfriendlyblooming lilac tie and a shirt that matched the color of his suit he appearedto be having some kind of fit through most of the debate Im not sure that histechnique of simply shouting over the moderator when his time is up is going tobe effective                           Orrin Hatch was running for vice president Hatch takes everyopportunity to praise his rivals yielding time to his distinguished colleaguesas if they were all in the Senate Mainly though he praised himselfconstantly reminding viewers of the many important committees he has served onHatch also took credit for just about everything significant Ronald Reagan didas president Frankly if you look at it weve had an unprecedented economicexpansion over the last number of years Its been primarily because Reagan gotmarginal tax rates from  percent to  percent by  he said I was oneof a handful who convinced him that should be done More extraordinary wasHatchs claim that he was the guy who talked Reagan into winning the Cold WarI was the one who convinced Reagan we should give the Stinger missile to theMujahadeen Hatch said now called one of four reasons why the Cold War camedown Id give Hatch the Admiral Stockdale Prize in the debatethe prize forhaving no idea why youre there
