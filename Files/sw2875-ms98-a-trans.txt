                okay cars you you maybe this is a fantasy we can to talk about any kind of car we want here       i want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac   hey that sounds like a great deal to me  you have great aspirations  well lets see i we just bought uh a seventy three Mercedes that we have restored     oh thats great your husband uh im im a hobbyist too i like to work on cars too   and it yeah it has really been a lot of fun uh we found some guys that actually you know worked for a Mercedes dealership and uh they also repair them for other the people on their off time   oh thats good   so have we we have redone that thing from stem to stern i mean inside outside you know weve redone the body repainted it detailed it so you know i really havent thought much past that it seems like you know i dont know if ill ever want another new car again you know   was you why they they didnt say buy it they didnt necessarily say buy it new they just said what would you buy you know   maybe not yeah thats true i i dont know it just seems like uh you know for what weve put into it i feel like thats something that might retain its value a little bit more than you know yeah yeah yeah   oh sure a restored vehicle is is great i think certainly if its an old Mercedes will be good   yeah right we the one thing that uh we did decide as its its we wanted it to be as authentic as possible but we did break down and put a CD player in it  thats not quite authentic but at any rate that that was one thing that i one of the features that i did want     well thats great   id passed up on one and put a sunroof in it i had to stop there   oh yeah you all you all done a lot more when i talk about working on cars i sure dont do that   yeah well of course we do it ourselves but like i said we were just lucky to find these guys that do it you know theyre they just werent really expensive and   oh okay okay oh that is good to have uh knowledgeable people   and uh yeah you know right and they work on it so the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and and work on it or work on it so   thats amazing   yeah its you know its really its really been nice we uh   i i do all my own work uh so i i have Chevies mostly well thats all ive got right now ive got three Chevy V Eights im uh im uh a Chevy im an American car person but i do like Mercedes   uhhuh uhhuh yeah youre an American car person yeah yeah i i have always had an American American car and uh i had a real real bad experience with the Cougar that i had it was an eighty two Cougar   yeah   and uh i dont know i think it just soured me on it for some reason because i had trouble with it starting the engine blew up  in it i had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so   yeah   you know i i thought what the heck you know well try something different so   well im not a Ford person and never have been as a kid and uh i do like the V Eight engines and i think the the   yeah   i went to the auto show with my daughter hear recently down in Dallas and i to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling engines right now i mean im not saying that they were a couple of years ago   uhhuh uhhuh really yeah right yeah yeah i would that that theres i see a marked improvement you know you know as far as uh what ive heard about performance and such   oh yeah   you know so uh uh hopefully itll stay that way i mean you know id id i would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has   oh yeah   you know even though right now im not driving an American car but uh i think   i uh you know they said they said what do we want to buy i im uh seriously not seriously thinking but i i would like to put it in that category uh buy a Cadillac but i wouldnt buy a new one and you know of course if i had the money id be happy to by a new one but uh   uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah yeah   i do look for a one year old vehicle you know with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles whatever   uhhuh yeah twenty thousand yeah yeah well thats what my parents are avid Cadillac freaks they had uh and i think my my mother drives the SeVille now thats uh i guess its a couple of years old and uh she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was sort of   oh yeah i remember those yeah   yeah yeah and she it final just wore out they had they had purchased it i dont cant remember how many years they had that car but she loved the styling of it   that she may want to save if she she doesnt have it anymore   no she sold it and she   that since they dont make them anymore she that could be turned into a classic in in ten fifteen years   yeah i know yeah she kept telling herself that and its sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said well just let me take it down there and find out whats wrong with it i mean he came back with a new car  yeah i think he had an ulterior motive he could just see you know dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went but uh   no he wanted new one yeah right yeah   they they really are nice cars there there   i im still a full size person and i like a full size Cadillac i i want one of those i think they are i dont know a classic but theyre certainly not they havent changed in about uh twenty years and   yeah uhhuh yeah yeah   and theyll eventually phase them out uh and i sure would like one ever those uh uh within the next five years or so   yeah it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again you know they had   right   theyve scaled everything down so much and uh i have i dont ive never owned a really large car i dont know i think that Cougar was the biggest thing i ever had and   well even the Japanese cars are bigger too but uh ive never had a Japanese   yeah yeah now the Lexus are very nice looking cars you know   ive never had a Japanese car i ive had friends who had them   uhhuh   and i think theyre a lot over rate and theirs no styling to them that you cant tell one Japanese car from the other they all look alike you know i dont mean that as a joke i mean they really all look alike and the adds i dont have any idea what which car it is   thats true thats true yeah yeah what is what yeah uhhuh uhhuh   until i look at it to see what it is and i think they have not uh lead the field in styling they do have nice sports cars   yeah   but the price is way more you can get a Cadillac for the same price as you can get a small Japanese car its ridiculous now   uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah i know that uh ive ive sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike  you know i guess it just uh there seems to me theyre all the same shape i have a very good friend that   umhum   has a Buick Regal and she shes had shes got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it and thats what shes going to buy again and im like oh please it looks exactly the same as this old one that youve got and so i guess its in the eyes of the beholder i suppose   yeah oh yeah yeah well if if youre interested you  to go to the next auto show i i look at the Cadillacs and boy there were some Cadillacs that i didnt even realize they made but they were just styled so differently   really uhhuh uhhuh   they were standard Cadillacs but they really looked beautiful   are they still are what theyre what they have out for like the next year is everything still pretty square it seems like the Cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really i i cant think of a car that they make are the than maybe the   oh no they have they have convertibles now in the Cadillac field and they have that new uh its not the big uh Fleetwood the one i want which is the same in the last twenty years   yeah uhhuh uhhuh yeah   theres another one that has came out in the last few year its not the Seville the Seville is totally different no the auto show they had fantastic looking cars so uh   uhhuh now when when was this when this was this recently   oh yeah it was a month or so ago   oh okay because i have a   well they have it every year   yeah usually when i see the new cars its during the fair when i go to the auto building at the State Fair and thats usually when i see anything you know   right now this was uh in it was downtown in the uh Convention Center they had all the cars they had certainly had Japanese and German cars they had the full range and they had some they had some new cars that werent even out they had a uh   oh i see yeah   new Chevy Suburban truck you know that big big one that was uh they didnt have a price on it nor did they know had a it would cost it had a microwave in it and everything it was they had several futuristic cars   oh really uhhuh oh my word thats wild you know you you hear about things like that and you think that cant possibly be done i mean it just thats just too weird   yeah i know and i like engines they had a lot of broken down engine not broken down i mean you know cut uh displayed engines you know   uhhuh right uhhuh so you could tell the what see the inside of them or whatever yeah   oh yeah but uh that that sold me in buying a new car you know i mean certainly interested in buying a new car but again the yeah the American cars were for superior in styling and new engines   yeah yeah hum well maybe somebodys finally woken up you know   and uh i think so because theyve been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while and i think that i i would definitely buy again theres the question are we in the market uh   yeah yeah   and i could buy anything you know   oh yeah you know i could fine i i was really crazy about Jags for a while and the convertible what is it XJS or something like that and i you know thought thats a dream car and and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant you know i   yeah yeah well i work on them myself so i dont that you know my cars dont go to the shop you know so uh i am a mechanical engineer and ive always done it myself and uh   yeah yeah well thats good that you can   ive got three of them and uh i cant remember one i think i had one someone welded a muffler on for me in a years time i think thats the only thing of the three vehicles that ive in it just the welding on like i said i dont do that you know   oh really that oh gosh thats great i think it takes a talent to do that you know my my husband is uh engineer but he cannot i mean i or maybe hes just doesnt want to mess with it thats might be part of it but uh you know we just i just say forget it well just take it in and have it taken care of he drives drives a Honda   yeah i i noticed that when i was a kid uh i was wasnt a mechanical engineer but i worked my way through college as a mechanic so i learned early from fifteen on   uhhuh right yeah   and dropped it for a long time when after i got out of college and then picked it up again later on and now again ive got three vehicles and i i dont i never  and they just dont go to the shop at all you know   umhum yeah well thats to  thats one thing that when you would consider see when i go out to think about a new car or buy another car i dont think about well is this engine that i can work on or that you know my husband can work on or whatever   uhhuh   you know so youre youre pretty lucky in that respect that   yeah im keeping V eight V eight Chevy engines because thats what i know and in fact i stock the same part im like a little stock if you brought your Chevy to me i could id probably have some parts for it right now you knows   yeah thats what you know yeah umhum thats pretty good its really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car and when i say we have redone everything i mean we have redone everything and its     oh thats great ive always wanted to that too   its really been so interesting the people you meet because uh my husband Carl has called all over the country you know hes gotten these catalogs trying its really more difficult to find these vintage parts than you might think this is for a seventy three   oh i can imagine
