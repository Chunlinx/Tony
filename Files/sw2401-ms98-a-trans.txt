        okay the car if i buy a car itd probably be an American made car thats whats with me wrong because i feel of the economy i would probably buy an American made car even though sometimes the foreign cars are better but were losing a lot of money buying foreign cars and people getting out of jobs as it is so id probably buy ive always own American car uh the kind of car is probably something i couldnt afford like a Lincoln i would love to have a Lincoln   uhhuh     mark seven   a Mark seven   yes   uh what do the Mark sevens usually run   oh about thirty five to forty   thirty five K   uhhuh   well theres a tremendous amount of money alright   its a luxury car its a its a sports luxury car its right below the Continental the Lincoln Continental   i see   you know its its along that line umhum   i agree about that uh American cars should be the ones to be bought  um i just wish their quality would to still improve further   yeah theyre getting even better i think   oh yes its a matter of time its probably going to be another two to five years before theyre really up to par where they should be and then i believe the majority of American people will   yeah already have foreign cars   yeah   uhhuh   they will already have in fact i have one myself im reluctant to admit   i dont my mother has one   she does   yes she finally she wanted she had a shes got a a Honda um not a Honda a Toyota that what is it Accord no Honda Accord yeah   Honda Accord yes thats one   and she hasnt had any problems out of it see   what year model is it   oh think its a eighty nine   eighty nine   uhhuh   well thats fairly new mine mine is an eighty four Sentra   uhhuh   and the only problem ive ever experienced major type problem ive experienced is a a fuel pump  had to be replaced and its got eighty four thousand no its got eighty nine thousand miles on it now   see i have a i have a Lincoln Continental right now   you do   its a yeah its a seventy nine Lincoln its got over a hundred thousand miles and there is no problem with the car see the i think   no major malfunctions then   huhuh huhuh my air conditioner went out but i mean  ten years but uh i mean as far as major theres nothing major with the car   i see well thats good to hear   but it i think what it is the American public had made good cars at one time and then they started more or less trying to hurry stuff the first car i think now that they have thats uh thats  made it on the what do you call it the mechanics list or the the why they check the how they judge cars what is it list where they come out with the consumer list   in Consumer Digest or a Consumer Reports   yeah is a is a is a Taurus   a Taurus   yeah thats the first one thats made it and uh its a you know its a four door its a nice car now for me to buy a Taurus i would have to buy top of the line Taurus and thats Taurus Show   uhhuh   its its its it has a four speed i like that stick shift but see thats top of the line that costs twenty whereas a Taurus would cost about a regular Taurus i think is twelve or thirteen   well thats not too bad in price listing   huhuh the the yeah see the Taurus Show has the spoiler kit and the and the big engine and the and stuff like that   it has an eight cylinder   it has the well yeah i think it has the it has that engine like the Mustang   oh yeah   yeah and its a four its i think its you know the speed uh uh manual transmission   correct   so but yes i would definitely buy one of those before if i had to between that and Lincoln id probably buy the Show   Lee Iacocca stressed on the mini van uh i mean the mini van has been one of the best top of the line vehicles for Chrysler isnt it   yeah   um   i dont know   their durability is a lot better i understand than most other vans     i think it would its not so much of the vans any more or the cars some of them are ugly   right   im sorry  they look like space mobiles   theres a lot of uh duplicity in the vehicles the way the build them too   uhhuh   insofar as their design um uh American even foreign but im sure its all for streamlining or for air streamlining   yeah why you cant still go fast so whats the difference thats what i dont understand you know theyre making it so that theyre talking about the wind current and how how efficient it is but if you cant go fast you cant go fast i dont care how sleek they make it it just makes sense to me Its like theyre making a a model of a speed car when you cant go fast   right   you know the in in Germany it would probably be alright if you put it on that autobahn   but over here nobody should be going that fast to be worried about wind   no   uh yeah  just a second going to pick them up excuse me for a moment right im fixing to get them right now excuse me i had to uh talk to my boss   i know how that go but i guess thats about it and i better let you go   okay so i guess we have nothing to do on the other end theres no uh interruptions here to tell us that were done or   uhhuh thats it just hang up all righty bye   okay later     come here
