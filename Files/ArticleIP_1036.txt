                                 Who Pays for the Internet             Even a fairly short middaytelephone call from say Los Angeles to Paris can cost  Yet that sameamount will buy you a month of an online service that includes unlimited emailall over the world For  you can make one to three hours of longdistancetelephone calls Or for the same  you can surf the Web day and night for amonth download as much data as your modem can handle enjoy unlimited emailand evenif you own the right softwaremake as many telephone calls to NewYork or Paris or Timbuktu as your heart desires            How isthis possible Worldly cybernauts may find the question navethough fewerknow the answer than think they do To newcomers the economics of the Internetis among its greatest mysteries Herewith a primer            First the wrong answer that the Internet is hightechpork The Defense Department created the Internet in the late s andthe government supported the Internet heavily from the s till the earlys But no more The last major subsidy ended in  Now except for a fewsmall shrinking and unnecessary federal grants the Internet is a commercialconcern Telecommunications companies computer companies and Internet serviceproviders ISPs built own and operate all the phone lines and computernetworks that comprise the Net            Thereal explanation of the Internets cheapness lies in the difference between thetelephone system and the Net A note The rest of this article applies to theUnited States The same basic rules apply to Internet users elsewhere exceptthat they probably pay more for Internet service and lots more forphone service            Consider a typical longdistance telephone call fromme in Washington DC to my aunt in San Francisco My longdistance companywhich happens to be MCI gives me an uninterrupted realtime circuit betweenmy house and my aunts In exchange I pay MCI about  cents for every minuteIm connected Of that  cents MCI pays about  or  cents to my local phonecompany Bell Atlantic for carrying the call from my house to MCIs lines Itpays another fraction probably  cents to Pacific Bell for delivering thecall the last few miles to my aunts house MCI pockets the rest            Theactual cost of a longdistance callafter all capital costs have beencountedis only slightly more than that of a local call But for decadesCongress and the FCC have mandated artificially cheap local phone service andartificially expensive longdistance service MCIs payments to local phonecompaniescalled access chargesare a subsidy It costs Pacific Bell lessthan a cent to deliver my call The other  cents are payback for giving myaunt cheap and unlimited local calls            Now consider the Internet In one very important wayusing the Net is no bargain You need  worth of computer hardware toconnect to it about  more than the price of a telephone But once youvegot the gear the Internet beats telephone costs for three significantreasons             The Internetexploits low local phone rates Unless you live somewhere remote you reachthe Internet by making a local call to your Internet Service ProviderYour ISP in turn leases superfast longdistance fiberoptic cable from MCISprint ATT regional Bells and other telecommunications companiesThese firms have plenty of fiber to spare These fiberoptic lines carry yourInternet traffic around the country delivering it to Network Access Pointswhich link different networks like highway interchanges When your data reach aNetwork Access Point they hop on a line owned by another company and travel totheir destination But because the Internet travels on leased lines the dataentirely avoid the longdistance phone companies own networks andtherefore avoid the access charges the longdistance companies must pay tolocal phone companies on normal telephone calls             Talk isnt cheapbut data are  ISPs can offer unlimited access on their lines for tworeasons First it saves them billing costs telephone companies by contrastspend billions every year calculating who used what line and when SecondInternet data transmission is remarkably efficient When you make a minutelongdistance voice call the phone company maintains an open circuit from endto end You pay for every second even if youre on hold When you go online tocheck out a Web page you may spend  minutes reading the page and  minutesdialed into your ISP But you only use the Internet for a few secondsthe time it takes to send your request to the pages Web server and for theserver to deliver the page to you For the other  minutes and plus secondsthe ISPs longdistance line is free Many Internet users can share a line thatwould need to be occupied full time by a telephone call            There are no guarantees on the Internet  Telephone service is a promiseYou can be almost certain that you can complete a call immediately to anyoneelse with a phone Internet service is a shrug You can be reasonably sure butno more that you can send your data to another Internet user prettyquickly            The Internet is an uncertain network because it ispacketswitched This means that data are broken up into small pieces orpackets Each packet seeks the cheapest route at the instant it is sent tothe destination When all the packets arrive at that destination a computerreassembles them Packet switching is a frugal efficient way to send data frompoint a to point b albeit via points c d q and k But packet switching isnot terribly reliable Packets routinely get lost or delayed cripplingcommunication            Internet telephony one of the coolest new online applications illustratespacket switchings drawbacks If two Internet users own the right softwarethey can talk by telephone over the Net It is miraculously cheap Speech isdigitized packetized and sent over the Net for no more than the cost ofonline access But because the Net gets clogged and packets are waylaid thesound quality is low and interruptions are common            The Internet may soon be less of a bargain  It isclogging as more and more Net heads use packetintensive realtimeapplications such as Internet telephony and RealAudio These streamingapplications swallow enormous chunks of bandwidth for long periods of timeeliminating one of the Nets chief economies There are three principalremedies for Internet congestion             ISPs can lease more andbigger lines             Customers who want toensure fast access can replace their modems with pricey highbandwidth ISDNlines T lines cable modems and so on             ISPs can discriminatebetween heavy and light users Customers will pay a premium to use streamingapplications or send highpriority messages            Remedies  and  arealready taking place The third is coming soon All of them will make theInternet easier to use And in the short term all of them will make theInternet more expensive
