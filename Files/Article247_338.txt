                                 The Post Withholds Credit Where Its Due            Its intellectual dishonesty time again Chatterboxs Indis citationgoes this time to the Washington Post  which today reports on Page  the firing of Wen Ho Lee a TaiwanesebornAmerican scientist at Los Alamos whos suspected of turning over nuclearsecrets to the Chinese According to the Post  Lee got fired afterfailing a polygraph test last month and after complaints from Sens Trent Lottand Richard Shelby Shelby is chairman of the Senate Intelligence committeeThats true But readers will be forgiven for wondering whether the firing hasanything to do with a splashy New York Times frontpage story thatappeared two days before and identified but did not name a Los Alamosscientist who was believed to have passed along nuclear secrets to the ChineseThe Times storys impact was mentioned in yesterdays accounts of Leesfiring by the AP and UPI but it wasnt mentioned in todays Post storyby Walter Pincus            Newspapers hate to credit other newspapers They will do it when they haveto which is why in its initial followup story to the Times scoop twodays ago the Post did cite the Times  Because that piece wasalso by Pincus Chatterbox wont bother to set the Indis Hall of Fametimer aticking this time out But the fact remains that the appearance of theTimes piece was surely a precipitating event perhaps theprecipitating event in the firing of Wen Ho Lee It had a big impact It washyped by Matt Drudge on his Web site It landed Richard Shelby on NBCs Meetthe Press one day later giving Shelby a highly visible platform from whichto scream and yell about the alleged security breach  Meet the Presscredited the Times generously too            Whether the disproportionate attention given to the front page of the NewYork Times ought to be a major factor in government decisions is ofcourse another question One can argue as the Post has more or lessbeen doing in its coverage of the ongoing China technologytransfer story thatquestions about what the US should be selling to the Chinese are very murkyand that the Pulitzerhungy Times has been hyping this scandalsimportance in the series of pieces that Jeff Gerth has been grinding outThats the subliminal message of an accompanying story in todays Post  But if theTimes  take even if its wrong really is driving events shouldnt thePost acknowledge that            On a less lofty plane it does seem a bit unfair that the Times getsto cover itself with glory over exposing Wen Ho Lee when the Wall StreetJournal ran a piece on page A for breaking news its version of page by Carla Anne Robbins conveying essentially the same information on Jan This fact seems to have eluded the media as do many facts that appear in theJournal  for the simple reason that the Journal is not availableon Nexis This used to drive Chatterbox crazy when he worked in theJournal s Washington bureau Assuming no one else had it beforeRobbins shouldnt Gerth have credited her                           Timothy Noah
