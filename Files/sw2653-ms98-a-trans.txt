        so i own uh a PCAT at my home   uhhuh i could never justify owning a personal computer at at home uh i mean thats quite an expense to look for uh well well well who is this what do you do use yours at home for   well thats actually a good question my wife works out of the home uh our home she has an office and it sits actually sits in the office and she uses it to compose and print out letters   okay well now   so thats a a very regular use of it that she has   uhhuh   and then in addition to that i tinker around with it im a computer scientist   oh   and so i write programs to do little things im actually working on a data base at home just just to keep track of things nothing special and also im interested in writing some programs that will you know kind of like remind me of things uh like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like although   uhhuh well excuse me i uh uh well im im a technician electronics tech and years ago TI sent me to their uh computer school down in Austin   humum umhum umhum   so uh i learned to repair one but you know i never really learned to operate one   oh thats a key thing well actually theres thats a theres really two issues to that that theres so many packages software packages available today that just require no programming   yes   so that you you in other words when someone built that software package they had to use the programming but if they were careful they could uh make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works   umhum   but i think you you you really hit the nail on the head for the average person is exactly what he can use it for and if your wife isnt working out of the home and sending out letters or if you dont want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage or whatever there your issue is then there really is   well uh space is a handicap with me i live in a motor home   oh i see wow   and im preparing for retirement   i see well congratulations on that   hey im not too far from it another year and a half   yeah well actually uh one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap that   yes definitely the just like the computers   umhum   uh remember how they started out running three four hundred dollars   right oh the calculators you mean   now i mean calculators calculators i beg your pardon yeah   yeah uhhuh yeah they sure do yeah i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum you can actually buy a whole a whole brand new computer with a not not a uh necessarily a slow one or or inadequate one but a pretty good one       for six hundred dollars   youre kidding including a printer   no hm that well actually actually i wasnt including a printer but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars so make it seven hundred   a hundred   yeah   wholly smoke uh a respectable one   yes uhhuh umhum   well see of not being particularly interested i dont keep track of prices on them but im im that does amaze amaze me   yeah the prices have plummeted you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply the box and the mother board of a a type of computer called an  for about two hundred dollars   umhum hum   and then the keyboard is another fifty the monitor with the card that drives it is another hundred and then the disk drive is two fifty and   well what what is a a a good brand a for inexpensive   well thats the thats the deal is youre not buying brands now youre buying these knock offs so theres uh probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one theres theres a magazine called Computer Shopper   huh huh   its a its a big magazine i mean its its twelve inches across uh narrow the narrow side and and fifteen fifteen seventeen inches the tall side and its probably an inch thick a thousand pages but the book is the magazine is full   oh wow   of these mail order computer mail order houses and theyre all competing with each so you just flip through there until you find a  computer   umhum   thats thats called thats the original PC so its be called a TI PC im sorry an IBM PC compatible and youll find all these things and youll find the monitors for forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board board for twenty five dollars which is amazing to me and just you mix and match and then you do it by mail order   hum   but theres no real brands theres probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards the main computer the circuit board   i see how do you go about getting one of those uh catalogs   theyre available in you know the B Daltons that that type of thing   umhum   youll notice it in that its its a its a very its although its a magazine its large and like i said its about an inch thick   umhum well getting back to the PCs ill tell you i uh first of all i dont like a machine thats smarter than me       and secondly i learned did learn this much about computers theyre theyre they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten       in binary   thats right thats great   well anyway thats one of my favorite jokes about that   oh yeah   one and one equals ten   yeah thats great   course you its its kind of an inside joke you know   yeah     you can only tell that to somebody who understands binary   i understand thats great thats a good joke   so what do you uh uh work with uh computers uh at TI   well what i did for years and then i was was a scientist over in central research labs and just recently ive changed my job to actually do some of the marketing   uhhuh   so i now i i type that one but i dont use it anymore   umhum well i just recently started using one uh connection with my work   i dont umhum yes   uh i keep track of an inventory here and of course now that is where a computer is is very handy   umhum yes i agree   and well i its my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated   oh yeah   uh see im with the QRA lab   oh i see thats fascinating   qualification and evaluation so naturally our equipment has to be in in top condition and is constantly calibrated and theyre dated   umhum   so i have to keep up with them uh and its very handy doing it on the computer   yeah   i just run a printout every week and and it puts me right uptodate what im what i have to do what i have to ship what i should be expecting to be returned   umhum   so uh it it is handy   right   and i must admit that up until i did start using one uh it was i had very little interest in computers   yes     but they are amazing   yeah they certainly are so lets see so i guess with respect to the question yeah i i guess weve weve kind of covered it   well i think we did   great nice little conversation with you Jack good good day thank you good same to you   yeah Mike you take care now good luck to you
