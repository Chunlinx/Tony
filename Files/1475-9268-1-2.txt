                    Background        Although numerous hypotheses have been proposed to        describe the etiology of aneuploidy in human gametes the        only steadfast association remains maternal age             Besides this association very little information is        available about the numerous potential mechanisms that may        disrupt normal chromosome segregation in oocytes Based on        studies involving compounds that alter microtubular        kinetics and induce both cellcycle delay and aneuploidy        several groups have proposed that temporal perturbations        during mammalian oocyte maturation OM predispose oocytes        to aneuploidy        In addition to faulty        microtubule kinetics perturbations during OM may also stem        from abnormal function of centrosomes kinetochores        spindle checkpoints proteins the anaphasepromoting        complex APC the securinseparincohesion complex        proteins and the proteasome            OM encompasses the nuclear and cytoplasmic changes that        occur during the transition from the dictyotene stage of        meiosis I to metaphase II MII During this transition        tightlyregulated posttranslational        phosphorylationdephosphorylation events and        proteasomemediated proteolytic reactions regulate the        activation and inactivation of signal transduction pathways        that control chromatin condensation nuclear membrane        dissolution microtubule nucleation and formation of a        haploid oocyte       Several kinases that exert        major roles during OM include maturation promoting factor        MPF      mitogenactivated protein kinases MAPKs             and the product of the cmos protooncogene Mos        kinase      Also during OM oocytes undergo two        highlyregulated metaphaseanaphase transitions MAT in        which homologous chromosomes are equally and randomly        segregated to an oocyte and first polar body and a        subsequent division in which equational division of sister        chromatids results in a haploid oocyte and a second polar        body The MATs are predicated upon the coordinated        activities of the spindle checkpoint      the        anaphasepromoting complex APC or cyclosome             the proteasome      and the cohesioncomplex        proteins involved with chromosome cohesion and separation              Alterations in the temporal sequence of these        coordinated activities may potentially predispose cells to        faulty chromosome segregation        Abnormal chromosome segregation has been observed in        mice lacking the Mad checkpoint protein     The        spindle checkpoint utilizes sensory proteins that detect        kinetochoremicrotubule tension and occupancy and        transiently block anaphase until all of the chromosomes are        properly attached to microtubules       Although        the mammalian spindle checkpoint appears to differ between        mitosis and meiosis the two meiotic divisions and male        and female germ cells     anaphase subsequently        follows stable kinetochoremicrotubule attachments            in both vertebrate mitotic    and meiotic           cells        The APC is a large protein complex that ubiquinates        mitotic cyclins and other regulatory proteins that are        destined for timely proteolysis by proteasomes             Proteasomes are multicatalytic S proteases consisting of        a S central core catalytic subunit bordered by two S        components     which hydrolyze Cterminal peptide        bonds to acidic basic and hydrophobic aminoacid residues             Proteasomes proteolyze securins which inhibit        separase activity Separase is needed for inactivating        cohesions and enabling sister chromatid separation             in both fission yeast    and mammalian cells            Although differences have been reported among species           and cell types     it appears that the majority        of cohesion is removed from mammalian chromosomes during        prophase and prometaphase whereas a lesser amount remains        at kinetochores until anaphase onset Proteasomes        translocated to meiotic spindles of rat oocytes and MG        inducedinhibition of proteasomal activity resulted in        partial segregation of chromosomes during meiosis I            Moreover defective proteasomal activity in fission yeast        impaired chromosome segregation            To test the hypothesis that transient inhibition of        proteasomal activity during mouse meiosis I was associated        with chromosome missegregation mouse oocytes were exposed        in vitro to the reversible proteasome inhibitor MG and        metaphase II MII oocytes were analyzed for structural and        numerical chromosome aberrations This transient arrest of        proteasomal activity represents a perturbation during the        normal temporal sequence of events during OM                    Results        Transient exposure of mouse oocytes to MG for  h        followed by washout of the compound and an additional  h        culture in vitro enabled exposure of cells during meiosis I        and sufficient time for them to progress to metaphase II        Although the majority of MII oocytes were classified as        normal Fig A the data indicated that MG induced a        doseresponse perturbation or delay in the rate of OM and        an increase of single unpaired chromatids and hyperploidy        in MII oocytes Table I The significant P          increase in the proportion of MI oocytes Fig B in the         mcgml group relative to the other groups and the        significant P   decrease of oocytes exhibiting        premature centromere separation PCS Fig C in the         mcgml group relative to the controls suggest that        proteasomal inhibition retarded the rate of OM An inverse        relationship has been shown to exist between the        proportions of arrested MI oocytes and MII oocytes        exhibiting PCS     The significant P   dose        responses of higher frequencies of MII oocytes with single        chromatids Figs CE and of hyperploidy Figs DE        suggest that the MGinduced transient inhibition of        proteasomal and calpain activities during meiosis I        predisposed oocytes to abnormal chromosome segregation        When oocytes were continuously exposed to            or  gml MG from one h after initiating the        culture until  h later the proportions of MI arrested        oocytes were                and   respectively Of the MI        oocytes in the  and  gml MG groups          and  exhibited diffuse chromatin Fig F        whereas those oocytes continuously exposed to   or         gmlMG did not display diffuse chromatin        Additionally the proportions of MI oocytes displaying        homologue separation Figs GH in oocytes transiently        exposed to MG for  h were                respectively for    and         gmlMG Oocytes with premature anaphase        polyploidy or structural chromosome aberrations were not        found                    Discussion        Proteasome activity is required for germinal vesicle        breakdown GVBD in starfish and toad oocytes     and        for activating Xenopus oocytes      Also        proteasomes are needed for regulating centrosome        segregation      kinetochore structure     and        sister chromatid cohesion and separation     When rat        oocytes were exposed to the proteasome inhibitor MG        proteasomes translocated to the meiotic spindle MPF        activity was sustained and oocytes were arrested in MI        with partially segregated chromosomes            Besides inhibiting proteasome activity the peptide        aldehyde proteasome inhibitors have been also reported to        repress certain lysosomal cysteine proteases and calpains            The finding that MG can obstruct the casein        degrading activity of the calciumdependent protease        calpain    appears relevant to oocyte maturation        Calpain activity is needed for proteolysis of the cmos        protooncogene product pp mos in Xenopus oocytes            certain cytoskeletal proteins alphatubulin actin        dynamin lamin B in starfish oocytes     and of        cyclin in Xenopus egg extracts            We report that exposure of mouse oocytes to  mcgml        MG during meiosis I led to significant P          increases in the proportions of MI arrested oocytes and of        MII oocytes with SC and hyperploidy Coupled with these        findings was a significant P   decrease in the        incidence of MII oocytes exhibiting PCS Table  Chemical        induction of MI arrest in mammalian oocytes and        spermatocytes indicates cell cycle retardation which is        often associated with aneuploidy      Although         mcgml MG increased the frequency of MI arrested        oocytes this cellcycle retardation may not be entirely        attributed to proteasome inhibition MG can also        inhibit calpains    which are needed for cell cycle        progression    and cyclin degradation     Previous        studies     have shown that an inverse relationship        usually exists between the proportions of arrested MI        oocytes and MII oocytes exhibiting PCS Oocytes residing in        MII for longer periods of time tend to display higher        frequencies of PCS whereas those deferred in MI spend        less time in MII prior to fixation The significant P          increase in the proportions of MII oocytes exhibiting        PCS in controls relative to the  gml group reflects        the greater length of time that control oocytes spent in        MII prior to fixation We suggest that the PCS detected in        MII oocytes mainly resulted from in vitro aging As such        the frequencies of PCS noted in Table would represent        independent events relative to the other cytogenetic        abnormalities reported        On the other hand PCS during meiosis I can result in        aneuploid MII oocytes PCS of homologous chromosomes and        sister chromatids prior to establishing proper        kinetochorespindle attachment during meiosis I increases        the probabilities of both homologues going to the same pole        and of equational division of sister chromatids during        anaphase I Upon normal fertilization MII oocytes with an        additional chromosome result in trisomic zygotes whereas        oocytes containing an extra chromatid would be expected to        produce  trisomic zygotes due to random segregation        during anaphase II This situation also applies to oocytes        missing chromosomes and chromatids Experimental data        support PCS as a prelude to aneuploidy PCS of homologues        during meiosis I and equational division of sister        chromatids during anaphase I     and premature        separation of chromatids during meiosis II     and        mitosis     have been shown to increase the incidence        of aneuploidy in subsequent divisions The partially        segregated chromosomes found in rat oocytes exposed to        MG may have represented homologous chromosomes andor        sister chromatids            The origin of single unpaired chromatids in MII oocytes        has been proposed to result from premature separation of        sister chromatids prior to anaphase I      The        possibility exists that both SC and aneuploidy may have        originated from PCS of homologues and sister chromatids        during the MAT of meiosis I Upon removal of MG from        the culture media during meiosis I and the subsequent        resumption of OM and proteasomal activity faulty        kinetochoremicrotubule attachment accompanied by        degradation of cohesion proteins could conceivably lead to        PCS of homologues and sister chromatids Following anaphase        I a probability exists that both homologues and sister        chromatids could randomly assort to the same pole and        result in SC and aneuploid MII oocytes        Although the frequency of homologue separation increased        with MG dose the sample size of  oocytes is much too        low to comment about their possible origin or their        influence on other abnormalities detected in MII oocytes        The possibility exists that the observed homologue        separation may actually reflect anaphase onset The finding        of diffuse chromatin in MI oocytes continuously exposed to         and  gmlMG may be related to the sustained        elevation of MPF activity noted in rat oocytes exposed to        MG    and the stabilization of polyubiquitinated        proteins and enhanced deubiquitination of nucleosomal        histones in chromatin following proteasomal inhibition                               Conclusions        The findings of the present study indicate that        transient in vitro exposure of mouse oocytes to MG is        associated with abnormal chromosome segregation However        additional data are clearly needed to further investigate        the roles of calpain proteolysis and proteasomemediated        proteolysis on chromosome segregation as well as the        numerous other potential molecular mechanisms of        aneuploidy                    Methods                  Animals          Female ICR Harlan SpragueDawley Indianapolis IN          mice between  g  wks of age were used in

was prepared in Waymouth medium          containing  L per ml dimethylsulfoxide DMSO as the          solvent          MG is a peptide aldehyde that inhibits          ubiquitinmediated proteolysis by binding to and          inactivating S and S proteasomes      Although           M MG inhibited first polar body extrusion in          rat oocytes its activity is reversible     We          conducted preliminary experiments to obtain a MG dose          range that would transiently perturb or inhibit OM during          meiosis I while enabling oocytes to complete OM following          washing out of the compound Data from oocytes cultured          in either     or  gml MG from          one h after initiating the culture until  h later          showed that the two higher doses completely blocked          oocytes in MI On the other hand when oocytes were          exposed to these same MG doses from one h after          initiating the culture until  h later when the chemical          was washed out X and cultured for an additional  h          in media without MG oocytes exposed to  and           gml MG were still arrested in MI Thus data from          these preliminary experiments enabled the selection of a          protocol in which oocytes were placed into complete          culture media and incubated for  h prior to adding          either  solvent only   or  gml MG          Six h later the MG was washed out of the media by          rinsing the oocytes four times in complete media without          MG and then reincubated for  h Under this          protocol oocytes were exposed to MG during meiosis I          and the subsequent  h culture time provided sufficient          time for the oocytes to overcome the MGinduced          meiotic block and progress to MII Control oocytes were          cultured in  l DMSO per ml complete media and          processed in the same manner as those exposed to          MG                          Cytogenetic analysis and statistical analysis of          data          Oocytes were collected and processed according to a          massharvest procedure    and chromosomes were          Cbanded    to distinguish between complete dyads          MII chromosomes and disjoined dyads single          chromatids In each cell analyzed the number of          chromosomes andor chromatids was counted at            magnification to provide data for calculating aneuploidy          The number of hypoploid n    haploid n            hyperploid n     and polyploid n            MII oocytes were recorded An oocyte classified as            contains  dyads and one chromatid or onehalf          dyad The frequencies of each ploidy class were divided          by the total number of MII oocytes analyzed excluding          polyploidy The frequencies of MII oocytes displaying          premature centromere separation PCS single chromatids          SC premature anaphase PA were also calculated          relative to the total number of MII oocytes analyzed          Since MI and polyploid oocytes are distinct categories          and are disregarded when computing aneuploidy their          frequencies were calculated relative to the total number          of oocytes analyzed          The criteria for eliminating a cell from analysis          included inadequate Cbanding for discriminating between          intact dyads and those separated at the centromere          overlapped or clumped chromosomes or excessive          chromosome scatter that precluded an objective analysis          of numerical or structural aberrations The frequencies          of hyperploid cells were used as a measure of aneuploidy          because an unknown proportion of the hypoploid cells is          influenced by technical artifact resulting from excessive          chromosome scatter during slide preparation ChiSquare          analysis and the Fishers Exact Test were used for data          analyses                            Authors
