        not be a very good conversationalist on fishing i dont do a lot of it     well i do love to fish   well good maybe i can learn something   well i dont know how much you can learn  im not so sure im good at it but i do enjoy doing it yeah     do you well it is fun what little i do of course i dont you know i think when they refer to different kinds of fishing i told my husband last night when i called and they had told me that this was a topic       i said well i can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm  he said i dont think thats the different kinds of fishing theyre talking about   well i hope it is theres not a whole lot of different kinds   thats about the only kind i know how to do   i dont do a lot of deep sea fishing i because i get seasick but we have a lot of lakes here in this area   umhum uhhuh   and i do a lot of fishing for um bass we have a lot of uh uh couple of lakes in our area that are filled just filled with good sized bass   umhum   and then when i get tired of them outwitting me i fish for catfish   umhum   and we use worms worms and shiners which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows and then i also use spinner baits and plastic worms   umhum umhum   it all depends on what im fishing for and the time of day   well it sounds like you do quite a bit of it   i do uh theres a lake like maybe two or three miles from here and   umhum   its very convenient on afternoons when i wanna just get away and sit and think fishings a good way to do that and i have a lot of friends who like to go fishing   um do you have a boat   no i dont i have a friend who has a little inflatable inflatable raft and we use that sometimes   umhum umhum   i wish i had a boat but i dont   i think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas the ones around here are so big that you can fish off the dock   umhum   but unless you have a boat you cant really get into the where they call the good fishing holes you know   right thats the same way here isnt it you have to get back in the sticks in the   is it uhhuh my inlaws live on a lake uh a little bit east of Dallas kind of in the Piney Woods and the lake is beautiful and i like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish but       actually catching fish to eat per se you dont really do much of that right there i catch a lot of little old uh i think they call them perch   right   and then the the uh turtles try to eat up all my bait  so its its so close to the dock that i think all i do is feed them a little bit but its kind of fun   oh we we dont have we dont have a big problem with turtles but we do have a lot awful lot of snakes in our lakes   um   and i   i would be afraid of that   well i cant think of a time that ive been fishing that i havent run into one or two of them   do they ever get on your hook   no we uh occasionally ill catch an eel on an on a hook but   uhhuh   never the snakes they just kind of   are they poisonous snakes   uh we have a lot of cottonmouth and so yes they are definitely   uhhuh   and they live in the shallow little coves that i like to fish in so i see them swimming by every once in a while   um yeah i think id be a little bit afraid of those   yeah they can theyre theyre certainly ugly   umhum we uh saw a large snake right off the dock there at my inlaws place last year it was probably four inches in diameter or something something like that you know great big snake and it course it scared the women to death you know but the men come out and said oh well thats only a a king snake it wont really hurt you you know but it looked so bad and it was so big that it it might not would have hurt us but we sure felt like it was hurting us just being there you know but theyre scary looking   yeah definitely do you have bass   yes uh i think that uh probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else   right well thats pretty much the same way here i   umhum now they have a lot of bass tournaments   well we have those i dont do i inevitably if i enter one of those i never catch a thing i just go out there and sit and watch other people do it   umhum oh no umhum well thats kind of weve never entered a tournament or anything were not that big into fishing but i see a lot of people you know early in the morning therell be all the boats going out and theyll say well theres a big bass tournament this weekend and all those people are here for the tournament you know   and oh yes   so i think theres a lot of people that have you know really i guess that youd call it really sport fishing theyre really into it to try to win   yeah oh definitely   my   certainly here they are   but it is its very a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out in on the water and looking around the peace and calmness is really relaxing   yeah its a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and to fish   umhum now ive never tried taking a book with me ill have to try that one of these days   thats what i do a lot yeah
