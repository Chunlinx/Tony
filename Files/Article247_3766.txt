                                 Why Hasnt the US Gone Metric                        On Sept  the  million Mars Climate Orbiter was lost when it veeredoff course and burned up in the Martian atmosphere Last week NASA revealedthe cause One part of the orbiters navigation system was speaking in Englishunits and another in metric Why hasnt the US adopted the metric system            The metric system originated in France in the late  th centuryto combat rampant commercial fraud by farmers and shopkeepers who used thevaried systems of weights and measures to their advantage Scientists were alsodemanding a standardized system to facilitate international cooperation onresearch While old systems seemed arbitrary the new standardized system hadan apparent basis in nature The meter was defined as  of thedistance between the equator and either pole it has since been redefined interms of the speed of light It was also easier to remember than other systemsbecause it was based on the decimal system            France officially adopted the metric system in the early s and the restof the continent quickly followed in hopes that a standardized measurementsystem would spur international trade Over the next hundred years the metricsystem spread globally The British Commonwealth resisted abandoning theirtraditional measures but in the early sunder the slogan Metric times betterthey too metricated Some road signs and body weightshowever remain customary Today the US is one of only threecountriesalong with Myanmar and Liberiawhere the metric system is notcommonly used            Officially at least the US has gone metric The yard the poundand the gallonprototypes of which were once held in Londonare nowofficially defined by reference to metric units In  the federalgovernment adopted metric as the nations preferred measurement system andestablished the United States Metric Board to manage the transition Thechangeover was ineffective however and by the early s the only tangibleprogress was that liquor and wine had to be labeled in liters Metrication wasrevived in  when Congress required that all government agencies be metricby  to the extent feasible Today agencies with large international orscientific operationslike the Department of Defense and NASAare almostfully converted otherslike the Department of Educationhave done littleciting the rights of states to decide such matters Americas private sector issimilarly mixed Large corporations with overseas exports are at least partlyconverted but most small businesses still use the English system            American metric advocates encountered stiff opposition in the s and sLabor unions worried that workers would be unable to learn a new systemBusinesses protested that redesigning machines and products to metric standardswould be costly States objected to the expense of replacing road signs andrevising laws And average citizens argued that change was unnecessary and saidthe metric systemwith its multiples of  instead of the more intuitivehalves and quarters of English measureswas not compatible with humanexperience In contrast there was no natural constituency for the prometriccause            But similar obstacles were encounteredand overcomein other countriesSo some metric advocates attribute Americas nonconversion to nationalcharacter American individualism they say makes us more resistant togovernmentmandated change than other cultures For example MotherJones reported that the National Cowboy Hall of Fame sued to blockmetrication claiming the West was won by the inch foot yard and mileMetric supporters also see xenophobia in Americans distaste for a foreignsystem of measurement In the s some opponents suggested that metric roadsigns would facilitate a Russian invasion            Others ascribe American inaction to logistical obstacles It is a classicinstance of path dependency Once a course is chosen it is difficult to inducepeople to switch And until the s the US had little incentive to do sosince the economy was sufficiently dominant in its trade relationships toenforce English units on its partners This may soon change as the EuropeanUnion plans to ban products labeled in English units at the end of the yearAlso unlike other nations the United States metrication legislation has beenentirely voluntary so few organizations have transitioned The Department ofCommerces Metric Programwhich took up the cause when the Metric Board wasabolished in now focuses on outreach to the business community insteadof legislation The years marquee event Metric Week begins thisSundaythe th day of the th month             Mother Jones recounts the struggles of theleast powerful men in Washington  the staff of the Department ofCommerces Metric Program Also see the Web page of the US MetricAssociation for exhaustive information on metrication            Next question
