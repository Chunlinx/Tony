                i run uh usually a couple of times a week um because i im at im a student at Rice University and so i can just sort of run a loop around the campus which is about three miles   good   and um thats sort of i guess its probably the most common thing i do for exercise the other thing i do is um i try and play racquetball a couple of times a week with um a friend   umhum Bill do you feel safe running across the campus   uh yeah actually if i do it uh certainly at night i feel i mean sorry not at night i feel perfectly safe at night i usually do it with someone else   umhum well the area immediately north of you and immediately west of you is not a very good area   well lets see um north is sort of the meandrous area which is not uh its not too bad as far as crime goes i think i mean its not really great   yes   um south is the area thats really crime ridden thats sort of the south main area um   okay the south main yes okay i know what youre talking about   yeah so that thats not too great but the um i usually feel pretty safe around the campus itself uh the uh Rice has their own police department and theyre pretty aggressive about   umhum well youve got pretty good fencing around your parameter parameter   no actually we dont we dont have fences its just uh a tall hedge so   okay well   but uh yeah it does  yeah at least its a psychological barrier so   i know you have some separation because my uh son went to Saint Thomas for uh a year and and uh we drove over and looked at Rice with the reason we thought there might some possibilities of of changing but anyway uh i was very impressed with the campus   yeah its really its a pretty a beautiful campus especially considering its in the middle of the ugly city like Houston but uh   yeah uh my exercise program i used i did run        uh for several reasons i now do mostly walking uh one was that i had a knee injury i stepped in a in a crack or a whole twisted my knee and it was very painful   hm yeah   and the other is im getting older now so it makes more sense to walk than it does to run   yeah i can um one of the reasons i run uh probably the biggest reason either run or play racquetball i mean either of them is um because if i dont get exercise i dont i dont sleep well and i just dont feel as good i just feel kind of yucky   umhum well the emotional the emotional benefits of running are almost as good as the physical benefits i use it as stress relief   yeah yeah that too i mean uh the um but the reason why i noticed you were talking about walking i i dont if i walk id have to walk like ten miles i think to you know for it to really sort of get the same benefit as running if i run uh really hard     yeah    umhum thats true   and that that may just be that may just be me or you know whatever im sure im sure when i get older ill probably ill be more of a workout but   yeah    well i walk forty five i walk forty five to fifty minutes   thats pretty good yeah   which is uh between two and three miles at a at a fairly comfortable  uh   yeah   the last time i was doing an aggressive running program i was in graduate school about um oh its i guess its been ten years ago now but uh anyway i was doing i was running three miles a day five times a week and that   wow that that thats a fair amount thats more than i do by a considerable amount   well that was that was because i was in graduate school and i was doing about a sixty hour week   yeah   and i had to do all this to play it you know to get things under control   yeah yeah no i understand that i mean i i sometimes you know feel like uh well one reason another another reason why i run rather than do something like walk is uh it takes a long time   yes   because its sort of the same work out but but yeah i can  i sort of you know am able to you know sleep better and and be more uh more alert um when im you know when i am awake if i if i exercise regularly so it really its kind of like an investment that pays off   ive never tried the handball do you find that helps you a lot   well i mean its kind of its its you know its good exercise especially when you get good at it because you the idea is to make the other player run to where hes not i mean you hit the ball its kind of like tennis in that sense but youre not chasing always chasing after the ball um   umhum yes i yes   but uh the reason why i do like that a little bit better than running if i can find uh you know people to play with because its more its more interesting i mean theres you know like a game aspect to it as well as just sort of the exercise   umhum right and as long as you keep moving you have the aerobic effect and i im sure if you have a  half way good player you do keep running         yeah oh yeah yeah yeah and it took a little it took a little while to to get good i mean the first you know i dont know two or three weeks of playing uh you know to i didnt really get that great of work out but but it now i its pretty good   umhum i used to uh years ago play tennis but again uh as you get older tennis is pretty rough on the knees im sure handball would be also      yeah i can i can understand knee problems because ive found i havent had trouble with it this year but in past years when ive you know done only running and not racquetball um my   umhum
