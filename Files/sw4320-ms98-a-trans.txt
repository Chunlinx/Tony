                okay   so how serious is the subject of crime in your area     well needless to say here in Washington DC  this is the war zone uh DC around here stands for drug capital or death capital       its uh its really bad here uh for example  the uh local high school uh theyve already found two students with sawed off shotguns   jeez   and theyre starting to uh get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things so it   well luckily it hasnt gotten that bad here uh San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime     uhhuh uhhuh   uh but its on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns   uhhuh   uh because you end up having a lot of gangs forming uh largely around the Hispanic core   uhhuh   uh it seems to be that uh gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of  poverty conditions   uhhuh right thats how they uh they bind themselves together in groups i guess and uh  now the interestingly enough i dont think we have here a a lot of gangs but uh   yeah   only a couple uh of not a whole large group of them but uh just a few most of them centered around uh drug territory   uhhuh uhhuh   and so theyre protecting their  economic interests i guess and uh now nowadays the latest thing ive ive read about in the paper here that theyre doing as far as   yeah   uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away  and leave you standing in front of your house   oh well thats efficient   yeah thats the uh latest thing that way theres no damage to the car or anything they just wait for you to show up after theyve picked out which one they want   theyre decided theyre completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort   uhhuh right  just wait for you to drive to your house you get out and they get in off they go with your car     wow   so its uh i think they call it car jacking around here   yeah yeah id heard that phrase   uhhuh yeah thats kind of the latest thing but  oh every year in the DC area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides so its uh its unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because were not from around here were from uh im from Ohio and my wifes from Florida so   uhhuh   and weve just come from twenty years in the military and uh which is an entirely different environment so this is a whole new thing for  for us to to have to put up with and its uh really scary sometimes   yeah there arent that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays     right and its pretty bad when theyre using metal detectors in school and uh of course the mayor uh of DC is having a real problem uh   uhhuh   trying to what do you do to to reduce crime in a in a major city like DC where its a way of life for everybody its uh i would hate to have to wrestle with that problem i dont know what what the solution is uh theres no way they can stop the drugs and thats whats causing all the killing   well uh  theres a couple of things that ive heard uh most of them are fairly uh radical in terms of what youd have to do uh   uhhuh uhhuh   course the  the reason that that these kids tend to to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems seems to be just you know the the the end results of of poverty and and parents that arent doing any parenting and everything else because i mean you know the parents arent making a living at anything   uhhuh right and they see all their friends and neighbors uh   uh and theyre accidental parents half the time anyway   yeah and their friends are driving Mercedes and so its actually they grow up with that as their way of life and uh i think uh to a large extent they dont understand the concept that what theyre doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised   its illegal but its not wrong because all their friends do it   right  exactly so maybe its the law that wrong in their eyes and they they say well its   yeah   its the law thats uh got to be changed instead of their way of life so i dont know its im glad its not the kind of problem i have to   come up with an answer to because its not easy   well i think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of of an actual solution to the problem um   uhhuh   the the social the other social problems wouldnt wouldnt go away   right theyve always been with us   uh i mean theres theres been a lot of and i used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus but then the more i thought about it the more sense it made is that uh alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else   uhhuh uhhuh   uh and prohibition didnt stop it and didnt do anything really to slow   right
