        so ive been concerned about crime lately um its really scary to listen to the news every night and  to hear about all the problems i wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood     umhum umhum well i i think we have a neighborhood watch i think im not real we dont get real involved were never home so  um   uhhuh   uhhuh     uh well i know they were gonna start one but uh i havent heard any more since so i dont really know but as far as personally doing something no   no hm   how about you   well  we moved in when we moved in there there wasnt any outside lights and so weve been trying to install some   uhhuh   um outside lights and  we put up a fence in the backyard mostly you know not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in but that our children would be safe playing in the yard you know   uhhuh yeah yeah huh   and i guess most of the crime that im concerned about generally is against my my kids its scary to send them off down the street a few houses   oh im sure it is   to let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything and   umhum umhum umhum   so i have to spend a good deal of time watching them  walk down the street and say call me before you leave and come back and     uh i would too if i had kids we dont have any  we did install a um  a uh motion detector light back in our driveway   umhum   and that was  mainly it was so when we pulled up the light would come on but also we have a boat back there  and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief so we thought with that light you know it would   umhum oh no   maybe keep them from doing something to the boat  yeah so   then thats a good thought well weve been real lucky that i dont believe theres been you know much trouble in our neighborhood but it but it does seem there that there is a lot more here in Plano of um just   uhhuh   bored teenagers  vandalism   yeah yeah thats what it is we live in Coppell and and thats pretty much what it is is you know   umhum   kids that are bored like you say   but yeah and they dont uh i know my sisterinlaw who lives in our neighborhood theyve had their theyve parked their car out on the street before and its been spray painted and   uhhuh oh no   a few things like that and course you know  i dont know  im getting scared for the kids to get older because you dont know if its someone their teenagers know  who and or is it just random   uhhuh uhhuh   crime but um weve been real lucky that no one in my family with the anywhere that they live has had been a victim of you know a serious crime   yeah yeah   but uh its really scary to know that you you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesnt mean youll be safe and   uhhuh uhhuh i know it hm   but i guess i take a lot of  um little bit of um   safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are like drug related or  um things that places usually that i wouldnt be going  and things i usually wouldnt be involved in   umhum umhum umhum yeah yeah huh   and uh theres not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to but it is scary   yeah yeah it is it really is   were you raised in this area   yeah im originally from Chicago but ive been in this area in the Louisville area for  uh lets see about twenty three years   hm umhum       so has it been getting worse that youve noticed or about the same hm   oh definitely  in the last few years i think and uh like i say now i dont think necessarily in this area here but   umhum   just Dallas in general i dont know i think back of when i was uh younger and in my party days some of those things i did you know i wouldnt be caught dead like being out that late at night  in a dark parking lot  so   right right take a lot of chances well i noticed that um that uh when we we moved here from Houston not too long ago and so of course we were interested in schools and um   uhhuh uhhuh umhum   but the schools in Houston all have big tall fences around them and theyre not really very safe   uhhuh   and so its been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools dont have fences at all  around them and  its just a whole different idea that that at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school     uhhuh   and in Houston that there was the mentality that they werent safe at school   huh   and so thats been something thats been good for the  you know in this area that you feel like um you know theres not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today  and i guess i dont know how people live with that everyday   umhum umhum um i dont either   pretty scary   yeah hm   but anyway well i guess i wont take up more of your time   hm
