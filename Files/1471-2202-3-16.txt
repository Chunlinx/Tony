                    Background        Transection of the peripheral axons of primary sensory        neurons results in profound alterations in their        metabolism regenerative capacity survival excitability        transmitter function and sensitivity to diverse extrinsic        and intrinsic signals      These changes are        contributed to by transcriptional alterations triggered by        a loss of trophic support from peripheral target organs        and by novel signals generated at the injury site The        transcriptional changes lead both to adaptive responses        such as the capacity to survive the injury and regrow the        injured axon and maladaptive responses that can lead to a        change in sensation including the generation of        neuropathic pain             Measurements of mRNA and protein made in many        laboratories using diverse methodologies have identified        approximately  genes that are upregulated and         downregulated after peripheral nerve injury              These regulated genes include members of several classes G        protein coupled receptors ligand and voltagegated ion        channels receptor tyrosine kinases growth factors        cytokines neuropeptides cell cytoskeletal genes cell        surfaceextracellular matrix genes and a miscellaneous        group of enzymes        We have now used highdensity rat genome oligonucleotide        microarrays to analyze changes in gene expression at an        early time point  days following a peripheral nerve        injury in adult rats Oligonucleotide microarrays provide        the capacity to analyze parallel changes in many thousands        of genes and have been used successfully to examine        expression profile changes in many neuronal and        nonneuronal systems    including DRG neurons             Studying the effect of peripheral nerve injury on gene        expression profiles in the DRG offers several advantages        The DRG represents a dense collection of cell bodies of one        general class of neuron the primary sensory neuron The        lesion has a uniform impact on the cells and the existence        of a large pool of genes with known regulation allows for        quality controls for changes identified by the microarrays                     Although microarrray technology offers enormous        potential advantages there remain important concerns about        representation sensitivity reproducibility variability        and the false positive and negative detection rates             What if any is the threshold folddifference between        probe sets that reflects real regulation Is        folddifference the most sensitive measure for detecting        changes Are genes with a low expression levels in all        conditions detected What is the concordance rate between        genes identified as regulated by independent methods and        genes identified by the microarray analysis What criteria        need to be used to jointly minimize the false negative and        the false positive rates How many arrays need to be        analyzed        We now show that folddifference alone results in a high        degree of error whilst detecting regulated genes from        microarrays replicate arrays with statistical analysis        reduces false positives and negatives The oligonucleotide        microarray screen indicates that hundreds of genes are        regulated by neuronal injury and that this technique is a        powerful primary screen for such changes                    Results                  Array sensitivity and variability          Affymetrix rat UA oligonucleotide arrays were used          to screen for changes in gene expression in DRG neurons          three days following a peripheral nerve transection          axotomy Ax by comparing expression levels with          noninjured DRGs nave N Nine biologically          independent array hybridizations were performed six          nave and three axotomy DRG tissue L and L from the          left or ipsilateral side to the injury from  male          SpragueDawley rats were pooled for each RNA population          Each RNA sample was labeled separately and hybridized to          a separate array Genes were defined as detected if they          received a present or marginal call in at least one of          the arrays within each comparison Of the  annotated          genes and expressed sequence tags ESTs represented on          the rat UA array  n  nave arrays were          detected in arrays hybridized with nave rat DRG cRNA and           n   axotomy arrays genes in the axotomy          comparisons          To assess the degree of variability inherent in the          system the mean probe set intensity values of the two          independent sets of three nave samples were compared on          a scatter plot Figure A The majority of probe sets          from the two control groups N vs N lie on or very          close to the identity line with a linear regression of r            for all detected genes in the N vs N          comparison Figure A Figure Ashows that most of the          variation between the two nave groups exists at the          lower end of the gene expression levels This suggests          that this variability is in part due to array          sensitivity In consequence differences in low intensity          genes may be unreliable          A plot of the mean intensity from triplicate naives          against triplicate  day axotomy N vs Ax arrays          Figure B show many data points lying both above and          below the identity line suggesting regulation Since          each individual sample was pooled from  male          SpragueDawley animals of a similar age and from a single          supplier Charles River biological variation is likely          to be minimal                          Defining regulated genes          Many of the detected genes in both the N vs N and the          N vs Ax array comparison groups show no difference          defined as folddifference up or down less than            N vs N and  N vs Ax Figure E Further          many show small folddifferences of  to   N          vs N and  N vs Ax Figure E In total genes          displaying a folddifference below fold accounted for           of the N vs N arrays and  of the N vs Ax          comparison          When statistical significance is not taken into          account  genes display a difference of  fold          and  a greater than fold difference in the N vs N          group  and  of present genes respectively In          the N vs Ax group  genes show a folddifference of           and  greater than fold  and  of          present genes respectively Although a greater than          fold change cut off eliminates most false positives          estimated error rate  this specificity is at the          expense of many putatively regulated genes In the           fold range in the N vs Ax group there are still          three times as many genes as are in the N vs N group           genes N vs Ax vs  genes N vs N Figure          E          In order to distinguish systematic from random          differences in the array intensity levels a twotailed          ttest was performed for both comparison groups which          was possible since each group consisted of three          independent experiments One of the fundamental problems          in analyzing microarray data is the risk of false          positive results due to multiple hypothesis testing The          most conservative approach to this problem a          Bonferronicorrected significance threshold would not          result in any significantly regulated genes as the          adjusted threshold would be     while the          lowest P value attained in our data set for the N vs Ax          comparison was     This would also rule out          identification of genes via stepdown methods based on          the Bonferroni correction Therefore we attempted to          assess the accumulation of false positives empirically          by testing multiple hypotheses in our system on a sample          not expected to include any true positives ie the N          vs N comparison Those probe sets with a unadjusted          significance of P   blue P   green          or P   red are indicated on the scatter plots          in Figures Cand D while the distribution of          significant differences at different foldchanges is          illustrated in the table in Figure E Of the           detected genes in the nave samples  show a          significant difference between the two sets  P            The vast majority of these genes however exhibit          low fold changes fold  Figure E          Of the  genes that show a folddifference of           and the  that were above fold in the N vs          Ax comparison   and   respectively were          not significant Figure E P   These data          indicate that using a folddifference of greater than           from triplicate samples to select regulated genes will          include many false positives However combining fold          difference with significant difference in a two          dimensional matrix can reduce the false positive error          rate drastically The combination of a fold and          significant difference P   identifies  genes          in the N vs N comparison compared with  genes for N          vs Ax a fold difference Figure E The estimated          error of  using these two criteria is much less than          that obtained using just above fold  or          significance alone  and prevents many genes          regulated below fold being excluded from consideration          of regulation          The inherent array error rate determined by the          significant difference rate in the N vs N analysis is          clustered at low fold changes Figure E However many          more genes achieve statistical significance at these          small fold changes in the N vs Ax comparison than in the          N vs N group  fold  N vs Ax and  N          vs N Figure E indicating that some low fold          differences may be real The degree of significance P              helps distinguish erroneous          changes at these low fold levels Figure E                          Comparison of array data with the literature          Table  see additional file  lists those genes          previously shown to be regulated in various sciatic nerve          injury models using a variety techniques as well

  additional file   are not detected by the arrays          indicating that array sensitivity is an issue Amongst          these are particular functional classes ie such as G          protein coupled receptors which are expressed at low          levels              Additional File           Comparison of microarray and known regulation data for          genes whose expression pattern within the DRG following          nerve injury has been studied previously          Click here for file           of the  detected genes matched the criteria          fold P   for defining regulated genes          across the N vs Ax comparison and all of these were          concordant with the changes reported in the literature          Table  see additional file  In addition  of the           detected genes whose levels had previously been described          as unchanged by axotomy also did not vary on the arrays          Mismatches between changes expected from the literature          and the arrays may be due to a failure of small          differences to achieve statistical significance when          using a triplicate analysis Furthermore differences in          the timing the nature of the injury models used and          detection methods employed between this and earlier          studies make detailed analysis of these data unfeasible          In order to detect true false positive and negative rates          a direct comparison needs to be made between the array          data set and transcript levels measured in samples          equivalent to those used for array hybridization                          Northern blotting validation of transcriptional          regulation          Twenty four genes detected by the arrays as being          present in the DRG and displaying up down or no          regulation three days after sciatic nerve axotomy were          analyzed by replicate quantitative slot blot Figure           and Northern blot analysis Figure  The genes were          chosen in a nonrandom fashion to encompass the range of          hybridization intensities seen on the arrays with          expression levels less than  to intensity levels          greater than  Genes were also chosen which          displayed a wide range of foldchanges and varying p          values and possible functions were taken into account          Table           Figure illustrates representative triplicate slot          blots for three genes with altered expression  showing          an increase after axotomy Figure Aand B and one a          decrease Figure C Cyclophilin a gene known not to          alter following axotomy     was used to correct for          loading Figure D Each blot was prepared from          independent L and L DRG RNA samples extracted from          different groups of animals than those used for the          arrays          Triplicate slot blots were produced for all  genes          present in Table  The concordance rate between the          microarray and slot blot fold changes for the  genes          was  overall but concordance depended on gene          expression level Table  Genes expressed at low levels          in the arrays tended to display fold changes that varied          from that found by the slot blots It is likely that this          is a consequence of the unreliable average intensity          estimation for low level genes due to limited array          sensitivity Figure A If genes with a mean intensity          expression level of less than  are removed from the          analysis top five rows Table  and the array fold          changes of the remaining  genes are plotted against the          slot blot fold changes a very strong correlation is          evident linear regression r   Figure E The          concordance rate of this group is  using          fold P   to predict regulation This          shows that within the bounds of array sensitivity          average fold changes for genes found to differ          significantly between triplicate control and experimental          arrays represent a reasonable estimate of the relative          changes in gene expression          Northern blot analysis although requiring more          tissue both confirms that the correct transcript size is          recognized by the probe and enables splice variants to be          identified Figure  All  genes in

ganglia as well as containing the cell          bodies of primary sensory neurons also contain satellite          glial cells Schwann cells and immune cells and it is          important therefore to determine which of these cell          types express the regulated genes Here we use isotopic           in situ hybridization ISH to          determine the cellular localization of  transcripts          Figure  All genes selected are neuronal GTPcylo          IESJE CCHLA and VGF all show a marked increase in the          number of labeled neurons while SNAP and the HT          receptor show a

These genes show diverse patterns of regulation While          lysozyme PACAP MET are all upregulated for MET          this is only transient Identical results were found by          in situ

                     Global changes in transcription          The  genes defined as putatively regulated          fold P   within the DRG  days after          sciatic nerve section represent  of the detected          genes and of these  are upregulated and           downregulated Figure A These genes were assigned          into functional classes and characterized as up and          downregulated Some gene classes are selectively          regulated after axotomy Figure B Genes associated          with the cell cytoskeleton positive and negative          regulators of apoptosis as well as immune markers tend to          be upregulated whereas genes involved in membrane          excitability ion channels or neurotransmission          neurotransmitters and vesicle trafficking genes tend to          be downregulated                            Discussion        Although many studies have used microarray technology        for expression profiling the criteria for determining        putatively regulated genes from such analyses remain poorly        defined the current standard being a fold difference        in replicate arrays Using Affymetrix highdensity rat        oligonucleotidearray data from control nave        noninjured and experimental axotomy  day post        peripheral nerve injury DRGs and comparing the        differences detected in control vs control and control vs        experimental arrays we have explored the optimal criteria        for minimizing the false positive error rate A fold        criterion alone was found to generate a substantial        proportion of potential false positives while also        excluding many putatively regulated genes Based on        significant difference for each probe set P           genes differed in the control vs control group and         in the control vs experimental group again a        prohibitively high false positive rate  However a        combination of fold and significant difference was found to        maximize the difference between control vs control and        control vs experimental array comparisons Using        fold and P    putatively regulated        genes were detected in the experimental group compared with        only  in the control group an estimated error rate of         If fold differences of  to  are included many        more significantly different genes are recruited  in        the experimental vs  in the control comparison reducing        the potential false negative rate At the same time the        estimated false positive error rate rises to   still        lower than the fold alone error Producing a reduction in        false positive without also producing false negative        differences requires the use both of fold and significant        difference The established fold criterion is much too        conservative when using replicate arrays with pooled        samples from multiple animals to reduce biological        variation it loses over  of putatively regulated genes        and fails to eliminate false positives The very high        concordance rate found between genes predicted from the        array analysis to be regulated and measurements of mRNA for         genes by quantitative Northern slot blots and         in situ hybridization validates        utilization of a two dimensional matrix of fold and        significant difference        One problem with oligonucleotide arrays is sensitivity        Some groups of transcripts particularly GPCRs including        the opiate receptors which are expressed in the DRG           fall below the microarray detection threshold Lack of        sensitivity may result from technical issues such as poor        probe performance    or low copy number transcripts        Tissue heterogeneity and neuronal subpopulationrestricted        gene expression may lower the concentration of a transcript        in the total RNA sample to below detection threshold                   Recently Xiao et al    published a study using  K        cDNA arrays to analyze genes regulated in the DRG           and  days following sciatic nerve axotomy Of the genes        listed in Table  seven were found in both studies        Peripheral Benzodiazepine receptor HT Gadd CLP        Lysozyme SNAP and VGF Of those genes whose expression        was analyzed across time in this study Figure  two        Lysozyme and SNAP were also detected by Xiao et al            Both genes show very similar expression patterns over        time in the two studies        In a different cDNA array study also recently        published  genes were identified to be regulated by at        least fold one week after sciatic axotomy     Of        these seven were also identified by our study Five of the        nonconcordant genes were not represented by known probe        sets on the array used here Others changed but did not        reach statistical significance and likely represented        differences in regulation levels relative to the time        points used  week as opposed to  days One gene        verified in this study the small prolinerich protein A        Table  was characterized in detail by Bonilla et al        who show that it colocalizes with filamentous actin in        membrane ruffles and augments axonal outgrowth            Comparison of the global lists of regulated genes        between this study and other reports are complicated by the        differing criteria used to identify regulated genes in the        different studies However it is encouraging to note that        a reasonable number of genes have been cross identified in        three separate array studies looking at the effects of        peripheral nerve injury on dorsal root ganglion gene        expression pointing to the reliability of array        technologies across differing platforms        Why is the number of genes regulated in sensory neurons        after peripheral nerve injury so large The injury        constitutes an enormous stress to the cell and also        deprives it from contact with its normal targetderived        neurotrophic support Both of these events represent        perturbations from normal cellular functioning that require        a variety of compensatory responses A major issue is cell        survival Injured adult DRG neurons do not die after axonal        injury    as a result of the upregulation of cell        survival factors such as the small heat shock protein HSP            We now find several genes that could have a        survivalpromoting role including the peripheral        benzodiazepine receptor whose agonists are potent        antiapoptotic compounds     GADDA which maintains        genomic stability and appears to be antiapoptotic in        neurons after ischemic damage     metallothionein L        which is a free radical scavenger     GTP        cyclohydrolase  which is obligatory for the actions of        NGF on PC cells     and IESJE MCP which        attracts macrophages which in turn have been reported to        have a role in neuronal survival            Neurons with axons in the peripheral nervous system can        successfully regenerate when injured     This is in        part due to an environment permissive for axonal growth but        also due to the upregulation of regenerationassociated        genes RAGs which increase intrinsic growth capacity            Three examples of RAGs are GAP and CAP    and        sprpA     We now find several other potential        candidates including  macroglobulin CLP and VGF all        of which have been described to promote neurite outgrowth        or interact with the cytoskeleton in a way that may promote        regeneration see Table  additional file  for        references MMP also known as  kD polypeptide transin        or stromelysin a secreted protease may facilitate        neurite growth by dissolving the extracellular matrix of        the basal lamina at the growing tip of the axon see Table         for references        Sensory neurons react to peripheral nerve injury by        increasing their excitability changing their constitutive        synaptic transmitter profile and even their synaptic        contacts in the spinal cord Interestingly an analysis of        the functional classes of the genes differentially        expressed Figure  reveals the contribution that        alterations in transcription make to these processes        Several of these changes are maladaptive in the sense that        they contribute to the generation of the abnormal        sensations that constitute neuropathic pain by producing        ectopic spontaneous activity into the CNS altering        synaptic drive increasing excitability and diminishing        inhibitory action in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord        and by making novel synaptic contacts with inappropriate        neurons      A number of the injuryregulated genes we        describe here may contribute directly to this altered        sensory processing CB receptor VGF the phospholemman        ion channel SNAP A endothelin and the ligandgated        HT receptor Table  see additional file  We have        only validated a small fraction of the putatively regulated        genes detected by the arrays Our analysis indicates that        at a conservative estimate over two hundred genes         genes fold P   are regulated by the        injury These include genes of a number of distinct        functional classes some of which appear to change in a        uniform way Ion channels and neurotransmitter related        genes tend to decrease their expression while those        associated with the cytoskeleton increase This raises the        possibility that numbers of different genes may be        regulated together by common changes in signal transduction        and transcription induced by the injury and contribute in        this way to the coordinated changes that constitute the        axotomy response        Discovering and validating regulated genes by array        analysis is clearly only the first step in elucidating        their functional role An evaluation of the cellular        localization and distribution of the gene product as well        as loss and gain of function manipulations         in vitro and         in vivo are required Functional        studies cannot yet be performed at a high throughput level        and this represents one of the major limiting factors in        analyzing the large numbers of candidate genes identified        by microarray analysis Elucidating the specific role of        genes regulated in sensory neurons after peripheral nerve        injury will provide insight though into many major        biological issues including cell survival growth        intercellular communication and the factors that contribute        to sensory abnormalities Microarray technology provides a        powerful tool for beginning this analysis in a high        throughput mode by revealing the extent of change in        neuronal gene expression Such analysis requires replicate        measures to minimize variability calculation of fold and        significant differences to detect regulated genes with        minimal false positive and negative confounders and        validation of individual genes                    Conclusions                 A comparison of two nave control        triplicate data sets allowed determination of the inherent        variation present in the oligonucleotide array data        Analysis revealed a relatively high false positive error        rate in the nave versus axotomy experimental comparisons         when using only a fold criterion for regulated gene        detection                 When statistical significance P          was combined with a fold difference of greater        than  as the criteria for detecting putatively regulated        genes not only was the estimated false positive error        substantially reduced to  but also many more genes        were identified compared with the established fold        criterion in the nave versus axotomy comparison  as        opposed to  genes                 All  genes displaying a fold        change of greater than  and a Pvalue of less than         are listed                 To validate these findings we        performed quantitative triplicate slot blots for  genes        enabling a direct comparison between the statistically        analyzed array data and the mRNA measurements These        comparisons show strong concordance between putative and        actual regulation as well as a direct relationship between        array fold change and mRNA fold change                 Some genes were further quantified        across a time course of    and  days post axotomy        These genes show diverse patterns of regulation in response        to nerve injury and underlie the importance of including        time as a dimension in any expression profile study                 Genes detected from the arrays as        being likely to be regulated were assigned to functional        groups These data suggest the reorganization of cell        structural components following peripheral nerve injury        activation of genes expressed by immune and inflammatory        cells and a downregulation of genes involved in        neurotransmission                    Methods                  Surgical procedures          All procedures were performed in accordance with

       The cRNA was hybridized for  hours to an array          followed by binding with a streptavidinconjugated          fluorescent marker and then incubated with a polyclonal          antistreptavidin antibody coupled to phycoerythrin as an          amplification step Following washing the chips were          scanned with a HewlettPackard GeneArray laser scanner          and data analyzed using GeneChip software External          standards were included to control for hybridization          efficiency and sensitivity          Hybridization levels for each species of mRNA

array data standard Affymetrix protocols          were employed each array was scaled to a target signal          of  across all probe sets MAS           The arrays were grouped for two comparisons two          triplicate sets of nave data compared with one another          and one triplicate nave set compared with one triplicate          postaxotomy set The individual nave arrays included in          each triplicate set were picked randomly A probe set was          determined undetected if it received an A call in all of          the six arrays involved in the comparison Detected were          Present or Marginal by MAS in at least one array for          each analysis Mean signal and standard deviation were          calculated for each detected probe set The pvalue for          rejecting the null hypothesis that the mean signals were          equal between the two triplicate sets was calculated          using an unpaired twotailed ttest for independent          samples with unequal
