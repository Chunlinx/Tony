                    Introduction        As initially described by Poiseuilles law resistance        to flow is that resistance provided by a vessel or        circulatory bed which permits a given pressure differential        to produce a unit flow Transcribed to human hemodynamics        systemic vascular resistance SVR can be measured from the        differential pressure between the mean arterial pressure        MAP and the central venous pressure CVP divided by the        flow ie cardiac output CO Although many clinical        conditions can cause a low SVR septic shock remains the        most common cause and usually results in a severe decrease        in SVR In more than  of patients with septic shock who        are aggressively volume loaded the CO is initially normal        or elevated Therefore hypotension results from reduced        vascular resistance with normal or elevated CO This form        of shock results from maldistribution of blood flow to        tissues usually from acute vasodilatation without        concomitant expansion of the intravascular volume While        distributive shock can also be caused by anaphylaxis drug        ingestion neurogenic injury and adrenal insufficiency        these conditions are seen with less frequency in the        intensive care unit Therefore a hemodynamic state with        low SVR is often considered synonymous of sepsis and other        conditions associated with a low SVR may not be        considered        There are minimal data in the medical literature        assessing the frequency or outcome of patients with        distributive shock that is unrelated to sepsis or the        sepsis syndrome Since we could find no prior studies in        the literature assessing the etiology and outcome of        hypotensive patients with a low SVR we reviewed our        experience with patients undergoing hemodynamic monitoring        in the medical intensive care unit of a large university        hospital The purpose of this study was to determine the        different causes of low SVR identify prognostic factors        and analyze the mortality of these various groups of        patients                    Methods        After approval by the Institutional Review Board of the        University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio        medical records of all patients admitted to the medical        intensive care unit of the University Hospital between         were reviewed All the charts of patients        undergoing pulmonary artery catheterization were        identified Patients with a recorded SVR less than         dynes scm were analyzed The main indication for        pulmonary artery catheterization in patients in this study        was unexplained hypotension after volume challenge Any        patient with an unclear etiology for hypotension or any        patient requiring more than   gkgmin dopamine        underwent pulmonary artery catheterization and was reviewed        for this study Anxiolytics sedatives and neuromuscular        blocking agents are administered by protocol and have        minimal or no direct effects on hemodynamics or histamine        release Cultures of blood and urine were obtained on all        patients cultures of sputum pleural fluid ascitic fluid        and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained as clinically        indicated Toxicological screening of blood and urine for        drugs was performed on admission if the etiology of        hypotension was in question Serum cortisol level        determination was performed on all patients receiving        exogenous corticosteroids or in patients with known risk        factors for adrenal insufficiency Hematologic and blood        chemistry determinations arterial blood gases routine        urinalysis and serial electrocardiograms were obtained on        all patients        Mean systemic right atrial and pulmonary artery        pressures and thermodilution cardiac outputs were measured        every  h in all patients Derived hemodynamic variables        were calculated as follows cardiac index CI lminm          CObody surface area SVR dynes  scm  MAPCO        and systemic vascular resistance index SVRISVRbody        surface area Patients received vasopressors to maintain        MAP above  mmHg The set of hemodynamic data with the        lowest SVR was selected for each patient        All historical clinical laboratory microbiologic and        hemodynamic data were studied Patients were divided into        four groups based on the following parameters  positive        blood culture  temperature  C or  C         white blood counts WBCs  mm or  mm  and         obvious source of infection Group  definite sepsis        had positive blood cultures and two or more criteria Group         probable sepsis had an obvious source of infection and        two or more additional criteria Group  possible sepsis        had fever and leukocytosis or leukopenia with no obvious        source of infection nor positive blood culture and Group         nonseptic had none of the criteria        The clinical course laboratory findings hemodynamics        and intensive care unit mortality were compared between the        various groups Data are expressed as mean  standard        deviation Clinical and hemodynamic variables were compared        with a students         t test and by analysis of variance        to assess statistical significance between groups Logistic        regression analysis was performed comparing SVR and death        using a univariant analysis        Mortality was assessed by MannWhitney rank sum test A         P value of   was considered        statistically significant                    Results        Fiftyfive patients were included in the study Table         Group  contained  patients with definite sepsis        Group  contained four patients with probable sepsis Group         contained  patients with possible sepsis and Group         contained  patients who had no evidence of sepsis The        mean age of the patients was   years Thirtyfour        patients were men and  patients were women The overall        MAP was    mmHg at the moment the hemodynamic values        were chosen The overall mean CO was   lmin and        the mean CI was   lminm  The overall mean SVR        was    dynes  scm  the mean SVRI was           dynes  scm  Analysis of SVRI was reviewed for each        subgroup and not found to be different from the analysis of        SVR therefore only data for SVR are presented        There were no statistically significant differences in        age sex or admission temperature among the different        groups Twentytwo patients Groups  and  met the        criteria for the sepsis syndrome   The mean SVR was           dynes  scm  CO was   lmin and CI was          lminm for this group The overall mortality        in those patients classified as having the sepsis syndrome        was  In patients with the sepsis syndrome the lung was        the primary site of infection in  out of  patients        Thirteen patients were considered nonseptic Group  This        group had no source of infection alteration in        temperature leukocytosis or leukopenia The mean        hemodynamic values for this group were SVR            dynes  scm  CO    lmin and CI           lminm  The mortality was  There were no        statistically significant differences in any hemodynamic        values nor in mortality between the nonseptic group Group         and the groups with sepsis syndrome Groups  and         The nonseptic group included eight patients with        intraabdominal disease five with decompensated cirrhosis        three with acute pancreatitis one patient with adrenal        insufficiency and four patients with unclear etiologies        for hypotension and low SVR idiopathic The mortality in        patients with decompensated intraabdominal disease was         six out of eight Additionally no statistically        significant difference in any of the hemodynamic values or        mortality was identified between the four groups when        analyzed individually Table         Twentyseven patients met the criteria for the extreme        hyperdynamic state EHS In the literature   EHS is        defined as an SVR below  dynes  scm and a CO above        lminm  The mean hemodynamic values for patients in        this study with EHS were SVR    dynes  scm  CO           lmin and CI     lminm  Seven        of these patients had a diagnosis of underlying cirrhosis        Twelve of the patients within this group were diagnosed        with sepsis syndrome  with possible sepsis and five        were nonseptic This group had a statistically significant        higher mortality  versus  than those patient        without the EHS          P   A univariant logistic        regression was performed analyzing the level of reduction        of SVR and mortality A statistically significant        relationship was found between these variables          P   For every reduction in        SVR of dynes  scm  there was a  increase in        mortality odds ratio   range                      Discussion        Sepsis and sepsis syndrome were the most common        etiologies of a low SVR in this study Although many        studies have found urinary or intraabdominal sepsis to be        the most common cause of low SVR   the lung was the        primary site of infection in over half of our patients        Septic shock the leading cause of intensive care unit        mortality is caused by systemic activation of the        inflammatory cascade Numerous mediators including        cytokines kinins complement coagulation factors and        eicosanoids are activated or systematically released        resulting in profound disturbances of cardiovascular and        organ system function These mediators particularly tumor        necrosis factor TNF interleukin IL platelet        activating factor and prostaglandins are thought to        mediate the reduced peripheral vascular resistance seen in        septic shock            Parker         et al   studied serial        cardiovascular variables in humans with septic shock A low        SVR was seen in both survivors and nonsurvivors however        persistently low SVR beyond  h was a strong predictor of        mortality This study demonstrated that the majority of        patients  who die of septic shock have a persistently        low SVR while a smaller percentage die of low CO  or        of multiple organ failure  after hemodynamic        resolution of shock Although we did not evaluate serial        hemodynamic profiles in this study our data identify a        group of patients with EHS who demonstrate a SVR below         dynes  scm and a mean CO over lmin As with patients        in prior studies   this group demonstrated a        significantly higher mortality Although the mechanisms        relating to the difference in mortality are unknown it has        been suggested that patients with complicated shock        defined as multiorgan failure have greater distortions of        cardiorespiratory patterns relative to the degree of        hypotension and that this is associated with a higher        mortality           Our study demonstrates that patients with sepsis        syndrome are the most common group of patients presenting        with hypotension and a low SVR in the medical intensive        care unit This group only represents approximately  of        patients in our study While many of the remaining patients        had some evidence supporting the diagnosis of sepsis eg        fever leukocytosis they lacked an identifiable source of        infection and the exact etiology of their hypotension        remains unknown More significantly almost onequarter of        the patients  in this study developed hypotension and        a low SVR without any evidence of sepsis This group had a        high mortality  similar to the remaining patients         There were no significant differences in the        clinical or hemodynamic parameters between the nonseptic        patients and the patients in the remaining groups The        frequency of nonseptic causes of a low SVR suggest that        clinicians must be aware of conditions other than sepsis        that have either been well documented Table  or reported        to induce a reduction in the SVR Table         The largest group of nonseptic patients in this study        with hypotension and a low SVR was found to be patients        with decompensated cirrhosis Although occult infections        should not be excluded none of these patients had fever        leukocytosis an identifiable site of infection or        abnormalities in the peritoneal fluid Patients with liver        cirrhosis often present with systemic hemodynamic        disturbances including hypotension low SVR and a reduced        sensitivity to vasoconstrictors   The precise        mechanisms of these hemodynamic disorders have not yet been        clearly elucidated Excessive production of vasodilators        peripheral shunts and increased levels of nitric oxide in        these patients may contribute to the hyperdynamic state        observed in this population                A recent study by Matsumoto   demonstrated that        patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis had higher        levels of exhaled nitric oxide than patients with        compensated cirrhosis chronic liver disease or controls        The decompensated cirrhotics had a significantly higher CO        and a lower SVR than the compensated patients        Additionally a positive correlation was found between the        level of nitric oxide and CI Five of our patients with a        low SVR had decompensated liver disease as the presumed        etiology of their hypotension Another five patients in the        possible sepsis group had hypotension with a clinical        diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis however        the lack of positive cultures or any other evidence of        infection suggest that decompensated liver disease may        have played a significant role in their hypotension        Pancreatitis was found to be the second most common        cause of low SVR in patients without evidence of infection        Three patients had necrotizing pancreatitis with one of        these having evidence of hemorrhage into the pancreas        Hemodynamic manifestations of pancreatitis include a        normodynamic or hypodynamic state usually present in acute        interstitial pancreatitis and commonly associated with        hypovolemia Pancreatitis can also present as a        hyperdynamic state with high CO and a low SVR as described        by Di Carlo         et al   and Bradley         et al   This hyperdynamic state        is another manifestation of the severity of acute        pancreatitis and is seen mostly in necrotizing pancreatitis        with or without hemorrhage   Severe pancreatitis may        mimic sepsis syndrome or septic shock despite the absence        of any infectious site The mechanisms responsible for        pancreatic shock have not been elucidated however an        inflammatory cascade generalized by cytokines and TNF is        felt to be the most likely cause of this process                   Adrenal insufficiency was found in one of our patients        with no evidence of infection Unfortunately cortisol        levels and adrenocorticotrophic hormone ACTH response was        not routinely measured in patients with infection and        adrenal insufficiency may have been underestimated in this        group Adrenal insufficiency may present as a hypodynamic        normodynamic or hyperdynamic state   The hypodynamic        state is usually seen early in adrenal insufficiency and is        associated with volume depletion from diarrhea vomiting        and decreased reabsorption of sodium in the distal tubule        CO may also be decreased in adrenal insufficiency as the        result of the myofibrillar adenosine triphosphate ATP        depletion seen with glucocorticoid deficiency          Intravenous fluid therapy most often increases CO and        decreases SVR in patients with adrenal crisis These        patients are usually separated from patients with sepsis by        a baseline cortisol level below  gdl or an inadequate        response to ACTH   One of our patients with septic        shock had baseline cortisol of  gdl and no response to        the cosyntropin stimulation test This patient could not be        weaned off high dose norepinephrine and dopamine until        intravenous corticosteroids were instituted Normal values        for basal and stimulated cortisol levels are derived from        the adrenal response of healthy individuals Patients        experiencing the severe stress of critical illness        demonstrate higher than normal amounts of circulating        cortisol Some patients with critical illness have minimal        or no ACTH stimulation above their baseline cortisol levels        and may be unable to respond to additional physiologic        stress   Several reports suggest a significant number        of critically ill patients may have unrecognized adrenal        insufficiency             Four cases of idiopathic hypotension with low SVR were        identified in our patients One case was felt to be related        to possible anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction but was        not well documented Silverman         et al   reported a patient who        developed anaphylactic shock secondary to penicillin days        postmyocardial infarction the hemodynamic parameters        showed a decrease in CO and MAP with an increase in SVR        Moss         et al   reported the opposite        hemodynamic profile in a patient with anaphylactic shock        secondary to succinycholine Their patient developed a low        SVR and a high CO which correlated with increased levels of        histamine and catecholamines Although there are minimal        human data animal studies suggest there is an initial        hypodynamic state secondary to severe extravasation of        fluids into the tissues followed by a hyperdynamic state        after fluid resuscitation        Our second case of hypotension with a low SVR presented        in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction Although        cardiogenic shock presents with a high SVR and low CO some        data suggest that rarely patients may present with a        syndrome of low SVR McCriskin         et al   reported a patient with a        left ventricular pseudoaneurysm postmyocardial infarct with        a low SVR and no evidence of infection Costantin          developed an animal model in dogs and demonstrated a subset        of animals with a hyperdynamic state after coronary        occlusion however Ross         et al   were unable to confirm        these results using another animal model Similarly Smith         et al   in one of the original        hemodynamic descriptions of patients after myocardial        infarction did not identify any patient with a        hyperdynamic state Another recently described cause of low        SVR in cardiac patients is the vasoplegic syndrome This        syndrome occurs within h after cardiac surgery using        extracorporeal circulation   The incidence has been        estimated between  and  of patients undergoing        cardiovascular surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass           The etiology is unclear but has not been associated        with increased levels of nitric oxide or endotoxin        One patient with a low SVR classified as idiopathic had        a history of significant alcohol consumption Their initial        hemodynamic parameters showed a low SVR with high CO which        rapidly resolved after intravenous thiamine and        broadspectrum antibiotics It is possible that this case        represents a variant of beriberi heart disease This rare        but treatable disease should be considered in every patient        with congestive heart failure and a low SVR The fulminant        form known as Shosin beriberi presents as a high CO state        with extremely high CO and a low SVR which rapidly responds        to thiamine            The remaining patient in the idiopathic group had no        explanation for their low SVR syndrome Review of the        literature shows many causes of a low SVR Tables and         and it is possible that one of these diagnosis was missed        by the clinicians caring for this patient The patient had        normal urine drug abuse screens and a normal serum        acetaminophen level A salicylate level was not obtained        Leatherman and Schmitz   reported a series of five        patients who became accidentally intoxicated with        salicylates with clinical laboratory and hemodynamic        features of sepsis but without bacteriological evidence        In two of the cases TNF IL and IL were measured and        found to be significantly elevated Other drugs have been        associated with a low SVR including tricyclic        antidepressants anesthetic agents and narcotics Recently        Nguyen         et al   reported hyperdynamic        shock caused by trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole in which        immunoglobulin E antibodies and TNF were not detected and        complement levels were normal suggesting a mechanism other        than anaphylaxis Our drug screen should have identified        tricyclic antidepressants or narcotics in the urine        however a careful drug history was not elicited in this        patient Although other conditions such as head injury            Pagets disease     arteriovenous        fistula   severe anemia    multiple myeloma          thyrotoxicosis   and spinal cord injury          have been reported to produce a low SVR this patient        lacked any clinical evidence suggesting one of these        diagnoses his hypotension resolved spontaneously                    Conclusion        In summary we describe a group of  patients with a        SVR below dynesscm  and a subgroup of  nonseptic        patents  with a similar mortality This study        emphasizes the importance of considering other conditions        besides sepsis in patients presenting with hypotension and        a low SVR
