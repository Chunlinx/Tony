                                 A Man of the Old School            Louis Begleys work is likea bibliographers idea of nostalgia Everything has been downhill since thefirst book Begleys first novel Wartime Lies  was a work of greatdistinction Three novels later it is still his best a marvel of achievedrestraint Unhappily the subsequent novels have been unwitting examples of thedifficulty of writing about restraint as a subject About Schmidt  hisnew book which explores the dwindling years of a morose retired lawyer a manwho calls himself the last of the Wasps offers some of his most delicatewriting yet but once again involves Begley in the paradoxical task of givingexpression to repression                           Wartime Lies which is largely autobiographical recounts the adventuresof Maciek a Jewish boy who with his aunt Tania is fleeing the Nazis inPoland The pair do not look Jewish and this combined with Tanias charmenables them to evade capture even as they live openly yards from the Warsawghetto Nonetheless they are in great peril and are hiding from that perilBy contrast Begleys second novel The Man Who Was Late  is about a manwho is hiding a secret Ben is a successful American financier who hasrepressed the memory of his unhappy Jewish childhood What mysteriouslydisappeared from one book to the next is a sense of the perilous It is as ifBegley could no longer identify the enemy In this novel and his third AsMax Saw It  his characters are still hiding but now they are hiding fromthemselves It is this selfdivision that seems to defy lucid expression Thesecrecy is more opaque than it appears to warrant            About Schmidt is a better book than its twopredecessors partly because of the honesty of Albert Schmidtsselfdisclosures There is clarity here he hides nothing from us Publicly hemaintains the Wasp proprietiesa stiff upper lip a stiff drink the rattle ofsmall talk But privately his soul is in turmoil Essentially Schmidtnarrates this novel the thirdperson narrator hews closely to his point ofview in the process he uncovers his own hurts His only daughter Charlotteis marrying one of his former junior partners from the old law firm Jon RikerSchmidt thinks him dull and laborious and with the kind of bigotry that is thefermentation of social vintage disapproves of his Jewishness Schmidt is alsostill in mourning for his wife His daughter seems to be cleaving to the Rikerfamily rather than to her sad father He kicks old memories around his lovelyhouse in Bridgehamptona house that he tries to give to Charlotte and Jon butthat they ungraciously refuse At  his body is cooling and even the heat ofan affair with a dangerously young waitress at a local restaurant will not warmhim for long            What isfine here is the precision of Begleys attention he does not strive to makeSchmidt either likable or a monster He paints with care the naturalvariegation of Schmidts petty antiSemitism its defiance on top itsembarrassment underleaf To the best of his recollection no matter howdeeply or how far back he looked Schmidt was sure he had not once in his lifestood in the way of any Jew Schmidts codes of belonging his fastidiousprejudices are laid bare In sentences of loping baroque syntax Begley makeshis elegant stately report There is something impressive about a writer soundaunted by a characters trivial unpleasantness by his daily acts ofmeanness            But About Schmidt loses delicacy as itproceeds Its power flows from its fidelity to Schmidts unhappiness and thisunhappiness has a reality only because we see how selfinvented it isSchmidts selfishness is the most convincing element of this portrait But thenBegley cheats he weights our sympathy in Schmidts favor His daughter becomesnot merely ungrateful but implausibly hostile In a climactic scene shetelephones Schmidt to tell him that a rabbi will be performing the weddingservice and that she will be converting There must be more to being a Jewthan your kind of Episcopalian she sneers Since she has not until thismoment shown interest one way or another in her inherited religion her suddenzeal to abandon it seems clumsy on Begleys part Meanwhile her fianc who isinterestingly dull at the beginning of the book begins to curdle intouninteresting stereotypethe dry ruthless Jewish lawyer poised to strip theinlaw of his treasures He is abetted by his beautiful psychoanalyst motherRenata who is also crudely drawn Like some caricature of a Freudian she hasan urge to psychoanalyze Schmidt whenever he is in her presence Schmidt quotesfrom King Lear  and Begley intends a soft echo of that play in his taleof an aged patriarch quarreling with a daughter But whats interesting aboutKing Lear is that Lear has no reason to blame his daughters Theirvillainy is all in his head The obviousness of Charlotte and Jons evilleaches the force from the story Begley wants us to feel pity for a manalready swimming in the emotion            As Begley loses his criticaldistance from Schmidt the novel grows maudlin and bleary Clannishly Begleyoffers Schmidt sexual release He romps with Renata and then with ayearold waitress named Carrie who is so eager to have sex with a man years her senior that she begs for it The Jamesian upholstery is ripped offBegleys prose and we are down to springs and horsehair I havent seen yourbreasts I think they are small and hard Schmidt muses Youre wrong Ivegot big tits she replies Then Schmidt retreats from us lost in a cloth thatBegley throws over him and what began as a sharp examination of publicrestraint and private release dwindles into a selfpity which seems not merelySchmidts but Begleys            Repression is one ofBegleys main themes But his latest novels do more than just showcase it theybecome its victims It is difficult not to detect an autobiographical note inhis heroes struggle to control inner distress and bury forgotten memoriesEven Wartime Lies  apparently so different from Begleys later work isintroduced by a man who has no childhood that he can bear to remember In thelast  pages of this novel Schmidts struggle to control himself fades fromview and one suspects that it is a struggle Begley can no longer depictbecause it is a struggle he can no longer win Instead he shuts it down andSchmidt dissolves into Begleys anxious obscurity
