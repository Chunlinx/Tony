Honorable Thomas J Bliley Jr Chairman The Honorable JohnD Dingell Ranking Minority Member Committee on Commerce House ofRepresentativesSubject Light Truck Average Fuel Economy Standard Model YearPursuant to section aA of title  United States Codethis is our report on a major rule promulgated by the NationalHighway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA Department ofTransportation entitled Light Truck Average Fuel EconomyStandard Model Year  RIN AF We received the rule onApril   It was published in the Federal Register as a finalrule on April    Fed Reg Section a of title  United States Code requires theSecretary of Transportation to prescribe by regulation at least months in advance of each model year average fuel economystandards known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy or CAFEstandards for nonpassenger automobiles manufactured in that modelyear Under subsections a and f the standard is to be themaximum feasible average fuel economy level that the Secretarydecides manufacturers can achieve in that model year taking intoconsideration technological feasibility economic practicabilitythe effect of other GovernmentGAOOGC motor vehicle standards on fuel economy and theneed of the United States toconserve energyThe light truck CAFE standard for model year  wasestablished at  miles per gallon mpg During the developmentof the CAFE standard for model year  the Department ofTransportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act  PubL No  Nov    Stat  was enacted Section of the Appropriations Act  Stat  providesNone of the funds in this Act shall be available to preparepropose or promulgate any regulations pursuant to title V of theMotor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act  USC  etseq prescribing corporate average fuel economy standards forautomobiles as defined in such title in any model year thatdiffers from standards promulgated for such automobiles prior tothe enactment of this sectionNHTSA interprets section  of the Appropriations Act asrequiring it to prescribe the same light truck CAFE standard formodel year  that applies to model year  Accordingly therule continues the  mpg standard for Enclosed is our assessment of NHTSAs compliance with theprocedural steps required by section aBi through ivof title  with respect to the rule As discussed in the enclosureNHTSA did not follow many of the steps that ordinarily would applyto the rule based in part on its interpretation that section of the Appropriations Act required it to fix the  standard at mpg and thereby deprived the agency of any discretion over thestandard NHTSAs interpretation of section  while notnecessarily the only plausible approach is supported by thelanguage and legislative history of this provision Neverthelesswe do not view section  as exempting the rulemaking from therequirements referred to in  USC  aBi throughiv particularly the analysis called for by  USC If you have any questions about this report please contactHenry R Wray

STANDARD RULE UNDER  USC aBiiviCostbenefit analysisOn January   NHTSA published a notice of proposedrulemaking which proposed a  standard of  mpg See  FedReg  The Supplementary Information accompanying the proposedrule contains a discussion and assessment of the economic impactsof the proposed standard including its potential costs benefitsand alternatives In addition NHTSA prepared a PreliminaryRegulatory Evaluation of the proposed standard which was includedin the docket for the rulemaking and contained more detailedanalyses of these and other affects of the proposed standard Theagency did not prepare a Final Regulatory Impact Analysis inconnection with the final rule because of the restrictions imposedby Section  of the FY  DOT Appropriations Act  Fed Regat iiAgency actions relevant to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct  USC    and Section  Initial regulatory flexibility analysisThe Supplementary Information accompanying the proposedrulemaking includes a certification pursuant to section b oftitle  that the proposal would not have a significant impact on asubstantial number of small entities thereby exempting theproposed rule from the requirement for an initial regulatoryflexibility analysis The certification was accompanied by astatement that few if any light truck manufacturers subject tothe proposed rule would be classified as small businesses See Fed Reg at Section b states that the certification and statement shallbe provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small BusinessAdministration SBA According to Department of Transportationofficials the certification and statement were not separatelyprovided to the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy They stated thatin accordance with the Departments practice publication ofsection b certifications in the Federal Register is treated asproviding notice to SBA An SBA official confirmed that someagencies follow this practice and that SBA has not objected to itThe official indicated however that SBAs policy may change sincefuture certifications will need to be justified more specificallyand will be subject to judicial reviewPage  GAOOGC Section  Final regulatory flexibilityanalysisNHTSA did not conduct a final regulatory flexibility analysisunder section  nor did it make a section b certificationin connection with the final rule The agency viewed such ananalysis as unnecessary in light of its lack of discretion withrespect to the rule but stated that past evaluations indicated fewif any small businesses would be affected See  Fed Reg atSection  Avoidance of duplicative or unnecessaryanalysisAs noted above NHTSA invoked the exemption from the initialregulatory flexibility analysis requirement with respect to theproposed ruleSection  Preparation of analysisAs noted above NHTSA did not prepare an initial or finalregulatory flexibility analysisSection  Participation by small entitiesThe requirements of section  are inapplicable to this rulesince NHTSA did not determine that it would have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entitiesiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  Since the standard appears to constitute a federal mandateresulting in aggregate annual private sector expenditures of million or more it would be subject to the requirements of section of the Act Statements to Accompany Significant RegulatoryActions Neither the proposed nor the final rulemaking expresslyrefers to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act or includes thestatements required by section  The Supplementary Informationaccompanying the proposed rule does include some of the informationcovered by section The rule also appears subject to section  of the Actrelating to consideration of regulatory alternatives While NHTSAdid not explicitly address section  it complied in substancewith the requirements of this section Potential alternatives wereconsidered and discussed at the proposed rulemaking stage and thefinal rulemaking describes NHTSAs determination that there was noalternative to the standard adoptedThe requirements of section  Small Government Agency Planand section  State Local and Tribal Government Input appearto be inapplicable to the rulePage  GAOOGC iv Other relevant information orrequirements under Acts and Executive ordersAdministrative Procedure Act  USC   et seqThe rule was promulgated through the general notice of proposedrulemaking procedures of the Act  USC   NHTSA affordedinterested persons the opportunity to comment on the proposed ruleThe final rulemaking however does not address commentsPaperwork Reduction Act  USC  The rule does not refer to information collection requirementssubject to the Act and according to NHTSA the rule imposes nosuch requirementsNational Environmental Policy Act  USC   et seqNHTSA did not conduct an evaluation of the impacts of the ruleunder the National Environmental Policy Act The SupplementaryInformation accompanying the final rule states in this regardThere is no requirement for such an evaluation where Congresshas eliminated the agencys discretion by precluding any actionother than the one announced in this notice  Fed Reg atStatutory authorization for the ruleThe Supplementary Information accompanying the final rulediscusses at length its legal basis Section a of title United States Code requires that light truck CAFE standards beprescribed for each model year in accordance with the Maximumfeasible criteria specified in that subsection and subsectionf However section  of the Appropriations Acteffectively prohibited issuance of any CAFE standard that differsfrom standards promulgated    prior to the enactment of thissection According to NHTSAs legal analysis detailed in theSupplementary Information section  of the Appropriations Actprecluded the agency from prescribing any CAFE standard differentfrom the most recent standards prescribed at the time of itsenactmentthose applicable to model year  Thus according toNHTSA section  deprived the agency of the discretion itotherwise would have under section  to determine theapplicable standard under the criteria set forth therein NHTSAconcluded that while section  superseded the section criteria it did not supersede the section  mandate that therebe CAFE standards for model year NHTSA noted that the only other possible interpretation ofsection  was to treat the phrase standards promulgated   prior to the enactment of this section asPage  GAOOGC encompassing any standard prescribed forany prior model year In addition to the mpg standard nine other light truck standardsrangingfrom  to  mpgwere promulgated for prior model yearsHowever NHTSA rejected this interpretation on the basis that itcould also conflict with the maximum feasible criteria under USC   and that it would be illogical to assume thatCongress intended to arbitrarily limit the  standard to one ofthese prior year levels even if some other level was determined tobe the maximum feasible for model year Accordingly NHTSA concluded that the only legally permissiblealternative was to establish the model year  standard at mpg As a result the agency did not complete its analysis todetermine what the maximum feasible level actually would be formodel year  under the  USC   criteriaNHTSAs legal interpretation is supported by the language andlegislative history of section  As the analysis points out theHouse Appropriations Committee report and a floor statement by theprincipal sponsor of section Representative DeLaydescribesection  as permitting NHTSA to establish a  standardidentical to the model year  standard The conference reportdescribes section  as prohibiting the use of funds forregulations that prescribe changes in the CAFE standardsOn the other hand we question whether NHTSA was compelled bysection  to forego completion of the analysis otherwise mandatedby  USC   to determine the maximum feasible level formodel year  The legislative history of section  taken as awhole suggests that the fundamental purpose of this provision wasto prevent an anticipated increase in the CAFE standardsRepresentative DeLay observed in his floor statement that NHTSA wasengaged in a rulemaking which could result in a sharp increase inthe standards for light trucks and vans and that this actionwould be devastating to the Nations economy  Cong Rec Hdaily ed July   He also stated that section imposes a year freeze on the ability of NHTSA to increase theCAFE standards and that it was my intent that NHTSA wouldwithhold any further action directed toward increasing CAFEstandards    Id In this context the references in thehistory to requiring an identical standard or precluding anychanges for  may have been based on the assumption that theoutcome of any change would be an increase in the standardCompleting the analysis under  USC   would haveprovided NHTSA more information on which to assess the relationshipbetween that section and sectionThese standards are listed in a table included in the finalrule The  mpg standard was initially prescribed for model year but was amended to  mpg before the start of that modelyearPage  GAOOGC  For example if the analysis indicatedthat the maximum feasible level for  was at or closer to oneof the lower prior year standards than it was to the  standardprescribing that lower standard would not necessarily beimpermissible Such an action would give greater effect to USC   than using the  mpg standard and would satisfythe plain terms of section  Nor is it clear that such actionwould conflict with the purpose underlying section  The historydoes not explicitly address the possibility that the  mpgstandard might exceed the maximum feasible level for indicated under  USC  Executive Order No Based on its economic impact the rule was determined to be asignificant regulatory action within the meaning of ExecutiveOrder No  Consistent with the Executive order the rule wasinitiated through an advance notice of proposed rulemakingpublished on April    Fed Reg  As notedpreviously the proposed rulemaking published on January  includes a Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation The final rulehowever does not include a Final Regulatory Impact AnalysisAccording to NHTSA the Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs reviewed the rule at the proposed and final stages andsuggested no changesExecutive Order The Supplementary Information accompanying the proposed rulestates that based on an analysis of the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order No  NHTSA determined that theproposed rule would not have sufficient federalism implications towarrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment  Fed Reg at The Supplementary Information accompanying the final rulestates that the final rule was not analyzed under Executive OrderNo  because of the NHTSAs lack of discretion with respect tothe rule It adds that prior light truck standards have not beenviewed as having federalism implications warranting preparation ofa Federalism Analysis  Fed Reg at NHTSA did not identify any other statutes or Executive ordersimposing requirements relevant to the rulePage  GAOOGC
