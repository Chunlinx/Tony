                                 Investors Have No Business in Show Business                        One of the bad things about a bull market is that the performance ofmediocre stocks can look great when presented in isolation Combine that factwith the willful neglect of the idea of the opportunity cost of investingthatis you have to measure the success of an investment against other potentialinvestments you might have made not against zeroand you get a recipe forreal confusion            Take the very curious column by Roger Smith Varietys financialcolumnist in the most recent issue of that magazine In essence Smith arguesthat entertainment has been a great business to be in over the last  yearsthat entertainment stocks have been often undervalued and that theyve beenundervalued for one real reason Wall Street is jealous of Hollywood becausepeople in Hollywood make lots of money and have fun doing it            There are a lot of strange ideas packed into that argument First itassumes that Wall Street somehow controls stock prices In the long term itdoesnt Markets collectively set prices and markets are much bigger andsmarter than all the investment banks and brokerage houses in the world puttogether If the market has looked skeptically on entertainment stocks itsprobably for a very good reason And even if Wall Street did set prices theidea that investment bankers have consistently foregone potential fortunes forthemselves and their clients because their jealousy of Hollywood made themunwilling to buy or even recommend entertainment stocks is at bestimplausible This is capitalism remember People who walk away from  billsthat are lying on the street eventually disappear            But theres also a deeper problem here which is that entertainmentcompanies have not in fact been those proverbial free  bills Smith pointsout that the revenue side of showbiz has risen dramatically at home andphenomenally abroad over the past decade and a half But he doesnt sayanything about the profitability of showbiz as an industry let alone about itsreturn on invested capital the most important single metric of a companyseconomic performance Thats because compared to industries such as softwaretelecom networking and pharmaceuticals the performance of the entertainmentindustry has been anemic            Besides havent entertainment stocks been mediocre Well Smith mentionsthat Wall Street analysts often cite this point as justification for what hecalls their longrange myopia But then he showsor believes he showsthatin fact big entertainment stocks have done very well in the past  yearsFourDisney Comcast Cablevision and TCIare up fold two are up betterthan fold a couple are up sevenfold and a couple have onlyquadrupled            Now set aside the fact that of the real powerhouses three are cablecompanies that own hard assets not part of what we usually think of asHollywood Consider instead that since  the SP  Index is upbetter than ninefold and better than fold since  So most of thestocks that Smith cites have done about as well as or worse than the market asa whole Then recognize that Smith is talking about the very best of the besthere and you start to see how weak the industry as a whole has been            Twentyfold since  Between  and  alone Dells stock rosefold AOLs rose fold and Microsoft was up  times Cisco SunMicrosystems EMC Pfizer Merck MCIWorldcom Coke Gillette WalMart HomeDepot McDonalds even recent laggards like Nike All of these stocks did aswell as or significantly better than the best entertainment companies over thepast  years and many of them have been public for a significantly shorterperiod of time            Its not that entertainment isnt a better business than it used to be Itis mainly because the people running these companies are spending more timerunning them and less time thinking about how to make them bigger But by theonly standard that really matterscomparing how much money is put into acompany versus how much money that company makesentertainment is just notand never has been a good business There are exceptionsDisney Time WarnerCBS USA Networks TCIbut they are the exceptions The bull market makes iteasy to obscure that fact But even in a bull market the real numbers dontlie Of course Smith is surely right that business in Hollywood is a lot offun Spending other peoples money always is
