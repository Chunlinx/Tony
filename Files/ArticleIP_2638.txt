                                 The Commoditization Conundrum            If theres one thing thatmicroeconomics has demonstrated it is that its hard to keep your profitmargins high if youre in the wheatgrowing business Wheat is pretty muchwheat no matter where it grows and its pretty easy to grow unless the DustBowl is raging That means that the supply of wheat rises quickly to meetdemand which in turn keeps a downward pressure on prices Wheat in otherwords is the definition of a commodity and the market for wheatabsentgovernment interventionis about as close to perfect competition as you canimagine            The samewould be true one might think of salt If anything salt is easier to producethan wheat And salt is the same all around the world It should in theory beimpossible for a company to charge more for its basic salt than its competitorsdo And yet Morton actually owns nearly half the American salt market eventhough its salt is more expensiveat least a few pennies morethan otherbrands If salt is a commodity and surely it is then American consumersappear not to know it            The lesson of Mortons success obviously is that even themost mundane and undifferentiated of products can be made into something uniquewith the right marketing strategy Salt is salt is salt except when it comesin a blue canister with a little girl with an umbrella on it and the promisethat rain wont damage its pourability Yet whats striking about Americanbusiness todayand in particular about the very industries that we now thinkof as the heart of our economy namely information technology and financialservicesis that the people in charge are not consoled by the thought ofMortons successful branding Instead they are haunted by the specter ofthat wheat market Luckily for them though were much further from that worldof perfect competition than much recent hype would suggest            Whatcorporations fear is the phenomenon now known rather inelegantly ascommoditization What the term means is simply the conversion of the marketfor a given product into a commodity market which is characterized bydeclining prices and profit margins increasing competition and loweredbarriers to entry Commoditization is therefore different fromcommodification the word cultural critics use to decry the corruption ofhigher goods by commercial values Microprocessors are commoditized Love iscommodified            Without this fear corporate America should bein its heyday Profits and stock prices are at record highs and theres nosign of any meaningful challengeregulatory or otherwise But analyses of theprospects for the personalcomputer industry or the banking industry or eventhe clothing industry reveal a permanent anxiety What companies rely on forprofits today they assume will most likely not be there tomorrow becausetomorrow someone else will be making the very same thing for less Click forone recent emblematic account In this universe even the paranoid may notsurvive            Insofaras commoditization is a reality its all to the good for consumers It iswitness to the enormous distance US corporations have traveled from theinefficiencies and qualitycontrol debacles of the s Commoditization canonly take place after all in a world in which secondtier companies cancompete in terms of quality and efficiency with topoftheline companies Andcommoditization or at least the fear of it encourages innovation Thosetechnological breakthroughs that allow a company to distinguish itself from itscompetition and charge a premium for its product are more likely and fruitfulin an economy characterized by price competition than in one dominated byoligopolies Finally and perhaps more dubiously commoditization has furtheredthe democratization of fashion and interior decoration Whether you deplore orwelcome the Gapification of America it is happening            Still this supposed ubiquity of commoditization isdifficult to square with one fact A few large corporations dominate many ifnot most major US industries From Coke and Pepsi to CompaqHewlettPackard and Dell to Intel to Gillette companies have been able tomaintain high profit margins and market share in businesses that in theory atleast should be eminently susceptible to competition            In somecases with the auto industry being the best example commoditization has beenfended off by the enormous capital investment required to enter the businessIt takes a much smaller initial investment to make a new wordprocessingprogram than it does to build a car In other cases like the softdrinkindustry a curious confluence of taste distinctions and brand identificationmakes meaningful challenges difficult to imagine Coke does taste differentfrom Pepsi and RC but that taste difference is reinforced by the allAmericanmythology that has been wrapped around it In still other casesthepersonalcomputer industry for examplethe brand name becomes a kind ofsurrogate for quality and reliability Its possible even likely that XYZComputer makes a PC every bit as good as Compaqs But because I recognizeCompaqs name Ill buy its PC without bothering to check out what XYZ isoffering If I pay extra for Compaq which I probably wont have to its tocover the opportunity cost I avoid by not having to comparison shop            The greatest example of a company avoidingseemingly certain commoditization is Intel which continues to charge premiumprices for its microprocessors even though by all accounts its Pentium chipsare no more powerful than chips made by Intels two main competitors AdvancedMicro Devices and Cyrix Its true that Intels production lines have beenconsistently more reliable and efficient than either AMDs or Cyrixs Thatmakes PC manufacturers more comfortable putting Intel chips in their computersBut other factors contribute to Intels success The mere fact of itscommanding position in the microprocessor marketa position it initiallyachieved by technological superiorityhas made computer makers leery of doingbusiness with its competitors lest Intel fail to give them access to new morepowerful chips in the future            Morestrikingly Intels successful Intel Inside ad campaign has created a brandname for a product that observers once believed was the very definition of acommodity As one lessthanprescient ad exec put it in  while labelingIntels advertising efforts awfully stupid Most people that buy computersdont even know that that chip is in there They care about the performance ofthe computer It really doesnt matter what the chip is Oh well Cyrix andAMD are now spending millions of dollars on TVad campaigns in recognition ofthe fact that it really does matter            More intriguing than Intels success though is thecontinued market domination of companies like Gillette and Campbells soupWhile Gillettes razors are technologically superior to Schicks and Campbellssoup tastes better than its competitors the quality differences arent bigenough to account for these companies ability to combine premium pricing withhuge sales Gillette owns  percent of the US razor market and Campbellshas more than  percent of the US soup market Nor can we simply ascribetheir market dominance to advertising Whats going on seems to be something wemight describe as the narcissism of small differences In an odd way themore similar products become the more telling the little differences amongthem end up being Branding successfully in other words can turn a smalldifference between products into a huge difference in market share            None of this means thatGillette and Campbells are not pushed by their competition since all theevidence suggests that they are constantly looking for competitive advantagesWhat it does mean though is that commoditization does its work not bybecoming a reality which would entail evershrinking margins and stagnantstock prices but by remaining a perpetually present threat Its the idea thatperfect competition might be just around the corner not the competitionitself that keeps the paranoid prosperous And alive
