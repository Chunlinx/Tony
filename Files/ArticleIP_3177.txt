                                 Noted With Pleasure            Much as the press coverageof government is in large measure coverage of politics so also dodiscussions of language get skewed toward issues of usage and etymology Inlanguage as in government a vast and remarkable infrastructuresome of itregulatory some of it didacticquietly shapes the world in revolutionaryways Yet most of us give little thought to how say there came to be spacesbetween words or why English has the letters that it does or how themechanical means of writing affects the nature of writing            From timeto time however language infrastructure pokes momentarily into public view Irecall a heady few days in  when a new reference work by Malcolm Parkes alecturer in paleography at Oxford enjoyed a certain modest vogue This workwas Parkes magisterial Pause and Effect An Introduction to the History ofPunctuation in the West  a book that at last stripped the cloak ofanonymity from the important work of commas periods dashes colonssemicolons and countless other full and parttime functionaries Severaltimes a day I still think of Parkes disquisition on the nowobsoletepunctuation mark known as a percontativus  a question mark floppedbackward and used to indicate a question that is purely rhetorical It is adevice we might usefully revive            This fall another noteworthy volume on the apparatus ofwritten language has been published The Footnote A Curious History  bythe Princeton University historian Anthony Grafton The book seeks to explainhow footnotes became an essential element of the narrative architecture ofhistorical writing This is not a reference book to be consulted but anexcursus to be savored by a writer with a studied sense of style To theinexpert he writes in one place footnotes look like deep root systemssolid and fixed to the connoisseur however they reveal themselves asanthills swarming with constructive and combative activity Elsewhere hewrites Unlike other forms of credentials footnotes sometimes provideentertainmentnormally in the form of daggers stuck in the back of theauthors colleagues Some of these are inserted politely He sympatheticallyquotes Noel Cowards observation that having to stop for a footnote issometimes like having to answer the door while making love            AlthoughGrafton does not mention the fact or even allude to it his book appears at amomentous time in the life of the footnote On the one hand encouraged in partby the cultural ascendance of irony and by recreational obeisance to themanytiered nature of experience and truth the noncitational or literaryfootnote has become increasingly prominent in recent years in journalismcriticism and fiction For examples see the effective but very differenttechniques employed by Nicholson Baker in his novel The Mezzanine  andby David Foster Wallace in the novel Infinite Jest and in the essayscollected in A Supposedly Fun Thing Ill Never Do Again  On the otherhand the footnote as scholarly reference tool or scholarly reference weaponhas never enjoyed more prominence than it does todayeach serious work ofhistory Grafton notes must now travel on an impregnably armored bottomrather like a tank In law the analysis of footnotes even sustains a newminor discipline citology The next task for the footnote scarcely begunis the mastery of electronic information an undertaking that offersopportunities for utility and mischief on an incomparable scale            Where did the footnote come from ScholarsGrafton explains have placed the birth of the footnote in the twelfthcentury the seventeenth the eighteenth and the nineteenthnever withoutgood reason but usually without attending to the other chapters in this storyGraftons book begins by considering the historians Edward Gibbon and Leopoldvon Ranke who in their own ways raised the historical footnote to a level ofhigh art both as a citational resource and a rhetorical outlet Ranke with hisavowed intention to show history wie es eigentlich gewesen how itreally wasand with his ambition to put the study of history on a scientificfooting doubtless had a more pervasive influence on the formal output ofgenerations of historians But Gibbons source apparatus and sotto vocecommentary in Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire remain moreaccessible and entertaining to ordinary readers Gibbon straightforwardlyobserves at one point for instance that the emperor Marcus Aurelius thankedthe gods in his Meditations for giving him a wife so faithful sogentle and of such a wonderful simplicity of manners Only in the annotationdoes Gibbon add The world has laughed at the credulity of Marcus but MadamDacier assures us and we may credit a lady that the husband will always bedeceived if the wife condescends to dissemble We owe a debt to thephilosopher David Hume for persuading Gibbon to take such notational materialout of the back of his volumes and to print it at the bottom of the relevantpagesthereby turning end notes into foot notes and allowingGibbon more effectively to drop the other shoe            NeitherRanke nor Gibbon invented the citational or literary footnote Grafton slogsback through time in search of antecedents Medieval commentators ardentlyglossed the margins of documents with references and asides These like thehistorians footnote enable the reader to work backward from the finishedargument to the texts it rests on Religious writers in antiquity pennednotations that sometimes we now know were later absorbed wholesale into theprimary text itself The structure of footnotes grew increasingly elaboratemainly because of the rediscovery during the Renaissance of a wealth of olddocumentary sources along with the proliferation of new sources made possibleby the printing press and the modern archive Some mechanism was needed to makesense of it all What is more humanism and the Reformation set off a fight forthe ownership of truth historical and otherwisewhence derived authority whenthe higher Authority had been dethronedand the footnote became a marker oflegitimacy As Grafton makes plain the story of the footnote is in many waysthe story of historiography itself            The story can get a little dense although any readercaptivated by footnotes to begin with has already passed the first endurancetest And Grafton enlivens his account with a sometimes astonishing array ofencylopedists autodidacts and polyhistors The French philosopher PierreBayle for example set out in the s to produce a vast reference workDictionnaire historique et critique  Historical and CriticalDictionary  whose sole purpose was to point out the mistakes in all otherpreviously published reference works This was a dictionarya bizarre bestsellerin which even the footnotes had footnotes and whose pages Graftonnotes offer the reader only a thin and fragile crust of text on which tocross the deep dark swamp of commentary            We smile even as thecrossing becomes potentially harder with every day Writing in  Rankeconjured a memorable image of the modern critical historian confronted by anddetermined to derive order from the boundless quantities of available sourcematerial            Consider thestrange feelings that would arise in someone who entered a great collection ofantiquities in which genuine and spurious beautiful and repulsivespectacular and insignificant objects from many nations and periods lay nextto one another in complete disorder            Does that sound anything likethe challenge posed by electronic media And where is a percontativusnow that I need one
