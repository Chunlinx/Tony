                well i dont know how you feel about this but uh its really scary to me   oh oh yeah me too   there was a thing in our we have a little Lewisville paper that just comes out twice a week and there was a thing in there just this week saying that in all of Denton County Lewisville had the highest crime rate of all of Denton it   well its not surprising considering how close to Dallas it is   i guess thats true but you know youve got to figure uh youve got to look at it like Carrollton is in Denton County   uh thats true thats true   you know you know and it gets kind of scary you know when youre looking at Lewisville youre looking at Denton youre looking at you know some of the larger cities and and Lewisville had more crime this last year than any of them and   yeah   its just getting its just getting really scary and almost uh out of hand you know theres been   uh   i dont know if youve heard any but any of it on the news lately or not but theres been a couple of uh you know uh a few months ago there was a deal in North Dallas where they had the man taking little girls out of their bedrooms breaking into their bedroom windows   yes oh yes i was living up there when all that mess was happening   at that time theres been a couple of those here in Lewisville over the last few weeks yeah and theyre you know theyre not sure if were working with the same guy or not but uh its really scary you know it really is so   is there yeah yeah it is   what are things like you said McKinney do you live in McKinney too are things pretty calm up there or   yes we uh oh yeah its its deader than a doornail up here weve only lived around my husband was uh transferred up here from uh   yeah   the North Building were to um so its weve been up here for about eight six or eight months an its a lot different than Dallas yeah   uhhuh oh yeah yeah i grew up in i went to high school in Frisco and lived there several years so i was up you know pretty close to where you guys are and and it was always     uhhuh yeah   i dont know Frisco there always seemed to be a lot of drugs in Frisco for as small a town as it was there were a lot of drugs   really oh uh um   but as far as major crime there didnt seem to be as you know one of those nice little small towns and nothing ever happened and it would be nice to kind of get back into that so   umhum yeah   i dont know i just dont know as a matter of fact i had uh one of these conversations the other day where our topic was uh capital punishment and you know the death penalty and you know what you know we were talking about that   oh yeah uhhuh   and one of the things that we kind of got to talking about is you know what is it we can do you know what can what can be done to stop it and im not sure that i know the answer to that question   yeah i dont know that one   you know i mean one of the things that we talked about that i truly believe is you know you give somebody a you know a jury convicts somebody and they give them a sixty year sentence and the guys going to be out in twelve or thirteen years you know   if if that long   yet they oh its very wrong its horrible you know i have i take a business law class um on Tuesday nights and my instructor is a practicing criminal attorney   yeah umhum   and you know so he does this like everyday you know deals with this and he said you know you could pretty much if you sit on a jury know right now you could be sure that they will serve just about a quarter of whatever you give them you know   oh yeah why is that why is that   well they they say we dont have enough room in the prisons and weve got to get them out well if thats the case lets come up with some money somewhere   i know yeah   to build some more and keep these people in i mean there was a thing on TV the other night where they were interviewing it was it was a womens prison and they were interviewing these women and these women are like they asked them is this a deterrent and they all said no   of course not   i mean were going to be out in a couple of years this is no big deal i mean this is like a little vacation we dont have to work we dont have to you know we dont have to worry about making a living you know were fed and were clothed and were you know this is no big deal and   yeah yeah   dont have to do anything   and you know they were asked you know well when you get out will you commit that same crime again and they said probably you know this is how we live thats how we make our living we live by selling drugs we live by stealing we live by this you know   yeah yeah yeah   so obviously the systems not working you know an uh and i dont know what to do to make it work and so you know   no no its not oh it its its too its too hard to enforce the capital punishment it takes it its all all this automatic appeal stuff it just drags it out for years and years and years   right years and years thats something we talked about too you know if you   and then people forget you know they you hear oh this persons going to be put to death but you dont they dont tell you what this person has done   what this person had done ten years ago the brutality of their crime exactly exactly   yeah killed five children or something like this and and and you dont get to hear that part   oh that kind of wears off with time and peoples outrage slowly goes away and you know   mine doesnt  i know what youre saying   no mine doesnt either but with specific yeah but with specific cases people but you know the names arent familiar anymore and   oh thats true thats very true   you know people dont remember the what happened and they dont remember the outrage they felt at the time you know that oh my God look what he did you know and   yeah yeah they say theyll say oh he killed a police officer you know who has a wife and three children yeah   yeah yeah they dont mention that part yeah thats exactly right there was a thing on the other night about they had this women uh her husband was a police officer and was killed   oh   i think brutally i mean this guy point blank just shot him in the head i mean just uh for no reason i mean he the cop pulled him over for like a manor minor traffic thing you know and   yeah   and uh you know they she was getting ready to go through the trial you know for this guy and you know they they asked her uh can you imagine they asked her if she wanted the death penalty and she said yes   oh God wouldnt that be horrible of course uhhuh   i do    and i want to sit on the front row when it happens i want to be there i want to watch it you know and you cant blame her for feeling that vindictive you know i mean   uhhuh no you can not   and you know it showed her trying to explain to her children where daddy is you know and it was just oh it was just   oh boy   it was just horrible i mean this her little girl was like five and she was you know all of a sudden she started crying and said mommy i w ant my daddy and and you know her mommy said i know honey an oh and this little girl said uh   yeah and they just cant grasp it   said something about that man shot my daddy didnt he and the her mother said yeah honey the man shot your daddy and uh she said where did he shoot my daddy   uhhuh uh   and it was in the head and the mother said well we wont worry about that right now and she said i think he shot daddy in the face and mom said well youre right you know and she just started crying and it was just so sad you know i mean just i want to   uhhuh yeah oh um and how a five year old can grasp something like that is beyond is just a uh   no you an adult cant grasp something like that the enormity of it you know i mean i dont   no   i dont know and these poor children are going to be fatherless forever and this guy ought chances are he hell be out hell be walking the streets and its just doesnt   yeah will be out or uh or you and i are going to be supporting him for the rest of his life   one of the two thats right thats right i dont know i just i know you know i look at some of the millions of dollars that we you know give to other countries every year   umhum yeah uhhuh   and i know some of the i know those people i i mean i know theyre people too and i know they deserve to have food to eat and water to drink   um umhum   but i just want to say hey you know lets straighten out you know use that money and straighten ourselves out before we go trying to heal the world you know i mean   yeah yes uh too much we give away way too much in my in my opinion   oh we do we do we do it we really do   and   and i guess if if we would as a country unite and sit down and and if Congress received a millions of letters in one week saying were not going to take this anymore   umhum   youre either you know do away with some of these laws providing this or were going to vote you out next time maybe something would happen you know but people dont get involved and dont sit down and do that so i dont know   no people would rather hide their head and   yeah and just not pay any attention to it yeah   and not venture venture out their own front door than   yeah well were feeding starving kids overseas but were not paying any attention to the ones that are starving next door you know its really sad   yeah   it really is i heard something that their supposed to be starting a huge campaign in New York about um child abuse and stopping child abuse and its supposed to be like its starting there supposed to be like a big nationwide campaign and you know so hopefully that will take off and really do something i dont know theres just   umhum yeah that would be nice but you know its like the big drug campaigns that you hear every once in a while they the big hype is at first and then it just kind of fizzles and dies   yeah kind of fizzles out yeah thats true thats true   and uh its just it its got to start at home is where its got to start and   umhum   uh its but then theres so many people you get so many different opinions like well you shouldnt have well i shouldnt have to have to do this or i shouldnt have to do that and all this other stuff i dont want to get involved and   umhum   and it just   i chased a bunch of kids down on Easter Sunday we had put Easter eggs out in the front yard for an Easter egg hunt for you know my son and for his cousins and stuff and   uhhuh   and uh a bunch of kids came along and just started grabbing them stealing them i went running after them screaming hey you stop you stop i called the police   uh   you know i mean there was people that laughed at me they were Easter eggs then i called the police because i figured if these kids were stealing Easter eggs at ten   thats theft that is theft yes umhum   theyre going to be stealing cars at sixteen and robbing houses at twenty one you know if it doesnt stop   yes well youve got to be held accountable for your actions no matter how old you are or what it is   thats right these boys knew that what they were doing was wrong and when i screamed at them to stop they kept running they knew what they were doing was wrong thats why i called the police   of course umhum um umhum   to heck with them you know the police asked me if i wanted to press charges and i said no im not going to press charges i wanted the boys parents to know what had happened and i want you to go to talk to their parents and i want you know their their parents to be aware      yes that now thats something that sure doesnt happen anymore boy when i was a kid if you did something to somebody else you got trotted over to that persons house and and you had to apologize to their parents and all this other kind of stuff   well this is exactly what i told my mom you know when it was all over i said if we had a decent set of parents here those boys will be back here this afternoon with money to repay the eggs and with a big apology and nothing   of course umhum nothing of course   nothing the one girl the boys ran i couldnt keep up with them but the one girl was like carrying a two year old on her back and i was able to keep up with her and follow her until the police police came you know so we would know who they were and her mother the police called her mother to come and pick them up   yeah   and her mother had the same attitude as she as she did they were convinced that the absolute only reason i called the police was because she was black it had nothing to do with the fact that she stole from me   oh Lord   and the little girl told me that the only reason you called the police is because im black and the little two year old sister she had with her she patted her on the leg and said see what happens when your black honey youll live with this your whole life   oh      and i told her i said honey this has nothing to do with you being black id follow white kids that stole from me i mean stealing is stealing i dont care what color you are you think just because youre black you can steal and nobodys going to call the police that doesnt make any sense   no ugh   you know oh it was just horrible and then the mothers attitude the mother looked at me and goes well what is it that you want do you want me to pay you for your eggs or what you know it was that kind of attitude you know i mean it was just bad and i thought you know the parents went home and you know the kids   oh
