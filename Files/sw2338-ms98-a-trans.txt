        hi   right   oh me im in favor of it   you are   yeah i thought i think if uh people like Charles Manson   right     the the heinous crimes uh even if its one time offense   yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things we had to pick a topic to to investigate and at that time i dont think its like that any more but at that time uh it was very unfair capital punishment was a lot more  common and if you tended and it tended to be that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black or any minority for that matter the chances your chances of of uh getting the death penalty were you know like hundreds of times greater than if you could just communicate well i mean you didnt have to be um you didnt even necessarily have to be white but if you could just communicate and you could come across in the court room with some kind of um   you know sense about you then even if you did the exact same crime chances are you wouldnt get youd get life instead of the death penalty as a opposed to somebody who couldnt communicate well and at that time it just seemed so fair unfair that um i i felt like i couldnt uh um you know i just didnt agree with it   yeah   its gotten so though that there are so many you know there are so many uh       i dont know what you call it uh so many different things that you have to go through before they actually give the death penalty that im not so sure it it seems a lot fairer than it used to be     yeah well i know that that um like they can hold it off for years by uh im trying to think of the word that you were um retrials and um   right right   im forget i cannot think of that word   right i know what youre saying um but yeah they theres you know theres always uh uh you know and and in a way you know i guess thats good i mean if youre going to  if youre going to kill somebody   you have to make sure theyre guilty   right yeah you know give them give them i mean you should give somebody every every chance even even if it seems obvious   yeah   um i dont know what the what the law is like in Texas i mean i certainly havent heard anything any anything about somebody being executed or anything   uhhuh yeah well i think its all uh i dont think they have uh execution here   i dont i dont either   i do know though its easy to get put in jail for life   yeah well you know the um there was something on TV last night about how one state what there was a newspaper in no it was a TV station   TV station   you did you see that   yeah hes theyre wanting to record a gas chamber   i thought that was disgusting i mean   well it might scare some people off of doing the crimes   well yeah but you know there there are so many people who just get get their jollies off of watching that   you know yeah i yeah i agree with you there too   and thats what thats what really bothers me you know im all for deterrents but i i think whats going to happen is its going to turn it into a circus   yeah well ill agree with you there i dont agree with them showing it on television hard telling who would see it   and no   but i i do think that it would scare some people from doing things you know theyll think about this and say hey i dont think so   right sure well where i could see it being very useful is for you know when if theres a first time offender part of his punishment is that hes got  to see what you know what hes up against   yeah   you know what what you know what might happen but the you know for TV station you know that TV station isnt going to want to restrict how they use it and theyre going to show it on the six oclock well probably not the six oclock news but theyll show it on the eleven oclock eleven oclock news and i dont you know ive got a ten year old and you know shes she could very well be up at that time   yeah   you know when were and thats just not the kind of thing for a ten year old im not sure its the kind of thing for a sixteen year old   yeah thats i dont think its the kind of thing for anybody i know i wouldnt be able to watch it   right right   and im im supposed to be an adult   right and in fact i think itd be harmful if my if you know if my daughter or my any of my kids saw it so that has to be brought into the picture too you know you just cant blatantly say lets lets show it and and the the right people will see it and itll deter them from committing a crime all lot of the wrong people are going to see it too and uh   yeah well theres more wrong people that would see it than right people   yeah yeah   uh you know uh       but i i i dont know i think i would   say that if they put it where those first time offenders of uh your sex crimes and murderers uh show them what would happen   right   now my aunt had a thing when i was younger and uh you know i was working with her and she would say that they should uh for men who did sex crimes they should take off a piece of his body and the most important part to a man and inch by inch   yeah right yeah my wife says that all the time       yeah well that that would certainly do it   that would stop them from wanting to no well i thought it was funny listening to her shes just a shes shes a little bit uh dingy when it comes to things but well shes vicious       yeah well you know i i think that if if i felt like the the the system was was truly fair and and uh and that they would never make a mistake  then you know but you hear you know you hear about people who are who are genuinely mistakenly accused of a crime and     yeah like that Lionel something or another that black boy of they had a television program about him two hour movie   yeah   cant think of his name   i cant i cant think either   but he spent quite a few few quite a while in jail   yeah right thats right and and it turns out he didnt do it   yeah   or you know and and its easy you know and and you know lets face it not all policemen are honest and   well you see that on television also   thats right       and and you know they can theyll take somebody who maybe is mentally retarded and then its and theyre under pressure to to solve a crime and some and the circumstances uh may be molded to blame somebody who didnt do it and especially if its you know somebody whos mentally retarded who cant defend themselves very well and id hate to see them get the ultimate punishment and it turns out it wasnt them   yeah thats a problem with capital punishment though but when you got people that you know uh for some reason or another Charles Manson sticks in my brain   right yeah yeah well he was a   i seen him on an interview talking about how if he ever got out how many people he was going to kill   yeah sheesh   and uh thats a man that should be put to death   and uh it it it just doesnt seem right that our tax money or somebodys tax money goes to keep him alive   yeah   you know he gets three meals a day and and he probably   thats more than some of the people out here who are out and out honest   right right thats right and hes probably living a lot better than some people who deserve a lot more and uh that does you know that does sort of you know but how you know its just so hard  its just so hard to to be fair and uh yeah i guess i wouldnt i wouldnt mind if all of a sudden he didnt exist any more uh   i uh i dont think anyone would miss him either   no no uh i you know i i think the same thing about people like Saddam Hussein   yeah   you know you know the jeez you know theyre just theyre just the scum of the earth and uh i just hate the idea that my tax money might go to support somebody like that   well as you can tell my two decided to come in here uh     now where where where area where are you from   what im in Denison   Denison oh okay every so often you get somebody whos in in uh California or or New York something   yeah i got some guy from San Francisco one night   yeah yeah   uh no you is talking about Saddam Hussein   yeah   i think it would be wrong for us to kill him for the Americans to kill him   i think youre right i dont think were i think were wed wed overstep our bounds if we went in and did that   i think the   though its awfully tempting   now if one of the Kurds im sure you know who they are   yep   if they went in and got him he wouldnt be a martyr whats the word martyr martyr martyr   martyr yeah   yeah i could see the word in my head i just couldnt pronounce it   yeah   uh but if we did it oh man   oh yeah the whole   theyd have him on a pedestal   well right now were in a delicate situation because weve got this weve for the first time were sort of aligned with a lot of these Arab countries   yeah thats what my husband keeps telling me see how you know um im just now getting into the world politics and all that   yeah   uh i guess i just too young to understand this or something   oh sure   uh but uh   its complicated   yeah well its getting easier to understand though you know plus my husband he was in the Navy for ten years so he uh when it comes to the military he kind of knows what hes talking about   oh right   i dont put every a hundred percent stock into what he says but       ill listen  and agree with what i think sounds right   right right yeah there and you know hes got that delicate balance right there and wed just be overstepping our bounds i think if we walked in and sort of took over   yeah well i think they uh the people there will take care of him now   yeah i just cant imagine that theyd let him rule any longer you know if if they had you know if they could do something about it i mean his own army is going to eventually turn on him because and and you see this has happened before in history you know that it just gets to a certain point where youre just not willing
