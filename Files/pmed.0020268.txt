                            Approximately  of the worlds population mostly living in the worlds poorest        countries is at risk of malaria In the tropical and subtropical regions of the world        malaria causes  million acute illnesses and at least  million deaths annually Ninety        percent of these deaths occur in Africa south of the Sahara mostly among young        children        To assess disease severity peripheral blood parasitemia is measured but this is only a        weak predictor of mortality in falciparum malaria In addition a microscopist is only able        to count the less pathogenic circulating stages of the parasite whereas the more        pathogenic parasitized erythrocytes sequestered in the capillaries and containing mature        parasites are not seen and therefore not counted However sequestered         Plasmodium falciparum parasites secrete Histidinerich protein         PfHRP which is liberated into the plasma at schizont rupture        In this months         PLoS Medicine  Arjen Dondorp and colleagues suggest that the plasma        concentration of this protein might provide a better estimate for the patients total        parasite biomass and therefore be a more accurate prognostic indicator than circulating        parasite load There is evidence to support this hypothesis A recent study by the same        team measured PfHRP in         P falciparum cultures and showed that approximately  of        PfHRP is liberated at schizont rupture and that the variation in the amount released is        limited        In the current study the researchers measured plasma PfHRP concentrations in         patients with varying severity of falciparum malaria and using a simple mathematical        model estimated the total body parasite biomass This value was compared with measures of        disease severity and outcome The developmental stage distribution of circulating        parasites which also provides information on the sequestered parasites was also evaluated        in relation to plasma PfHRP levels in these patients        The researchers found that the estimated geometric mean parasite burden was more than        six times higher in patients with severe malaria than in patients hospitalized without        signs of severe disease and was highest in patients who died Statistical analysis        revealed that the estimated total parasite biomass was clearly associated with disease        severity and outcome By contrast peripheral blood parasitemia and the number of        circulating parasites were not associated with disease outcome nor with other measures of        severity such as admission plasma lactate concentrations        The finding that sequestered parasite biomass is associated with disease severity fits        with current thinking that sequestration of erythrocytes containing the mature forms of the        parasite is the central pathological process in falciparum malaria        However the team noted there were several factors that might contribute to inaccuracies        in the model For example the amount of PfHRP secreted per parasite varies between        different parasite strains Also in high transmission areas where partial immunity        against the disease develops clearance of PfHRP might be increased in the presence of        antibodies against the protein in these areassuch as countries in subSaharan Africathe        model would thus underestimate the parasite burden and might need to be adapted further for        use        Despite these issues estimates of plasma PfHRP concentrations may be useful as a        research tool to stratify patients parasite loads say the authors They conclude that        quantitative measurements of plasma PfHRP in patients with falciparum malaria could be        used to estimate the total parasite biomass a parameter pivotal in the pathophysiology of        the disease and that this total parasite biomass is associated with clinical measures of        the severity of the disease
