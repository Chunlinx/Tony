                                 Who Framed Ronald Reagan            The consensus so far on Dutch A Memoir of Ronald Reagan is thatEdmund Morris the biographer who inserted a fictionalized version of himselfinto his work is just this side of insane and his publishers just that side ofexploitative and corrupt This strikes Culturebox as distinctly possible butshortsighted literarily speaking Not wanting to steal thunder from historianAlan Brinkley and Reagan biographer Dinesh DSouza who are scheduled to debatethe book in                   Slate                next week Culturebox wont defend what Morrishas writtenshe cant anyway having read only the Newsweekexcerptbut will lay out a few arguments for why he has in principle everyright to try to write this way but cant make it work             Just because Morris was driven to do what he did by desperation as hehas admitted in interviews doesnt mean it lacks legitimate precedent Thehistory of literary biography is like a yoyoone century it careers toward thefacts the next it swings away from them It has ever been thus at least sincethe Greek mythologizer Plutarch published his Lives  and continues to bethus in the debates over footnotes etc between academic and journalisticbiographers today Culturebox thinks the outcry about Morris resembles thefuror over Bloomsbury biographer Lytton Strachey His masterwork was EminentVictorians  a collection of brief revisionist essays about great men andwomen of the th century that contributed no new facts but rather amocking spin on existing ones  In a time of twotome biographies his wereshort and to the point which has a lot to do with his popularity His moreenduring innovation though was as one historian has put it liberating thebiographer from the enslavement of data Stracheys most controversial libertycame at the end of a later biography of Queen Victoria in which he madehimself free to enter her mind as she died                           She herself as she lay blind and silent seemed to those who watched her tobe divested of all thinkingto have glided already unawares into oblivionYet perhaps in the secret chambers of consciousness she had her thoughtstoo Perhaps her fading mind called up once more the shadows of the past tofloat before it and retraced for the last time the vanished visions of thatlong historypassing back and back through the cloud of years to older andever older memoriesto the spring woods at Osborne so full of primroses forLord Beaconsfieldto Lord Palmerstons queer clothes and high demeanour andAlberts face under the green lamp and Alberts first stag at Balmoral andAlbert in his blue and silver uniform and the Baron coming in through adoorway and Lord M dreaming at Windsor with the rooks cawing in theelmtrees and the Archbishop of Canterbury on his knees in the dawn and theold Kings turkeycock ejaculations and Uncle Leopolds soft voice atClaremont and Lehzen with the globes and her mothers feathers sweeping downtowards her and a great old repeaterwatch of her fathers in its tortoiseshell case and a yellow rug and some friendly flounces of sprigged muslinand the trees and the grass at Kensington                         Interpolations such as Stracheys above have become commonplace No onecomplains about the tiny fictionalizations that abound in almost everybiography written today including Morris own earlier awardwinning biographyThe Rise of Theodore Roosevelt  For instance Culturebox spotted twobits of fantasy on the very first page The scene being set is that of a WhiteHouse reception for the public on New Years Day                            A shiver of excitement strikes the line of people waiting fourbreastoutside Theodore Roosevelts front gate and runs in serpentine reflex alongPennsylvania Avenue as far as Seventeenth Street before whipping south anddissipating itself over half a mile a way The shiver is accompanied by amurmur The Presidents on his way downstairs               There is some shifting of feet but no eager pushing forward                        Was this based on known fact Did Morris have documentation for a snakelikequiver rushing through the crowd or for its footshuffling Lets face it Hespeculated and we let him get away with it because his writing has the ringof truth In the Newsweek excerpt of Dutch  there are manysimilar tours de force  some imaginatively construed as celebrityquestionandanswer interviews Morris with Nancy others set inside somecharacters head             In short literary biography in our time is more literature thanbiographywe believe it if its wellimagined Acting on that truth andplaying around with form is anything but a moral shortcoming Inventingfictional characters as Morris has done in Dutch  howeverclever as itisseems doomed to fail as a literary device Mainly its intrusiveIt destroys the illusion of transparency In theater one would say it callsattention to the fourth wall the proscenium framing the play Even inStracheys and the earlier Morris wildest speculations they hewed to animplied contract between reader and biographer that states Well go alongwith you as long as you make what you say sound like it had some basis onceupon a time in verifiable or even plausible fact The Edmund Morris who isReagans childhood chum is neither a verifiable nor a plausible fact hes ahypothetical Hes the Roger Rabbit of biography a cartoon figure insertedinto Reagans more straightforwardly filmed movie He may not be less true thanthe  little fabrications and selfinventions in which Reagan specialized infact given Morriss greater levels of alertness and perspicuity hisselfinventions are probably more true The problem is theyre like theanthropological definition of garbage matter out of place
