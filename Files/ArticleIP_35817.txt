                                  The Real American Love Story            The PBS broadcast last month of An American LoveStory a hour film about an interracial familyspawned a great deal ofchatter to the effect that mixedrace couplings were the wave of the future Infact they are the wave of the past Interracial marriages accounted for only percent of all marriages in the Current Population Survey of  a gainof only twotenths of a percent over  and the number of mixed couplingsactually decreased slightly in  The census pattern suggests that slightlymore interracial couples will fall into each others arms in the coming yearsbut that there will be nothing resembling a dramatic acceleration of marriageacross the color line            But America already has almost  years of racemixing behind it beginning with that first slave ship that sailed intoJamestown harbor carrying slaves who were already pregnant by members of thecrew Americans have grudgingly accepted the fact that sex between masters andslaves such as Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings was frequent leading to amanyhued race of people who do not look African at all even though they callthemselves AfricanAmerican Outside of recent African immigrants to theUnited States there are virtually no black Americans of purely Africandescent which is to say no black people who lack white ancestry left in thiscountry            Four centuries of racemixing have had a similar impact on Americans who define themselves as whiteConvincing estimates show that by  about one in five white Americans hadsome African ancestry This inheritance most often arrived at the bedroom doorin the form of a fairskinned black person who had slipped over the color lineto live as white Put another way most Americans with African blood in theirveins think of themselves as white and conduct themselves as suchand checkwhite when they fill out census forms            How did so much black blood get into so many whitepeople Consider the story behind the  case of Loving vs Virginia in which the Supreme Court overturned laws in  states that forbade blackpeople and white people to marry Richard Loving was white and Mildred Jeterwas black In  weeks after the two were married the Caroline Countysheriff dragged them from their marriage bed and jailed them for the crime ofbeing married The Lovings were then exiled from Virginia under pain ofimprisonment In banishing the couple from the Old Dominion the CarolineCounty judge said from the bench Almighty God created the races whiteblack yellow Malay and red and placed them on separate continents and butfor the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for suchmarriages The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intendthe races to mix            This statement would havebeen ludicrous anyplace but was especially laughable in Caroline Countyand inthe Lovings hometown of Central Point which had been an epicenter of racemixing for at least  years There were many such centers in the South Incities such as Charleston SC and New Orleans for example white familiesand their fairskinned black relatives lived so close together that they bumpedinto each other on the street Mixedrace people were initially treated as anew people who existed in the space between white and black and deserved astatus not quite as high as whites but higher than that of black people ingeneral This special status began to dry up just before the Civil War andevaporated when slavery ended and free blacks competed with whites for jobs andpolitical power White Southerners became obsessed with drawing an impossibleline that would preserve white racial purityanother way of referring towhite political dominance The onedrop rule defined as black anyone who hadany black ancestry at all even if that ancestry was invisible to the naked eyeor in the genealogical record Those who fell on the black side of the lawoften lost the rights to vote to hold highstatus jobs and to defend theirpersons and property in the courts            The revocation of special mulatto rights accelerated thepractice of passing for white Central Point was locally known as the passingcapital of the world Passing for white was so common there that a section ofCentral Point had actually been named Passing Some Central Pointers livedas negroes at home but crossed the line to seize white privileges just an houror two away in Richmond Va Local children were often taken for white duringexcursions to nearby towns where they shopped in stores that did not serveblacks and were admitted to the white only sections of movie houses            Having learned therewards of whiteness early these children grew up moved away and continuedthe charade Those who entered the armed forces which were segregated until were often classified as white and attached to allwhite units This madefor dicey moments when brownskinned classmates from Central Point turned up inallblack units Some of these former classmates kept the secret but a fewexposed the passers as frauds Neither Britain nor France had laws that forbadeinterracial marriage and people in those countries had no clue what the Yankswere going on about when they argued over who was really white or really blackTo the French and the British race was defined by what you looked like If youlooked white well then you were            Back in Caroline County soldiers who were passing weresure to travel home alone to prevent their white buddies from knowing who andwhat they were The passers from Passing married white spouses moved intowhite jobs took up residence in white neighborhoods When the couples returnedto Central Point to visit the town went along with the masquerade Familiesditched brownskinned friends and relatives and children stayed out of schoolto avoid being seen on the colored bus headed to the colored school Principalsand teachers stuck to the script One of them told Ebony magazine in that blacks in Central Point had infiltrated the white race more than anyother group of Negroes When a student plays hooky from school for a week andsays an inlaw is visiting the family we understand The kids just cantafford to catch the Negro school bus without giving away the racialidentity            This infiltration wascommon not just in Virginia but all over the United States The mostinteresting document listed in the amicus briefs for Loving vs Virginiais a statistical study called African Ancestry of the White AmericanPopulation by Robert Stuckert a sociologist and anthropologist from OhioState University Stuckerts statistical models are tough going buteyeopening for what they show Simply put he examined census and fertilitydata to arrive at estimates of how many white Americans had African blood linesand how many fairskinned blacks had crossed over the line to live as whiteStuckerts tables show that during the s alone roughly  fairskinnedblacks per year slipped across the color lineabout  for the decadeStuckert estimates that by  about  percent of the whitesor about million of the  million persons classified as white in the censushadblack ancestry within the last four generations He predicted that theproportion would only grow in the coming decades The belief that onesancestors are racially uniform is a basic American fiction Stuckert wrotebut a fiction nonetheless
