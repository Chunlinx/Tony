                                 Sickbed Populism            A mere six months ago BigTobacco stood astride the American political scene the colossus of evil Everypublic interest group despised it Every Democratic politician railed againstit Its public approval ratings trailed Linda Tripps Its politicalcontributions were tainted But then something funny happened on the way to theballot box Democrats found themselves a new boogeyman to replace the tobaccobarons The Dems new merchants of death health maintenance organizationbureaucrats            The campaigns vilification of HMOs marks the culmination of a remarkable andspeedy collapse of the industrys image Just five years ago HMOs were thegolden children of the busted healthcare industry imposing the cost controlsand efficiencies everyone agreed the system needed But during this summer andfall Democratic candidates have had a field day telling HMO horror storiesHMO has become a synonym for heartlessness and windfall profit and politicalcontributions by health insurers are blood money            In the Missouri senate race for example a Democratic TVad declared that Republican incumbent Kit Bond would let insurance companybureaucrats make your medical decisions because he had accepted  fromthe insurance industry An ad tarred Illinois Republican gubernatorialcandidate George Ryan for accepting contributions from exactly those HMOs thatare charging us more while providing us less Arizona Democrat Paul Johnsonran ads saying that incumbent Republican Gov Jane Hull has taken tens ofthousands of dollars from HMOs and big insurance companies and then steadfastlyrefused to impose any meaningful reforms on an industry that is clearly out ofcontrol In North Carolina Georgia Wisconsin Kentucky Texas FloridaOhio and elsewhere Democrats have anchored their campaigns to HMO reform anddepicted opponents as shills for the health insurance industry The issue isthe key to almost every race Im involved in says one Democraticpollster            As apurely political matter health insurance populism seems all upside forDemocrats Americans always worry about health care and they are especiallyfretful about managed care HMOs have new rules that they have not adjusted toand dont much like and the industry has its share of profiteering shystersHMOs are still an experiment Americans have not yet decided if we like havingforprofit corporations controlling our medical care            The pop culture a leading political indicatoris full of HMO bashing Audiences at last years movie As Good as ItGets burst into applause at the linevoiced by the mother of a sickchildFucking HMO bastards Pieces of shit HMO horror stories have spreadwidely and rapidly drivethrough baby deliveries the experimentalchemotherapy denied to a child with cancer the accountant who proposedpermitting cataract patients to have surgery on only one eye because you needonly one eye to see Consumers for Quality Care an antiHMO group even picksan HMO Casualty of the Day            All this is fertile soil forDemocrats Republicans in the Senate after all did just kill arelatively modest HMO reform bill Republicans are in the pockets ofthe HMO and insurance industries Senate Majority Leader Trent Lotts officetold health insurance executives to get off your wallets And they didforking over millions to the GOP this election cycle And Democrats proposedreforms are not elaborate and not unreasonable the right to sue your HMO theright to appeal denial of treatment no gag rules for doctors and easieremergency room access One survey showed that  percent of Americans supportsuch changes and  percent would favor a candidate who supports them            Democratic HMO bashing is also an unexpected windfall from the defeat ofClintons  health plan Under the Clinton plan there would have been tacitrationing limits on service and more rules about doctor visitsexactly thekind of bureaucratization and handcuffing of doctors that Americans so deplorein HMOs Killing the plan has backfired on the GOP Had Republicans letClintons plan go forward they would now be the ones campaigning againstbureaucratic medicine and telling nightmares about Clinton Care Insteadmanaged care went private the Democrats get to inveigh against it and theRepublicans are absorbing all the blame            Despite its political logic this vilification of HMOs is adismaying manifestation of two common illnesses of American politics The firstis SomethingforNothingism Democrats have seized the HMO issue this fallbecause it is classic entitlement politics Americans are understandablyambivalent about health insurance When your child gets sick you naturallydespise the frugality that made your HMO so attractive when you subscribedAmericans wantno expect health care to be both infinite and cheapWe should have everything paid for by someone else who shall remain namelessDemocrats by pushing regulation without acknowledging its costs are feedingthis impossible expectation SomethingforNothingism is of course theguiding philosophy of almost all politics There is no reason health careshould be an exception            Aprincipled Republican response to the Democratic antiHMO campaignand aresponse that a few Republicans are actually makingis to say OK if youwant to have the right to sue your HMO you are going to have accept xpercent higher premiums and thats going to price y thousand customersout of the health insurance market But most Republicans who are as willingto pander as the next guy heck more willing are afraid to fight on themerits Instead they are countering one boogeyman with another claiming thatvoters should reject antiHMO Dems because they are beholden to trial lawyersThis is too bad because a fight on the merits is exactly the way Americanscould make an informed decision about how much HMO regulation they want            The antiHMO strategy is also evidence of thepernicious influence of Anecdotal Politics The benefits of managed care areunremarkable and undramatic lower premiums more preventive care But itscosts are visible and awful denial of and delays in care The resultDemocratic candidates have terrible tales to tell and Republicans have nothingto reply with            A  Henry J KaiserFamily Foundation survey found that Americans in managed care plans arebasically content with their own care But they are more worried about thefuture than those in feeforservice plans Why Largely because they haveheard so many alarming tales about HMOs Never mind that no hard evidenceexists that American health care has actually deteriorated under managedcare            This is why managed care isa genuinely confusing issue Should voters believe the anecdotes whichare real and horrifying or should they accept the evidence that peopleare mostly happy with their own insurance happy to be paying less and ashealthy as they have ever been Both parties in the  campaign offer an easyanswer to that question The difficulty for voters is that neither answer iscompletely right and neither is completely wrong
