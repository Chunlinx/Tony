                      Hong Kong and        Its People        Exciting mysterious glamorousthese words have described        Hong Kong for at least a century With its vibrant atmosphere and        nightandday activity it is an intoxicating place Hong Kong is        crowdedit has one of the worlds greatest population densities But        it is also efficient with one of the best transportation systems        anywhere and for such a crowded place quietyou dont hear voices        raised in anger motorists sitting on their horns or loud boomboxes        Shopping never endstheres always another inviting spot just down        the street Youll find Hong Kong easy to get around the people        helpful English spoken everywhere and food that lives up to its        reputation        On  July  the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong        reverted to Chinese sovereignty as a Special Administrative Region of        the Peoples Republic of China Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist        enclave with its laws and rights intact and China has promised that        Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least  years        Beijings announced policy of maintaining Hong Kongs prosperity and        stability makes sense Hong Kong has long been Chinas handiest window        on the West and the city is unrivaled in its commercial knowhow and        managerial expertise Around the time of the transition there was much        speculation about how things would change But in fact once news of        the handover vanished from the front pages the people of Hong Kong        returned to their usual topics of conversation the economy and the        price of housing        The impression of the visitor today will be that very little        has changed Establishments are no longer called Royal Queen        Elizabeth has vanished from the coinage and the Union Jack has been        replaced by the flag of China and the new Hong Kong flag with its        bauhinia flower But in fact there have been changes many of them due        to economic progress new construction and other factors that        influence cities all over the world        Others are more subtle British social customs are still        evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long        lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour The British population        has decreased today there are as many American and Australian expats        as there are British        With a population of nearly eight million and a total area        of just over  square km  square miles housing is one of Hong        Kongs perennial nightmares To alleviate the problem the government        has become the citys major landlord with the construction of massive        apartment blocks that though they have every modern facility average        only  square m  square ft in size Whole cities have been created        in the New Territories although the unimaginative architecture of        these towns has been criticized        Of Hong Kongs population  percent are Chinese The        majority are Cantonese born in Hong Kong or from South China but        there are immigrants from all over China The Chinese people have been        described as hardworking and pragmatic attitudes that have contributed        to Hong Kongs success There are many stories of refugees who arrived        with nothing in their pockets set up a small sidewalk stall worked        diligently until they had their own store and then expanded it into a        modest chain        Old customs are still followed Fate and luck are taken very        seriously and astrologers and fortunetellers do a steady business        Before a skyscraper can be built a feng shui see page         investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building        will promote health harmony and prosperity Youll also notice that        gambling is a passion whether it be cards mahjong
