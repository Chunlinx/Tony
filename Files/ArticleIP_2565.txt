                                 A Klutz at the Ballet            After  years of writingabout the budget I have become bored with the subject and have been lookingfor a more emotionally satisfying interest It may seem bizarre but I havefound one such interest in watching ballet at home on my VCR I call thatbizarre because I cannot dance a step One of my most anguished memories is oftrying to propel an unfortunate female classmate around the floor at the MohawkCountry Club during the senior prom of Schenectady High School I did notimprove much with time although I did find a more agreeable partner            Despitethat or perhaps because of thatpsychologists always have two optionsI havelong been fascinated by dance In college I participated in an essay contestthat required entrants to use a nom de plume I chose Bojangles the nicknameof Bill Robinson the famous movie and stage tap dancer I mention that partlyto show that my interest did not always and only lie in longlegged girls intutus            Ifirst became aware of ballet at the University of ChicagoOne of my first dates with the young woman who was to be my wife took us toLes Sylphides downtown in the Loop For  years thereafter the balletremained an occasional diversion Only recently whenas I have notedboredomwith the budget and indeed with economic policy in general left a vacuum atthe forefront of my consciousness did ballet come in to fill it I am by nostretch of the imagination an expert I am writing only to indicate whatpleasure the ballet now readily available on videotape has given this klutzand to suggest that others like me might also get pleasure from it            Ballet mayhave special appeal these days because it is a relief from the verbalcommunication in which we are all drowning It is like music in that respectMusic may have a more transcendental spiritual quality But ballet has moreof scene of form and of movement for many people ballet offers more byway of food for the mind than music does            I am going to focus first on Swan Lake It is the most popular ballet of all time and probably the easiest toappreciate Also I happen to have on tape two versions of Swan Lake one featuring Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev  and one with the KirovBallet             Bothversions are characterized by a complete fusion of the music and the dance Themusic is simple clear tuneful and rhythmic It seems to compel the dance asif the particular steps danced to each note and bar were inevitable and anyother steps would be wrong Listening one getsor at least I gettheimprobable feeling that the music is so compelling that if I were on stageand heard it I too would do that dance Yet as natural and inevitable as itseems the dance is also absolutely incredible It is unbelievable that anyonecould do what those dancers are doing That applies not only to the obviouslyspectacular leaps and spins but also to the precise placement of the feet whenwalking slowly and of the body when seated            Everyone knows the story of Swan Lake  It was summedup in the comment of a little old lady why is it always a little old lady andnever a big young man who after seeing it said So he fell in love with aduck So what could come of it To amplify just a little Odette is abeautiful maiden trapped in the body of a swan She can be freed only bysomeone who will love her forever Prince Siegfried promises her that love buthe is seduced into betraying that promise by the beautiful but not so niceOdile Dire consequences loom            The two versions I havediffered in the degree to which they emphasized the story The Kirov versionat least the one I saw was a vaudeville in which discrete and stunningdance performances are hung on the thread of the story It was staged before alive audience that repeatedly broke into applause to which the stars respondedwith bows That of course interrupted the story It also took the stars outof their charactersSiegfried out of his soulsickness Odette out of herheartbreak and Odile out of her seductiveness Moreover the principals whiletheir dancing was brilliant hadnt really tried to be soulsickenedheartbroken or seductive The problem was particularly serious for Siegfriedwho in the first act seemed a happygolucky fellow with no apparent reason tospurn the beautiful women of the court and go out hunting a mirage            TheFonteynNureyev version on the other hand emphasized the story with all its The show slimmed the story down considerably with some of the mostspectacular parts being cut There was no audience no applause nointerruptions no bows in the middle of the story Nureyev who was  at thetime looked the anguished searching youth that the story requires Fonteynportrayed clearly in her facial expressions and arm movements the contrastingcharacters of Odette and Odile            Both versions are wonderful In a sense youget more ballet for your money in the Kirov version But you get more emotionin the FonteynNureyev version            My recentinterest in ballet has opened my eyes to a newer style that I used to findunattractive and incomprehensible It is less athletic and acrobatic than theolder more romantic ballets What there is in the way of stylized leapsspins and balancing on the toes comes out as the natural expression ofexceptionally graceful human beings and not as a demonstration of what someclever windup toys can do            The main reaction to the older ballets is Wow How cananyone do that The newer ballets do not elicit that response At first sightthey look easy although further observation shows how precise and disciplinedthe movements are The newer ballets aim for more universal and fundamentalemotions than amazementfor a sense of beauty or joy or love or sorrow            How those emotions aregenerated I cannot explain But I can give two illustrations both from balletsby George Balanchine that I have on tape The Prodigal Son is an oldstory But the performance by Mikhail Baryshnikov and others is so vigorousand stark that it seems new And at the end when Baryshnikov throws himselfinto the arms of his father who wraps him in his prayer shawl one gets apowerful sense of the goodness of man and God The other example isChaconne  starring Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins If there is astory there I dont get it However the dancing seems so free andspontaneous and yet so precise and with such commitment between the partnersthat one is left with a feeling of joy in life that I cannot associate with anyother form of art            I realize I am gushing Thatis the way new and naive enthusiasts are I also realize that ballet may not beeveryones cup of tea But if you are sick of watching Clinton and Gingrichwaltz around you might try Fonteyn and Nureyev or Farrell and Martins
