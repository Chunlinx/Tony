                                 The DaimlerChrysler Collision            In the wake of DaimlerBenzAGs  billion acquisition of Chrysler Corp simply the latest in what hasbecome an unending series of massive mergers it seems increasingly likely thatthis is all the fault of that ad campaign for Godzilla  Tell peopleoften enough that size matters and look what happens Feel free to insertyour favorite Viagra joke here At this rate itll be the Fortune  beforetoo long But each of those  companies will offer a full range of financialinstruments car models and computer chips Itll be just like Korea onlybetter            Actually thats far tooharsh a verdict on the new DaimlerChrysler particularly since DaimlerBenz hasspent the last four years shedding noncore businesses and refocusing itsenergies on automobiles which now account for  percent of its revenues Inaddition as Ive pointed out here before the auto industry is facing severeproblems with excess capacity so reducing the number of players in the globalmarketplace may decrease the chance of dramatic overbuilding Finally unlikethe CiticorpTravelers deal Daimler and Chrysler will not try to mergefundamentally different product lines in an elusive quest for super marketglory Economies of scale do exist in capitalintensive industries which meansthere are opportunities for companies to be simultaneously bigger and moreefficient            Stillits not clear those conditions will exist in DaimlerChrysler At first glancein fact it looks as if DaimlerBenz got taken That may seem an oddconclusion when you consider that Chrysler is both more profitable thanDaimlerearning  billion last year on  billion in sales where Daimlerearned  billion on  billion in salesand vastly more efficient IfDaimler is adding all the resources of a low cost lean manufacturingpowerhouse to its already impressive collection of assets how can it begetting the raw end of the deal            In the first place as impressive as Chryslers comebackfrom the debacle of the late s and from the disastrous later years of LeeIacoccas reign was the company is hardly the jewel of American manufacturingthat last weeks press accounts made it out to be Last year the companysearnings slid by  percent while GMs and Fords both rose and its USmarket share is just  percent And while Chryslers Jeep and SUV lines areexcellent it doesnt make a single passenger car of note aside from thelimitedrelease Dodge Viper and Prowler            Chryslerdefinitely did a brilliant job of reinventing itself in the early s takingadvantage of the fact that it operated taxfree until  because ofcarryover losses to streamline its operations and rework its design andmanufacturing processes It also slashed payrolls cutting the whitecollarwork force in half and the bluecollar work force by almost a quarter As aresult it halved the number of vehicles it had to sell every year to breakeven More recently Chryslers toughlove approach has given its partssuppliers a financial incentive to cut costswith resulting savings toChrysler of  billion since  But how all this is really relevant toDaimlerBenz remains somewhat unclear            Daimler is not after all getting Chrysler atno cost Rather Daimler will be payingdepending upon what its own stockprice doessomething like  billion more for Chrysler than the stock markethad thought Chrysler was worth Thats a huge premium and in exchange for itDaimler must be expecting to receive more than just the opportunity to includeChryslers sales with its own It must be expecting synergy            Certainlysynergy is the word on the lips and the word processors of everyone who hascommented on the deal But not all these commentators seem to understand whatsynergy means For instance theres very little overlap between the productlines of the two companies Chrysler sells SUVs minivans trucks andmassmarket cars Mercedes sells luxury sedans and sports cars This doesntmean synergy is automatic All it means is that the two companies arecomplementary that there are no redundancies And while DaimlerChrysler willbe able to offer cars to the full spectrum of buyers the current lack ofoverlap also means there arent any easy cost savings to be found byeliminating duplication It also means the deals effect on the overcapacityproblem will be negligible unless you believe Daimler is going to cut back onproduction of its Eclass sedans because its also making the Dodge Neon            To repeat a point made here too many times before synergyoccurs only when two companies together can make and market products moreefficiently than they were able to do apart Daimler is going to have to beable to make and sell more Mercedes more cheaply because it has acquiredChrysler and vice versa for the deal to make sense And with a  billionpremium the deal has to make an awful lot of sense            FromChryslers angle the possible synergies are fairly obvious Chrysler gets percent of its sales from North America Daimler will give it immediate entryinto the European market and presumably some of the Daimler cachet will ruboff on Chrysler abroad Daimlers cars feature safety innovations that Chryslerwill be able to incorporate into its vehicles and most intriguingly Daimlerhas been a pioneer in fuelcell technology which means that Chrysler willimmediately become the dominant American player in developingnoncombustionengine cars            But what will Daimler get Chryslers expertisein frontwheeldrive engineering will be a nice addition although it hardlyseems likely that Mercedes is suddenly going to abandon rearwheel drive Andthere is the hope that Chryslers lean manufacturing style will help Daimlershake up a company that is still heavy with layers of middle managementChrysler makes four times as many cars as Daimler with fewer than half theworkers and although there are good reasons for thisluxury cars require morelabor Daimler is diversified into other laborintensive businessesmuch ofthe difference does stem from Daimlers bureaucratic approach The addition ofChrysler may help change that approach but how remains to be seen Chryslerselaborate system of dealerships might in theory help Mercedes crack the USmarket where its share is now less than  percent But as Daimler recognizesselling Mercedes through Chrysler dealerswith all the memories of the Volareand KCarcould damage the cars treasured cachet            DaimlerChrysler willprobably be big enough to run harder bargains with suppliers although theresno real evidence that Ford or GM has enjoyed huge cost savings on parts becauseof their size The new company may also benefit from merging warehousing andinventory management and ideally there will be joint production of componentsthat both companies use But size brings disadvantages as well as benefits andnever more so than when its the result of crossnational mergers If being thebiggest company was a guarantee of success wed all be using IBM computers anddriving GM cars DaimlerBenz and Chrysler were great companies on their ownproductive and profitable making quality cars that people wanted to buy Nowtheyre risking that present for an Ozymandian future at the cost of billionsof dollars Size matters but sometimes for all the wrong reasons
