        okay um i guess um       this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess   oh really what kinds of things have you done   but um um well ive made a lot of baby gifts  it seem like thats like especially lately theres been so many babies  that uh bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings   aha   um   do you ever keep any of your stuff   isnt that funny no   i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that and i have very little of my own stuff and its kind of embarrassing people say let me see some of your work         oh well can you go to so and sos house   yeah  isnt that funny i guess i do have one thing friend of mine gave me a clock kit and i i needlepointed the face   yes ooh   and i uh kept that because she gave me that so   that that would be definitely something youd want to keep was was the whole face done or just the numbers and and like minute   oh yeah and its real neat   marks   um  basically the whole well no i guess the minute marks but the minute marks are done theyre like hearts   oh   and then the at the numbers they theyre kind of outlined and stuff it it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too i really like doing stuff like that so   i did some needlepoint years ago and then i got into the Bargello   oh whats that   well its an Italian um needlework using using the uh i started to say the canvas but the uh hum the what kind of cloth uses that i ive just gone blank but its used with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth   huh   and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture youre making a design like a geometric or whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them   wow thats interesting what did you what kind of things did you do   what i did when i was doing that was mostly pillows you know for sofas and so forth and   uhhuh   i cant find one that ive done it its one of those things i didnt i didnt give them away but i didnt know if its been my color choice or multiple moves   oh yeah   or or what and it i was so proud of them when i  got them finished       but i have no idea where they are   what did you call that   bargello its B A R G E double L O   huh thats ive never heard of that before ive probably seen it though i mean when you described it   i suspect you i suspect you have   yeah i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess but ive never heard of it before and its really interesting um i guess ive decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but ive kind of gotten out of that i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows   me too yeah thats interesting   really thats yeah it is   how did you know to choose this subject tonight thats funny uh       how did you what kinds of decorations did you use with the baskets how were you decorating the baskets   oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons um i really wanted to do you know so many of them now have the ribbons where im not sure how they do it but the ribbons   um   they make them they like i dont know how to explain it they make them hard you know   like fabric thats been stiffened in yes   yeah ive never done that and those are so neat i mean i would really like to do those but   ive seen some and there there they i suspect theyre fairly simple because the one lady ive seen i know that does it ive never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of like six   um   and and theyre all a handful so its got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly   oh definitely yeah   when i do um crochet its usually the lacy Victorian type   oh   things like that and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture its like white glue and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i dont know i was just theres bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that thats very similar thats not going to melt too much with uh   oh yeah   uh high humidity   thats i think thats what my concern was was it really sure and how they would how they would last   in in a room do you know what my concern is how will i dust this thing  im terrible   youre right no thats true thats funny   so many of my crafts well right now im looking at a little uh quilted uh uh hanging its like its a flag and i dont want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but its such a dust collector to be   yeah   out and so forth and most of my things are dust collectors  uh and i hate to dust so first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean     oh i know   thats funny  no i just um i have really gotten out of it i dont do it quite as much as i used to um i guess because i i went back to school so i dont have as much time   oh you dont have time   now and i have two children also  so that it keeps me very busy but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance you know its really   you definitely dont have time   its so relaxing to just sit and but once i get started i cant put it down i just   that i have a similar problem ive got to have time or i dont even want to get into it in the first place   uhhuh uhhuh   and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all   i know i started a project its been over a year ago  that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for Christmas and i   you just didnt say which Christmas right   thats what i keep telling this person well i didnt tell you what year             what was this project   um well its a its uh cross stitch and its a picture and its a wildlife it has deer and trees and its really beautiful but its going to be a lot of work and you know ive i have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as id like to you know its just so hard   now this is done in the needlepoint   uhhuh well i shouldnt its counted cross stitch actually is what im doing and so its really since its counted you know its really a lot of work  yep   yes yes i do know i have done a little bit of that but ive decided that thats something that demands my time my my total attention   uhhuh   and so ive got to have total almost total silence i cant really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like youd have lots of shading on that particular piece it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish   uhhuh yep no it really isnt and i tell you really  i could just kick myself for even  starting it because i have a feeling im never going to get it done im probably going to hear about it the rest of my life     oh im sure youll get it done but it just may not of the original obviously not of the original time schedule     no thats true i i just dont know when im ever it just seems like theres just never enough time to pick it up and do it you know its just really hard but i really do en like i said i really enjoy it when i do its just hard   just hard finding the time that can be dedicated to that   uhhuh and theres theres so many other things that i i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts ive made a lot of bibs and wall hangings and so you know those dont take much time at all so its no big deal for me to pick those up and do them   do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns or do you go out an buy a a kit like for a bib or something like that   no no i usually just buy a pattern book i have several pattern books and i just go with those   okay   and then i buy the bibs separate usually i think its a little bit cheaper in the long run and then i just use whatever colors i want to i dont usually use the colors they tell me to and it it depends on what it is you know but some things especially letters   um   if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to yeah i yeah   thats what i would do too   yeah   or whatever i have thats   theres yeah theres a few designs i guess ive done myself but not very many  real simple ones you know i do ive made i made a little uh little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny   ooh   it was really easy i mean just just did a thumb print you know   what what with ink oh okay   uhhuh and then see i didnt cross stitch the actual thumb print you know that was just the ink and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth that was so simple and it just it didnt take anything at all   oh that sounds really neat did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink okay so you just   uhhuh   just like being finger printed   and then i just
