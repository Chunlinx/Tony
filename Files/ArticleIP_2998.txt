                                 Hong Kong Phooey            The Union Jack came downThe band played God Save the Queen one last timealthough given theoccasion the American lyrics My Country Tis of Thee seemed moreappropriate Prince Charles looked suitably dour boarded Britannia  anddeparted Hong Kong He shall not return            No onethrows a ceremony like the British but did the coverage of the July handover have to be so breathless Will the return of Hong Kong to Chinareally be remembered as one of the great events of the  th centuryA month later the event already seems forgotten The death of colonialismshould be ranked among humanitys greatest accomplishments of the waningcentury but the hard work was done at the end of World War IIan event thatseems secure in its place in the history books even though Peter Jenningswasnt there to report it            In this atmosphere of hyperbole Paul Therouxs KowloonTong A Novel of Hong Kong takes a refreshingly smallscale approach Thenovel is an unabashed attempt to capitalize on the hype surrounding thehandover but it succeeds by steadfastly refusing to indulge in majestyInstead of princes and beefeaters Theroux gives us a circumscribed tale aboutthe fleecing of a dysfunctional British family by an unscrupulous businessmanfrom mainland China It is a tonic for the cloying coverage of the eventitself            I admit tohaving been suspicious of Kowloon Tong  a novel prepared for an eventrather than responding to it The publishing world is fond of anniversariesbut the notion of creating a novel to commemorate an event before it happensseems especially fishy Great novels are topical only in a subtler and grandersense Imagine if Herman Melvilles seafaring adventure of  had focused onthe first Americas Cup race that year or if F Scott Fitzgerald hadimplicated Gatsby in the Teapot Dome scandal            To my surprise however Kowloon Tongworks because the match of author and subject is so good Though born inAmerica Theroux is a passionate dissector of the British character havingspent  years living in London Theroux finds the British most hilarious whenindulging in the rituals of empire dark comedy and absurdity he calls itHe also delights in exploring the limits of the British stiff upper liprelishing opportunities to see what indignities a subject of the queen cansuffer and still say mustnt grumble And while Theroux has never been notedfor his celebration of the milk of human kindnessat his worst he is sounrelentingly peeved with others that one wonders why he bothered to writeabout themhe does have an eye for the differences among people and amongpeoples and a shrewd understanding of the irrational annoyance thosedifferences provoke            The HongKong handover creates the ideal subject for Theroux Clashes of race andpolitics are exacerbated by the emotional intensity of a deadline that everyonethinks historical though for different reasons Therouxs own sympathy lieswith those who fled Communist China but are being denied a chance to rulethemselves in Hong Kong In case his fiction leaves any ambiguity Therouxspelled out his support for the Hong Kong democrats in a recent NewYorker article            It is impossible not to see Kowloon Tong as anallegory The book focuses on Neville Bunt Mullard and his mother Betty theowners of a stitching plant on the eve of the handover Bunts brand ofcapitalism is played by the outdated rules of imperialism He spends his daysin Hong Kongs blue hotels making daily deliberately mysterious appearanceson the factory floor in order to encourage productivity Bunt is unprepared forthe ruthless capitalism of Mr Hung a Peoples Liberation Army officer whoappears in Bunts club to make him an offer for the factory he simply cannotrefuse Bunt struck by a belated attachment to his native Hong Kong falls inlove with an employee named Meiping When Bunt and Meiping begin to raiseuncomfortable questions about Hungs connection to a murder Hung decides hemust drive Bunt from the colony altogether                         As Therouxdescribes Bunts speculations about Hungs guilt he succumbs to the urge topreach The evidence was not in the room the evidence was missingthat starkneatness was the proof that a bloody crime had been committed The same wastrue of China The look of the apartment was the spare look of China a placethat had been scoured and simplified by chaosupheaval terror mass murderwar Hong Kong had a peaceable clutter just an accumulation of worn oroutofdate things like a massive attic Happily however labored metaphorslike this are few and the politics serve more as a backdrop than as amessage            In fact Therouxs sympathy for the Hong KongChinese is what gives Kowloon Tong a moral center often absent from hiswork Meiping Bunts employee and lover suffers at the hands of both theoutgoing British masters and incoming Chinese without her Hungs takeover ofImperial Stitching might have seemed a victimless crime The otherwiserepellent Bunt is redeemed by his somewhat ridiculous infatuation withMeiping and the at times heavyhanded tale of the factory sale gives way to amore interesting story a love triangle of sorts among Bunt Meiping andBunts mother Betty            Bunt and Betty are amemorable pair Bunt is named for an elder brother who died in infancy andboth Betty and Bunt seem to feel that he is only a standin for hispredecessor At  Bunt remains a toddler in his mothers eyes and he too isdisturbingly comfortable in the relationship Each evening Betty waits up forher son aware of his vain attempts to create a secret life for himself withHong Kongs prostitutes When he was late and his mother stood waiting in thedoorway she always seemed to swell filling the doorframe to obstruct anddelay him so that she could bulk against his approaching face and scold him She had the pathetic aggression of a wife or motherto Bunt there was nodifference            It soon becomes clear thatit is not Hungs connivance thats driving Bunt out of the factory and intoexile but Bettys will She hears the sum offered for the factory and refusesto allow Bunts concern about the future of the business or his burgeoningromance with Meiping to stand in the way of her plan to return to England andlive in comfortable solitude with him This chilling story of a motherscrushing love for a son will haunt me long after Ive forgotten the details ofthe handover ceremony
