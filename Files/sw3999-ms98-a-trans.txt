                well Barbara whenever you get around to purchasing your next new car what are going to be the chief considerations   one of the main considerations is safety and quietness and um economy what about you   uh im interested primarily in reliability uh   well i have found most of the cars now are pretty reliable um i havent found any that have left me down yet what are your specific requirements American or foreign   well well uh let me give you a little history on that i drove i drove uh GM cars for a long time and in fact i had a a Chevrolet and it ended up costing it was only about five or six years old and i was paying on the average a hundred dollars a month in repair bills on that thing and i just couldnt handle that so i took a deep breath and bought a Toyota and have lived happily ever after since then yes yes ive had two small problems neither one of which left me by the side of the road   really   uh with the Toyota in the last five years and and when i was buying that i was concerned primarily with reliability reliability and but i also wanted a hatchback because you know you you sometimes you have to carry bags of fertilizer   umhum   uh so well it is a sports car that i got which is my first probably my last one because comfort is not       high on the list when you get a sports car   do you have a family for comfort or   no   just you   just me   well i had the same problem whenever i had a General Motors car i had a Chevy and uh   just me   it was constantly giving me valve problems i had this constant ticking of the valves and uh i switched over to Chrysler Plymouth and i havent had a lick of problem   does your car have an air bag   yes   it does   but just on the drivers side   yeah   i wish they would come out with them everywhere on the passenger side too   yeah i suspect they probably will and i think on my next car ill be concerned ill i think i will want antilock brakes ive heard good things about them it was the first year it was offered on the Toyota Supra when i bought mine   uhhuh   and i was a little nervous about some new technology i mean id got to where i had real this real hate relationship with anything that looked like service department at a dealership     well i found out theyre pretty good whenever uh especially on weather like were having today and and uh the roads are so slippery   umhum   the antilock brakes are one of the better ones to have   yeah yeah i think id id like that i dont know i i have a friend who drives an Acura Legend which is very comfortable car   umhum   and it it makes me more aware of how uncomfortable mine is every time i ride in his car   my daughter has a Civic Honda and thats a real comfortable car to sit in yeah which surprised me   uhhuh oh is it uhhuh yeah   i have a Chrysler now i just bought and uh its real comfortable and im very happy with it but Chrysler has a good warranty that they have to stand behind so i havent had any worries about that thats one thing i go for in a car is their warranty and uh what does and doesnt come under that warrantee but they have the seven thousand uh seven thousand seventy thousand miles or seven years i believe   yes uhhuh   and uh bumper to bumper and i have no complaints   well thats great   so far with mine   thats great so if you had to do it again youd buy another Chrysler do you think would you   i sure would Dodge Plymouth Chrysler something in that line   thats yeah thats interesting because i mean i i was hearing a just on on the way home from work the other day i heard something on the news about the trade deficit for December the figures were some some very large number   umhum   i was thinking golly and and you know its partly my fault i mean not in December but       i i really have a problem buying Japanese things and for years i bought American and i dont know i hope by the time this car wears out and i hope thats not for another five or ten years   well   i hope that i can get an American one at that time   well thats another fallacy because uh so many people say thats a requirement has to be American but uh did you know that my Chrysler has foreign parts in it and so does Chevy and so does Ford   oh sure it yeah   so um i often hear people saying well i want to buy American or i like the foreign something and uh theyre built right here like the foreign cars are even built over here Datsun has a
