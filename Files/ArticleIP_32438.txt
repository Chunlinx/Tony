                                 Go to Hell            In his current                   Slate                 column DavidGreenberg compares George W Bush and John Quincy Adams John Qas he was notknownis the only presidents son so far to become president himselfHistorian Greenberg finds many parallels but some differences For example Qsuffered a lifelong case of clinical depression whereas W has come tobelieve that all Jews are bound for hell While the parallel is unclearthese are certainly two different things As someone who has based oncircumstantial evidence such as his bar mitzvah I found this latter datumespecially interesting And of course it is remarkable to learn that GeorgeW has actual opinions on any subject let alone strong and controversialones            Unless youre a political junkie or live in Texasyou may have missed this story The press have reported it but not with theneurotic intensity you might expect Why not Conservative press critics oftencomplain that the media ignore the importance of religion This may be a casein point though not one those critics are likely to complain about Secondthere is the inoculation phenomenon Once a story has been done editors andproducers dont want to do it again So getting it done small is protectionagainst finding it done big Finally there may be a feeling among journaliststhat the whole things a bum rap Which it is and it isnt            Theres no evidence thatGeorge W is an antiSemite After college he was even engaged briefly to ahalfJewish woman Some have suggested that Bush may have dumped her becauseher father was Jewish but theres no reason to think he didnt know that allalong if he cared so the episode weighs in against the antiSemitism chargenot for it Bush has had many Jewish business partners and friends If hebelieves theyre all going to hell he hasnt held it against them in thislife            So what does he believe Like the Gospel tales themselvesthe story of Bushs views on Jews has several variants In  discussing hisdecision around age  to accept Christ as his personal savior Bush told aHouston Post reporter thatas the reporter paraphrased itheaven isopen only to those who accept Jesus Christ So at worst Bush never condemnedJews specifically to hell specifically but rather condemned most of humanityanyone who doesnt accept Christ to what may be depending on your point ofview a wider geographical area anywhere outside heaven Im not sure ifthats better or worse            Heres where the gospelsdiffer According to Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard  Bush says hismother then called Billy Graham to straighten him out Graham advised him tonever play God by ruling on who gets into heaven But according to Sam HoweVerhovek of the New York Times  Bush says Grahams intervention occurredearlier during an informal theological discussion at the Bush Sr White HouseAnd according to Ken Herman of the Austin AmericanStatesman  Bushactually made his  comment in the course of recounting the Graham episodeIn this version the evangelists advice was slightly different Grahamgenerally agreed with the theory but cautioned against spending much timeworrying about it Bush said            So where does this leave us If Billy Graham actuallyconvinced Bush long beforehand that we dont know who gets into heaven thenthe Houston Post report of  was flatout wrong and Bush didntbelieve Jews were shut out of heaven even at the time But Bush has neverdenied the accuracy of the reporters paraphrase Nor needless to say has headopted Version  of Grahams advice by declaring that Jews wont get intoheaven but hes too busy to care Bush now answers all questions on thesubject of heaven and its admission requirements with this catechisticformulation It is not the governors role to decide who goes to heaven Ibelieve that God decides who goes to heaven not George W Bush            This wont do Im afraid It was good enough toget him a kosher certification from the AntiDefamation League but it makes nosense No one is asking Bush to decide or rule on who gets into heaven Wecan stipulate that God decides Some peoplemost Jews for examplebelievein God but not in heaven Few if any people believe in heaven but not inGod The issue is whether God has an admissions policy that excludes Jews andwhether George W has an opinion about what that policy might be            Surely he does Myfaith tells me that acceptance of Jesus Christ as my savior is my salvationand I believe that Bush says Does he think that this principle only appliesto him Does he think that its possible for others to achieve salvationwithout accepting Christ Even nonrecruiting religions such as Judaism claim tobe more than just a personal taste or preference Bornagain Christianityclaims to be the right answer to the most fundamental questions So how canJews possibly get into heaven without converting Only two ways that I can seeOne is if God allows exemptions But to avoid offending any religious ornonreligious group the exception would have to be that anyone who does notaccept Christ need not accept Christ which would destroy the rule The otherway out would be if the entire belief system permits doubt about itselfforexample if its only  that accepting Christ is mandatory for salvationfor anybody including George W himself Neither of these conditions appliesto George Ws faith as he describes it            And so what Why should anyone care whether he or she willachieve salvation by the terms of someone elses religion What difference doesit make if you cant get into a heaven you dont believe in As a nonbelieverI find the conventions of ecumenism baffling I dont want to tell you peoplehow to run your religions And obviously we want to avoid an outbreak ofreligious war or even lesser forms of intolerance if possible But why doestolerance require people to pretend they dont believe what they do Wouldnttolerance be easier if it only required agreement to disagree peacefully ratherthan demanding actual sharing of religious doctrines at some level ofabstraction After all if Bush really believes that accepting Jesus is theonly path to salvation he is pulling a pretty dirty trick on Jews by tellingthem otherwise Putting votes before souls Talk about politicalexpediency            George W is lying eitherwhen he professes his faith or when he denies its implications Or he hasntreally thought it through which itself would cast doubt on the depth of hisfaith But I doubt this particular dishonesty will keep him out of heavensince it is imposed on every politicianand even every clergyman withambitions            To be sure there is a certain joy in watching a pol caughtin pandering gridlock Bush plays up his bornagain faith to the religiousright He uses it even more than bona fide Christianright pols do as FredBarnes points out in order to allay suspicions that he may be moderate orindifferent on social issues Then he has to fudge his faith so that people whodont share it wont take it seriously            And if he gets this balancing act wrong he mustpander even more furiously to make it up Going for a twofer a couple of yearsago Bush confided to Washington political columnist Andrew Glass that heenjoys hanging out with country music singer can you guess well obviously Kinky Friedman who wrote uhoh They Aint Making Jews Like JesusAnymore  Does W agree with this sentiment Does he have some problem withthe quality of Jews being produced in America today
