              United Way Picture of Central Indiana  N Meridian St PO Box       Indianapolis IN       Cecilia desperately searched for medical care for her unborn child      She would have a better chance of getting help and delivering a healthy      baby if she lived in Sweden But Cecilia lives in central Indiana      Cecilia might even be your neighbor      Dear      When I found out that the infant mortality rate in Indiana was       percent greater than for mothers in Sweden I was shocked      Later my distress hit home in a personal way when I discovered than      an expectant mother who lived just a few blocks from my house in Marion      County  a young unmarried woman just like Cecilia  had difficulty      obtaining prenatal care      Realizing the seriousness of the problem helped motivate me to join      with individuals like you who have helped to prevent needless suffering      in our community by contributing to United Way of Central Indiana      When a young unmarried woman like Cecilia becomes pregnant the risks      to her unborn child are very serious In Cecilias case she had to face      the situation with a limited education no skills and no source of      income Would it surprise you to learn that less than two years away from      the millennium the problem of supplying prenatal care to young single      mothers is one of growing concern in our community      Of those beginning prenatal care in the first trimester Indiana      mothers rank in the lower third of individuals receiving such care      nationwide And thats just one significant example of community need      There are many other important areas where children families the      elderly and disabled need our help      Having exhausted all of her options Cecilia turned to her family      priest where she found support and guidance Cecilia was brought to a      residential outreach maternity service funded by United Way of Central      Indiana When I investigated all the different ways I could get involved      to help local families I discovered the answer that made the most sense      was United Way of Central Indiana      United Way and ONLY United Way regularly conducts research in our      community to find out where the most important needs are If United Way      didnt do this it wouldnt be done at all At St Elizabeths home      Cecilia received a place to live until her baby was born She received      prenatal care child care training friendship and peer group      support      Your past contribution provided a direct line of support for local      programs that promote health and wellness strengthen families invest in      our children help people become selfsufficient and serve the elderly      and disabled      Cecilia gave birth to a healthy baby boy Whenever she looks at her      son she feels grateful to United Way for the good start she was able to      give him      And thats why Im writing to you today I urge you to continue to      make a difference in the lives of individuals like Cecilia and her son      You can literally help save a life  percent of the atrisk pregnant      women served by St Elizabeth Home have given birth to healthy      babies      Following the birth of her child Cecilia received job training at      another United Way funded agency This story ended happily perhaps      because of your past contribution Remember just  or  per month      can provide a homeless expectant mother with two visits to an      obstetrician for Prenatal care      Thanks to the support United Way of Central Indiana receives from      people like you there are hundreds of stories like Cecilias But      unfortunately there are also hundreds of examples where vital services      were not available because of lack of funds      Please continue with your neighbors to see to it that no expectant      mother goes without medical care no child goes without nourishment       no family goes without shelter      Will you help Today      If you would consider increasing your past pledge by just  this      year it would be wonderful If you could possibly increase your pledge by      even more I would be overjoyed But please join us again this year so      that stories such as Cecilias can continue      Sincerely       United Way of Central Indiana Campaign Chair      PS Today Cecilia is selfsupporting She lives with her month old      son in a clean cheerful home Without the support of United Way of      Central Indiana Cecilias story might not have had such a happy ending      Please join with us to see that happy endings do continue
