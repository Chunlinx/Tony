                                 Pharmaceutical Realism            Slate ran an itemabout Gabriel Garca Mrquezs News of a Kidnapping a couple of weeksago reporting a general puzzlement among reviewers Some reviewers were saidto have regretted the unmagicness of the books realism and the sobriety of itsprose style Someone else was said to have deplored a lack of moral firmness inGarca Mrquezs portrait of Pablo Escobar the Medellin drug lord But thosereactions as summarized in Slate dont do justice to the book                           Newsof a Kidnapping is a genuinely masterful work in its fieldthough thefield is journalism not fiction which may surprise readers but shouldntGarca Mrquez began his career as a newspaper reporter not as a novelist andhe has written journalism from time to time ever since Kidnapping is an oldtheme of his Years ago he composed a screenplay described as acinematographic narrative about a reallife mass kidnapping of members ofthe Nicaraguan elite by the leftist Sandinista guerrillas in  during thetime of the Somoza dictatorship The screenplay was never filmed so far as Iknow but came out in book form under the title Viva Sandino or in alater edition El Asalto  There you could already see the elements thatmake up News of a Kidnapping  a social background of violence andinjustice the United States hovering in the distance a hostage situation Butthe screenplay about Nicaragua presented these elements as a simple Marxistfablethe contemptible elite kidnap victims the loathsome US imperialiststhe heroic revolutionary kidnappers            Nothing so simple appears in News of a Kidnapping The author says very little about the United States apart from noting that atthe beginning of the s when the book takes place the US wanted toextradite Colombian drug lords to American prisons The  kidnapvictimsseized on Pablo Escobars orders for the purpose of pressuring thegovernment of Colombia not to extradite anyoneare presented as whollyadmirable As for Escobar himself Garca Mrquez offers a portrait that isauthentically scary            The mostunsettling and dangerous aspect of his personality was his total inability todistinguish between good and evil Garca Mrquez tells us in one of his onlydirect commentaries on his own cast of characters He shows us the consequencesof this particular inability toothe murdered presidential candidates themassacres in the Colombian streets the hundreds of murdered policemen But wedo also see the social reality behind Escobar and his drug empire which makesfor a complicating factor We meet the young hit men who guarded the kidnapvictims and odors of fatalism superstition and barbarism waft upward fromthe page in an unmistakable indication that we are in the presence of thegrimmest poverty            Escobar claimed to have been conducting a waron behalf of the Colombian slums avenging the brutality of the police withstill more brutality of his own and we can see that in a perverse way he didfeel something of a righteous indignation He managed even to demand that theColombian press publish a humanrights report by Americas Watch which was awonderfully bizarre demand for a crime chief to make And with details likethat Garca Mrquezs narrative of the kidnapping the sequestering of thevictims in their different safe houses the efforts by the husband of one ofthe victims to get the president of Colombia sympathetically involved thedrawnout negotiations the months of incarceration a killing then anotherthe intervention of a halfmad television priest the release of the survivorsand at last the surrender of Escobar himselfthis tale like a tropicaldownpour conjures up a brilliant leafygreen Latin Americanness At least itdoes in the original Spanishlanguage text In English the leafy green comesout a bit less leafy due to the traumas of translation            Translations are always faulty and the present one by Edith Grossman isdoubtless better than most Still there are passages that while perfectlyclear in the Spanishlanguage original reemerge in translation as pointlesslyobscure The kidnap victim whom we get to know best is a prizewinningjournalist named Maruja Pachn about whom Garca Mrquez says in the Englishtranslation In the bloom of her early thirties she had married in theCatholic Church at the age of nineteen and had given her husband fivechildren But in Garca Mrquez had merely written much more simply She wasin the flower of her thirties she had been married by the Catholic Church atnineteen and she had given her husband five children And of mangled passageslike thatnow translated with too much freedom now too literallyis to coverGarca Mrquezs text with a thin almost invisible varnish of strangenesswhich is exactly what the author never meant to have happen            For if there is a deep theme in News of aKidnapping  it is the same as in some of his other writings the theme of anarrow remote provincial life quaint and familiar as it feels in the Spanishoriginal in which the quaintness has somehow blossomed into somethinghorrific That is exactly how we are meant to see Escobaras a bit ofColombian local color except intensified a thousandfold to the point ofmonstrosity A primitive among provincials A man whose defective moral senseincluded a grotesquely exaggerated loyalty to a limited number of people in hisown family and in the slums A man with a fortune of  billion dollars whostill could not figure out how to live outside his own country away from thepeople trying to hunt him down A cornered beast terrorized andterrorizing            Garca Mrquez tells us atthe start of the book that writing News of a Kidnapping was the saddestand most difficult task of his life But apart from that and a playful wave atus at the end How incredible says Maruja in the last line Somebody shouldwrite a book nothing in the narrative draws attention to the author or tohis way of telling the story This too must disappoint readers looking forthe pleasures of an intricately constructed novel News of a Kidnappingis about real events however and not about imaginationnot even about ajournalists imagination By the last chapter I understood Garca MrquezsColombia a lot better I understood something about the drug wars But nevermind what I understoodmy hair was standing on end It was because withoutever breaking the rules of hardfact journalism Garca Mrquez had given me anexperience of fear of death
