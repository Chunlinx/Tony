                                 Still Waters            Visitors to the Monet inthe  th Century exhibition in Boston are in for a surpriseespecially if they arrive in one of the museums pastel shuttle buses deckedwith water lilies as if it had been dredged from a swamp There areMonetinspired munchies to sample and a gift shop crammed with the inevitableGivernyanaeverything for the fantasy gardener except bulbs All thissoftfocus packaging conveys the popular image of Claude Monet  asthe painter of weekend pleasures puttering around in his aqueous garden andfilling his canvases with sunlit lilies reflected in the pink and blue waterarococo Fragonard or Boucher marooned in the early  th century            Then you enter theexhibition itself and a different Monet takes over This one is a boldexperimentalist way ahead of his time A huge blowup of a of the man in hisgarden towers over the entryway Imperious Monet his legs buried in thewisteria covering his Japanese bridge looks like the proprietor of sometropical plantation His eyes shaded by a Panama hat and a full white WaltWhitman beard pointing to the water he seems to be saying This is myterrain Enter at your own risk            The timing of this lavishshow which includes some paintings never before exhibited could hardly bebetter Just as the art world is revving up for the Jackson Pollockextravaganza at the Museum of Modern Art in November its good to be remindedjust how far along the line of abstraction and monumentality Monet had traveledby the end of his long life As these late canvases wash over you with theirgreat swaths of paint you can immediately see why Clement Greenberg writingduring the late s spoke of the rehabilitation of Monet and why the mostadvanced of advanced painters Greenberg names no names wereenthusiastically rediscovering him            Actually as Michael Lejapoints out in an interesting catalog essay theres little evidence thatAbstract Expressionists such as Pollock and Mark Rothko had much interest inMonet Nor did Monet need Pollocks validationor Greenbergs for thatmatter But its true that by the s when MoMA purchased one of Monetsboldest big panel paintings which later burned in storage Monet was nolonger viewed as merely a safe painter of pretty suburban sights            In a sense Monet had beentorn between pleasing the crowds and taking risks all his life Born in into a family of modest means he lacked the financial security net ofaristocrats such as Degas Manet and Berthe Morisot He always had one eye onthe market finding a motifgardens beaches cathedralsthat would sell andmaking multiple versions of it He pretended that he did all his work outsideand on the spot when actually he sketched rapidly in paint then carefullyfinished his canvases in his studio He even used photographs on occasionfurtively and was furious when he was caught in the act in London while addingdetails to his series of pictures of the Houses of Parliament Monet everrespectful of his audience and potential buyers never indulged in the harshjokes of his urbane contemporaries He was happy to disguise his first wife asa geisha in a painting hanging elsewhere at the Museum of Fine Arts butthere are no prostitutes dressed up as odalisques in his work no probings intothe murky secret lives of Parisians            And yet Monet was in hisway as unyielding and uncompromising as any of his contemporaries Never muchinterested in the human figure he kept the Impressionist faith of showing theeffects of changing light on landscape One of his early pictures hisImpression Sunrise of  gave the movement its name A couple ofLondon views in the Boston show with orange sun setting in the fog over theThames closely resemble that painting            Monet turned  in  andhe was finally his own man Building on the huge success of his seriespaintings of the sthe cathedrals and haystacks now awkwardly renamedgrainstacks and rows of poplarsMonet could afford to paint for himselfalone He still kept track of the market though In the opening roomsespecially there are highly finished paintings of London bridges painted fromMonets luxury suite at the Savoy andin a glorious sunlit corridorviews ofVenice An early cluster of smallish water lily paintings two on circularcanvases that Monet exhibited in Paris in  are almost saccharine in theirplacid beauty visual equivalents of some of Debussys prettier preludes            But shadows were beginningto intrude In  Monets second wife Alice died of leukemia a yearlater he learned that he had cataracts in  Monets son Jean died Underthe weight of these shocks Monet took some time off from painting thenannounced a bold new shift in his work toward huge decorative panels Duringthe last decade of his life working incessantly in the new whitewalled andhighceilinged at Giverny resembling a SoHo loft built specifically to housethese enormous canvases he turned out paintings by turns ominous terrifyingsublime In calligraphic studies such as  we feel like weve plungeda few hundred feet below the surface into a midnight realm of Medusas andcolorful anemones A strange human skull seems entangled in the reflectedweeping willow branches scrawled at the lower left Such paintings which Monetnever intended for exhibition prefigure to a remarkable degree the work of themost gestural Abstract Expressionists such as De Kooning            The title of the Boston showhas a double meaning the work Monet created during the  thcentury and his work in relation to the various Modernist movements of the th century While inviting comparison with New York art during thes the show also insists on Monets involvement with contemporary Frenchhistory Several years ago the MFA devoted an exhibition to Monets seriespaintings of the s Paul Tucker guest curator of that show and the currentone made a convincing argument that Monet was celebrating the great motifs ofthe French nation her land her agriculture her religion and herarchitecture            Then came the DreyfusAffair and Monets faith in French nationalism was shattered A passionateDreyfusard Monet supported his friend Zola in his defense of the French armyofficer falsely accused of passing secrets to the Germans Henceforth asTucker sees it Monet searched for a more private and less jingoistic tie tothe French landscape and discovered it in the multiple layers of his own watergarden Like Melvilles Ishmael who noted that meditation and water arewedded for ever Monet found that all his moods found echoes in the reflectedweeping willows and tangled lilies During World War I as he conveyedvegetables to the troops quartered nearby and refused to leave Giverny as theGerman line advanced Monets panels took on some of the dark mood of war Atwars end he arranged to contribute some of his panels as a sort of victorymonument to the nationthe gift that eventually became the glorious circularwater lily chapel at the Orangerie in Paris            How terrible it is to reachthe end of ones life Monet had written in  after the death of thelandscapist Alfred Sisley Intimations of his own mortality turned out to bepremature As his fellow Impressionists died one after the otherPissarro in Czanne in  Degas in  Renoir in Monet ended up onceagain like Ishmael at the end of MobyDick  Now I am the lastsurvivor of the group he sighed He was the last Impressionist but he alsotraveled the farthest pushing the limits of landscape until he broke rightthrough them
