        do you have a particular attitude about public education     okay well i have one child thats in public schools now i have three children that went to a private school and then we put them into public school system and i think we did them a big disservice by putting them in public schools   hm   um i think that they my child now is in public school and were getting ready to put her into a private school because of it i just dont feel like theyre theyre getting enough out of it you know for   academic   yes yes i just dont think that academically theyre and the school systems here is supposed to be really good they have i dont know if youre familiar but Texas has uh oil money that finances their school system you know there theres no state taxes paid here   uhhuh oh i didnt know   so the money from the taxes from the oil go to pay go towards the schools and running of the schools so theyre supposed to have a really good program but uh i dont know i just feel like my daughters are in college now and the last three years their life they went to public school and they made straight As and theyre really struggling in college now   hm   and uh i think that it has a lot to do with it i dont i dont i dont know where where you can fix it  you know what you need   well apparently in your state theres more incentive to send your child to public uh to a private school because in New York you pay taxes for public schools and then if you wanna send your child to private school you pay again   yes well you do that here too you pay higher uh property taxes for the area that youre living in depending on the schools and the area youre in     oh okay i got i got the impression you said the oil money paid for the schools so   no it it supplements the schools that for therefore theres no state income tax that goes towards uh the school systems   ah uhhuh   because of that you know because of that but the property taxes that you have on your home depending on what area you are you know like theyre higher in certain areas than they are in other areas you know but uh   sure right i dont i dont have any experience myself with private schools so i really cant say theyre better i did go to public schools and what im finding um right now i have two kids and im going back to work and im substitute teaching in public schools   umhum   and what i see in the high school is i dont know that its public private i think times have changed i mean i know that i would never not do my homework because lightning would strike me something terrible would happen   umhum umhum exactly yeah   but nowadays the kids dont do their work and they have the nerve to say to you so what are you gonna do and youre not gonna do anything   exactly well theres no disciplinary actions you know that can be done taken against them at all yeah   but you yeah i think the most important thing that a public school can do to help the problem is to to maybe go backwards in some ways um i find the teachers trying to be like the kids uh telling their kids i teach art and theyll go yeah thats cool well maybe they should talk like grownups and the kids should learn to act like grownups instead of the grownups trying to act like the kids to get their acceptance i find the teachers are very concerned about being liked   being friendly being friends with the kids   being being friends with them and you know they dont wanna be so strict they dont wanna be so hard on them and i find that the kids are not turning in quality work because theres nothing to impress upon them that they better   uhhuh right right   and you know the kids   i think that thats right i think i think a lot of that right there and and i think that thats where you come into the private schools the private schools have more power you know i mean because in public schools these people really dont have any authority to do anything or to really punish these kids in any way i mean they cant even hardly give them detention you know without   well maybe theyll make them   having to call their parents and have their parents come in and all this kind of stuff i mean it really is a major thing   well you know yeah well maybe theyll make them stay home for a day but thats no torture for a kid   no really exactly yeah to stay home is like oh yeah     yeah and i know kids if they you know if theyre late enough often enough they get a letter home and they get to the mail box before their parents because their parents work so you know its not a problem and i find that you know   uhhuh umhum they send oh because they send the report cards and and failing notices and stuff home in the mail   um yeah well they they sent me yes thats true it progress reports   progress reports well see up in Oklahoma now they do that but here they dont do that they give these progress reports to these kids my son is a senior and he failed a class this last six weeks and im like Kevin how could but he didnt even tell me you know and so i called the school im like i didnt even know that he had was failing this class and their like but we sent the progress report home with him well you think hes gonna give it to me i mean is he  you think hes he may be failing a class but hes not an idiot   oh sure they yeah they never have homework they always did it in school i have a fourteen year old son who is just getting into you know realizing that he can dupe me i think     right right i know i   but i i think the the public school its not that the teachers are inferior or that the materials are inferior i think whats going on is that the teachers have to be backed up when the kids dont do what theyre supposed to do um the teachers have to have some way to   well they have to have parental support the parents have got   they need the parental
