               my TV down okay im sorry   uh invasions of privacy um what most annoys me are all sorts of   umhum   phone calls trying to to sell me things   umhum   all all sorts of hours calling and   umhum   especially with it being that i want investment advice that i want this service or that service or the other thing   yes and i hate those  canned messages they put on my recorder   um my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congress and not clear just what went into the even the final will i think it does something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers   umhum   i guess in some cases they just consider pickup your your phone and and and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not   umhum   um  but i thought i saw something about having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial use and and uh and uh people businesses would be prohibited uh from calling for purposes for purposes of of selling you things im sure thats true   i have through the phone company um  no nine hundred numbers can be dialed  from my phone or received   ah  something i probably should do too i think i think government can do that now is that right   umhum   and uh especially with with possibly children around um that could could be useful protection   umhum right yes and i dont have children around but i just dont like those nine hundred numbers so ive excluded those   yeah uh   but isnt it does not stop you from the uh dialing services   i should do that what are dialing services   where they uh intend to sell you things   oh oh where people just  just call you   umhum umhum and leave again that canned message on the   um yes what another problem that has been eliminated those problems used to be when i used a credit card   umhum   theyd want to have my phone number   umhum   and i did not like giving it out or even give out my work number   right   but i think im not sure if its by law or just otherwise i think the practice has basically been eliminated of asking for a phone number   well thats the thing i hated too about uh Radio Shack if you go in and buy anything they want your phone number   how did Radio Shack work   and i dont think theyre gonna call me and ask me how its functioning and and i dont give that out i have an unlisted number so i dont   yes thats thats thats one solution but you you you nonetheless often get get people calling you   sir   despite the fact that your number is unlisted   umhum   and you believe they actually have your number or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours   well  anything that you buy   umhum   um you can you may get put on a a uh preferred list that is purchased   umhum   and and companies can purchase this list and what that is is people who buy from the mail   yeah and they so whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers   umhum   um i dont particularly mind the addresses um is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number   uh not not really um no uh  that unfortunately is legal so they cant stop people from uh uh advertising and that and thats what it falls under it falls under the guise of advertising so i dont care for it but it is a legal uh uh solution for some companies so but thats the way things are   uhhuh yeah i i dont know i think its gotten much worse the last few years   umhum umhum   maybe thats just because ive gotten on more lists   well they you know thats thats the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy youve got the holy rollers and youve got uh all kinds of people knocking on your door   yep   um who want to uh either direct you to the right path or or or want to uh sell you uh paper routes uh whatever so um you know its not just the phone telephone   yeah sell you magazines uhhuh i guess for whatever reason i guess we just dont get
