                                 The Gold Bug Variations            The legend of King Midas hasbeen generally misunderstood Most people think the curse that turnedeverything the old miser touched into gold leaving him unable to eat or drinkwas a lesson in the perils of avarice But Midas true sin was his failure tounderstand monetary economics What the gods were really telling him is thatgold is just a metal If it sometimes seems to be more that is only becausesociety has found it convenient to use gold as a medium of exchangea bridgebetween other truly desirable objects There are other possible mediums ofexchange and it is silly to imagine that this pretty but only moderatelyuseful substance has some irreplaceable significance            But thereare many peoplenearly all of them ardent conservativeswho reject thatlesson While Jack Kemp Steve Forbes and Wall Street Journal editorRobert Bartley are best known for their promotion of supplyside economicsthey are equally dedicated to the belief that the key to prosperity is a returnto the gold standard which John Maynard Keynes pronounced a barbarous relicmore than  years ago With any luck these latterday Midases will never laya finger on actual monetary policy Nonetheless these are influentialpeoplethey are one of the factions now struggling for the Republican Partyssouland the passionate arguments they make for a gold standard are a usefulwindow on how they think            There is a case to be made for a return to the goldstandard It is not a very good case and most sensible economists reject itbut the idea is not completely crazy On the other hand the ideas of ourmodern gold bugs are completely crazy Their belief in gold is it turnsout not pragmatic but mystical            Thecurrent world monetary system assigns no special role to gold indeed theFederal Reserve is not obliged to tie the dollar to anything It can print asmuch or as little money as it deems appropriate There are powerful advantagesto such an unconstrained system Above all the Fed is free to respond toactual or threatened recessions by pumping in money To take only one examplethat flexibility is the reason the stock market crash of which startedout every bit as frightening as that of did not cause a slump in the realeconomy            While a freely floating national money hasadvantages however it also has risks For one thing it can createuncertainties for international traders and investors Over the past fiveyears the dollar has been worth as much as  yen and as little as  Thecosts of this volatility are hard to measure partly because sophisticatedfinancial markets allow businesses to hedge much of that risk but they mustbe significant Furthermore a system that leaves monetary managers free to dogood also leaves them free to be irresponsibleand in some countries theyhave been quick to take the opportunity That is why countries with a historyof runaway inflation like Argentina often come to the conclusion thatmonetary independence is a poisoned chalice Argentine law now requires thatone peso be worth exactly one US dollar and that every peso in circulationbe backed by a dollar in reserves            So thereis no obvious answer to the question of whether or not to tie a nationscurrency to some external standard By establishing a fixed rate of exchangebetween currenciesor even adopting a common currencynations can eliminatethe uncertainties of fluctuating exchange rates and a country with a historyof irresponsible policies may be able to gain credibility by association TheItalian government wants to join a European Monetary Union largely because ithopes to refinance its massive debts at German interest rates On the otherhand what happens if two nations have joined their currencies and one findsitself experiencing an inflationary boom while the other is in a deflationaryrecession This is exactly what happened to Europe in the early s whenwestern Germany boomed while the rest of Europe slid into doubledigitunemployment Then the monetary policy that is appropriate for one is exactlywrong for the other These ambiguities explain why economists are divided overthe wisdom of Europes attempt to create a common currency I personally thinkthat it will lead on average to somewhat higher European unemployment ratesbut many sensible economists disagree            So where does gold enter the picture            While somemodern nations have chosen with reasonable justification to renounce theirmonetary autonomy in favor of some external standard the standard they choosethese days is always the currency of another presumably more responsiblenation Argentina seeks salvation from the dollar Italy from the deutschemark But the men and women who run the Fed and even those who run the GermanBundesbank are mere mortals who may yet succumb to the temptations of theprinting press Why not ensure monetary virtue by trusting not in the wisdom ofmen but in an objective standard Why not emulate our greatgrandfathers andtie our currencies to gold            Very feweconomists think this would be a good idea The argument against it is one ofpragmatism not principle First a gold standard would have all thedisadvantages of any system of rigidly fixed exchange ratesand eveneconomists who are enthusiastic about a common European currency generallythink that fixing the European currency to the dollar or yen would be going toofar Second and crucially gold is not a stable standard when measuredin terms of other goods and services On the contrary it is a commodity whoseprice is constantly buffeted by shifts in supply and demand that have nothingto do with the needs of the world economyby changes for example indentistry            The United States abandoned its policy ofstabilizing gold prices back in  Since then the price of gold hasincreased roughly tenfold while consumer prices have increased about percent If we had tried to keep the price of gold from rising this would haverequired a massive decline in the prices of practically everythingelsedeflation on a scale not seen since the Depression This doesnt soundlike a particularly good idea            So whyare Jack Kemp the Wall                Street                Journal  and so on sofixated on gold I did not fully understand their position until I read arecent letter to of all places the leftwing magazine Mother               Jones from Jude Wanniskione of the founders of supplyside economicsand its reigning guru One of the many comicopera touches in the lateunlamented Dole campaign was the constant struggle between Jack Kemp who triedincessantly to give Wanniski a key role and the sensible economists who triedto keep him out Wanniskis main concern was to deny that the rich have gottenricher in recent decades his letter is posted on the Mother               Jones Web site and makes interesting reading            But particularly noteworthy was the following passage                           First let us get ouraccounting unit squared away To measure anything in the floating paper dollarwill get us nowhere We must convert all wealth into the measure employed bymankind for  years ie ounces of gold On this measure the Dow Jonesindustrial average of  today is only  percent of the DJIA of  yearsago when it hit  Back then gold was  per ounce Today it isplus This is another way of saying that in the last  years the peoplewho owned America have lost  percent of their wealth held in the form ofequity  If you owned no part of corporate America  years ago because youwere poor you lost nothing If you owned lots of it you lost your shirt inthe general inflation                        Never mind the question ofwhether the Dow Jones industrial average is the proper measure of how well therich are doing What is fascinating about this passage is that Wanniski regardsgold as the appropriate measure of wealth regardless of the quantity of othergoods and services that it can buy Since the dollar was delinked from gold in the Dow has risen about  percent while the prices of the goods weordinarily associate with the pursuit of happinessfood houses clothescars servantshave gone up only about  percent In terms of the ability tobuy almost anything except gold the purchasing power of the rich has soaredbut Wanniski insists that this is irrelevant because gold and only gold isthe true standard of value Wanniski in other words has committed the sin ofKing Midas He has forgotten that gold is only a metal and that its valuecomes only from the truly useful goods for which it can be exchanged            I wonder whether the godsread Slate If so they know what to do
