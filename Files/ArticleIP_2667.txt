                                 Of Course You Dont Like Your HMO            Given the increasingly angrycomplaints lodged against managedcare health plans by consumers youd thinkthat the plans would be losing business Instead managedcare enrollment isclimbing A study in this months Health Affairs explains why Bossesdecide what health plan you will have and more of them are deciding that youwill have managed care like it or not Besides explaining why competition andconsumer ire arent slowing the managedcare juggernaut these findings alsosuggest that tougher regulations are unlikely to make insurers serve patientsbetter            Managedcare programs which include healthmaintenance organizations andpreferredpractice organizations limit member patients to specific doctors andhospitals The goal of the plans of course is to hold costs down HMOs arethe most restrictive plans only covering patients who see their specified careproviders PPOs are the least restrictive offering coverage with minimalpayments if patients visit the plans doctors and with larger payments if theygo outside the network for care Only oldstyle indemnity insurance givespatients uniform coverage no matter where they go Nowadays HMOs account forcoverage of  percent of privately insured workersand that number is risingOnly a quarter of all workers have indemnity insurance            What patients hate about managedcare plans arecostcutting mandates that shorten hospital stays and doctor visits and make itdifficult for patients to see specialists No wonder popularity polls revealthat only tobacco companies rank lower than managedcare programsIncreasingly patients and their allies are seeking legislativeremediescurrently more than  bills that would regulate managedcareplans are pending in state legislatures  in California alone And early nextyear President Clinton will introduce his own legislative package            Typicallythe proposals loosen the restrictions Already in effect are new federal lawsrequiring all insurers to pay for twoday stays after uncomplicated childbirthand for fourday stays after Caesarean sections Many states are nowconsidering bills that would stipulate twoday stays after mastectomies directaccess to obstetriciangynecologists without a referral and automatic coveragefor almost any emergency visit            But what about hospital stays after heartsurgery or a stroke And after appendectomies prostate operations pneumoniaWe dont really want the government directing our care any more than we wantinsurers to Whats more piecemeal regulation is bound to fail If aninsurers priority is cheap health care it will find a thousand otherunpalatable ways to economize            Politicalconservatives and the managedcare industry argue that the market should be letalone to sort things out They believe that the managedcare backlash isfomented in irrationality The same consumers who whine about managed carerefuse to pay the extra cost of indemnity insurance In  average familycoverage costs under managed care were  and  under indemnity plansplus deductibles and copayments were usually higher too            But fewer workers are given that choice today according tothe Health Affairs study from consulting company KPMG Peat Marwick Thestudy found that  percent of small and mediumsized companies that giveworkers health benefits offer just one plan Fortyseven percent of largecompanies offer no choice of plan either Whats more employers areaggressively switching their workers to managed care In  smallercompanies gave few employees a choice but  percent offered indemnityinsurance Now only  percent offer indemnity Even the hospital where Ipractice medicine dropped its Blue Cross indemnity plan and now offers managedcare exclusively            Employersmainly pick insurers on the basis of price and often switch plans in pursuitof the lowest cost So we shouldnt be surprised that patients arent happy orthat insurers arent bending over backward to please them Employers are theconsumers in the healthcareinsurance marketplace not the patients Its likewhen your mother picked your clothes for you The only one happy with what yougot was your mother            Employers resist letting some workers pick moreexpensive plans and cover the extra costs themselves because most insurersinsist that companiesespecially small companiesdeliver all their employeesto the plan Also most employers would rather send one big check to theirinsurer each month than deal with the paperwork hassle of a bunch of differentinsurers            Lost inthe managedcare rumble is this question Why do employers provide healthinsurance in the first place After all they dont offer employees carinsurance Health insurance became a standard benefit during World War II Wageand price controls then in effect prevented employers from giving raises butbecause the government regarded health insurance as a taxfree benefitemployers used it to fatten compensation packages for workers If car insurancewere a taxfree benefit it wouldnt be surprising to find employers pickinglowcost insurers who make you visit preferred mechanics and skimp oncoverage for Land Rovers and minivans Angry consumers would complain aboutcheapo car care To appease consumers without upsetting the business lobbylegislators would probably require overnight stays after brake and lubejobs            The most straightforward way to put choices back intofamilies hands would be to sever the connection between health insurance andwork If health benefits were taxed as income people would promptly demandthat the cash be paid directly to them and that they be allowed to choose theirown insurance Insurers would then have to cater to their needs Short of thatradical change effective legislation should be passed to increase choices foremployees Some states have established insurancebuying groups that employerscan join These groups give workers a selection of plans and reduce paperworkhassles for employers Legislation could expand such groups Some suggest thatthe law require employers to offer both a managedcare plan and an indemnityplan as it did in the s when HMOs were first created            This week the presidentsadvisory commission drafting his consumerprotection proposals endorsed a hostof patients rights including the right to appeal mistreatment by insurersBut employers on the panel scuttled all concrete measures to return choice toconsumers The new rights are nice enough theyll move consumers a few seatsforward on the bus But employers are still driving and thats all thatcounts
