                                 Nichols and Nora            My favorite story aboutacting happened minutes before the filming of a crucial scene in MarathonMan in Central Park Dustin Hoffman had to appear physically exhausted sohalf an hour before the shoot he jogged rapidly three four five times aroundthe reservoir then staggered up to his costar Laurence Olivier and gaspedthat he was ready Baffled by Oliviers nonchalance Hoffman still breathinghard asked him how he prepared for a scene Prepare Olivier repliedcarefully setting down his cup of tea and languidly rising from his chair Idont prepare I pretend            One reason I love the storyis that it so symmetrically counters the usual assumptions about the differencebetween American and English actingthe spillyourguts Americans and thetechnically polished English the American search for emotional truth and theEnglish displays of mere skill Hoffman for all his straining afternaturalistic verisimilitude remained dependent on actingclass exerciseswhile Olivier for all his years of training had so deeply integratedtechnique into his being that like a classical pianist he could stop thinkingabout it the moment he began performing In short its the difference betweentalent and geniusbetween Glenn Close proficiently performing her charactersattributes one by one Look at me Im acting and Marlon Brando intuitivelydiscovering his characters essence Look at me Im alive and conveyingall his ambiguities and contradictions simultaneously            Thesethoughts were occasioned by what I regard as without question the two mostenthralling performances of the decadeand I hasten to temper such asuperlative with a dose of irony Mike Nichols performance in Wallace ShawnsThe Designated Mourner the filmed version of the London production ofthe play has been universally praised but by the time the Oscars roll aroundnext March will surely be overlooked Janet McTeers Broadway performance inIbsens A Dolls House  on the other hand has been both widely honoredand roundly reviledshe won the Tony for best actress last Sunday but amongthe reviews were several sputtering fulminations            Jack Nichols character in The Designated Mourner is a former graduate student of English literature who in his own descriptionwent downhill from there His wife Judy and her father Howard are membersof the intelligentsia in an unnamed country in the near future and thestorytold by the three characters seated at a table in direct address to thecamerainvolves the gradual destruction of their lives by an oppressiveregime and the moral disintegration of Jack the eponymous survivor A mancharacterized by envy and cynicism superficial wit and subterranean rageceaseless introspection and emotional detachment insufferable smugness andbarely concealed selfloathing Jack is a bundle of apparentcontradictions            In describing Nicholsinterpretation the problem of technique immediately arises because to giveexamples of specific line readings suggests that hes merely made a sequence ofacting choices when what makes his performance so engrossing is his ability toembody all these aspects of his character at once Now cynicism comes to thefore now rage now a brief interlude of tenderness but their opposites alsoare always presentfor Nichols is embodying the character not the characterscharacteristics Watch Nichols in his most typical gesture He ducks his chinonto his chest bobs his head back and forth gulps as if stifling a burp thensuddenly lifts his head and expresses a thought that not only seems to havejust occurred to him but which also seems to have struggled with conflictingemotions before emerging A technique certainly but one so expressive ofcharacter that it never occurs to us that hes reciting a text At times hespeaks in short halting phrases pausing between the most unlikely words andthen hell rush through a series of phrases so quickly that hell nearly runout of breath and almost gasp out the last wordsrhythm as characterizationhis cadences revealing the contours of his troubled spirit as concisely as hiswords            Itstempting to go on for paragraphs How can one overlook the abruptly truncatedlaugh for instance that conveys a perplexed intellect Or the voice suddenlyshifting from silky to raspy when derision erupts from his muddled emotionsBut each moment remains significant only as it traces the trajectory of hisspiritual deterioration Finally when he learns that Judy has been murderedhe can barely breathe his anguish seems nearly unendurable but its only amomentary spasm he regains his soulless equanimity and as he quietly intoneshis last linesThe greatest pleasure in life is the sweet everchangingcaress of an early evening breezewe realize weve witnessed the exquisitelyironic fusion of elegy and despair the inseparable linking of a brilliant textand a superb performance            Every actress would like to play the mostlegendary Nora but for much of the first act Janet McTeer seems to want toplay the most irritating Shes an unusually sexy Nora but in an annoyinglykittenish way flighty and fluttery as the role calls for but with awhimpering and giggling nervousness This Nora we begin to think isnt somuch a woman as a collection of manic mannerisms But we gradually realize thatthis Nora in fact is playing the role thats expected of hermerely playingtricks as she says in the last actand that theres another Nora beneath thechildlike silliness that will astonish even her There is so much shes notallowed to experience much less expressher native intelligence her creativeenergy her increasing unhappinessso much that can emerge only indistortion            McTeersbold choice to play Nora as far more fraught than usual at the beginning of theplaywith a hyperanimation that in her increasing frustration becomesnervous exhaustion and eventually a kind of hysterical dementiaallows her tomake Noras transformation at the end at once more plausible and more powerfulSome critics have suggested that her performancelike most performances of theroleturns Nora into two different and irreconcilable characters the domesticdoll and the feminist icon But on the contrary she subtly provides thepsychological continuity between these two aspects of her character            In the opening scenes for instance even as McTeer enactsNoras dependence on her husband she shows the cunning that is the only outletfor the characters acute and sensitive mindsubmission as manipulation Thisis no ninnythis is a woman forbidden to use her intelligence And even as sheproclaims her happiness McTeers Nora reaches compulsively for her macaroonswith a hint of voracity that hints at her dissatisfaction            Noras jittery skitterybehavior is charming in a way Its certainly the kind of selfabasingflirtatiousness her husband finds seductive McTeers decision to play Norasmarriage as erotically electric makes Noras decision to leave all the moredifficult and all the more shattering But when her web of lies begins tounravel and he calls her pretty bird she rolls her eyes in a gesture at onceaccepting of his flattery aware of her deceit and resentful of hiscondescension She knows nothing of this consciously but in dozens of suchgestures McTeer reveals the unconscious conflation of Noras conflictstheway her wildly unfocused energy is the consequence of her inner turmoil ofboth social oppression and emotional repression Over and over McTeer portraysa Nora with a capacity for feeling she herself refuses to recognize and acapacity for insight frustrated by her familial role When she hears herselfsaying that being with her husband is like being with papa she pauses for asecond then flashes her eyes with something close to a recognition of primalsin utters a sound somewhere between a hysterical giggle and a shriek ofhorror and rushes across the room as if in flight from her own words            By thefinal confrontation with her husband McTeer has so skillfully foreshadowedNoras transformation that though it seems bewilderingly abrupt to her itseems emotionally inevitable to us Gone are her neurotic mannerisms Nora nowsits in an ominous stillness Im saved her husband says after the arrivalof the forgiving letter What about me Nora responds with a touch ofmeekness but at last with a sense of her separable self Out of her stillnessshe suddenly shrieks not as an appeal but as a demand Im a human beingMost astonishinglyfor the first time in my experience of half a dozenNorasMcTeer even manages to make Noras single most famous line ring trueWhen her husband says that no man would sacrifice his integrity for anotherperson Nora has to reply Hundreds of thousands of women havean impossibleline for the character a line in which it is not Nora speaking but Ibsenhimself McTeers solution She lowers her voice a full octave and intones thewords in a constrained furythe voice not of Nora but of wronged womenforever            The trouble with this kind of detailed analysisis it implies that any competent craftsman could carefully study theperformers techniques and replicate themHoffmans preparation We can onlybe grateful that they cant that Nichols and McTeer become rather than enacttheir charactersOliviers pretending Perhaps all we can say of greatacting is that it involves assimilation rather than accumulation that theperformer isnt so much a surrogate as a vessel Theres paradox in artificeThe supreme tragedies leave us not devastated but exhilarated and the sublimeactors the moment their performances begin stop acting
