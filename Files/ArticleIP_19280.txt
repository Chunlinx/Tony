                                 Are Taxes Heavier Than Ever            Republicans propose usingthe federal budget surplus to finance a tax cut They argue that the tax burdenon the average American has grown A tax cut may be a good or a bad idea forother reasons but the notion of a growing tax burden rests on two highlymisleading statistics            The first is that atypical mother and father who both work paid nearly  percent of their incomein taxes as Republican Rep Jennifer Dunn stated in her reply to the Stateof the Union address That means Dunn explained  cents of everydollar they earned went to the government Dunn also noted that the statisticreally bothers me Dunn can stop tormenting herself the  percent figure isbogus            The number derives from a study conducted by the TaxFoundation a conservative research group The study found that typicalfamilies pay  percent of their income in total taxes which is commonlyrounded up to a neat  percent Thats a sneaky increase of almost a tenthright there But even the  percent figure is inflated These errors werebrought to light by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities a moderatelyliberaland methodologically soundresearch group For instance the TaxFoundation assumes that the average taxpayer pays an average share of estateand capital gains taxes which is absurd Most people do not have any capitalgains at all and the estate tax only affects inheritances of at least and actually a lot more than that unless youre exceptionally stupid aboutestate planning The typical taxpayer paid estate taxes last year in thesame sense that the typical golfer scored some fraction of a hole in oneThat is in almost no sense whatever            Even more bizarrely the Tax Foundation study countsas part of the tax burden things that arent taxes such as private pensioncontributions by government workers or rental fees on property owned by thegovernment If you lease office space in the Ronald Reagan Trade Center shouldyour rent be considered a tax The Tax Foundations miscounting of nontax taxesalone overstates the federal tax burden by oneseventh            Legitimate differences ofinterpretation do exist But the Tax Foundations calculation of the federaltax burden which is nearly a quarter larger than the Congressional BudgetOffices and half again larger than the Joint Tax Committees is beyond thepale            A more sophisticated statistical salvo which conservativepundits have shot off recently is that federal tax revenues now consume thehighest percentage of the gross domestic product since World War II Thisnumber is true Last year Washington took in  percent of GDP whereas inthe decade before Clinton took office the number ranged between  percentand  percent            But this is misleadingThe federal cup runneth over in part because the raging stock market hasproduced a gusher of capital gains tax revenues But GDP does not includeprofits from stocks This means that during a strong stock market thenumerator tax revenues will shoot up but the denominator GDP will not            The main problem with the tax revenuetoGDP ratio thoughisnt accuracy Its relevance During the heyday of the Reagan deficitsconservatives maintained quite logically that the important statistic was nothow much the government took in but how much it spent Big government financedthrough borrowing was no better than big government financed through taxingToday the federal government spends  percent of GDP less than it did whenPresident Bush left office            Leading Republicans who now complain about analleged huge increase in tax revenues insisted back in  that PresidentClintons tax increase would cause a decline in tax revenues This wasthe free lunch logic in reverse If a tax cut will increase revenues a taxincrease will reduce them That prediction failed spectacularly Tax revenueshave boomed with the economy Now the boom they denied could even happen hasbecome their main justification for a tax cut
