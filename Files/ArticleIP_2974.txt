                                 Cafe Sociology            Studio  was a singulardisco Let me give you an example of what I mean            One night therea fairlytypical Tuesday as I recallI noticed that I was standing next to JuanCarlos the occupant of the Spanish throne He seemed to be enjoying himselfthough he looked a little anxious when a paparazzo took his pictureHow am I going to explain this to the archbishop he might have beenthinking Later that week my mother came to visit me in New York We werewatching a local newscast in her hotel room and there was a story about thepolice raiding a disreputable midtown disco The TV showed images of a youngishPuerto Rican clientele being led out by the cops Goodness my motherexclaimed Are there a lot of Hispanics at Studio  Shes fromVirginia            Well Ireplied beaming a bit the last time I popped in the king of Spain wasthere            Its hard to convey how much more interesting New York wasin the late s than it is now There was a sense of unlimited possibility inthe air Everywhere elseParis Los Angelesseemed provincial and dull bycomparison John Sparrow the late warden of All Souls College put it nicelyMy impression is that in New York anything might happen at any moment InEngland nothing could happen ever            Shortlyafter I arrived in the city an unknown from the sticks come to learnphilosophy at Columbia I went uninvited to an opening at an art gallery on theEast Side I met a guy there who turned out to be Andy Warhols silkscreenerand he introduced me to Warhol who then introduced me to the governor of NewYork Hugh Carey who then introduced me to Diana Vreeland of whom I had neverheard The next thing I knew I was in a private room upstairs at the  Clubhaving dinner with the lot of them Hey Manhattans easy I thought What Ididnt realize is that you dont become rich and famous or even enduringlyfabulous by osmosis at some unhappy point you have to work            The sense of possibility reached its mostintense pitch in that little patch of spacetime known as Studio Temporally it spanned a thousand days from  to  spatially itoccupied a handsome former opera house that was also a former TV studio  TheJack Benny Show  Whats My Line  Captain Kangaroo  on th Street W  th St to be exact Oddly CBShad called it Studio             It wasthither that Iemboldened by my earlier

OJ Simpson Margaret Trudeau andfor all I knowtheauthor of this engrossing book Anthony HadenGuest            The Last Party is more than the story of Studio  It isthe Gibbonesque chronicle of the rise and fall of New York night life from thepostwar period to the present The chief cultural innovation of the period wasof course the discothque The great early discothques were in Paris andRome Roger Vadimthe director husband of Brigitte Bardotcoined the word byanalogy with cinmathque  The concept swam into the ken of Americanswith Fellinis La Dolce Vita             What is adisco It is the perfection of voyeurism Playing recorded music allows theclub to get rid of the performers so that the people have nothing to look atbut one another They are the spectacle But you have to have the right peoplelest the spectacle prove disagreeable The disco in Saturday Night Feverwas the  Odyssey in Brooklyn a hustling polyesterdraped mass of ruttingGuidos and Guidettes In a  article titled DISCO Hottest Trend inEntertainment Life magazine claimed that there are now more than discotheques in the US Yes and only one of them was any good            What made Studio  seem like the center of theuniverse was that every worldart royalty Hollywood fashion rock Euroliterary gay political bohemian bluebloodbrilliantly intersected thereIt solved for a brief shining moment what in game theory is known as thecoordination problem Yes Elizabeth Taylor Norman Mailer Warren BeattyDavid Rockefeller and Mick Jagger will go to a nightclub but only if they arereasonably certain that Diana Ross William

another  or so people who were simply beautiful or interestingto look at plus HadenGuest and me            But whydid all these competing elites blend together so ecstatically One reason Ithink was a giddy feeling in the late s that the End was Nigh soeverything was permitted and there was no reason to compete The rest of thecountry had endured Vietnam and Watergate but New York had its own littleproblem bankruptcy and physical collapse It was like Rome in the waning daysof empire Let the great debauch proceed            And if there was a bit of buggery and whatnot going on upin the balcony what of it You would look around and youd see somebodysback says a photographer quoted by HadenGuest And then youd see littletoes twinkling behind their ears In the warren of grungy rooms
