                                 To Intel Analysts Margins Arent Everything                        Todays Nasdaq selloff was relatively steep although you have to rememberthat with the Nasdaq near   points is just not panicinducing Andwhile picking proximate causes for market movements is a fools game Ill be afool and point to two important reasons bond prices and Intel            With the yield on the year bond now at a twoyear high at  percentbonds are looking like a tastier investment and theres still a lot of concernthat the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its Nov  meetingNeither of those things are good for stocks As for Intel it came in withquarterly numbers that were a couple of cents shy of analysts expectations andgot crushed as a result with much of the rest of the tech sector falling insympathy or empathy or whatever you want to call it            Intel is a true tech bellwether since its chips go into most of the PCs inthe world meaning that if its having trouble a lot of other companiesprobably are too And given that in the past few months expectations for thesemiconductor industry have risen sharply Intels failure to blow awayestimatessomething it hasnt done by the way for a couple of yearscame asa shock But there are good reasons to think that todays selloff was overdoneand that whatever trouble Intel is having has less to do with the tech sectorwhatever that mythical beast is in general and more to do with Intel inparticular            The company for instance took great pains to point out that demand for itschips was not the problem In fact in a curiously unIntellike performanceit was manufacturing the chips especially its newest chips that tripped thecompany up Intel delayed the release of its highestpowered Pentium processorCoppermine and a new chipset for memory chips because it couldnt hit theproduction schedules its customers needed Had they shipped as planned Intelwould have had no trouble meeting estimates Traditionally its Intelscompetition most notably Advanced Micro Devices that finds deadlinesbothersome But apparently even masters of manufacturing can trip up            Theres a bigger point than just manufacturing mishaps at stake in the Intelselloff though and thats what you might call the fetishization of marginsproblem which I touched on in last weeks discussion of Amazoncoms zShops initiative Nearly all the analystswho marked down Intel today emphasized that the companys gross marginswhichequals revenue from products minus the cost of sales for those productsfellin the most recent quarter Now they fell  percent from  percent to percent which is statistically insignificant But the important pointfor the analysts was that they didnt rise            What this demonstrates supposedly is the impact on Intel of having to sellso many more of its cheap chipthe Celeronrather than its higherpricedPentiums As consumers have got used to the sub PC Intel has had tomake chips that cater to that market and naturally they earn less profit onthe  Celeron than on the  Pentium III Analysts see this as a slipperyslope so that pretty soon Intel will watch its margins driven down to asliver            Well maybe But somehow I doubt it In the first place Intels margins arestill remarkably high for a manufacturing company and would have been muchhigher had they shipped Coppermine More to the point falling margins arenot in and of themselves evidence that things are falling apart If you dothings right turning inventory more rapidly you can make it up on volume Thevalue of a business depends not on how hefty its profit margins are but on howefficiently it uses capital and you can use capital efficiently by setting upa revolving door of lowmargin products WalMart a steady stream ofhighmargin products most banks or a mix of the two which is where Intel isgoing So lets wait a little while before deciding that Intel is really onthe road to destruction
