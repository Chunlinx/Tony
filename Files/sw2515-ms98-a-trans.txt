           hi Maureen how are you   all right   well do you have a family budget   no we probably should but we havent so why dont you explain to me some good tips about what youve done which youve found useful and workable     okay we do a few things and i have to say were my husband and i are both from financial backgrounds i im an accountant   uhhuh   and uh he has an MBA so uh we were sort of you know keyed in on expenses and things like that so  um   um okay   coming from that background what we pretty much do is we our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws you know X amount of dollars for the month and then that money is used during that month we have a certain budget   uhhuh   excuse me for instance i control all the household expenses the groceries uh the haircuts the gasoline for my car any miscellaneous expenses babysitting things like that and uh   uhhuh   excuse me if uh it comes the end of the month and i dont have any money uh  we dont buy any more milk   uhhuh     but uh weve gotten pretty good at it weve been doing it a couple of years now   uhhuh   so we our budgets are realistic and they are not so stringent as you know to make us feel uncomfortable   hm   uh and i i really try to stretch my my dollars here and there shopping uh at warehouses sometimes like at Sams and things like that   uhhuh   but uh we live we live on on a cash budget and it sometimes its tight come the end of the month but generally we always make it   what do you do for the surprise things that you dont necessarily plan for the you know are sometimes several hundred dollars like uh tires for the car or car repair of some sort or like a a dental bill or something that youre not prepared for   right well uh most of our medical things we dont uh have to worry about because of insurance and theyre theyre relatively small uh weve been lucky in the past we didnt have that problem but right now we dont for the other things the things that crop up that we arent really expecting we have different funds set aside for different things like we have a car fund and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not   oh   so i mean and i i cant really remember what it is   do you kind of continue call this like a part of savings account or a different savings account   its all part of the savings account we just keep track of it on paper uh you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account we decide okay you know lets say its a hundred dollars you know every month fifteen dollars is for car fund   uh   you know ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever uh and   oh   we just we constantly do that so that theres a build up of money for those things if something does come up like i know that my washing machine is going to go any day and   oh okay   so but we have the money set aside so if it does its not going to kill us   hm   uh so were were actually were pretty disciplined so it makes those surprises not so   uhhuh   difficult to get through   okay then so like your pay what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that you know will cover all of the expenses kind of thing   well in   or like what what percent do you then save or something   uh we have a lot of different things right now we save about twenty five percent of our of our pay   hm okay   it and it goes toward different things its for you know for vacations like i said for you know emergencies like for car uh breaks down something like that uh and we also put money aside for our kids college   uhhuh uhhuh   neither of us had any help with our college degrees and just this last month we paid off my final school loan so  were starting our kids a little bit early   oh okay   do you uh use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things   checking account a lot  uh not so much credit cards now several years back i used to use charge uh charge cards and you know all the time kind of thinking oh well its on sale you know it must be a good deal and   uhhuh sure   there have been times that i have been bad about the credit cards and so pretty much now uh we dont use them too much if we travel or something yeah but you know   uhhuh   standard we usually dont or if it it is a purchase uh then its paid off when the bill comes you know so it isnt any extended uh it may be that i picked up something at the store but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then so its not any you know uh build up on the charge cards at all   thats good   and but that hasnt always been the case  so im kind of i feel at least better now that i have finally gotten some of those things uh       you know in the past and i dont have you know big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest rate just is a killer   oh and its not deductible anymore   yeah well ive never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow but uh   or you can get deduct anyway yeah   pretty much when i always i go to the grocery store or something i just always write checks   yeah we did we did that for a long time and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things and it seemed like we didnt have enough money when   hm   things cropped up you know so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be and then we kept track of everything for a month   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   you know how much we spent on food how much we spent on gasoline how much we spent on everything and from that built you know a cash budget so now i mean i have   uhhuh   i dont remember what it is now four hundred dollars for the month lets say and uh i mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and   uhhuh   some months it may be different its not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves you know down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing   uhhuh   but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know uh utilities and uh the house payment and all that those are things you dont really have much control over   yeah uhhuh      uh the cash budget just fits right in there  like i said if we dont have we also set aside money for entertainment i mean its but again its a set amount every month   uhhuh   and uh on special occasions i mean birthdays and things like that we we dont we still have fun on things   yeah uh we are in the process of trying to buy a house do you know how did your budget work or did you have a budget to uh get your down payment going to get a house   well no not originally because when we we did buy when we bought our first house it was at a time where you and the kind of loan we got you really didnt have to put down anything   huh   so we got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house   oh okay   so we we got out of that one pretty easily   okay        uh yeah i just keep thinking all the time i mean it its really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your you know your priority at least mine is to save for the house but then its awful hard to really scrimp for a long long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment you feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime   sure i know       thats how i feel sometimes about my kids education i mean jeez they are one and four       we have got a long time to save my husband hes the real hes the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually   uhhuh   oh no no   well i know but there are times when i sit there and i think wow you know we make X amount of money and where is it i mean you look around and you go where is it you you havent made uh big purchases and thats the easier thing to see if you can see a big purchase and you go okay well this is the year that we bought the couch or the TV or something like that   what do you do with it now uhhuh right   but all those you know just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door and theres big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries and stuff that you dont have tangible i mean the perishable kind of things thats gone used and gone   oh yeah yeah its its amazing how much we spend on some things my husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work   oh   and thats all he has he has a ten dollar bill   huh   and i mean so id say at least two usually three times a week he takes his lunch   uhhuh   the other times hell uh i dont know go out somewhere eat in a cafeteria or whatever   uhhuh uhhuh   but but he keeps himself on that i mean he found its its so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch   uhhuh   thats a hundred dollars a month on lunch   uhhuh   thats thats twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch         when he can take a sandwich you know   yeah
