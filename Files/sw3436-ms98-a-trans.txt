            last the last time i had one of these conversations i you know discovered that i my tastes and and and the other persons were very different uh   oh well thats good   uh i  my my own uh   so where do you like to dine out   um  well sort of yuppie places i guess is probably the best way to describe them um places that are  comfortable and have sort of unusual different foods   oh i see well i like the atmosphere myself   um where where what do you find particularly good atmospherewise   well i like i like lets see well it depends on the mood im in also sometimes i like to go where theres quiet music and theres a piano bar and so that we can visit or theres   umhum umhum   other times when i like when theres real exciting and theres one place here in Dallas where theres a woman on a trapeze and she she goes back and forth over the bar   well that sounds different  id seen things like that in movies but it dont recall having ever been to a restaurant ever even close to a restaurant where that was an option     oh well thats thats called Old San Francisco Steak House   hm   and she uh swings back and forth over the bar its very interesting   oh uh the   she tries the ceiling is i dont know how high it is but she touches the ceiling with her toes and then her   yes yes yeah   thats kind of interesting   that that sure is now can i top that can i even come close         gee   but uh so you like different foods huh   sure enough um   what kind what kind   uh what this week its been Chinese food five days in a row so   oh gee   um but normally not so  not so not so concentrated um um southwestern cuisine um you know New York deli kinds of stuff uh you know it covers covers you know quite a range i mean the the only things i find difficulty with is is these these raw fish things   umhum umhum umhum oh yes i cant eat that either i do like fish though we have a lot of Red Lobsters out here   uh how do you have Red Lobsters in Texas in the middle of Texas   i eat there quite often how do we have them   yeah i would have thought they wouldve come out of out of the water somewhere   theyre all over   crawling around on the on the   no no i mean the Red Lobster thats the name of the restaurant   around Dallas oh oh oh im sorry oh im sorry i thought you were talking about a kind of food like Red Lobster yes them the Red chain yes thank you never mind     im talking about the restaurant   what makes you go back to the same place is it the food or   well its its um its a combination of a lot of things i mean theres sort of a value quotient i mean i i you know theres no absolute dollar limit that you know is either okay or not okay but its its more like gee this is a really good you know you got a lot for your money either quantity or quality or interest or   oh and the service too   and service and um   right the service means a lot to me   yes um   a lot   do you prefer to have men men or womens as servers   i really prefer a man   umhum why is that   i just i feel that theyre more efficient and they they just seems like they just have it uh more together you go to Mexico and you wont see any women servers   yes   all men servers down there   yeah ive never been to Mexico what how how how are the how is the food in Mexico compared to what we find in   oh   Mexican restaurants   well oh hows the food different there than up here   yeah compared to what we have in this country   well its much spicier   umhum     and its um its just prepared a little bit different but its uh it has a different flavor to it and the service is good because the because they have men servers   umhum   and uh what do you like men  waiters or women   i i i think i probably have a slight preference for for male servers but but not very great   um   um you know its the the quality of service is is important and it and its and its i dont think that thats i dont correlate that with genders   um   i think i think it really it might actually just be that you know some some restaurants employ more of one than another it may just be the restaurants i go to   umhum well i just i feel like the men have it more together than the women they just ive waited on tables myself and i just could never seem to organized like the guys were   how how did you like being a waiter or waitress   its a lot of hard work   thats thats what my impression is   a lot of hard work   and and and being a chauffeur that isnt also hard work   a chauffeur yeah really hard to please people   yeah   just like waiting on tables you just cant whatever you do sometimes you just cant please them     yeah is this is this one of these limo services where people coming into town and want to be driven around and   umhum
