                    Background        Ion channels located in the plasma membrane provide one        means to mediate cellular adaptation to local environmental        changes Voltagegated K channels in nonnerve nonmuscle        cells play crucial roles in cell development        proliferation migration volume regulation as well as        maintenance of membrane potential and cell viability This        is in part because these channels regulate the cytoplasmic        concentrations of K  Ca  and Na ions                     The diversity of voltagegated K channels and        currents present in these nonexcitable nonmuscle        nonnerve cells is impressive Thus the assignment of        specific functions to particular subclasses of K channel        proteins represents a significant challenge                          Voltagegated K currents with distinct        electrophysiological and pharmacological properties are        present in granulosa cells GC and modulate resting        membrane potential         Furthermore        selective antagonism of GC K channels with distinct        molecular correlates electrophysiological properties and        expression patterns can influence differentially GC        proliferation steroidogenic capability and apoptosis             Our laboratory has previously identified two        distinct delayed rectifier K currents in pig GC a slow        current I         Ks  associated with channels formed by        coassembly of KCNQ poreforming and KCNE accessory        proteins and an ultrarapid current I         Kur  formed by coassembly of KCNA        poreforming and KCNAB accessory proteins     Moreover        we have shown that selective block of I         Ks enhances basal progesterone        synthesis while complete block of both I         Ks and I         Kur accelerates apoptosis            Here our goal was to determine the functional effects        of antagonizing GC K channels formed by KCNA vs KCNQ        family proteins To this end we treated primary cultures        of GC and monolayers of the immortalized granulosa cell        line PGC    with the K channel antagonist        aminopyridine AP aminopyridine at millimolar        concentrations completely inhibits K currents conducted        by heterologously expressed KCNA channels and native GC I         Kur  but lacks significant effects on        native GC I         Ks        Kusaka showed that        antagonism of AP sensitive slowly inactivating delayed        rectifier K currents suppressed both basal and luteinizing        hormone LHstimulated progesterone production     In        this report we extend those findings by demonstrating AP        inhibition of follicle stimulating hormone FSHstimulated        progesterone production and by elucidating the underlying        mechanisms                    Methods                  Reagents          Cell culture media supplements phosphatebuffered          saline PBS  X and

progesterone          accumulation in the media of serumsupplemented GC          cultures at  h and  h posttreatment in the presence          and absence of FSH Figure  The decreased progesterone          concentrations in the media of drugtreated cultures did          not reflect significant differences in the number of          viable cells under these culture conditions Figure A          Densitometric analysis of data from  experiments similar          to that shown in Figure Brevealed no significant effect          of AP treatment on the expression of proliferating cell          nuclear antigen PCNA These data provide additional          evidence that AP exerts neither an antiproliferative          nor a proapoptotic influence on serumsupplemented GC          cultures because PCNA expression is a sensitive marker          of GC proliferation and apoptosis       The lack          of AP effect on GC viability is also evident from the          flow cytometric analysis the percentages of cells          staining positive for propidium iodide were    and             in the presence and absence of drug n   samples          of  cellseach from  GC isolations          Treatment with AP  mM also diminished          progesterone accumulation on days  and  posttreatment          in GC cultures maintained in the defined serumfree media          in the presence and absence of FSH However in these          serumfree cultures AP treatment was associated with          not only decreased progesterone accumulation but also          decreased numbers of viable cells Table  The          percentage of viable cells was unaffected by AP          Control     vs AP     n   FSH              FSHAP     n   suggesting that AP          inhibited growth rather than promoted cell death          Overall these data are consistent with previous          reports that endocrine cells express voltagesensitive          ion channels that can contribute to the regulation of not          only resting membrane potential and cell volume but also          cell proliferation and steroidogenesis                            The K currents blocked          by AP in pig GC are conducted by ion channels formed by          heteromeric complexes of poreforming subunits from the          KCNA also called Kv or Shaker family of proteins and          accessory subunits from the KCNAB also called Kv          family of proteins     Similar APsensitive K          currents play a key role in transduction of mitogenic          signals in a variety of cell types and AP treatment          has been associated with not only growth arrest but also          apoptosis                        Our finding that  h exposure to AP decreased the          number of viable GC in serumfree but not          serumsupplemented primary cultures is consistent with          the reported effects of AP and other K channel          antagonists on other cell types       It has been          shown that the concentrations of K channel antagonists          required to inhibit growth of human bladder tumor cells          can be  times higher in the presence than the absence          of serum     AP has been shown to inhibit the          proliferation of human myelobastic leukemia cells by          preventing growth factor activation of mitogen activated          protein kinase MAPK pathways     This mechanism          may be responsible for the antiproliferative effect of          AP manifest in Table  It is likely that MAPK pathways          are less robust in GC grown in defined serumfree vs          serumsupplemented media however validation of this          hypothesis would require additional experiments beyond          the scope of the present investigation We concluded that          the antiproliferative effect of AP may contribute to          the decreased progesterone accumulation observed in          serumfree but not serumsupplemented GC cultures then          focused additional efforts on understanding other          mechanisms responsible for AP inhibition of          progesterone production          The effects of AP in serumsupplemented GC cultures          are consistent with previous reports that antagonism of          voltagesensitive K currents can modulate basal and          gonadotropinstimulated progesterone accumulation in the          absence of any effect on cell growth or death We have          shown previously that antagonism of the slowly activating          noninactivating granulosa K current I           Ks  enhances basal progesterone          production by depolarizing membrane potential and thus          enhancing calcium influx via pimozidesensitive Ca          channels     In contrast Kusaka    showed          that antagonism of AP sensitive slowly inactivating          delayed rectifier K currents suppressed both basal and          LHstimulated progesterone production Data presented in          Figures and confirm the inhibitory effects of AP on          basal progesterone production by cultured pig GC and          demonstrate for the first time a similar inhibitory          effect of AP on FSHstimulated progesterone          synthesis                          Effects of AP on Pathways for Steroid Hormone          Biosynthesis          The inhibitory action of AP on progesterone          production was investigated further using not only          primary cultures but also the spontaneously established          granulosa cell line PGC     Although PGC lack          FSH receptors these cells can serve as a useful           in vitro model for GC function          because they produce cAMP in response to forskolin and          synthesize progesterone and estradiol when supplied with          appropriate substrates We examined the effects of AP          on cAMP progesterone and estradiol production by PCG          after confirming that these cells express AP sensitive          voltagegated K currents similar to those in primary          cells see additional file           AP decreased production of cAMP Figure A and          expression of StAR by PGC Figure B AP had no          significant effect on progesterone production by PCG          cultured in the presence of pregnenolone androstenedione          or DHT Figure A In contrast AP significantly          reduced estradiol production by PGC cultures provided          with androstenedione Figure B          To evaluate the relevance of the experimental results          obtained using PGC we examined the effect of AP on          the progesterone output of primary GC cultures          supplemented with either the membrane permeable cAMP          analog chlorophenylthio adenosinecyclic          monophosphorothioate CPTcAMP  mM or estradiol            ngml The inhibitory effect of AP on          progesterone accumulation was partially but not          completely overcome by the addition of CPTcAMP Table           AP had no inhibitory effects on either basal or          FSHstimulated progesterone production by GC cultures          supplemented with estradiol  Figure  Thereby the          combined results of experiments performed using PGC and          primary GC cultures suggest that APinhibition of GC          progesterone production may be linked to decreased          expression of StAR decreased generation of cAMP and          decreased output of estradiol          StAR plays a key role in the initial steps of          steroidogenesis because it is required for transport of          cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane where          CYPA resides and the first reaction in progesterone          synthesis occurs     cAMP is a well known second          messenger in FSH and LHstimulated progesterone          synthesis and a key effect of the cAMPdependent protein          kinase in GC is transcriptional control of StAR               Estradiol is recognized as a biological amplifier of          basal FSH and cAMPstimulated progesterone production          in pig GC with significant synergistic effects distal to          the generation of cAMP at one or more steps in          cholesterol transport and metabolism     Our          experimental results are thus consistent with AP          inhibition of GC progesterone output via drug effects on          multiple interacting sites in the steroidogenic pathway          Moreover despite multiple sites of action the drugs          actions cannot be dismissed as nonspecific because AP          had no effects on either hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase          HSDmediated conversion of pregnenolone to          progesterone or androgen androstenedione          DHTstimulated progesterone synthesis          Estradiol has been reported to affect K channel          expression and gating in smooth muscle                  The data presented here do not address directly the          potential for estradiol modulation of voltagegated K          channel expression or activity in GC However such a          mechanism seems unlikely to account for the ability of          estradiol to oppose the inhibitory effects of AP on GC          progesterone production The K channel subunits and          currents modulated by estradiol in vascular and uterine          smooth muscle differ from the AP sensitive KCNA family          channels that contribute to the AP sensitive current I           Kur in pig GC                  Moreover in the single study where estradiol was shown          to influence the gating of a uterine delayed rectifier          current with electrophysiological characteristics          resembling those of GC I           Kur  the observed effect of the          hormone was inhibitory     and thereby similar          rather than opposite to the effect of AP          Additional experiments were performed in an attempt to          identify signaling pathways that transduce specific          inhibitory effects of AP These focused on AP          modulation of membrane potential intracellular ion          concentrations and cell size as described below                          Effects of AP on Membrane Potential          Intracellular Ions Cell Size          Hormonal signal transduction and steroidogenesis can          be affected by changes in intracellular and extracellular          concentrations of inorganic ions cellular resting          membrane potential and cell size                      Blockade of AP sensitive K channels in          nonnerve nonmuscle cells can lead to changes in          transmembrane ion gradients membrane potential and cell          volume      On this basis we determined the          effects of  h exposure to AP on GC size membrane          potential and intracellular potassium K            in           Samples  cells of GC from  hour cultures          associated with  GC isolations were analyzed by flow          cytometry to determine if AP treatment influenced GC          size Light scattering properties did not differ          significantly with GC isolate However the average          forward scatter median coefficient of variation of GC          cultured for  hours in the presence of AP            was significantly greater than that of GC maintained          similarly in the absence of drug            Representative dot plots are shown in Figure  Resting          membrane potential Figure A and K            in Figure B were also found to be          increased in GC exposed to AP based on DiBAC             and PBFI fluorescence          respectively          The observed druginduced increases in cell size and          K            in suggest that AP sensitive K          channels represent a significant K efflux pathway          involved in maintenance of cell volume in GC          Interestingly the increased K            in may contribute directly to the          inhibitory effects of AP on production of cAMP and          progesterone Loss of K from the intracellular          compartment of rat GC has been associated with opposite          effects namely enhanced synthesis of both cAMP and          progesterone              The observed increase hyperpolarization of GC          resting membrane potential cannot be explained easily by          any direct effect of the drug In fact AP inhibition          of K efflux would be expected to depolarize rather than          hyperpolarize membrane potential Data obtained          previously in our laboratory suggest that inhibition of          granulosa I           Kur should be associated with a  to           mV depolarization of cell resting membrane potential          block of I           Ks alone decreased resting potential          by  mV while block of both I           Ks and I           Kur decreased resting potential by           to  mV     Most previous investigations of AP          effects on the resting membrane potentials of nonnerve          nonmuscle cells have similarly demonstrated druginduced          depolarization      although there is a single          report showing APinduced hyperpolarization of          chondrocyte membrane potential              We hypothesized that hyperpolarization of APtreated          GC could reflect anion influx associated with activation          of a Cl entry pathway sensitive to changes in cell          volume as well as membranepotential To test this          hypothesis the effects of AP on membrane potential          were examined using GC incubated in either media modified          to contain the chloride channel antagonist DIDS or a          physiological buffer solution modified to contain a low           mM concentration of chloride In contrast to the          results obtained in the standard media Figure A AP          did not induce significant hyperpolarization of GC under          these conditions Figure AB Exposure to DIDS alone          significantly decreased depolarized GC resting membrane          potential Figure B suggesting that an outward          chloride current chloride influx contributes to the          normal resting potential of pig GC Membrane potential          was further depolarized in GC exposed to AP in the          presence of DIDS Figure B consistent with the          hypothesis that APinduced hyperpolarization depends on          chloride influx          Interestingly concomitant exposure to DIDS prevented          AP from diminishing the accumulation of progesterone in          GC culture media Figure C suggesting that chloride          influx membrane hyperpolarization or both might mediate          this effect of AP Chloride channels or chloride ions          are known to influence cAMPstimulated steroidogenesis by          adrenal cells     human chorionic gonadotropin          hCGstimulated steroidogenesis by amphibian          follicleenclosed oocytes     as well as          LHstimulated steroidogenesis in rat Leydig cells              MA cells     and chicken GC     In          mammalian cells removal of extracellular chloride          stimulates basal and protein kinase A PKAdependent          steroid hormone production by increasing the expression          of StAR and potentiating the effects of submaximal          concentrations of cAMP      The proposed mechanism          of action involves chloride efflux depolarization of the          mitochondrial and plasma membranes and alterations to          protein synthesis and cholesterol transport                        The data shown here in Figures and suggest strongly          that chloride ions can influence progesterone production          in pig GC by similar mechanisms In our experiments the          chloride influx and membrane hyperpolarization associated          with AP treatment not only decreased expression of          StAR but also inhibited cAMP production and          steroidogenesis The observed effects of Cl channel          antagonists differ significantly between the present          study where DIDS prevented AP from decreasing          progesterone synthesis and previous investigations where          DIDS and other Cl channel antagonists prevented LH from          enhancing progesterone production       However          this discrepancy is expected because DIDS antagonizes a          chloride influx pathway in pig GC and chloride efflux          pathways in Leydig cells          In summary the data demonstrate that AP inhibits          basal and FSHstimulated progesterone production by pig          GC via a complex mechanism involving drug action at          multiple interacting steps in the steroidogenic pathway          Drug block of the voltagegated potassium channels that          conduct the ultrarapid delayed rectifier current I           Kur is associated with increased          intracellular potassium concentration increased cell          volume activation of chloride influx and          hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential These          changes in the GC internal milieu appear to modulate the          inhibitory effects of AP on expression of StAR and          production of steroid hormones          The physiological implications of the data are          significant as they suggest novel roles for granulosa          cell ion channels We demonstrate for the first time not          only that delayed rectifier K channels play a          significant role in GC volume regulation but also that          voltage andor volumesensitive Cl channels modulate GC          membrane potential and progesterone production          Additional experiments are required to link these data          obtained           in vitro to functionally          significant changes in GC volume and chloride flux during          normal follicular development                            Conclusions        In conclusion the present studies indicate that the K        channel antagonist AP inhibits basal and FSHstimulated        progesterone production by pig GC Exposure to AP is        associated with decreased production of cAMP decreased        expression of StAR and decreased synthesis of estradiol        These inhibitory actions of AP on adenylate cyclase        activity StAR expression and steroidogenesis may reflect        druginduced changes in the intracellular concentrations of        K and Cl and the GC resting membrane potential Further        studies are required to elucidate fully the mechanisms        involved        Additional investigation is warranted AP is reported        to have therapeutic potential for the relief of symptoms        associated with demyelinating diseases such as spinal cord        injury and multiple sclerosis          The        drug is currently being studied in large scale human trials            Druginduced inhibition of steroid hormone        production could have significant effects in these        patients For example AP could exacerbate abnormal        steroid hormone profiles associated with spinal cord injury        and multiple sclerosis and thereby
