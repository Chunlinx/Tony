                    Background        DNA microarray analysis has become the most widely used        technique for the study of geneexpression patterns on a        genomic scale    Differential microarray        cohybridization assays measure the relative gene        expression of paired query and reference samples and the        power of microarray analysis comes from identification of        informative patterns of gene expression across multiple        experiments Achieving both these objectives is facilitated        by using a common reference sample that provides a baseline        expression measure for each gene enabling normalization        and comparison of independent experiments        Pooled RNA derived from cell lines is a commonly used        reference sample To provide optimal coverage of genes        spotted on the array reference samples are often        constructed from a large number of cell lines from a        variety of tissues One example is the universal human RNA        reference commercially available from Stratagene   This        reference consists of equimolar quantities of RNA from ten        human cancer cell lines representing ten different tissues        B cells breast brain cervix liver lipocytes        macrophage skin T cells and testis        Another challenging technical consideration in        microarray analysis is the cutoff value used to distinguish        differential expression from natural variability in the        data A cutoff of twofold up or downregulation has been        chosen to define differential expression in most published        studies    However little has been done to evaluate        the accuracy of the technique and assess the confidence        levels for various foldlevel changes in expression ratios        In addition microarray analysis is a complex multistep        technique involving array fabrication labeling        hybridization and data analysis and many laboratories have        developed a variety of protocols for each of these steps           Studies by a number of groups using a range of        protocols and including many different RNA samples will        give a better picture of how reliable microarrays are for        elucidating geneexpression profiles        In this study we evaluate the performance of cDNA        microarrays using our current laboratory and dataanalysis        protocols and derive a new intensitydependent approach to        identifying differentially expressed genes RNA from         different human cancer cell lines the Stratagene universal        reference RNA and RNA isolated from a tumor specimen were        assayed in a series of selfself hybridizations on a        element cDNA array containing  elements        spotted in duplicate Statistical analysis of the ratios        of CyCy fluorescence intensities among this large number        of distinct samples provides insight into the variation        inherent in expression ratios extracted from cDNA        microarrays We assess reproducibility of array experiments        by analyzing replicates using both clones spotted in        duplicate on the same array and in triplicate hybridization        assays In addition we use the methodology developed in        this study to compare expression in a colon and an ovarian        cell line to identify tissuespecific genes        Selfself hybridization results for individual cell        lines were also analyzed to determine the composition of an        optimal reference pool consisting of RNA derived from cell        lines Our underlying hypothesis was that pooling a large        number of cell lines might not necessarily improve the        overall gene representation Although some cell lines        express significantly more genes than others not all cell        lines express all genes at the same levels Consequently        mixing cell lines may dilute rare transcripts so that their        representation in the final RNA pool is below the        detectable limit Results of our analysis will aid in the        future assessment of geneexpression patterns and the        design of reference RNA samples                    Results and discussion                  Cell line selfself hybridizations          To evaluate the natural variability present in spotted          cDNA microarray data across a number of distinct RNA          samples we carried out a set of selfself assays in          which aliquots of the same RNA are separately labeled          with Cy and Cy dyes and cohybridized to a single          microarray PolyA RNA was prepared from  human          carcinoma cell lines  brain  colon  ovarian           pancreatic and  testicular and Stratagenes universal          human reference RNA RNA was reverse transcribed into          cDNA using random hexamer primers in the presence of          aminoallyldUTP Cy and Cy dyes were covalently          coupled to the incorporated aminoallyl linkers in a          subsequent labeling reaction          For each cell line Cy and CycDNA samples were          cohybridized to a spotted microarray containing           human cDNA clones  clones printed in duplicate          Hybridization results were analyzed to determine relative          expression levels for each printed element and          hybridization intensity data were first normalized          globally using an iterative meanlog            ratiocentering approach Briefly          log            ratio values were calculated for          each array element and the mean of the distribution was          calculated Ratios were adjusted such that the mean log            ratio for the entire collection of          genes was set to zero or a corresponding average ratio          of  As outliers can significantly influence this          process these were identified and excluded and the          process repeated until convergence This process results          in an average CyCy log            ratio of zero for the spots          analyzed in each microarray          We and others have noted that the log            ratio values often have a          systematic dependence on intensity most often observed as          a deviation from zero for lowintensity spots Locally          weighted linear regression lowess   has been          proposed as a normalization method for microarray assays             that can remove intensitydependent dyespecific          effects in the log            ratio values          In this procedure fluorescence intensities are          measured from both channels for all elements on the array          and the log            CyCy ratios for each spot are          represented as a function of the log            CyCy product intensities          Scatterplots of such data referred to as an RI plot          for ratiointensity can reveal intensityspecific          artifacts in the measurement of the ratio which tend to          occur most notably for weakly fluorescing arrayed          elements For a selfself hybridization of the type          analyzed here one expects a mean log            CyCy ratio of zero for each          element in the array independent of intensity Lowess          enables deviations from this expected behavior to be          detected and corrected by performing a local weighted          linear regression for each data point in the RI plot and          subtracting the average ratio from the experimentally          observed ratio A representative RI plot for the cell          line KMLA in Figure shows a slight upward curve of          the log            ratio for lowintensity data          points shown in blue which is removed after application          of the lowess correction producing a balanced          distribution of expression ratios around zero independent          of intensity shown in red Similar plots including a          calculated standard deviation SD both before and after          lowess correction are shown in Figure c The most          important feature of the data is the narrow distribution          of ratios in individual array experiments regardless of          the RNA sample assayed in each experiment This is also          true of the entire dataset as can be seen in the          histogram of combined expression ratios from           experiments shown in Figure           These results are comparable to those obtained in a          recent study of  selfself hybridizations on          element cDNA arrays   Yue           et al   created histograms for          three sets of data each consisting of  independent          array experiments using mRNA derived from human          placenta brain and heart tissue In one of their data          sets a SD limit of fold was observed combined           of the data points were within  fold A small          number of distinct samples  in combination with a          large number of replicates per sample  most probably          accounts for the slightly tighter distribution of          expression ratios than that observed in our study          The second important aspect of our dataset is the          number of outliers approximately  of the data points          in each array fall outside of  SD from the mean data          not shown While this is not unexpected it suggests          that the distribution of log            ratio values does not deviate          badly from normal This is of a particular significance          because it should enable detection of genes with low          levels of differential expression at high confidence in          future studies Combining all data from all           hybridizations the SD limit is equivalent to fold          change   log            ratio only  out of           points or  of the expression ratios fall outside a          SD threshold Consequently if differential expression          is defined as greater than  SD from the mean genes with          fold changes greater than  can be classified as up or          downregulated at approximately  confidence level          Goodquality array data can only be generated using          well developed and extensively tested laboratory and          dataanalysis protocols Our group has been working          continuously to improve our laboratory procedures and          implement new dataanalysis methods One of the changes          recently adopted by ours and many other laboratories is          indirect cDNA labeling As firststrand cDNA synthesis is          identical for both samples incorporation of nucleotides          with an aminoallyl linker followed by the covalent          coupling reaction to Cy dyes reduces bias for          incorporation of one dye over the other by the reverse          transcriptase Slight dyespecific effects are present in          normalized lowintensity data probably caused by a          wavelengthdependent differential response of the          photomultiplier tubes in the array scanners or slight          differences or nonlinearities in the quantum efficiencies          of the fluorescent dyes but these can be efficiently          removed by the application of the lowess correction                          Tissue sample selfself hybridization          In our experience hybridization using RNA derived          from tissue samples is generally more problematic than          that derived from cell lines To determine whether data          of comparable quality can be generated with tissue RNA          we carried out a similar expression analysis using RNA          derived from a colon tumor liver metastasis Twenty          micrograms of total RNA that have been extracted using          Trizol and subjected to secondary purification using          Qiagen RNeasy columns were labeled with both Cy and Cy          and examined in a selfself cohybridization assay The          distribution of expression ratios is in excellent          agreement with cellline data only  out of            of identified spots fall outside the fold          change SD limit                          Intensitydependent estimation of differential          expression          While lowess normalization greatly reduces          dyespecific artifacts that often appear for          lowintensity data points the data exhibit additional          structure that can be used to evaluate patterns of gene          expression As can be seen in Figure a the log            ratio measures generally show          greater variation at lower intensities Most published          microarray studies use a single log            ratio threshold as a measure of          differential expression Examination of the distribution          in Figure suggests that this may inappropriately          identify genes at intensities where the natural variation          in the data would not support their selection while at          the same time causing genes to be missed in other          intensities where the data suggest that much lower log            ratio values are statistically          significant Several mathematical models have been          derived to explain this phenomenon                One   discusses the use of a smoothed estimate of the          SD as a function of the fluorescence intensity The study          conducted by Hughes           et al   shows how their model          for estimating intensitydependent differential          expression can be used to identify biologically          meaningful differential regulation at levels lower than          twofold in a compendium of  different           Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants          and chemical treatments          We developed a much simpler approach to identify          differentially expressed genes using an          intensitydependent calculation of a standard           Z score Using a sliding window of          fixed width in log            CyCy the local mean and SD          was calculated for each gene using the data in the          normalized RI plot Figure adepicts the result of such          a calculation for the cell line KMLA with data less          than  SD shown blue between SD and SD in green and          greater than  SD in red respectively genes greater          than  SD from the local mean            Z   are identified as being          significantly differentially expressed          The shape of the RI plot and the           Z score distributions are          characteristic of the samples being compared in the          microarray assay under consideration For closely related          samples such as RNA from a cell line and the same line          perturbed with a stressor the RI distribution has a          tadpole shape similar to that shown for our selfself          hybridization although typically with a slightly broader          distribution in the log            ratio than that shown in Figure          a When two very different samples or tissues are          compared however the distribution generally has a          characteristic eye shape with the greatest spread          coming at intermediate expression levels Figure bshows          the results from a hybridization comparing the CaC          colon and PA ovary cell lines                          Analysis of replicates          Expression data for clones spotted in duplicate were          examined to assess reproducibility within each array          Plots of the log            transformed ratios of the Cy and          Cy intensities for the two replicates were generated for          this purpose As can be seen in the representative plot          in Figure ablue log            CyCy values form a sphere          centered around zero with the majority of data points          lying between   and   on both axes However a          small number of outliers is present and probably          represent situations where one or both of the replica          spots are of poor quality Similar plots were obtained          for the other  selfself hybridization assays data not          shown          Because one cannot determine           a priori which of the duplicates is          in error irreproducible elements should be removed          before any further analysis unless many more replicates          are analyzed The idea of outlier filtering was also          incorporated into the model for the intensitydependence          of expression ratios introduced by Baggerly           et al   we developed a simple          approach to flag and eliminate questionable replicates          Ideally CyCy ratios should be the same for the two          replicas and log            r            r             where r            and r            are CyCy ratios for the two          replicas should be equal to zero replicates where this          condition is not satisfied probably contain one or more          bad elements Consequently we sought to filter out genes          whose log            r            r             deviates greatly from this          expected value of zero We calculated the mean and SD of          this log            r            r             for each pair of replicas in the          entire array and eliminated pairs of elements whose log            r            r             is greater than  SD from the          mean In Figure a  of data points were eliminated          using this outlier criterion red resulting in a much          tighter dataset          We also examined duplicate clone filtering in a          hybridization assay of two different samples CaCO and          PA Figure b In the case of differential expression          the correlation of the replica ratios is expected to be          linear The correlation increases from r   blue          dashed line to r   red solid line after  of          outliers are filtered out using the method outlined          above The substantial increase in the correlation          coefficient suggests that our filtering procedure          efficiently removes elements with at least one unreliable          log            CyCy value          A similar approach can be used to identify          questionable replicate spots on separate slides To show          this five cell lines CaOV HCT KMLA NTD          and SW were selected and assayed in triplicate In          addition expression in CaCO and PA was compared in          triplicate hybridizations RNA from the same isolation          was used for replicate hybridizations thus allowing us          to concentrate on technical and not biological          replication and to explore more thoroughly the systematic          errors that can arise Replicate slides were subject to          filtering in pairs arrays  and   and   and           using a process analogous to that applied to withinslide          replicates representative data are shown in Figure           Correlations of log            CyCy values for the three pairs          of arrays before blue dashed line and after red          solid line filtering for the CaOV cell line selfself          hybridizations are shown in Figure a The same set of          plots for differential expression assays of CaCO and          PA cell lines including linear fits to the data is          shown in Figure b          Triplicate hybridization assays enable us to assess          variability among independent labeling reactions and          hybridizations As can be seen in Figure a there is          some variation in correlations for each pair of          hybridization replicas arrays  and  as well as  and           show better correlation than do arrays  and  When          averaged over three pairs of replicas however the          variability between arrays is comparable to withinarray          variation Similar results were obtained for the          remaining four cell lines data not shown For the case          of hybridizations of two different samples Figure b          the mean r values increase significantly from  blue          dashed lines to  red solid lines after outliers          in each pair of hybridizations are filtered out These          correlations are as in the case of selfself          hybridizations similar to those seen for withinarray          replicas          Our analysis suggests that replication is essential          for ensuring data quality whether spotting replicate          clones on single arrays or performing multiple          independent hybridization assays Further the replicate          filtering process we describe here is a simple approach          that can eliminate questionable array elements and          provide higherconfidence expression measurements                          Identification of differentially expressed          genes          To show how the concepts presented in this study can          be applied to detect differentially regulated genes we          sought to identify sets of genes that are over and          underexpressed in ovary relative to colon by analyzing          hybridization assays of CaCO colon and PA ovary          cell lines The CaCO sample was labeled with Cy and the          PA sample was labeled with Cy genes that are          expressed in colon at much higher levels will therefore          have negative logratios and ovary genes will have          positive logratios          For this analysis we applied the process outlined in          the previous discussion as follows First individual          arrays were normalized using meanlogcentering and          lowess procedures as outlined in the Cell line selfself          hybridizations section Next unreliable spots among          triplicate arrays were eliminated using the filtering          approach discussed in the Analysis of replicates section          Then intensitydependent SDs on the log            ratio were computed for each          array as described in the Intensitydependent estimation          of differential expression section Array elements with          ratios outside the SD limit were defined as          differentially regulated   and  were          identified in each individual assay Finally the          intersection of differentially expressed genes on all          three arrays was taken this resulted in a list of           array elements  genes as some are withinarray          replicates of which   genes have higher          expression in colon and   genes are more highly          expressed in the ovary relative to colon          A list of differentially expressed genes with mean log                     CyCy values and SD calculated          over three experiments is available see Additional data          files The small SDs illustrate the reproducibility of          measurements made using the methods described here and          show their ability to provide a highconfidence list of          differentially expressed genes and their expression          ratios          In an attempt to validate the differential expression          we observed in this assay we compared our results to the          expression patterns derived from EST libraries generated          from  colon and  ovarian sources including normal          tissue cancer tissue and cell lines using the digital          differential display DDD available at the National          Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI   see          Additional data files Although these data sets are not          completely complementary we identified one gene that is          significantly upregulated in the colon relative to ovary                     PLAB  coding for prostate          differentiation factor Hs THC and one          gene that is overexpressed in the ovary relative to colon          dehydrocholesterol reductase           DHCR Hs THC in          both microarray and DDD data We also identified three          gene families significantly differentially expressed in          both datasets We found genes in the solute carrier          families  Hs DDD  THC microarray          and  THC microarray as well as laminin A          Hs DDD and A THC microarray to be more          abundant in the ovary In addition serologically defined          colon cancer antigens  Hs DDD and           THC microarray were more highly represented in          colon However we also found two discrepancies in          relative abundances of one gene and one gene family          between the DDD and microarray data DDD data indicate          that the proteinkinase inhibitor P Hs          THC is more abundant in the ovary but the same          gene appears to be more highly represented in the colon          in our microarray study Similarly insulinlike growth          factor binding protein  Hs DDD is upregulated          in the ovary relative to colon while the opposite is true          for insulinlike growth factor binding protein           THC microarray          To further validate our findings we performed          quantitative realtime reverse transcription PCR RTPCR          assays on  genes with log            RG and log            RG values encompassing the entire          range present in the microarray data Expression ratios          obtained by quantitative RTPCR see Additional data          files are in good agreement with the ratios obtained          using microarrays This concordance is especially          significant for genes with low expression ratios and for          transcripts expressed at low copy number confirming the          validity of our approach for obtaining a highconfidence          list of differentially expressed genes RTPCR data also          showed that the P proteinkinase inhibitor Hs          THC is upregulated in the colon relative to ovary          which supports our array results and suggests that the          discrepancy between microarrays and DDD is not due to          technical limitations of microarray assays but reflects a          true biological difference between the cell lines we          compared and tissues used in DDD                          Reference pool selection          Comparison of query samples to a common reference          sample is among the most widely used experimental designs          for largescale microarray studies    Reference          samples often consist of pools of RNA molecules derived          from cell lines because cell lines provide a renewable          source of large quantities of RNA Each cell line          expresses a distinct assortment of RNA species so any          particular cell line will provide measurable baseline          hybridization for only a subset of the genes on an array          Consequently cell line RNA reference pools are typically          constructed from a large number  or more of cell          lines derived from a variety of primary tissues The idea          underlying such a design is that by combining RNAs from          diverse cell lines one might obtain a more complete          representation of the genes spotted on the array          This approach however does not take into account the          expression levels of individual genes in each cell line          While genes expressed at high levels will give detectable          signal even when diluted by a factor of  many of the          more rare transcripts may get diluted to below the          detection limit Therefore we hypothesized that          comparable or better representation of spotted genes          might be obtained using fewer cell lines each expressing          a large number of diverse genes To test this hypothesis          we constructed two reference pools TP and TP using          a naive genecounting approach designed to include three          cell lines with the greatest representation of unique          genes that are also easy to grow and yield high          quantities of RNA TP consists of colon cell lines          CaCO and KMLA as well as the ovarian cell line          OVCAR OVCAR is replaced with the UMG brain cell          line in TP          The results of our analysis are summarized in Figure           which shows a histogram representing the percentage of          array elements with signals in both Cy and Cy channels          in selfself hybridizations The performance of TP is          comparable to that of the Stratagene pool approximately           despite a large difference in the number of cell          lines in each pool This supports our hypothesis that          adding more cell lines to the pool may not necessarily          improve the overall gene representation because some          genes are diluted below the detection limit          Including cell lines from very dissimilar tissues may          however give a better representation of the genes on the          array TP contains a brain instead of an ovarian cell          line and covers close to  of the spotted sequences          This improved performance relative to TP is likely to          be due both to the fact that brain exhibits the greatest          diversity of transcripts on the basis of based EST and          serial analysis of gene expression SAGE analysis and          that the subset of genes expressed in brain is more          disjoint with the genes observed in colon than in ovary          This illustrates that a simple pool of RNA from diverse          cell lines can provide a superior reference                            Conclusion        DNA microarray assays performed using well optimized        laboratory protocols can produce highquality reproducible        data although the use of replicates particularly        dyereversal or flipdye assays are highly desirable        While global normalization of the data can help to provide        meaningful expression ratios a more sophisticated        normalization using lowess allows for correction of        intensitydependent artifacts in the data Together the        laboratory and analytical techniques described here can        produce highly precise and accurate data In the  assays        we performed the global SD limit corresponded to an        expression ratio between  fold and  fold        induction or repression with a mean of          corresponding to log          ratio values of     and          respectively with fewer than  of the data        points falling outside the  SD limit This suggests that        changes in gene expression smaller than the  fold        commonly used can be reliably identified as differential        expression More careful analysis of the distribution of        ratios as a function of intensity suggests that an        intensitydependent assessment of local SD of the        distribution provides a better measure of statistically        significant differential expression essentially        calculating a local         Z score The same holds true for        tissue RNA from tumor samples Individual labeling        reactions and hybridizations do not introduce significant        variability as judged from good correlations of replicate        experiments However a small number of outliers present in        replicate spots andor arrays can be filtered out        underlining the importance of replicates in generating        highquality expression data        Pooled reference samples should be designed on the basis        not only of representation of individual genes in each cell        line but also of expression levels of genes within the cell        lines Adding more cell lines to the pool does not        necessarily improve overall gene representation because        rare transcripts become undetectable when diluted in a pool        of a large number of cell lines        Overall the data presented herein derived from a large        number of RNA samples from cell lines and tissue suggest        that the laboratory and data analysis protocols we describe        should allow for a more accurate and reproducible        identification of differentially expressed genes than does        the selection of an arbitrary global foldchange threshold        chosen independent of any measure of the natural        variability in the data We propose a model for analysis of        cDNA microarray data consisting of three steps        lowessnormalization of individual arrays followed by        replica filtering to remove questionable elements and        finally estimation of the local         Z score for identification of        differentially regulated genes                    Materials and methods                  Array fabrication          cDNA

and Cy channels and stored as          paired TIFF images                          Data analysis          Spots were identified and local background subtracted          in the TIGRSpotfinder software   In the first step          a grid consisting of square cells is drawn around each          array element Spot segmentation is then performed using          a histogram segmentation method that uses the          distribution of pixel intensities to separate probable          signal from background and a binary thresholding approach          to identify spots followed by a procedure to exclude          disconnected features Raw intensity for each element is          obtained by first excluding saturated pixels and then          summing all remaining pixel intensities inside the spot          contour The area outside the spot contour but inside the          cell is used to calculate local background Background          per pixel is estimated as a median of the pixels in this          area and is multiplied by the spot area to give an          estimated spot background value In the final step this          integrated background value is subtracted from the raw          integrated spot intensity to produce the          backgroundsubtracted integrated intensities we use for          further analysis Furthermore a quality control QC          filter is used to remove questionable array features Two          criteria for spot rejection are a spot shape that          deviates greatly from a circle and low signaltonoise          ratio Spots for which the ratio of area to circumference          deviates by more than  from the value for an ideal          circle and spots containing fewer than  of pixels          above the median background value are flagged and          eliminated from further consideration This approach has          proved extremely robust to misidentification of the spot          boundaries and expression measures have shown it to be          both reproducible and verifiable The output data from          Spotfinder is available as additional data files          Lowess normalization was implemented using a native          Java implementation in
