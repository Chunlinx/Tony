                    Background        Kirs have numerous functions depending upon the member        of the family and the cells in which they are expressed        Most are open under resting membrane potentials and thus        help maintain the voltage across the membrane near the K        equilibrium potential Specific functions include        modulation of electrical activity of cardiac and neuronal        cells insulin secretion and epithelial K transport            The crystal structure of the transmembrane region of a K        channel KcsA from the bacteria         Streptomyces lividans has been        determined     Like KcsA Kirs are TM proteins that        have two transmembrane segments M and M that flank a P        segment The P segment transverses only the outer portion        of the transmembrane region The first part of P dips into        the transmembrane region as an helix and its latter        portion returns to the surface in a relatively extended        conformation that lies near the fourfold axis of the pore        Backbone oxygens from all four subunits of the latter        portion of P form a series of K binding sites and thus        determine the selectivity of the pore This K selectivity        filter region is the only portion of KcsA that shares        substantial sequence identity with eukaryotic Kirs Kir N        and Ctermini segments that precede and follow the MPM        motif contain regions that are well conserved among Kirs        see Fig  but that are not similar to sequences of any        other K channels In at least some Kirs these        cytoplasmic domains modulate the activity of the channel        Homology models     of the MPM portion of Kirs        have been developed using the backbone structure of KcsA        The validity of these models has been challenged by        experiments    that were interpreted as indicating that        the sequence alignment between KcsA and Kir proposed        originally by Doyle et al    for M and used in these        models is incorrect Fortunately the putative bacterial        KirBac sequences reported here can be aligned unambiguously        with the poreforming P and M segments of both KscA and        the eukaryotic Kirs This turns out to be the same        alignment that was used in developing the Kir homology        models                            Results        In analyzing evolutionary relationships among K        channels and their homologs we identified five        prokaryotic sequences that should code for proteins whose        closest relatives are Kirs The         Burkholderia pseudomallei KirBac         and         Burkholderia cepacia KirBac         sequences were determined by the Sequencing Group at the        Sanger Centre and can be obtained from        httpwwwsangeracukProjectsMicrobes The         Burkholderia fungorum LB        KirBac         Magentospirillum        magnetotacticum KirBac         and Nostoc Punctiforme KirBac        sequences are being determined by the DOE Joint Genome        Institute and can be found at httpwwwjgidoegov        These sequences are preliminary and could contain errors        The eukaryotic Kirs have been classified into seven        subfamilies called Kir  to Kir We used several        multisequence alignment methods PsiBlast     Clustal W             Pileup of the GCG package     to initially        align KirBac with eukaryotic Kir sequences accessible in        public databases The methods all predict essentially the        same alignment with only minor differences in the locations        of some insertions and deletions indels the final        alignment shown in Fig was adjusted manually for those        few positions where discrepancies arose Portions of the        sequences at the N and Ctermini that are difficult to        align because they are poorly conserved among the sequences        were not included in the calculations or Table or the        alignment of Fig  Table shows the evolutionary        distances calculated among members of the Kir family and        KirBac These analyses support the phylogenetic tree shown        in Fig  in which the eukaryotic Kirs and prokaryotic        KirBacs form two distinct families Members of each family        are more closely related to each other than to members of        the other family KirBac  and  were placed in        the same subfamily because of their high degree of        similarity as indicated in Table  The alignments used        for the calculations of Table and illustrated in Fig are        rigorous because they consider many sequences and almost        identical alignments are obtained with a variety of methods        that all take into account residue similarities as well as        identities However for illustrative purposes it is more        convenient to consider only identities for a few sequences        Fig illustrates our alignment of the KirBac sequences        with the Kir and Kir sequences Kir was selected        for the illustration because it is the Eukaroyte Kir        studied by Minor et al    and because it is closely        related to members of the Kir Kir and Kir subfamilies        see Fig  Kir was selected because it is the Kir        subfamily most distant from the other Kir subfamilies as        indicated in Table  Of the different K channel families        KirBacs were found to be most similar to the Kir        superfamily in the PsiBlast searches primarily because of        the homology of their similar relatively long Cterminal        sequences following the M segments When the MPM        regions of all of the different families of K channels are        compared one finds that the eukaryotic Kirs are the most        divergent Accordingly the MPM region of most        eukaryotic Kirs has numerous unique features that        distinguish them from other families of K channels These        features which are numbered in Fig under the Kir        sequence include in sequential order  A DxxTTxxDxxWR        motif immediately preceding M  a highly conserved        tryptophan in M  an insertion in the MP loop that        contains a CVxx V or I motif  the absence of an        aromatic residue at the first aromatic cuff position           in the P segment helix  a glutamine near the end of the        P helix  the absence of an aspartate at the end of the P        segment signature sequence TVGYGD and a RxxTxxCP motif in        the PM loop that is two residues longer than in most        other K channels  a glutamine in the first part of S        and  a hydrophilic residue Asn Asp or Glu near the        mid region of S that when negatively charged is involved        in blockade of some Kirs by Mg      Fig shows that        none of these features are present in the KirBacs In        fact if only the PM transmembrane poreforming region is        considered KirBacs are more similar to some other K        channel families than to the eukaryotic Kirs see below        This finding suggests that the common ancestor to KirBac        and the eukaryotic Kirs did not have these features and        that they developed after the divergence of the eukaryotic        Kir subfamilies        The intermediate nature of the KirBac PM region        between sequences of the eukaryotic Kir family and several        other K channel families can be analyzed several different        ways One way is to perform a Blast search of the        nonredundant database using only the PM or MPM        regions of KirBac When only the PM region is used the        highest scores are with members of the voltagegated K        channel family Kv and with members of a bacterial        family of putative K channels that have transmembrane        segments quite similar to those of the Kv family We call        this family Kbactm When the MPM region is used a        Blast search also finds some Kir sequences among the        highest scores To analyze these relationships more        quantitatively we aligned the MPM regions for  Kv         Kbactm and  Kir sequences We also aligned the        MPM region of KcsA with the ten bacterial sequences in        the microbial sequence database that were most similar to        KcsA to produce a KcsAlike family We then developed        sequence profiles from each of these multisequence        alignments To identify the best alignments of the Kir and        KirBac families to the transmembrane segments of these        families similarities of the sequence profiles were        calculated as described in the Methods for different        alignments of KirBacs for both the M and M segments The        length of the hydrophobic region of M is longer for Kirs        than for the other families To search for the best        alignment between Kir or KirBacs and the other families        longer M and M Kir and KirBac sequence profile blocks        where scanned through M and M blocks indicated in Fig        for the other families No indels were permitted in these        calculations because they are unlikely to occur in        transmembrane segments The P segment was not included in        this analysis due to the high number of identical residues        indicating the obviously correct alignment between the        different K channel families Z scores see Methods for        two alignments Alignment A of Fig and Alignment B        proposed by Minor et al     are given in Table  The        Z value is the number of standard deviations the raw        alignment score is from the mean of the normal distribution        of scores obtained by random permutations of the alignment        columns The more positive the Z value the less likely it        is that the alignment occured by chance and that the two        protein families are not related A Z value of zero        indicates that the alignment is no more likely than a        random permutation of the sequence of amino acids For M        Alignment A was best for all comparisons All Z values of        Alignment A are greater than  for all comparisons except        when the Kir family is compared to the nonKirs for which        the values range from  to  The finding that        Alignment A is clearly the best for comparisons of the        KirBac family to both the nonKir families and the Kir        family strengthens the argument that it is the proper        alignment for Kirs with the nonKirs Alignment A is also        predicted to be best by all of the other methods that we        used Except that for some Kir and KirBac sequences the        PhiBlast approach predicted that the two residue indel near        the beginning of S occurred within S instead of in the        PS loop We favor the loop location predicted by Clustal        W because indels are more likely to occur in loops than        within transmembrane helices Furthermore when Z values        were calculated for alignments of the different family        profiles this alignment was found to score quite highly        for Kirs even without considering KirBac see Table         The fact that KirBacs score are more similar to the Kv and        KbacTM families for M but as more similar to the Kirs        for the remaining portions of the protein illustrates their        intermediate nature        The best alignment for M is less apparent Alignment A        produces high Z scores when the M profiles of nonKir        families are compared to each other and when the KirBac        families are compared to the Kir family The Z scores of        Alignment A for comparisons of the Kir family to the other        families are also reasonably high  However the Z        scores for comparison of KirBac to the nonKir of families        are only between  and  and some other alignments        scored higher for comparisons of the KirBac family to the        Kv and Kbactm families Nonetheless Alignment A can be        inferred to be the best because it scores highest for        comparisons of KirBacs to Kirs and for comparisons of        Kirs to the other families M lies on the exterior of the        KscA crystal structure where it should be very exposed to        lipids when the protein is in a membrane see Fig a        This relatively exposed peripheral location explains why it        tends to be poorly conserved when different families are        compared        We favor Alignment A for M for several additional        reasons  This alignment does not require any indels for        alignment of KirBacs with most members of the Kv and        KcsAlike families for the entire MPM segments Indel        penalties were not included in our profile calculations         Second site suppressor experiments on Kir strongly        suggest that a serine residue in M forms a H bond with a        glutamine residue in M     This can occur when        Alignment A is used to develop homology models based on the        KcsA structure Futhermore when a homology model to be        presented elsewhere of KirBac was developed the        analogous glutamate residue in M which is absolutely        conserved among KirBacs can form HBonds to the two        adjacent asparagines residues in M the first of these is        analogous to the Kir serine mentioned above and the        second is absolutely conserved among KirBacs This        interaction between the most polar conserved residue on M        the glutamate and the most polar conserved residue on M        the asparagine cannot occur with most other alignments of        M when the strongly predicted Alignment A is used for M         When Alignment A is used to develop homology models        most residues that are highly conserved both within and        between the different families interact with residues of        other transmembrane segments This point is illustrated in        the helical wheel representations shown in Fig of the        MPM segments for the different families Note that both        M and M display patterns that we call unilateral        conservation    in which residues that are exposed to        lipid on the outer surface are poorly conserved and very        hydrophobic whereas those that interact with other protein        residues tend to be more highly conserved These patterns        would not be expected to be the same in the Kv and Kbactm        families because they have four additional transmembrane        segments per subunit that should surround their core        SPS region In these models residues that are        conserved among the different families tend to cluster        together either near the center of the pore where they        determine the K selectivity or at the region where M P        and M interact within the subunit In the latter case        most of the very highly conserved residues are small        glycine alanine serine threonine or cysteine Small        residues are common where axes of adjacent transmembrane         helices come close together     Although there is        little sequence similarity for the M and M sequences when        the Kir sequences are compared to those of the other        families the patterns of sequence conservation of the Kir        and KirBac families are remarkably similar to those of the        other families when Alignment A is used Also note that        many of the residues that are highly conserved within each        family are identical or very similar to residues that are        conserved within the KirBac family as indicated by the red        and orange dashed lines that encircle some of the side        chains        The patterns of sequence conservation in Fig are        complemented nicely by mutagenesis studies that have been        performed on Kirs as shown in Fig  For example note        how well the poorly conserved black and highly conserved        red orange and yellow residues of M for the KbacTM        family of Fig fcorrespond to the tolerant blue and        intolerant red Kir residues of M in Fig a that was        developed from the screening experiments of Minor et al            and note how well the poorly conserved residues black        blue cyan and green residues and highly conserved        residue positions magenta red and orange on M of the        KirBac Fig b and KcsAlike Fig d families        correspond to the tolerant blue and intolerant red M        Kir resiude positions of Fig b that were colored        according to results of alanine and tryptophan scanning        experiments     These similarities of residue        conservation patterns between Kirs and the other families        do not match as well for most other alignments between        Kirs and the other families        Three groups      have used Alignment A for M of        KcsA and the eukaryotic Kirs However based on the        results from yeast mutant screens that identify second site        suppressor mutations in M and M segments in Kir Minor        et al    proposed Alignment B in which the Kir        sequences of Fig would be shifted three positions to the        left relative to the other sequences for M while those        for M would be shifted three positions to the right They        proposed a model to explain their data in which the Kir        has a structure different from that of KcsA in which M        interacts with M helices of adjacent subunits throughout        the entire transmembrane region We are skeptical about the        validity of this model because our threedimensional        modeling efforts indicate that the Minor et al model        requires exclusion of the P segment from the transmembrane        region It is highly unlikely that the only portion of the        protein with substantial sequence identity between Kirs        and KcsA and that determines the selectivity of the        channels for potassium would have entirely different        structures andor exist in different locations in these two        proteins Our calculations indicate that Alignment B is        clearly inferior to Alignment A for both M and M in        fact the Z values in Table of Alignment B average zero        as expected for an incorrect alignment Futhermore        Alignment A requires no indels for the MPM regions for        most sequences which were not included in the        calculations whereas Alignment B requires two Finally in        our hands homology models based on KcsA developed with        Alignment A satisfy the mutagenesis data on which Alignment        B is based as do models using alignment B and models using        Alignment A are more consistent with mutagenesis studies of        other groups      No single model in which the P        segment has the structure of KcsA can satisfy all of the        second site suppressor data of Minor et al            However their data are from an open conformation and the        KcsA structure is probably a closed conformation Most of        their data can be satisfied by a combination of two        conformations by dramatically altering the position of M        and the inner portion of M for the open conformation        personal observation It is also conceivable that some of        the second site suppressor data are due to an essential        intermediate stage of protein folding that differs from the        final structure                    Conclusions        Gene transfer between organisms often complicates the        interpretation of their evolution There are now three        families of eukaryotic ion channel genes for which only a        few homologs have been identified in prokaryotes the first        family is a glutamateactivated K channel GluR           from Synechocystis PCC  that is homologous to        eukaryotic ionotrophic glutamate receptors the second        family is a Na channel NaChBac from         Bacillus halodurans               and homologous sequences from         Thermobifida fusca and         Magnetococcus sp MC personal        observation httpwwwjgidoegov with only one TM        motif per subunit that is homologous to the CatSper Ca        channel of sperm cells    and to each of four        homologous TM motifs of the poreforming subunit of        eukaryotic Ca channels and KirBac is the third family        In each case the nature of the prokaryotic sequence        supports the hypothesis that the gene evolved first in the        prokaryotes rather than being transferred to the prokaryote        from a eukaryote For example mutagenesis experiments            suggests that the ion selective region of eukaryotic        glutamate receptor pores have a gross structure similar to        that of K channels however only GluR has a K channel        signature sequence and forms a K selective channel This        is consistent with the hypothesis that glutamate receptors        evolved first in bacteria from K channels and then lost        their selectivity in eukaryotes Similarly the fact that        NaChBac is about equidistant from consensus sequences of        all four TM motifs of eukaryotic Ca channels    is        consistent with the hypothesis that Ca channels initially        evolved first in prokaryotes as homotetramers from TM        Kvlike channels and then underwent two consecutive gene        duplication events to evolve into the eukaryotic Ca        channels that have only one poreforming subunit that        contains four consecutive TM motifs Likewise the        hypothesis that KirBac evolved after transfer of a        eukaryotic Kir to a bacteria is inconsistent with several        findings  all eukaryotic Kirs are more closely related        to each other than to any KirBac  the PM region of        KirBacs is more similar to that of some other bacterial K        channels than it is to that of eukaryotic Kirs and         the MPM region of eukaryotic Kirs have numerous        features that occur in no other K channels including        KirBac Thus the Kirs probably evolved first in        prokaryotes as proteins similar to KirBac This finding        suggests KirBac has diverged less from the common ancestor        to KirBac and eukaryotic Kirs than have the eukaryotic        Kirs and supports the hypothesis that Kirs evolved first        in bacteria        The utility of bacterial channels in structural studies        has been made abundantly clear by the KcsA structure        Currently little is known about the threedimensional        structure of Kirs Thus determination of the structure of        KirBac would be a major breakthrough in understanding the        structure and functional mechanisms of this important        family of K channels Also it would be interesting to        compare the functional properties of KirBacs to those of        other Kirs Chimeric experiments in which proteins are        generated that combine part of a KirBac with part of a Kir        could be useful in identifying the role of features that        are conserved among eukaryotic Kirs but that are not        present in KirBacs                    Methods        Sequence searches were performed with the webbased        programs Blast and PsiBlast at        httpwwwncbinlmnihgovBLASTfor sequences that were        deposited in data bases and by tblastn at        httpwwwncbinlmnihgovMicrobJlastunfinishedgenomehtmlfor        unpublished microbial sequences The default matrix        BLOSUM and gap cost were used but a filter was not used        in these searches The Wisconsin Package Version         Genetics Computer Group GCG Madison Wisc USA was used        to align and edit multiple sequences and to calculated the        distance matrices Clustal W    was also used to        make multisequence alignments of the MPM region for        members of each Kir subfamily plus the other sequences        illustrated in Fig         Quantification of the similarity of the transmembrane        segments of the different channel families was accomplished        by first transforming the multiple sequence alignments into        logodds residue profile matrices This was done by the        method of Henikoff  Henikoff     as previously        described     In summary the first step was to weight        each sequence in a multiple sequence alignment block        according to its degree of similarity to the other        sequences which has the effect of minimizing the influence        of highly redundant sequences in the final profile These        weights were calculated according to the method of Henikoff         Henikoff     which is based on the residue        diversity at each position of the alignment Next the        sequenceweighted counts were used to calculate the        observed occurrence frequency of amino acid residues at        each column of the alignment block To these real residue        counts pseudocounts were added to better approximate the        full set of related sequences in nature of which only an        incomplete nonrandom sample is known Calculation of the        pseudocounts was based on the degree of diversity and        statistical substitution probabilities for the specific        residues occurring in each of the alignment columns The        recommended value of  times the residue diversity was        used for the total number of pseudocounts and the amino        acid substitution probabilities were taken from the BLOSUM         matrix     A substitution matrix based on        transmembrane helices    was also used in some cases        however the results were not altered substantially        Finally the logodds of occurrence of a specific residue        is obtained from the logarithm of the sum of real and        pseudocounts divided by the background frequency that        would occur in a random sequence by chance The latter was        calculated from the relative occurrence of all amino acids        in the SWISSPROT protein sequence database     The        final profiles were then constructed as matrices of        dimension  by the number of positions in the multiple        sequence alignment where the column vectors provide the        logodds of occurrence of the  different amino acids at        each position        Having numerically represented the distribution of        residues in the multiple sequence alignments the        similarity of two profiles was calculated according to the        method of Pietrokovski     Specifically the standard        Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for each        aligned pair of column vectors and summed over the length        of the alignment to provide a raw score This was then        converted to a Zscore which is the number of standard        deviations the raw score is from the mean of the normal        distribution of scores that would occur by chance This        distribution was estimated from the scores obtained by        randomly permuting the columns of one of the two profiles        over  thousand times In contrast to our previous method        of calculating the chance distribution from the Blocks        database     using the profiles corrects for the        specific composition of amino acids in the segments The        Zscore provides a measure of the statistical significance        that can be compared among pairs of aligned profiles More        positive scores are less likely to occur by chance and        thus indicate a greater probability that the two protein        segments are homologous                    Abbreviations        Kir Inward rectifying K channel        KirBac Inward rectifying K channel
