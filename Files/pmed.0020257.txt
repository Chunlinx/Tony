                            People living with HIVAIDS PLWA face many forms of stigma and discrimination This is        the case in whichever country they may live as has been shown in a number of previous        research studies In addition to experiencing unfair treatment in their families        communities and places of work PLWA may encounter discrimination from healthcare        professionals This can interfere with effective prevention and treatment Discriminatory        practices in the healthcare sector may also appear to legitimize other forms of        discrimination against PLWA        Vincent Iacopino and colleagues from the organization Physicians for Human Rights in        collaboration with researchers from Policy ProjectNigeria and the Center for the Right to        Health also in Nigeria investigated the problem in Nigeria With a population of roughly         million Nigeria is home to one in  of the  million PLWA worldwide Around  of        adult Nigerians are thought to be HIVpositive and there will be an estimated  AIDS        deaths this year The indications are that infection rates will increase Until now little        has been known about the nature and extent of discrimination against patients with HIVAIDS        in Nigeria        Trained interviewers conducted a crosssectional questionnaire survey of  Nigerian        healthcare professionals in  healthcare facilities in four of Nigerias  states        Those sampled were  physicians  nurses and  midwives and  healthcare workers        of unknown profession Fiftyfour percent of them worked in public tertiary care        facilities Many of the surveys results are worrying Nine percent of professionals        reported refusing to care for a patient with HIVAIDS and  said they had refused a        patient with HIVAIDS admission to a hospital Fiftynine percent agreed that PLWA should        be on a separate ward and  believed a persons HIV status could be determined by their        appearance Ninetyone percent agreed that staff should be informed when a patient was        HIVpositive in order to protect themselves Forty percent believed healthcare        professionals with HIVAIDS should not be allowed to work in any area of healthcare        requiring patient contact Twenty percent agreed that many with HIVAIDS had behaved        immorally and deserved their infection Eight percent felt that treating someone with        HIVAIDS was a waste of resources        Providers who reported working in facilities that did not always practice universal        precautions against HIV transmission were more likely to favor restrictive policies towards        PLWA In general basic materials needed for treatment and prevention of HIV infection were        not sufficiently available Providers who reported less adequate training in HIVAIDS        treatment and in ethics were more likely to report negative attitudes towards patients with        HIVAIDS There was no consistent pattern of differences in negative attitudes and        practices across the different professions surveyed        The researchers concluded that while most healthcare professionals surveyed reported        being in compliance with their ethical obligations discriminatory behavior and attitudes        towards patients with HIVAIDS existed among a significant proportion Inadequate education        about HIVAIDS and a lack of protective and treatment materials appear to favor these        practices and attitudes The findings of the study in just four states cannot be        generalized to Nigeria as a whole and although sampled systematically it is possible that        sampled facilities and healthcare professionals may differ significantly from those that        were not sampled in the study states Concerns over a perceived lack of privacy in the        interviews or about job status may have resulted in an underreporting of discriminatory        behavior andor an overreporting of correct practices or attitudes The authors note that        the healthcare system in Nigeria is underfunded and suffers from fundamental problems        including material scarcity and inadequacies in infrastructure both of which may        contribute to discriminatory behavior They call for targeted education of healthcare        professionals and provision of adequate resources to healthcare facilities and for the        introduction and enforcement of antidiscrimination policies
