                    Background        Spermatogenesis is a complex developmental process in        which male germ cells progress through mitotic        proliferation meiotic division and dramatic morphological        changes to form mature sperm This process is vital for the        propagation of a species and involves a large portion of        the genome of an organism to ensure the quality and        quantity of the final products It is estimated that        mutations in up to  of all genes in         Drosophila might lead to male        sterility     This is likely to be true for humans        also considering the extremely high incidence  of        infertility in men     Among the genes associated with        male infertility is the         DAZ Deleted in Azoospermia gene        family The family includes the Ylinked         DAZ genes that are present only in        great apes and old world monkeys     and the autosomal         DAZL DAZlike  and BOULE genes            in all mammals Deletion of the         DAZ genes is found in about  of        infertile males with idiopathic azoospermia     and        disruption of         Dazl causes infertility in both male        and female mice     Mutations in the         DAZ family members of         Drosophila             C elegans     and         Xenopus    also affect the        fertility in either males females or both sexes        The         DAZ gene family encodes RNA binding        proteins that are expressed specifically in germ cells DAZ        and DAZL are expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of        primordial germ cells and spermatogonia and in the        cytoplasm of meiotic spermatocytes      BOULE is        expressed later in the cytoplasm of pachytene        spermatocytes     Genetic and biochemical studies        suggest a role for the DAZ family in the regulation of mRNA        translation         Drosophila Boule mutants was        defective in the translation of the meiosisspecific CDC        homologue Twine     and DAZL was found to be        associated with polyribosomes in mouse testes     More        recently DAZL was shown both         in vitro and in a yeast threehybrid        system to bind specifically to oligoU stretches        interspersed by G or C residues including a Urich segment        in the  UTR of mouse         CdcC mRNA            In an attempt to elucidate the function of the         DAZ gene family and to understanding        the mechanisms of its action we used a yeast twohybrid        system to isolate two human genes encoding DAZ associated        proteins DAZAPs     One of them         DAZAP is expressed predominantly in        testes It encodes a protein with two RNA binding domains        and a proline rich Cterminal portion The DAZAP protein        interacted with both DAZ and DAZL         in vitro It also bound to RNA        homopolymers We now report our characterization of the        mouse         Dazap gene and its protein product        The subcellular localization of DAZAP suggests that it is        not involved directly in mRNA translation                    Results                  Characterization of the mouse DazapcDNA          Mouse           Dazap cDNA clones were isolated by          library screening and the  end of the cDNA was          isolated by  RACE     The near fall length cDNA          consists of a  bp  untranslated region UTR an open          reading frame for a protein of  amino acid residues          and a  bp  UTR GenBank Accession No AF The          coding region shares  similarity with that of the          human orthologue The  UTR sequence is remarkably          conserved It contains three segments of  bp  bp          and  bp that share   and  similarity with          segments in the human  UTR respectively These          segments probably contain regulatory elements          The DAZAP protein contains two RNAbinding domains          RBDS and a Cterminal portion that is rich in proline          Figure  It is highly conserved evolutionarily The          mouse and the human proteins differ in  amino acids          only with  substitutions and two deletionsinsertions          The mammalian proteins shares  similarity and           identity with           Xenopus Prrp for prolinerich RNA          binding protein     The two RBDs are especially          highly conserved They share  and  similarity and           and  identity respectively between DAZAP and          Prrp These proteins may therefore have a similar RNA          binding specificity The Cterminal prolinerich portions          of DAZAP and Prrp are less conserved  similarity and           identity There is an insertion of a  bp segment          in Prrp cDNA that causes a change of reading frame and          results in a shorter Prrp with a different Cterminal end          sequence                          Genomic structure of Dazapand chromosomal          mapping          Several overlapping lambda clones containing mouse           Dazap genomic sequences were          isolated The locations of exons were determined by PCR          amplification across exonintron boundaries following by          sequencing All but the first exon were isolated and          mapped The genomic structure of the human           DAZAP gene was also determined by          blasting the human genome sequence at National Center for          Biotechnology Information with the human           DAZAP cDNA sequence The mouse and          the human genes have very similar structures consisting          of  exons spanning about  kb All intron insertion          sites are conserved Table  The two RBDs are encoded          by exons  and  respectively          A pair of PCR primers was designed from           Dazap intronic sequences that          amplified mouse but not hamster genomic sequences Using          a panel of mousehamster radiation hybrids the mouse           Dazap gene was mapped to          chromosome  placed  cR from DMit lod            data not shown This region is syntenic to human          p where the human           DAZAP gene is located               It contains no known mutant alleles that are associated          with infertility                          Expression of Dazap          Northern analyses of adult mouse tissues showed the          presence of two           Dazap transcripts of  kb and           kb respectively Figure  Only the shorter          transcript has been isolated in cDNA clones           Dazap was expressed most          abundantly in the testis much less in liver heart and          brain and even less in other tissues This pattern of          expression is similar to that of the human           DAZAP  RTPCR analyses showed          that           Dazap mRNA was already present in          fetal testes at embryonic day  similar to           Dazl mRNA Figure  The          expression of both           Dazl and           Dazap persisted throughout testes          development in both the prenatal and postnatal periods           Dazl and           Dazap transcripts were also          present in the testes of W vW vmutant mice which          contained diminished number of germ cells              However only           Dazap was expressed in a mouse          germ cell line GClspg    and a Sertoli cell line          MT The results suggest that           Dazap is expressed in both somatic          and germ cells in the testis          To study the expression of the DAZAP protein two          antibodies against mouse DAZAP were generated The anti          DAZAPC antibody was raised against a recombinant          protein containing the Cterminal prolinerich portion          and the anti DAZAPP antibody was raised against an          oligopeptide containing the last  amino acid residue at          the Cterminus Both antibodies recognized           in vitro synthesized DAZAP in an          immunoprecipitation assay data not shown Western          blotting of mouse tissue extracts detected a  kD          protein that was present most abundantly in the testis          and to a lesser degree in spleen liver lung and brain          Figure  The protein was also present in the ovary          The expression of DAZAP during germ cell development          paralleled that of DAZL Figure  It is present at a          low level in the testes of  days old mice which          contained only primitive type A spermatogonia The          expression of DAZAP increased afterward as the testes          contained increasing number of proliferating and meiotic          germ cells                          Subcellular localization of DAZAP          Our previous fractionation of mouse testis extracts          showed that most DAZL were present in the post          mitochondrial fraction and some of them were associated          with polyribosomes     Similar analyses showed that          a majority of DAZAP in adult mouse testes was also          present in the cytoplasmic fraction data not shown          However sucrose gradient analyses of the post          mitochondria fraction showed that unlike DAZL DAZAP          did not cosediment with polyribosomes Figure                             Discussion        RNAbinding proteins have been found to participate in        many cellular functions including RNA transcription        premRNA processing mRNA transport localization        translation and stability     A role for the DAZ        family in the regulation of mRNA translation is supported        by lines of circumstantial evidence including the        association of DAZL with polyribosomes     The absence        of DAZAP from polyribosomes indicates that it is not        directly involved in protein synthesis This finding is        different from two RNAbinding proteins FXRP and FXRP        that were identified through their interaction with another        polysomalassociated RNAbinding protein the fragile X        mental retardation protein     Both FXRP and FXRP        are associated with the polyribosomes            The significance of the interaction between DAZAP and        DAZLDAZ remains to be defined These proteins may act        together to facilitate the expression of a set of genes in        germ cells For example DAZAP could be involved in the        transport of the mRNAs of the target genes of DAZL        Alternatively DAZL and DAZAP may act antagonistically to        regulate the timing and the level of expression Such an        antagonistic interaction between two interacting        RNAbinding proteins is exemplified by the neuronspecific        nuclear RNAbinding protein Nova Nova regulates the        alternative splicing of the premRNAs encoding neuronal        inhibitory glycine receptor  GlyR      The        ability of Nova to activate exon selection in neurons is        antagonized by a second RNAbinding protein brPTB        brainenriched polypyrimidine tractbinding protein        which interacts with Nova and inhibits its function            DAZAP could function in a similar manner by binding to        DAZL and inhibiting its function Comparing the phenotypes        of         Dazl and         Dazap single and double knockout        mice may provide some clues to the significance of their        interaction         Dazl knockout mice have already        been generated and studied     The spermatogenic defect        in the male becomes apparent only after day  post partum        when the germ cells are committing to meiosis H Cooke        personal communication The genomic structure of         Dazap delineated here should        facilitate the generating of         Dazap null mutation        DAZAP was shown to bind RNA homopolymers         in vitro with a preference for poly        U and poly G Its natural substrates have not been        identified Recently the         Xenopus orthologue of DAZAP Prrp        was identified and characterized     Prrp binds to a         nt sequence in the  UTR of         Xenopus Vg mRNA This Vg        localization element VLE is sufficient for the migration        and clustering of         Vg mRNA to the vegetal cortex of        mature oocyte Prrp also interacts through its prolinerich        domain with two microfilamentassociated proteins profilin        and Mena which may facilitate the anchoring of         Vg mRNA to the vegetal cortex The         Vg RNA encodes a member of the        transforming growth factor family that is required for        generating dorsal mesoderm at the blastula stage of         Xenopus embryogenesis            Sequence conservation between the RBDs of DAZAP and Prrp        suggests that these proteins may bind to similar RNA        sequences However a BLAST search of the GenBank for the         nt VLE sequence failed to identify any mammalian        sequences with significant homology Further mapping of the        RNA sequence within VLE that binds Prrp and possibly        DAZAP may help to identify the natural substrates of        DAZAP                    Conclusions        DAZAP is an evolutionarily conserved RNAbinding        protein It is present at variable levels in many tissues        Its predominant expression in testes suggests a role in        spermatogenesis In mouse testes DAZAP was found both in        the nuclei and in the cytoplasm Its absence from        polyribosomes indicates that it is not directly involved in        mRNA translation                    Materials and methods                  Isolation of mouse DazapcDNA clones                    Dazap cDNA clones were isolated          from a mouse testis cDNA library  Stratagene La          Jolla CA using a human           DAZAP cDNA as a probe The  end          of the cDNA was isolated by  RACE     using          prdap ttgcgggccatatccttg  as the primer for          cDNA synthesis from mouse testis RNA and prdap          ttgttgccacgtgggcg  and an adaptor primer as          the primers for PCR amplification The PCR products were          cloned into a TA cloning vector pCRTOPO Invitrogen          Carlsbad CA           Dazap clones were identified by          colony hybridization and sequenced The  RACE clone          with the longest  UTR region and the cDNA clone P          were ligated together through a unique           Pml I site at   to generate a          cDNA clone DazapC with a near fulllength insert                          Chromosomal mapping of Dazap                    Dazap genomic clones were isolated          from a mouse SV genomic library  Stragagene          and sequences flanking each exons were determined PCR          primers prdap cacctccaggatgtgttagc and          prdazpgtcaccaagggtgtctgaag were designed from          intronic sequences flanking           Dazap exon  These primers          amplified a  bp fragment from mouse but not hamster          genomic DNA DNA samples of a panel of  radiation          hybrids containing mouse chromosome fragments in a          hamster background were purchased from Research Genetics          Huntsville AL The presence of mouse           Dazap in the radiation hybrids was          determined by PCR and the results were sent to the MIT          server wwwgonomewimitedumouserhindexhlmlfor          computerized physical mapping of the gene                          Expression of Dazaptranscripts          Northern hybridization was carried out according to          standard procedures    using a mouse Multiple Tissue          Northern Blot  from Clontech Palo Alto CA The          blot was hybridized sequentially with           DAZAP and actin cDNA probes          with stripping of the bound probes in between          Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction          RTPCR was carried out as preciously described using an          annealing temperature of C     The primers were          prdap agctcagggagtacttcaaga and prdap          ggagcttgattcttgctgtcc for           Dazap which generated a product of           bp and prdaz atcgaactggtgtgtcgaagg and prdaz          ggaggctgcatgtaagtctca for           Dazl which generated a product of           bp Both primer pairs annealed across intron          insertion sites                          Generation of antiDAZAP antibodies          Antibodies were generated against both a recombinant          protein produced in           E coli and an oligopeptide          synthesized           in vitro The insert of a           Dazap cDNA clone P which          encoded the Cterminal portion of DAZAP starting from          aa  was cloned inframe into the           Eco RI           Xho I sites of an expression vector          pETb Novagen Madison WI Sequences at the junctions          were verified by DNA sequencing Milligrams of fusion          proteins between thioredoxin and DAZAP were prepared and          purified on HisBind metal chelation resins Novagen          Madison WI The proteins were mixed with Freunds          adjuvant and injected into rabbits to generate the          antiDAZAPlC antibody An oligopeptide containing the          last  ammo acid residues of the mouse DAZAP was          synthesized           in vitro using the services of          Bethyl Laboratories Montgomery TX The peptide was          conjugated to KLH as carrier and injected into a goat          The antiDAZAPP antibody thus produced was purified on          an affinity column containing the oligopeptide          antigen                          Western blotting          Mouse tissues were homogenized in the RIPA lysis          buffer  mM NaCl  NP  DOC  SDS           mM Tris pH  at a concentration of  g tissue per          ml of buffer The homogenized samples were cleared of          debris by centrifugation at   g for  minutes          Protein concentration of the tissue extracts was          determined by the Bradford method using the BioRad          Protein Assay system BioRad Hercules CA About  g          of tissue extracts were separated on           SDSpolyacrylamide gels and blotted with either the          antiDAZAPC antibody at a  dilution or the          antiDAZAPP antibody at a  dilution After          incubation with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated          secondary antibodies the binding of antibodies was          detected using the ECL Western Blotting System Amersham          Pharmacia Biotech Piscataway NJ                          Fractionation of mouse
