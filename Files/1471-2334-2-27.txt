                    Background        Several anionic polymers were shown to have HIV        inhibitory activity and are being considered and evaluated        as vaginal topical microbicides for prevention of        transmission of sexually transmitted disease STD        pathogens including HIV These polymers belong to        several classes  sulfate esters of polysaccharides        dextrin and dextran sulfates                      cellulose sulfate        sulfate esters of        galactose  anhydrogalactose copolymers carrageenan                 polymers containing sulfonated        benzene or naphthalene rings polystyrenesulfonate             and naphthalene sulfonate polymers PRO              and  polycarboxylates acrylic acid polymers        Carbomer P BufferGel         and acetyl        phthaloyl cellulose cellulose acetate phthalate CAP                          The mechanisms involved in sexual transmission of HIV        appear to be complex and are not yet fully defined             Thus a microbicide with HIV inhibitory activity        could provide protection         in vivo only if both the compound and        the virus reach susceptible cells before productive        infection could occur This might be difficult to        accomplish For this reason it is preferable that        microbicides irreversibly inactivate the virus upon the        first compoundHIV encounter in the vaginal environment        ie microbicides should have direct virucidal activity        Such activity was reported for dextran sulfate after  h        incubation with HIV    but results of other studies        indicated that dextran sulfate failed to neutralize virus        infectivity      Inactivation of HIV by carrageenan        was reported in a review article     BufferGel is        virucidal against HIV by providing a buffered low pH        environment pH      but virus inactivation might        be incomplete and possibly compromised by minor pH        increases due to the presence of seminal fluid     To        be effective in preventing infection by direct virus        inactivation antiHIV microbicides must be virucidal        against both X and R viruses utilizing CXCR and CCR as        coreceptors      respectively R HIV being most        frequently sexually transmitted Recent results             R Shattock personal communication indicate that CAP in        soluble form meets these requirements Since CAP unlike        the other polymers listed above is not soluble at low pH        characteristic for a normal vaginal environment            micronized forms of CAP had to be used in microbicidal        formulations of this compound                Therefore it was of interest to determine how CAP in        micronized form and other candidate polymeric microbicides        affect X and R viruses represented by HIV IIIB and BaL        respectively                    Methods                  Reagents          Aquateric the

Measurements of HIV infectivity          Twofold serial dilutions of HIV IIIB treated with          distinct anionic polymers and separated from these          polymers by precipitation with  PEG or by          centrifugation at  rpm for  h and control virus           l respectively were added to HeLaCDLTRgal          cells which had been plated a day before infection in          well plates at    cellswell in  l of DMEM          medium containing  fetal bovine serum FBS In some          experiments antiHIV tat IgG  g was added to          treated and control virus to suppress the effect of          extracellular tat which may have been present in the          virus preparations on virus infection      After          incubation at C for  h the culture supernatant          fluids were removed and the cells washed once with PBS          Subsequently  l of lysis buffer from the          GalactoLight Plus kit were added to the wells for  h at          C Aliquots  l of the cell lysates were          transferred into wells of well microplates and          galactosidase was quantitated using the GalactoLight          Plus System chemiluminescence reporter assay in a          Microlight ML  luminometer Dynatech Laboratories          Inc Chantilly VA The infectivity of treated and          control HIV BaL was measured by the same method except          that MAGICCR cells were used          Measurement of HIV infectivity in seminal fluid is          impeded by the cytotoxicity of seminal plasma               contributed to by spermine     Such effects were          minimized by using for titrations of virus infectivity          pellets after precipitation with  PEG or after          centrifugation  rpm for  h                            Results                  Micronized CAP induces gp sixhelix bundle          formation and is virucidal against HIV          Earlier studies      indicated that soluble CAP          at neutral pH binds to the CXCR and CCR coreceptor          binding sites on HIV IIIB and BaL respectively and          induced the formation of deadend gp sixhelix          bundles These two properties of soluble CAP appear to be          involved in the virus inhibitory and virucidal activities          of this compound However CAP is not soluble at  pH           and would precipitate in a healthy human vaginal          environment which is mildly acidic with a pH range of                 The precipitate would have drastically          reduced antiviral activity To overcome this problem CAP          in a micronized form was used and proven to have          virucidal activity against HIV IIIB    and shown to          be effective in reducing vaginal infection by simian          immunodeficiency virus SIV in a macaque model              Micronized CAP provides a low pH buffering system and          this may have contributed to its virucidal properties In          order to correlate the properties of CAP in soluble and          micronized forms it was necessary to establish whether          or not micronized CAP would bind HIV virus particles          and HIV envelope glycoproteins and induce the          formation of gp sixhelix bundles a marker of          irreversible virus inactivation as did soluble CAP              First it was established that HIV gp bound to          micronized CAP provided in the form of micronized CAP          particles or of a commercial product Aquateric          containing about  of CAP and used for enteric coating          of tablets and capsules in the pharmaceutical industry              Fig  Similar results were obtained when          gp was diluted in seminal fluid diluted  with           M NaCl Under these conditions   of gp          bound to micronized CAP and Aquateric final          concentration of CAP  mgml respectively HIV          IIIB and BaL virus particles also bound effectively in          the presence of seminal fluid to Aquateric formulated          into a topical gel Fig           As a result of interaction with micronized CAP in the          form of Aquateric the integrity of both HIV IIIB and          HIV BaL virus particles was strikingly affected as          indicated by the observation that most of the p antigen          after virus contact with micronized CAP was no longer          precipitable by  polyethylene glycol  PEG unlike          p antigen within untreated virus particles which          precipitates under these conditions Fig           Furthermore interaction with micronized CAP elicited the          formation of gp sixhelix bundles which were          undetectable or present at low levels in untreated virus          particles     The sixhelix bundles detectable by          ELISA were mostly not precipitable by  PEG indicating          that they were no longer associated with virus particles          Fig  Furthermore they were detected partially          HIV IIIB or entirely HIV BaL in a form not bound          anymore to the micronized CAP particles unlike most of          the virusderived p antigen This suggests that          interaction of virus particles with micronized CAP          resulted in stripping off of the viral envelopes which          was more noticeable with HIV BaL than with HIV          IIIB          To confirm that gp six helix bundle formation was          caused by contact of virus particles with the micronized          form of CAP  Aquateric and not by low pH contributed          by CAP purified HIV III B and BaL respectively was          exposed for  min at C to acidic buffers final pH              and  The suspensions were          neutralized and assayed by ELISA for sixhelix bundles          The results were negative absorbance in the  to           range the same as for viruses exposed to pH  in the          absence of CAP Poloxamer a constituent of Aquateric            at a final concentration of  mgml also did not          induce the formation of sixhelix bundles          Results shown above indicated that HIV adsorbed onto          micronized CAP and that the CAP  virus interaction lead          to the formation of gp sixhelix bundles a hallmark          for HIV inactivation    To confirm that contact of          virus with micronized CAP leads to loss of HIV          infectivity HIV IIIB and BaL respectively were          diluted in seminal fluid and the diluted virus          preparations were mixed with an Aquateric formulation          for composition see legend to Fig  at volume ratios          of   and  for  min at C Subsequently the          micronized Aquateric particles were sedimented by          centrifugation The supernatant fluids were brought to pH           and the pellets were dissolved by addition of Na            PO            final pH   All fractions were          then precipitated by  PEG and the redissolved pellets          tested at  to fold dilutions for infectivity see          Methods section Infectious virus was undetectable            and   inactivation of HIV IIIB and BaL          respectively Similar results were obtained with other          CAP formulations data not shown                          Induction of sixhelix bundle formation by          polymeric anionic candidate microbicides          Since elicitation of gp sixhelix bundles might be          involved in or contribute to the virucidal activity of          candidate microbicides it was of interest to determine          whether anionic polymers other than CAP also induced          sixhelix bundle formation in HIV IIIB and BaL virus          particles          Results in Fig show that carrageenan cellulose          sulfate dextran sulfate polynapthalene sulfonate and          polystyrenesulfonate all elicit gp sixhelix          bundle formation in HIV IIIB but somewhat less          effectively in comparison with CAP On the other hand          Carbomer P the active ingredient in BufferGel was          inactive in this respect Strikingly different results          were obtained for HIV BaL Fig  and show that only          CAP and to a lesser extent polynapthalene sulfonate          elicited gp sixhelix bundles detectable by ELISA                          Effect of anionic polymeric microbicide candidates          on the integrity of HIV particles          Since micronized CAP caused the dissociation of HIV          particles     Fig  it was of interest to          determine whether anionic polymeric candidate          microbicides in soluble form at neutral pH would have          similar effects While no such effects were seen with          HIV IIIB the integrity of HIV BaL appeared to be          partially diminished by treatment with CAP and          drastically affected by cellulose sulfate Fig  The          latter finding was confirmed by the observation that          HIV BaL gp was no longer precipitable by  PEG or          pellettable by centrifugation after treatment of the          virus with cellulose sulfate unlike gp associated          with untreated virus particles Fig  This was not          seen with cellulose sulfate treated HIV IIIB data not          shown                          Comparative virucidal activity of polymeric anionic          microbicide candidates          HIV IIIB and BaL respectively were treated with          the distinct polymers  mgml for  min at C and          the infectivity of the treated viruses was compared with          that of control untreated HIV In repeated experiments          with HIV IIIB soluble and micronized CAP cellulose          sulfate polynaphthalene sulfonate          polystyrenesulfonate and BufferGel respectively          caused a  fold reduction in infectivity while          dextran sulfate carrageenan and Carbomer P pH           respectively were less effective  to fold          reduction in infectivity A typical example for HIV          IIIB is shown in Fig           Representative results shown in Fig indicate that          the polymers differed from each other more substantially          with respect to their capacity to inactivate HIV BaL          micronized CAP cellulose sulfate BufferGel and the aryl          sulfonates being most effective                          Inhibitory effect of polymeric anionic microbicide          candidates on blood clotting          For the selection of the most promising candidate          microbicides it is important to compare not only their          virus inhibitory and virucidal activities but to also          study their potential untoward effects Since heparin and          other anionic polymers are known to inhibit blood          clotting     the effect of anionic polymeric          microbicide candidates on blood clotting was measured          While CAP carrageenan and BufferGel Carbomer P had          moderate or no effects cellulose sulfate dextran          sulfate polynapthalene sulfonate and          polystyrenesulfonate greatly inhibited clotting of          ACD plasma Fig  The increase in clotting time might          be potentially undesirable for topical applications under          conditions of local preexisting injury or bleeding                            Discussion        Several anionic polymers are being considered as topical        microbicides to prevent sexual transmission of HIV They        include  sulfate esters of polysaccharides carrageenan                cellulose sulfate        and        dextran or dextrin sulfate                       aryl sulfonates polynaphthalene sulfonate             and polystyrenesulfonate      and         aliphatic Carbomer PBufferGel         and        aromatic carboxylates CAP                   The antiHIV properties of these polymers are expected to        depend on their complexation with virus proteins which is        likely to occur mainly through the formation of salt        linkages or ion pairs between oppositely charged groups on        the polymers and virus proteins respectively            However the antiHIV properties of these polymers may        depend not only on their charge density but also on the        characteristics of their uncharged portions which may be        involved in hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions        which can elicit profound conformational changes in        hydrophobic regions of proteins and cause disassembly of        complex proteins consisting of subunits     For these        reasons it is not be expected that all anionic polymers        considered as antiHIV microbicides would have similar        biological activities                In vivo protection by antiHIV        compounds against sexual transmission of the virus could        only be accomplished if the compounds at sufficient        concentrations and the virus both reach susceptible cells        within genital mucosa before productive infection could        occur      Considering the complex events involved        in sexual transmission of HIV this might not be easily        accomplished Therefore inactivation of HIV infectivity        preceding virus contact with susceptible target cells        should be considered a preferred mechanism of protection        against infection For this reason it was of interest to        study the virucidal activity of anionic polymeric        microbicide candidates against both X using CXCR as        coreceptor and R using CCR as coreceptor viruses the        latter being most frequently transmitted sexually                   Soluble CAP at neutral pH was shown to bind strongly to        the coreceptor binding sites on gp of both X and R        viruses    and to elicit the formation of gp        sixhelix bundles the hallmark of irreversible virus        inactivation     Thus HIV exposed to CAP at        sufficient concentrations is rendered noninfectious and        continued presence of CAP is not required to maintain lack        of infectivity CAP differs from all other anionic polymers        listed above in that it is not soluble at pH          Therefore CAP would be expected to precipitate in a normal        acidic vaginal environment To avoid this CAP in        micronized form which does not aggregate at low pH        instead of CAP in soluble form is being considered as a        topical microbicide          Micronized CAP        Aquateric was shown to be virucidal against HIV        herpesviruses and several nonviral sexually transmitted        disease STD pathogens         The virucidal        activity of micronized CAP could at least partly be        explained by its buffering capacity at low pH    since        it is a free acid while other anionic polymeric microbicide        candidates except BufferGel the active ingredient of        which is Carbomer P     are sodium salts Results        presented here explain how micronized CAP inactivates        HIV Both the envelope glycoprotein gp Fig  and        HIV IIIB and BaL virus particles Fig  in the presence        of an excess of nonviral proteins including seminal fluid        bind effectively to micronized CAP Under         in vivo conditions when the virus        concentrations are by one to four orders of magnitude lower        than those used here under experimental conditions             Fig  this would be expected to physically remove        virus particles by adsorption onto micronized CAP        Aquateric so that they would cease to be available to        initiate the complex sequence of events leading to mucosal        infection Furthermore interaction with micronized CAP        elicits the formation of gp sixhelix bundles and causes        the stripping off of HIV envelope glycoproteins Fig         The formation of gp sixhelix bundles was not due to        exposure to a low pH environment provided by the micronized        CAP since exposure to low pH buffers did not elicit gp        sixhelix bundle formation In summary the contact of        HIV IIIB and HIV BaL representatives of X and R        viruses respectively with micronized CAP resulted in a        complex sequence of events involving virus adsorption        exposure to low pH induction of gp sixhelix bundles        and stripping off of viral envelopes and virus        disintegration ultimately resulting in loss of        infectivity        In order to contribute to the understanding of the        potential virucidal activity of anionic polymers their        capacity to induce gp sixhelix bundle formation was        measured and compared with that of CAP in soluble form pH         All polymers except Carbomer P elicited gp        sixhelix bundle formation in HIV IIIB albeit in some        cases less efficiently in comparison with CAP Fig  On        the other hand gp sixhelix bundle formation in HIV        BaL was detectable only for CAP and polynaphthalene        sulfonate treated virus Fig  suggesting differences        among the anionic polymers with respect to their activity        against the R virus HIV BaL The induction of sixhelix        bundles in HIV does not seem to be the only mechanism        involved in virucidal activity of anionic polymers compare        Fig with Figs and  and there might be other        contributing processes        Since CAP in micronized form was shown to cause        disintegration of HIV virus particles     Fig         it was of interest to determine whether any of the other        anionic polymeric microbicide candidates affect the        integrity of virus particles While HIV IIIB was not        affected significantly by any of the polymers tested CAP        to some extent but surprisingly cellulose sulfate affected        the integrity of HIV BaL particles Fig  These        results were supported by the observation that HIV BaL        gp after treatment with cellulose sulfate unlike virus        associated gp did not become precipitated with  PEG        and failed to pellet by centrifugation under conditions        leading to sedimentation of intact virus particles Fig         The differential sensitivity of an R virus HIV        BaL as compared to an R virus HIV IIIB to the same        negatively charged polyelectrolyte appears unprecedented to        the best of our knowledge        Among the three polysaccharide sulfate esters        carrageenan cellulose sulfate and dextran sulfate        cellulose sulfate appeared to be more effective against        HIV BaL than the other polymers This might be due to the        polysaccharide backbone of cellulose    with a        propensity to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and        to be involved in hydrophobic interactions more than        soluble dextrans    and galactose         anhydrogalactose copolymers  the saccharide moiety of        carrageenan      Among the two polymers containing        aryl sulfonates polynapthalene sulfonate was more        effective than polystyrenesulfonate with respect to        induction of gp sixhelix bundles in HIV BaL This        difference may possibly be due to the high propensity of        the uncharged part of the molecule polynaphtalene to be        involved in hydrophobic interactions Among the two        carboxylate polymers Carbomer P and CAP only soluble        CAP at neutral pH was able to elicit the formation of        gp sixhelix bundles in both HIV IIIB and BaL and was        virucidal against both of these viruses The insoluble        micronized form of CAP had similar properties The        differences in biological activities of these polymers is        probably due to their noncharged portions ie mainly the        occurrence of benzene rings in CAP        Polycarboxylates soluble CAP and Carbomer P Fig         had a minimal effect on plasma coagulation Among the        sulfonates and polysaccharide sulfates carrageenan and        polynapthalene sulfonate had lower anticoagulant        activity in comparison with cellulose sulfate dextran        sulfate and polystyrenesulfonate Fig         Consideration of these side effects might contribute to the        process of selection of preferred microbicides for future        largescale use                    Conclusions        Among anionic polymers considered as topical        microbicides to prevent sexual transmission of HIV        Carbomer PBufferGel carrageenan CAP cellulose        sulfate dextrandextrin sulfate polynapthalene        sulfonate and polystyrenesulfonate CAP formulated        in a micronized form is the only compound which has a        capacity to remove from physiological fluids infectious        virus by adsorption onto the micronized particles The        interaction between HIV IIIB a representative of X        viruses and HIV BaL a representative of R viruses        with the micronized form of CAP has the following        consequences  elicitation of deadend gp sixhelix        bundles expected to render the virus incompetent to fuse        with target cells  loss of virus integrity and stripping        off of the envelope glycoproteins and  inactivation of        virus infectivity Elicitation of gp sixhelix bundles        and virucidal activity represent shared properties between        micronized and soluble at sufficient concentrations forms        of CAP            As determined by ELISA the aforementioned polymers        other than CAP except Carbomer P also elicited gp        sixhelix bundle formation in HIV IIIB albeit less        effectively than CAP On the other hand only        polynapthalene sulfonate in addition to CAP elicited        detectable sixhelix bundle formation in HIV BaL This        suggests that X and R viruses may be differently affected        by some of the polymeric compounds being considered as        topical microbicides This was confirmed by the results of        assays for virucidal activity                    Abbreviations used        ACD acid
