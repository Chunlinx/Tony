        kinds of music are you into     uh well i i like lots of different kinds of music   yeah same here   uh my uh my uh upbringing was in classical music but um i really enjoy um   uhhuh   all all different kinds of music for example i i really get a kick out of Rush and uh and Pink Floyd   uhhuh they just played here in Atlanta not too long ago   oh yeah   uhhuh they played uh with uh Primus have you heard of them   um no i dont think so   yeah i didnt i didnt get to go to it then i know some people that did and they they said it was a really great show   yeah yeah im sure it was um i also like jazz   uhhuh what kind like modern or   and um well yeah well yeah i like Fusion but i also like uh the classics      yeah im kind of im more into the the traditional like um        Flonies Smunk and uh Cole Don Cole Train maybe uh i like Winten Mersalis   yeah hes great   yeah   he is hes very good   he was i think hes i read in the paper i was thinking about going down to the Jazz festival in New Orleans its like a i think might be the end of April but um i think hes supposed to be playing there he played in he played in town in here in Atlanta a little while ago too but i didnt have the money  it was like eighteen bucks or something   yeah now i saw him along time ago before he had achieved fame at the uh Jazz Festival they had in Cleveland   oh really oh really God that mustve been great   yeah he he is really good um i i i even enjoy uh some of the old timers like even uh uh from like the big band era like Bennie Goodman or   uhhuh   uh i saw him play uh when i was a kid also uh of course he by that time he was he was an old man but it was still fun to uh fun to listen too him   uhhuh yeah thatd been weird seems like a that seems like a long time ago im im kind of i dont know im into a lot of different kinds of music too i like that kind that kind of jazz and um a lot of different kinds of rock music not really pop type music you know like radio a lot of radio play like the stuff i listen to but its not you know strictly alternative either   right   its kind of i like um lets see theres some local bands from Atlanta like have you ever heard of uh Fuller for Now theyre theyre real new   yeah   theyve theyve theyve gotten in Rolling Stone a couple times        but uh they just put an album out um the Red Hot Chili Peppers uh Fishbone theyve got theyve got some horns i i like i like bands with horns   yeah   that rock with horns it sounds really neat   yeah i did too i i i one of the things given given my classical background uh one of the things that really turns me on is uh when the musicians are are creative with their instrumentation   uhhuh yeah   um as well as you know the typical creative lyrics or or or melodies i also like thats one of the reasons for example that i like Rush is because its not always   right   you know in two or in four even meter you know it they they they mix it up they they do interesting things with rhythms and they do interesting things with   right umhum yeah their drummers unbelievable   yeah and also um Getty Lee on the base   yeah uhhuh   um its not just a straight base line that just repeats over and over and over again like on the pop tunes it right it it it it it changes up   yeah definitely do you play any instruments   um yeah i play i play uh uh oboe and English horn in fact um ive actually started playing again   oh really   uh i played when i was uh up through college in my first year of college and uh uh then college got the best of me and then i got married and had kids and and i really havent had very much time to play but uh i have i found a friend who   uhhuh uhhuh   i met somebody in town who had kids became friendly with and discovered that we both played oboe in college so weve been trying to uh get together once a month or once every couple of weeks and   well thats good   and and play a little bit mostly uh its mostly remedial work for us because we we were both out of shape   uhhuh yeah i bet i id never played really anything throughout school i never i dont know i never got in it i thought it would take too much time and all that then i i um i started getting into uh drums i got this bongo that someone had left at our house and i sort of play on that and i got i got a drum set like three months ago     oh cool   and ive weve got extra room in our house and ive been driving all my roommates crazy playing on that but i really need to       get like i know this guy that i think im going to try to get to uh give me lessons and stuff because theres lots of stuff that i dont i mean i could im improving but slowly and i think i could you know   yeah well also if you if you take lessons you might be able to uh   learn a lot   nip bad habits before they start   yeah its true which i probably already have because ive been playing for three months but um its never too late i guess its not too late to change yet but uh its been thats been a lot of fun and it makes me listen more a lot more too to when im listening to bands and music and stuff uh i mean i i play a lot more attention to what theyre doing and i i appreciate you know a a lot of what the musicians are doing
