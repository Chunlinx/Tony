                                 Washington Swingers            Washington morality is acurious thing It is capable of focusing on certain kinds of misbehavior withhalogenlike intensity for short periods of time But its also highlyselective often preoccupying itself with one modish ethical issue to theexclusion of others that are equally serious Since the election everyone hasbeen consumed with outrage over the Clintoncampaignfinance scandal and by extension over anything related topolitical fund raising But no one seems to care any more about influencepeddling a category of sleaze that is equally pervasive arguably more venaland much more easily cured            As casesin point consider two current examples Haley Barbour and Alexis Herman Inthe Republican Party no one bats an eyelash when Barbour offers himself as agunforhire available to lobby congressional leaders to whom he was givingpolicy advice just a few months ago And among Democrats it isnt consideredeither surprising or scandalous that the president would nominate as secretaryof labor Alexis Herman the most accomplished swinger through Washingtonsrevolving doors since the death of her mentor the late Ron Brown            Barbour and Herman are about as different in background andtemperament as two Beltway insiders can be Hes a Republican good ol boy fromYazoo City Miss whose colorful metaphors invariably invoke pigs dogs andmules She grew up on the other side of the Old Souths racial divide andspeaks flavorless corporate English He likes to be in front of the camerasShe likes to work behind the scenes But theyre basically in the samebusiness Both have prospered in Washington by skillfully exploiting theintersection of public policy and private interests            Lets takeBarbour first Despite Bob Doles defeat Barbour was considered a greatsuccess as chairman of the Republican National Committee a job he held untillast month Under Barbours leadership Republicans raised  million in the election cycle a record amount credited with saving the RepublicanCongress How did Barbour raise all that money He did it by being moreexplicit than ever before about the connection between big contributions andwhat is euphemistically called access Corporations that gave  ormore became Republican seasonticket holders with regular opportunities toschmooze GOP congressional leaders They were even assigned special RepublicanNational Committee staff members to help with their problems in WashingtonAfter the election Barbour scolded members of the Business Roundtable forgiving some  percent of their donations to Democrats Without exclusivesupport he threatened Republicans might not prove so effective a conduit forbusiness interests            In his new private capacity Barbour holds outthe promise of being a very effective conduit himself As soon as his term asRNC chairman ended he returned to his old lobbyinglaw firm Barbour Griffith Rogers and founded a semidetached strategic communications firm withEd Gillespie Gillespie the former chief of staff to House Majority LeaderDick Armey is best known as the guy who came up with the idea for the ContractWith America As a former House employee Gillespie is bound by thepostemployment restrictions that apply to excongressional staff members ButBarbour who hasnt worked in government since the Reagan administration canstart lobbying Newt Gingrich and Armey right away And Gillespie can ofcourse give Barbour plenty of advice on how to go about doing so            Thecombination of highpowered connections and freedom from legal restraints makesBarbour uniquely valuable to corporations involved in what economists callrentseeking According to a short item in last weeks Wall StreetJournal  Barbour immediately faced a bidding war for his services betweenthe regional phone companies and the longdistance services ATT and MCIThe regional companies appear to have had deeper pocketsBarbour went withthem Neither Barbour nor Gillespie responded to phone calls or to a faxedlist of questions But according to the Journal  Barbour will focus onthe implementation of the Telecommunications Act which involves issuesrelating to how soon the longdistance companies can compete in thelocalservice market Consumer groups tend to side with the longdistancecompanies in their dispute with the regional ones But whatever the merits ofhis case are or arent it will be pretty amusing to watch Barbour take sidesin a propaganda war after letting everybody know he was available to work foreither side on mercenary terms            When it comes to the revolving door Alexis Herman is lessof a Bigfoot than Barbour but more of an innovator As head of the WomensBureau in the Labor Department during the Carter administration she helped towrite regulations requiring federal contractors to comply with goals andtimetables for hiring minorities After she left the Labor Department she setup a firm to advise companies on how to comply with those regulations Butthats not the half of it According to a recent story in Business Week when Herman was at Labor she also helped to steer government jobtraininggrants to a firm she once worked for as well as to a youthtraining program runby Jesse Jackson Jackson a very close friend of Hermans spent much of thes boycotting and threatening boycotts against firms whose minorityhiringpractices he deemed inadequate In most cases he negotiated settlements withthe companies he targetedsettlements that often included a recommendation tohire Herman as a diversity consultant More recently Jackson helped Herman bylobbying Clinton to name her and not former Pennsylvania Sen Harris Wofford assecretary of labor            The pressgripped by Hermans notespeciallynotable part in the Democratic NationalCommittee fundraising scandal has largely ignored the many interestingconvolutions in her various roles Herman kept her consulting business goingeven after she became chief of staff to Ron Brown at the DNC in  a clearconflict of interest Under one particularly lucrative diversityconsultingcontract which Senate investigators are now looking into Herman advisedWashington developer Herbert Miller on how to comply with minorityhiringguidelines on a project called Market Square In addition to a payment Herman got an ownership stake in the deal which is now listed on herfinancialdisclosure forms as being worth between  and  millionMiller a big contributor to the DNC had coffee with the president lastyear According to Clinton sources Herman has often lent an inside helpinghand to another longtime friend Washington superlawyer Vernon JordanJordans corporate clients include American Airlines a very happy company thisweek It would be interesting to know what role Herman played in thepresidents decision to break the American Airlines pilots strike            Im not suggesting that any of Hermansliaising around is illegal But noncriminality is a pretty low standard forappointment to the Cabinet It is the standard however that the Clintonadministration has applied not only in Hermans case but even more notably inthe choice of Ron Brown for the post of secretary of commerce In the case ofRepublicans ethical standards are if anything lower During the lastCongress Gingrich rehabilitated convicted felon Michael Deaver as a Republicanadviser in good standing while the Dole campaign brought such notorioussleazemeisters as Lyn Nofziger Paul Manafort Charlie Black and John Searsback into the fold            Likecampaign finance revolvingdoor lobbying is a systemic problem in Americanpolitics The difference is that whereas campaign finance is an immenselycomplicated problem that can only be fixed with changes in the law the Augeanstables of K Street could be cleaned up pretty easily if anyone cared All itwould take is for a few prominent politicians to stop elevating lobbyists tohigh office and to quit taking their calls Its a cheap easy and effectivesolution that unfortunately doesnt fit in with this seasons spasm ofmorality
