                say you did uh starters and Bendix springs such as that on an old one   yeah and uh  helped my wife replace some carburetors   yeah   some that she had to uh um label everything   she had to label everything what was she driving     yeah because it was a Cadillac   uhhuh   and they uh well  they quit making those the Quadrajet carburetor and they quit making it   yeah   they rebuilt it and it never did never did run right again   yeah Quadrajet not real easy to get rebuilt just right   yeah   um what were you replacing the starters and Bendix drives on   um  a Maverick and also um a Chrysler station wagon before that   yeah did you replace just the uh the Bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter   uh the im replacing the two or three starters on the Chrysler   yeah the starters are kind of fragile   they yeah and the   especially if you need a tune up   umhum they kept saying that the Chrysler thats what Chryslers did is they wore out starters you know   yeah well if if if they start real easy you know you just hit the key and it starts up and when its properly tuned up that starter will last for a long time   yeah   see they built that starter so itd fit every V and all the slant sixes that they built in like thirty five years   right   they all take the exact same starter theyll interchange completely i mean completely one starter will fit all of them so theyve got a whole lot of torque but to do that they did uh they use an underdrive system where they geared it down so its motor spins really fast   umhum   so its got to spin for very long its kind of tough on the bushings usually what goes is the bushings you take a little time replace the bushings you still got a perfectly good starter   yeah right   but uh most places dont put dont rebuild them with with good with good enough bushings so its you know   umhum   after you get rebuilt one you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly especially if you need a tuneup   no   anyway what are you driving now   um my Chrysler van and its its pretty maintenance free you know and uh and beginning the year last year and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon and it didnt give me any trouble at all   thats good   yeah   what is it a late model set Chrysler van   its a eighty seven   yeah one of the little minivans   umhum yeah is it   do you like the way it rides and such   uh rides or runs   rides rough   it yeah well yeah it rides rides rough it runs good you know i kind of it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine   yeah yeah   you have to kind of wait for it especially when you get on the highway   yeah right now without getting some of the sportier models uh the four cylinders arent real peppy   yeah   but uh theyre starting to change that out in the last couple of years too   you driven American cars all   uh see ive driven one import uh i drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while about a month um in that month i think i put uh three oil coolers on it um every time i turned around i was having trouble with it everything else i ever owned was American built uh mostly older cars um ive been a mechanic well i worked starting working my fathers service station when i was about uh twelve   umhum   so ive been around cars a lot but uh driven a lot of old Pontiacs my first three cars were uh seventy model Pontiacs a GTO and a Bonneville and a station wagon and i had a couple of Chryslers had a Super B for a while with a four forty in it it a lot of fun       but uh   not not much gas mileage though   i dont know gas mileage wasnt too bad i got about seventeen   oh wow   well till you got crazy with it you know you get the four barrel all worked up and suddenly it it it drops off fast but   yeah   long as you didnt spin the tires too much or or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it it didnt do too bad on gas didnt have to work very hard to move the car around   now do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs   oh yeah yeah definitely   umhum   you know the my last GM car was a seventy Chevy station wagon uh it still had the points and condenser in it when i rebuilt the engine on that about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car   yeah   i uh pulled that old points distributor out and got a an HEI distributor electronic distributor and put into it
