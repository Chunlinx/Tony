                                 Murphys Law A Chatterbox Investigation            The death of Air Force Capt John Paul Stapp who during the s and sallowed his body to be used in various experiments testing the effects ofhighspeed transportation provides an occasion to consider how Murphys Lawcame into being The New York Times  obituary of Stapp who died Nov  at the ripe age of  tellsit this way                                             Stapp who was known for his razorsharp wit suffered an injury in theexperiment that inspired Murphys Law after a  rapid sled ride in                              An assistant Capt Edward Murphy Jr had designed a harness to strap therider in The harness held  sensors to measure the acceleration or Gforceon different parts of the body There were exactly two ways each sensor couldbe installed Murphy did each one the wrong way               The result was that when Stapp staggered off the rocket sled with bloodshoteyes and bleeding sores all the sensors registered zero He had beenrestrained in vain               A distraught Murphy proclaimed the original version of the famous maxim Ifthere are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in acatastrophe then someone will do it that way                        But a  article by Ted Bear then a flightcenter historian atEdwards Air Force Base in California where the experiment in question tookplace tells it this way                                             Murphys Law was named after Capt Edward A Murphy an engineerworking on Air Force Project MX a project designed to see how much suddendeceleration a person can stand in a crash                              One day after finding that a transducer was wired wrong he cursed thetechnician responsible and said If there is any way to do it wrong hellfind it                        Both versions of the story have the same basic theme which is that itsalways good to be prepared for lots of things going wrong But in theTimes version Capt Murphys comment seems to be an exercise inevading blame  Rather than saying Gosh Im sorry Capt Murphy isattributing his                own screwup to some larger cosmic tendency forall things to get screwed up Its the engineering equivalent of thefamiliar political dodge mistakes were made By contrast in Bears versionCapt Murphy is attaching blame to someone else  Murphy is more or lesscalling the technician said to be responsible we never get thetechnicians version a schmuck  In Bears version Murphy is notstating any broad philosophical principle of any kind If this is thereal versionfor what its worth Capt Leah M Bryant told the storythe same way in the Sept  issue of Leading Edge  the house organ ofthe Air Force Materiel Commandthen Murphys Law was completely misconstruedIn other words Murphys Law is itself an illustration of Murphys LawNeither the Times version nor the BearBryant version is particularlyflattering to Capt Murphy            To make matters even more confusing theres a third version of thestory involving an entirely different Murphynot Capt EdwardMurphy but Commander later Admiral  Joseph M MurphMurphy Chatterbox was unable to obtain details of this story but MurphMurphy is the person to whom Edward H Heinemann an aircraft designer andengineer for Douglas Aircraft in the s and s attributes Murphys Law inhis Heinemanns  autobiography Ed Heinemann Combat Aircraft Designer  Chatterboxgot the poop on Murph Murphy from Fred Johnsen the historian at the EdwardsAir Force Flight Test Center Johnsen told Chatterbox that Heinemann onceshowed him Murph Murphys photograph and said Thats the guy who inventedMurphys Law Johnsen said that while Heinemann spent a lot of time atEdwards he has no reason to think that Murph Murphy had any connection toEdwards at all            There are several reputable people in the aeronautic industry who claim tohave known Murphy and its a different Murphy in each case Johnsen toldChatterbox regretfully At least Chatterbox thinks thats what Johnsensaid
