                 okay on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why   well i guess i stand on uh on probably ten for no uh restrictions i uh recently just moved to Texas from uh South Dakota and Nebraska and i guess in terms of gun control ive always uh been raised with the uh idea in the Constitution that uh citizens had a right to bear arms and i realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded uh more uh of a national defense uh than anything else but uh on the other hand too uh people then uh needed to use firearms for um survival in terms of uh food and uh i was raised uh   yes true   you know hunting all the time i lived on the farm and and um you know enjoy hunting and i guess i have uh some problems with uh being restricted to um owning a gun for you know hunting purposes mainly   right   and um it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where um eventually we may not be able to have that right any more   yeah i can i can understand that i was raised in Oklahoma and course being Oklahoman and Texan uh you know hunting the hunting and everything and im used to relatives and my father and my husband having guns and all and i i did used to be all in favor of it but its all of a sudden its starting to get really scary with these gangs yet i think i would vote a one if i thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun no crooks nothing but because i know thats not gonna happen then i have to im probably right up there about an eight   yeah it uh moving to this area of course it happens everywhere but um i guess were pretty naive coming from small towns uh in the midwest and then uh moving to a larger city where there are driveby shootings and uh there seems like killing for no reason at all and uh   well it it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was theres always been a certain amount of crime in your you know your urban areas and i know we lived in Chicago for seven years and of course it was definitely there so when we first moved here it wasnt as bad as this its you know its just getting all of a sudden so much worse i dont know whether its due to the drugs and the uh drug kings that are here and and uh Jamaican drug kings coming in i dont know whether thats it or street gangs i dont know what the answer is i know that its scary and yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i cant do and thats basically what the gun control would end up being   i i think so and and theres always the uh the old uh saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough theyll theyll get one and uh and then uh yeah   well its very true its not the lawabiding citizen that you know is is dangerous with the gun  its the ones that are going out and stealing it and i said i think the  only way i would be   yep   in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them and i think that would almost have to go with armies too i mean that has to be almost worldwide which we know would never ever happen   yeah yeah thats for sure   because even if you said okay you know armed forces could have them some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck   yeah and uh   and uh   and you know uh i suppose um years ago way back when uh when uh they had the Revolutionary War and people decided that they uh were fed up with the government uh if they didnt have a way to uh to fight back  they would have been in big trouble   thats  thats very true  very true who knows we maybe want to overthrow the government i know if somebody doesnt do something uh   well the way things are going   what about uh what do you think of this this uh law that theyre putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can uh carry the gun or buy you know actually purchase the gun   well you know they introduced some gun control back when i was a teenager i believe in terms of uh every gun you had bought had to be licensed i believe   yes   and uh you know that didnt bother me uh too much and so i guess it depends um if there are some statistics that show that uh that people uh commit crimes on the spur of the moment
