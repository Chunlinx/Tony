Legal Services Corporation Strategic Directions  Progress Report for ProgramsIntroductionIn my capacity as VicePresident for Programs I am pleased andproud to provide to the LSC Board of Directors this third progressreport documenting the work of the Programs staff at LSC  OPP OIMand its consultants and the staff of the Vice President forPrograms and her consultants in addressing the challengesplaced before us in January  by the LSC Board of Directors InJanuary  the LSC Board of Directors adopted a strategicplanning document entitled Strategic Directions  Thisdocument established twin goals to be attained by the nationallegal services community by  to dramatically increase theprovision of legal services to eligible persons and to ensure thateligible clients are receiving appropriate and highquality legalassistance Strategic Directions  also identifiedanticipated outcomes including increased numbers of clientsreceiving legal services appropriate to the legal issues theyencounter expanded relevancy of the delivery system to the mostpressing needs of lowincome clients with clients themselvestaking a leading role in this effort an expanded range andimprovement in the quality of services provided by legal servicesprograms and finally greater consistency in the quality of legalservices programs State planning is identified in this Boarddocument as LSCs key strategy to achieve the goals statedaboveBecause state planning was identified as the Boards primestrategy for fulfilling the mandate of Strategic Directions a brief review of LSCs state planning initiative isprobably in order LSCs State Planning Initiative began in primarily in response to the programmatic changes and budget cutsthat were threatening the very survival of legal services deliveryacross the nation State planning was built on the understandingthat states and territories serve as the relevant geographic areasof a planning focus for developing strategies to meet the civilequal justice needs of poor and vulnerable people Several yearslater in  state planning became a key LSC strategy to achieveaccess and to improve the quality of services LSC specificallyannounced its intent to put resources into the creation ofcomprehensive coordinated and integrated state legal servicesdelivery systems in Program Letters  and  These programletters declared that LSC was no longer limiting its focus onoutcomes for clients within and by individual programs but ratherit believed that quality legal services could be delivered only ina statewide context It challenged each state to examine itsorganizational structures its use of technology intake systemsresource development and private bar involvement through astatewide lensIn late   eleven months after the adoption of StrategicDirections   LSC issued its fourth program letter onstate planning that set forth expectations for each justicecommunity These expectations for purposes of brevity can besummarized as follows a delivery system in which eligible clientsin every state are afforded an equal opportunity to availthemselves and ultimately to attain highquality civil legalassistanceThe LSC Programs staff have worked assiduously these pastseveral years to help create a worldclass national legal servicesdelivery system in which eligible clients in every state areafforded an equal opportunity to avail themselves and ultimately toattain highquality civil legal assistance However as we moved toaddress the Boards mandate we quickly realized that the creationof a worldclass delivery system involved more than stateplanning per se After all we do not pursue state planningbecause we are planners by education or trademost of us indeedare first and foremost legal services attorneys and advocates Andwe do not pursue state planning because we love planning We dontreally love planningat least most of us do not We love legalservices and are committed to making legal services better Andfrankly we do not pursue state planning because we want ournaysayers to believe that LSC has reformed itself We pursuestate planning because we believe that our lowincome clientsdeserve the highest quality service that can be made available tothem despite our limited funding Accordingly in our quest tocreate worldclass justice communities in each state and territoryin this great country we began to focus on other initiatives thatwere to us just as important as state planning to the creation ofa delivery system in which eligible clients in every state areafforded an equal opportunity to avail themselves and ultimately toattain highquality civil legal assistance often refer to theseinitiatives as state plannings companion initiatives and theseinitiatives  competition the quality initiative the diversityinitiative technology initiative grants the matters initiativeour efforts to enhance services for selfrepresented litigants theLegal Resource Library to name just a few  have become asimportant to the creation of a worldclass delivery system as stateplanning has proved itself to be These companion initiatives andthe hardworking and talented staff who carry out these initiativeswork handinglove with the equally wellqualified state planningteam to promote the development of high quality worldclassdelivery systemsIn January  we issued our first progress report to the LSCBoard of Directors describing our efforts to help build premierjustice communities throughout our country We issued our secondreport in January  In this third report we have decided topresent our work to you in a fashion slightly different from theformat we have used in the past two reports Because we havelearned over the years that premier delivery systems have twoprimary legs upon which they ultimately stand or fall  healthy andvibrant LSCfunded programs and healthy and vibrant state justicecommunities to which all LSC funded programs belong  we willpresent our work in this third report in terms of our activities topromote healthy programs and healthy state justice communities Webelieve this format will provide the LSC Board of Directors acomplete and true picture of the work we pursued in  to buildlegal services delivery system in which no eligible client isturned away and in which every eligible client is provided highquality legal servicesWe thank the LSC Board of Directors for giving us thisopportunity to present our work More importantly we thank the LSCBoard of Directors for giving us the opportunity to improve a legalservices delivery system that is so valuable to our clients soessential to a democratic way of life and so very important to allof us The Legal Services Corporation exists to help our clientsaddress their legal wrongs and promote their legal rights To theextent that we have been given the opportunity to participate fullyin addressing this important and primary mission of LSC we havebeen truly fortunateI Structural Changes in the Delivery SystemSince  LSC has initiated and overseen significantstructural changes in the number and configuration of LSCfundedprograms in order to develop more powerful and effective statedelivery systems The Office of Program Performance OPP staffhave assisted LSC grantees and state justice communities with thischange process in a number of ways including the provision ofsignificant technical assistance to help with planning andimplementation In  LSC made  available to help sixstates develop effective plans and  to assist nine statesinstitute new delivery structures Significant staff resources alsohave been devoted to onsite visits and to sharing information andbest practices targeting programs undergoing consolidationPlanning for ChangeTechnical Assistance for Planning In  LSC gavetechnical assistance to Alabama Arkansas Mississippi MissouriMontana and New York enabling these six states to obtainimportant consulting and facilitative assistance with configurationand overall planningConfiguration Changes Nine states completedconfiguration planning in  and submitted proposals forsignificant structural change with completion dates in  and Each of these states received LSC planning assistance fundsConfiguration planning commenced in another six statesChanges Effective in Iowa Iowa will become one statewide service area TheLegal Services Corporation of Iowa which serves  of Iowas counties has absorbed the assets of the single county Polk Countyprogram and changed its name to Iowa Legal Aid reflecting itsexpanded service areaMichigan After years of effort  basic field serviceareas have been consolidated into five The new configurationimproves opportunities to increase resources and access and achievegreater equity in client serviceNew Jersey The states  service areas have beenconsolidated into a much more manageable six One of our mosthighly integrated and comprehensive delivery systems New Jersey isnow poised to deliver even better services to lowincomepersonsNorth Dakota Two separate Native American service areasand two Basic Field service areas have been combined into oneNative American area and one Basic Field area and a grant for bothmade to a single program This will yield more geographicallyequitable service especially for Native AmericanclientsChanges Effective in Florida Twelve LSCfunded service areas have beencombined into seven regions Under Floridas plan which wasaccepted by LSC this summer the LSCfunded programs will continueto anchor the delivery system and provide the lions share of basiclegal services to lowincome residentsNew York The New York plan also accepted by LSC thissummer reduces the states  service areas to seven By combiningmany of the smaller service areas the new configurationestablishes a sturdier platform for client services and the futuregrowth of New Yorks equal justice systemAlabama Alabama has just submitted its plan toconsolidate three service areas into a statewide program Plannersbelieve this will improve coordination of resources with LSC andnonLSC programs and assure uniform delivery of services toclients throughout the stateMissouri Missouris Legal Services Commission withappointees from the state Supreme Court and Missouri Barrecommended consolidation of the states LSC service areas into oneLSCfunded program beginning in Mississippi After a year of planning Mississippi hascommitted to producing a reconfiguration proposal by January Future Changes Massachusetts Minnesota Ohio Oregon Puerto Rico and SouthDakota These five states and one territory received notices ofconfiguration concern from LSC in  Nearly all have experiencedstructural changes in their delivery systems since  Now eachwill embark on a review of the efficacy of current configurationpatterns and report to LSC on their studies in Implementing ChangeAssistance to Merging Programs LSC staff givesubstantial assistance to merging programs In  programsmerged or prepared for merger in Iowa Louisiana New Jersey NorthDakota Wisconsin Texas and New Mexico Our efforts with theseprograms varied depending on need We wrote checklists of mergerissues to consider during the merger process and shared modeldocuments developed by other programs When asked LSC madeavailable information on consultants with special expertise inmerging nonprofit entities We referred programs to peers that hadsuccessfully addressed similar merger challenges Over and aboveassisting with the technical aspects of merger we helped programsresolve issues that interfered withcreating and maintaining a comprehensive integrated deliverysystem in the reconfigured service areaSpecial grant conditions for programs that merged in Our special grant conditions required periodic submission ofwritten progress reports on achieving a comprehensive integrateddelivery system Programs in California Illinois KentuckyLouisiana Michigan Mississippi North and South Carolina SouthDakota Tennessee Texas and Virginia received special grantconditions In many instances LSC staff responded to their reportswith written feedbackTechnical Assistance to Assist with Consolidations In LSC gave  in merger

efforts changes in intake hotlines and case managementsystems and other consolidation issues In two states our fundshelped leverage new resourcesII Quality ImprovementAt the core of powerful and effective delivery systems are highquality legal services programs OPP staff work with grantees toenhance the quality of their work through ongoing contact throughLSCs Library Resource Initiative see section IV and throughprogram visits Program visits allow staff to monitor programdevelopments to learn about problems and to develop newstrategies for expanding access and enhancing qualityOnsite reviews take a number of forms Technical assistancevisits are conducted after LSC receives a request from a programfor assistance in a particular area such as intake systems legalwork management and supervision or technology Program inquiryvisits are designed to gather information and to give LSCadditional knowledge about programs that have not been visitedrecently Program inquiry visits also occur when LSC staff believethat certain challenges facing the program need LSCs attentionTIG visits are made to Technology Initiative Grant TIGrecipients In  we visited programs that received TIG fundingin  and  to review technology progress under the grantFinally postreconfiguration visits occur two years after aservice area has been reconfigured to assess how well the programis serving the new service area and the extent to which therestructured organization is operating cohesivelyOPP conducted  onsite visits in  All fourteen visitslasted several days one required  business days due to the sizeand location of the program and involved two to five personsConsultants sometimes served as team members and often OPPtechnology staff joined teams to lend their special expertisePrograminquiry Visits Occurred in Oklahoma New YorkWisconsin Delaware and Wyoming In addition programinquiryvisits conducted in combination with state planning visits tookplace in the District of Columbia Alaska Kansas andHawaiiPostreconfiguration Visits Occurred in CaliforniaColorado and ArizonaTechnical Assistance Visits We responded to requestsfrom programs in Arkansas and Maryland for technical assistancevisitsTIG Visits In addition to the  onsite program qualityreviews OPP technology staff visited our  and  TechnologyInitiative Grant TIG recipients in Indiana South CarolinaPennsylvania Mississippi Illinois and TennesseeIII Diversity Leadership and InclusionEarly in  LSC invited a small group of national leaderswith a deep interest in promoting multicultural diversity to adviseLSC on how best to help grantees reach their diversity goals Theadvisory committees preeminent project was to help create andproduce a training tool on leadership and diversity for programboards and managers This resource was completed in November In  LSC acted on several other items listed in its ActionAgenda on Diversity a summary of ideas and suggestions raised inLSCs  national conversations on diversity Board Training Module on Leadership and DiversityThis resource is intended to assist programs with diversityinitiatives and guide grantee board and management discussions onthe importance of diversity in providing highquality andappropriate services to clients It can be used in conjunction withregular board trainings or as a standalone device Leadership andDiversity The Link That Promotes Effective Delivery of LegalServices was tested with good results at two sites  a statewideprogram in the northeast and a large southwestern program Early in the module will be given to every LSCfunded program Weanticipate that the module will increase commitment to building amulticulturally competent staff and services that reflect thediverse backgrounds of client communities by engaging boards incandid conversations and exercises on fostering inclusioncultivating new leadership and expanding diversity parameters intheir programs Program staff research explained below inCollecting Diversity Data indicates that many program boards andmanagers need to reemphasize diversity in staff recruitmentpromotion and strategies to reach overlooked client groups Education and OutreachSoutheast Project Directors Association LSC organized awellreceived panel at the SEPDA Conference to showcase how welltwo state communities of justice and two programs usedreconfiguration activities to expand diversity within staff andvolunteer ranks and for instituting programmatic measures thatwill generate a new cadre of leaders in the legal servicescommunityVirginia Annual Legal Aid Conference At this statewide trainingevent we joined a panel that addressed how legal services programsand equal justice communities can effectively recruit and retain adiverse work force among other critical diversity activitiesLater in  building on this panel the Virginia State PlanningAssembly began creating an action plan of goals for obtainingdiverse staff and boards growing a diverse corps of leaders anddeeper engagement with the client communityOther Public Forums Vice President for Programs Randi Youellsrepeatedly highlighted diversitys essential role in a healthy andeffective legal services system in talks she gave throughout theyear to program staff civil justice leaders and state justicecommunities In this way the LSC diversity message was deliveredlocally in states like Arizona and Montana and nationally througharticles in the MIE Journal and NLADA Update She promoteddiversity in speeches she was invited to give to partnerorganizations  the combined Conference of State Court Judges andConference of State Court Administrators the International LegalAid Group and through the Ontario Canada Legal Aid SpeakersSeries Our commitment to a nuanced approach to diversity wasapparent in each meeting of the LSC Board Provisions Committee asstaff regularly reported on activities in this area and presentersinvited from our programs reflected the importance of inclusion inthe topics they addressed and in the communities theyrepresented Leadership Mentoring EffortsResponding to a concern raised at LSCs  conference fordirectors of statewide programs we designed a pilot mentoringproject for new statewide program executive directors In itsinitial phase the project matched two new statewide programdirectors with an experienced one The three convened at eachothers programs and over the telephone to explore topics such asexecutive leadership managing change and state planning in stateswith one LSC grantee Collecting Diversity DataThrough the Competition Process Through its competitive grantprocess LSC obtains and reviews substantial data on an applicantscapacity to respond to a diverse client community Using thisinformation LSC can learn how each applicant proposes to diminishclient access barriers including cultural geographic and languagebarriers how the applicant will engage clients with accessbarriers the racial ethnic and gender distribution of theapplicants staff strategies used to recruit retain and promotediverse staff training events that address diversity and how theorganization is building leadership that is diverseUsing Case Service Reports CSRs which grantees are requiredto submit annually to LSC contain data on program staff as well ason cases closed during a calendar year Early in  we reportedon our examination of  data on gender and race ofexecutive directors of LSCfunded programs We discovered thatreconfiguration within the confines of state planning did notdiminish the percent of minorities and women in leadershippositions in our programs We saw that despite vigorous efforts toincrease diversity in state justice communities and particularly inleadership positions the ethnic profiles of our executivedirectors remained virtually unchanged and the number of womendirectors was significantly lower than their percentage in theattorney workforce Later in  we were able to study the data These indicated that the number of directors of color rosefrom  percent to  percent of the director populationUnfortunately the data also showed that the number of womendirectors continues to lag behind their increasing presence in ourgrantees attorney ranksIV Identifying and Sharing Best PracticesLegal services programs often pioneer creative responses to thechallenge of high quality effective services for clients At LSCwe are frequently impressed with the range of novel approaches thatpractitioners have devisedIn October  we launched the LSC Resource Library InitiativeLRI a website committed to ensuring that LSC programs are awareof and have access to innovations in civil legal services work Theproject is dedicated to raising the standard of practice in legalservices programs by encouraging the crossfertilization ofinnovative practices through facilitating the voluntary exchange ofexemplary practices LRI showcases a variety of original andeffective activities ranging from how to conduct a comprehensivestrategic planning process to new ideas for serving hardtoreachpopulations Ten weeks after OPP launched LRI site activityreports showed that users had viewed approximately  pagesLRI is available online at wwwlrilscgovV Managing Information to Improve Grants Administration andProgram QualityLSCs Office of Information Management OIM along with OPPrecently launched the Electronic Grants Award Letter EGAL systemThis initiative permits LSC to distribute grant award letterselectronically from a secure website EGALs benefits include anelectronic archive of competitive grant contracts immediate accessto digital grant award documents reduction in administrative costand faster and more efficient transmittal of information tograntees Similarly OIM revised the electronic Grant RenewalApplication to accommodate new information sought by LSC and toensure greater ease for usersDuring  OIM obtained the  Census figures at state andcounty levels and devoted substantial time to calculating povertypopulation for each of our grantees service areas under these newfigures This information was supplied to all grantees and will bethe basis of our grant awards for the next decadeLSC is committed to providing the United States Congress and thepublic with the most accurate information possible Closed casestatistics form a major component of the program activity datacollected by LSC and are a critical measure of the impact offederal funding on the legal problems of people living in povertyTherefore it is essential to assure the accuracy of the CSR dataEach year OIM staff assists our grantees in verifying thereporting of CSR data through the annual selfinspectionprocessThe purpose of the selfinspection process is to give ourgrantees a means to ensure that their CSR data meet LSC standardsfor accuracy In January of each year LSC distributes a CaseReview Form The Form contains a list of questions that identifykey requirements that need to be met in order to report a case toLSC Grantees statistically sample the cases closed in theprevious year to determine if the sampled cases generally meetthe requirements for reporting cases to LSC If ten percent or moreof the cases sampled in the selfinspection process have problemsthen LSC assumes that there are overall problems within thegrantees case closing records which may affect the accuracy ofthe CSR data In the event that the selfinspection process doesreveal problems grantees are asked to consult with LSC todetermine the appropriate corrective action All grantees arerequired to submit their SelfInspection Certification and SummaryForms to LSC in March of each year for the previous year Theinformation is turned over to LSCs Office of Compliance andEnforcement which is responsible for monitoring the accuracy ofthe CSR system and CSR dataVI TechnologyStrategic Directions  identifies technology as aprimary strategy for enhancing client access to services We haveobserved that many more clients receive some assistance whentechnologically sophisticated intake systems are installedComputerized and webbased selfhelp programs make high qualityinformation available to those who would be denied aid because ofresource limitations and case acceptance criteria Technologyinnovations can improve full representation through quicker legalresearch and information gathering capacities Finally strongertechnology systems allow a programs staff to experience moreeffective supervision and coordinationThe Technology Initiative Grant Program TIG is LSCs mostpowerful tool to help programs ramp up existing technology systemsIn   TIG awards were granted The improvements and projectsthey funded are discussed below see Section VII Training SectionIX Pro Se Enhancement Section XI Pro Bono Enhancement andSection XII Intake EnhancementThe Technology Initiatives Grant ProgramLSC received  grant applications for the  TIG fundingScreening them required seven review sessions with outside panelsinternal review sessions and special sessions with OPP staff toanalyze how the applications affected program quality and stateplanning concerns Staff recommendations went first to VicePresident Randi Youells and then to President Erlenborn for finalfunding decisionsLSCs  TIG grants totaled  million They foster ourobjective of improving access to justice for clients For examplethe grants will allowAlaska to install computers in six courthouses withaccess to legal information and selfhelp materials on thestatewide legal services websiteGuam to put  computers in the village mayors officeswith access to legal information and selfhelp materials that aremounted on a new statewide websiteMaryland to create a webbased pro se litigant supportsystem for some of the  courtfunded assisted pro se programsUsers will be able to view their own personal web pages aspersonal case account managers and resource their files Indevelopment is information about a panel of attorneys to provideunbundled services and mediators who offer free services to prose litigantsOrange County California to expand the ICANInteractive Community Assistance Network services to include anEarned Income Credit module Lowincome workers will be able tocomplete the Schedule EIC and related tax forms and file themelectronically The Internal Revenue Service is a partner in thisprojectWashington State to support their joint courtslegalservices planning for the effective utilization of technologyresources for self represented litigantsExpanding on earlier grants for statewide websites LSC made new awards bringing the total number of states that are buildingand maintaining statewide websites to more than  These sitesenable a states residents to benefit from centrally maintained anduptodate resources for legal information and selfhelpmaterialsVII TrainingMany areas of poverty law are highly specialized To ensure topquality representation legal workers need ongoing training in newand complex areas of law Low levels of funding and the absence ofstate regional and national poverty training materials andteachers can diminish opportunities for staff education onsubstantive poverty law issues Through the competition processour work with state justice communities and with TIG funding LSChelps grantees meet critical training needs In  we designedseveral new approachesNew Lawyer Training ProjectPursuant to a contract with the National Center on Poverty LawNCPL held training events at nine sites nationally on conductingpoverty law research via the Internet and other webbased tools Thetraining was structured to allow participants to subsequently traincolleagues who did not attend the sessions These events were sopopular that NCPL replicated them at new sites not funded underthe LSC contractThe LSC contract required NCPL to produce a page Poverty LawManual that introduces advocates to the fundamentals of povertylaw A hard copy of this manual was distributed to all new legalservices attorneys in the country It is available electronicallyat NCPLs websiteTechnology Grants Focused On TrainingTwo  TIG awards focus on training In one Legal ServicesLaw Line of Vermont Inc will make nationally available onlinethe core curriculum of the Legal Services Training Consortium ofNew England and provide a platform for other legal servicesorganizations to obtain distance learning opportunities allowingadvocates to get skills training without the usual financial andtravel costs In the second Legal Aid Society of Orange Countywill create a national technology training and curriculum projectto build capacity across many audiences within the legal servicescommunity This will extend the implementation of model technologyinnovations that improve justice for lowincome clientsTechnology Technical Assistance Days of ServiceOPP staff offer handson technology training by building onnational legal services events One example is our Day ofService This project is supported by our TIG funds and isorganized by the National Technology Assistance Project NTAP ADay of Service occurs on the day before the opening of a nationalconference The technology staffs of all the programs attending theconference including OPP staff convene the day before theconference begins to lend technical expertise to the legal servicesprogram in the host city Days of Service have benefited Legal AidSociety of Cleveland in conjunction with the ABANLADA EqualJustice Conference Legal Action of Wisconsin prior to the NLADAAnnual Meeting and Greater Orlando Area Legal Services inconjunction with the Nonprofit Technology Enterprise NetworkNTEN ConferenceAnother innovative project that is held on conjunction withnational legal services meetings is our Cyber Caf In  wehosted a Cyber Caf at both the NLADA Annual Meeting and at theEqual Justice Conference to give Internet access to conferenceparticipants allowing them to check their email Our Cyber Cafalso allows technology staff from around the country to demonstratenew software and discuss technology resources with confereesVIII Measurement and EvaluationIt is crucial to the strategic planning process to measure thevolume of our grantees work and to evaluate the success of theirapproaches To this end OPP has built systems for determining theeffectiveness of our strategic initiatives Described below aremeasures we have been refining over the past year to captureinformation on the effects of state planning the amount and typeof service that programs give client outcomes program deliverysystems and the impact on services of our technology grantsState Justice Communities Planning Initiative EvaluationInstrumentIn order to insure the highest quality and maximum level ofservices to potentially eligible clients in each state and so thatthe goal of meeting those needs will be realized LSC has developedthe State Justice Communities Planning Initiative EvaluationInstrument A design team of  representatives from the legalservices community  including providers clients courts and otherstakeholder entities  worked assiduously over the year to producea tool that will be tested in  revised pursuant to thatprocess and ultimately used nationally The instrument is designedto assess the health and vibrancy of each state justicecommunitystate legal services delivery system establishbenchmarks against which further progress can be measured andbegin to gather data to allow comparisons of state justicecommunitiesState Planning Self Evaluation ProcessPending implementation of the State Planning EvaluationInstrument LSC responded to and engaged state justice communitiesaround the selfevaluations reports they sent in pursuant toProgram Letter  Our feedback focus is on the relationshipbetween the structure of a delivery system and its capacity toprovide client access to a full range of services no matter wherein the state the client resides while at the same timeanticipating and providing for clients emerging legal needs andaspirationsAnalyses of Case Closing DataProgram staff from the Office of Information Management reviewedCase Service Reports CSR for  through  to discern trendsin the types and numbers of cases closed by grantees Theiranalysis revealed that most programs experienced declines in casesclosed during periods of dramatic funding reductions and beforethey with and without LSC assistance aggressively sought otherforms of funding eg mids In spite of a diminution incases closed however programs showed remarkable stability in thekinds of cases they reported The data indicate correlationsbetween the number of brief service andor counsel and advice casesclosed and the institution of telephone intake systems They alsoshow that the percentage of extended service cases also grewdemonstrating that LSC grantees continue to vigorously representclients in the more traditional forums of administrative hearingsmediations and trial and appellate courts even as they instituteinnovative fullservice intake systems Our study reportednationally by Randi Youells at the Conference of State Court Judgesand Conference of State Court Administrators also vividlyillustrated what we do not know about our grantees work  thedifference it makes in clients lives and how it has benefited thecommunityMeasurement of Services Programs Provide in Addition toCasesSome lowincome persons who seek assistance at LSC programs needonly legal information guidance with selfrepresentation or areferral to an organization more appropriate to their needs LSChas stressed the merit of these limited services though severalstrategies including technology grants to support statewidewebsites LRI to share innovative practices and state planningrequirements that touch on pro se assistance community legaleducation and similar servicesThe matters reports allow OPP for the first time to learnabout the type and volume of grantee work that does not constitutecases These activities include community legal education someforms of pro se assistance referrals outreach indirect servicesincluding training to nonlegal advocates who help low incomepeople and other services including mediation and alternativedispute resolutionAlthough we collected data on matters work undertaken during thelast six months of  we were not able to analyze and report onthem to the LSC Board and on our website until  More than twomillion people received significant matters services from granteesin the second half of  All but one of the programs providedcommunity legal education  percent engaged in outreachactivities and  percent disseminated pro se informationGrantees reported providing referral information to more than people The importance of matters services to thelowincome community is demonstrated in our report which alsoincludes summaries of innovative approaches that have allowedgrantees to offer clients services that do not fall into thecases category but are nonetheless significantThe matters report is athttpwwwlscgovWebsitedocsMRpdfMeasurement of OutcomesDevelopment of an outcome measures reporting system tosupplement or replace LSCs CSR system is underway In  LSCposted a Request for Information in the Federal Register as thefirst step to issuing a Request for Proposals to develop an outcomemeasurement system In late  LSC hired an experiencedconsultant to study and report on existing systems in the legalservices community and make recommendations on approaches LSC couldadoptMeasurement of Quality through Quality Review VisitsLSC expanded its onsite program reviews to include internalprotocols for visiting recently merged programs and for evaluatinga programs closed case statistics The purpose of the former is tolearn whether all elements of a newly merged program arefunctioning cohesively and to identify areas where technicalassistance may help achieve a unified operation Protocols onclosed cases will ensure the consistent application of our analysisfactors Both new protocols will be used by staff and consultantswho review programs and in their reports and recommendations basedon the reviewsMeasurement of Quality through the Grant ApplicationProcessThrough the competitive grants process LSC evaluates anapplicants capacity to provide effective and efficient highquality legal representation to eligible clients Assessments alsoare made of an applicants participation in an integrated deliverysystem that seeks to make the most efficient use of all resourcesstrives for innovations in delivery mechanisms and creativelyinvolves the private bar Criteria and standards used to measurethe strength of a legal services delivery network are derived fromthe LSC Act and regulations LSC Performance Criteria American BarAssociation ABA Standards for Programs Providing Civil Pro BonoLegal Services to Persons of Limited Means and ABA Standards forProviders of Civil Legal Services to the PoorRecently LSC examined its competitive grants process through aseries of discussions and surveys and interviews with consultantsLSC grantees and staff to determine its effectiveness in measuringan applicants capacity to provide high quality clientcenteredlegal services The results demonstrated that our process is auseful and effective tool for assessing the quality of legalservices delivery Suggestions on how to improve the currentprocess were implemented and as a result LSC will be sendingfeedback letters to applicants that filed grant proposals for funding to begin a dialogue about the applicants delivery systembased on the grant application Additionally our Request forProposals now encourages applicants to describe the quality oftheir delivery approach the unique features of their service areaand any model projectsThe Evaluation of Technology ProjectsTIG funds support the Technology Evaluation Project aninitiative of the Legal Aid Society of Cincinnati The Projectcreates evaluation instruments for statewide websites alsosupported by TIG awards Created over the course of the year thetools were distributed to programs for comment at the end of User feedback is expected early in  after which the tools willbe modified if necessary and distributed When perfected the toolswill allow programs to evaluate their technology projects duringimplementation phases to both assure successful completion andultimately to determine whether their goals were achievedIX Pro Se EnhancementOne of the best ways to help the approximately  percent oflowincome persons who need legal assistance but must do withoutis to arm selfrepresented litigants with quality information andassistance LSC does this in two ways One is by giving selfhelpassistance directly through our programs such as with the ICANsystem and the statewide websites and the second is by enhancingexisting efforts on behalf of pro se clientsTIG Pro Se EffortsThis year TIG made  grants that directly touch on pro seEighteen were website renewal grants to statewide websites begun inprevious years Thirteen were for new statewide websites Anadditional nine were for other pro se projects One put selfhelpcomputers in each of Guams  mayors community offices anotherput selfhelp stations in six remote courthouses in Alaska Athird made to Atlanta Legal Aid partnering with Georgia LegalServices built on earlier efforts by AARP and created Self HelpOffices SHO for an urban setting Atlanta and a rural setting amobile office that will move from community to communityTIG staff presented the TIGfunded ICAN project from OrangeCounty California to the Virginia Court System We also organizeda conference on document assembly software in New York City Atthat event legal services personnel court personnel and othertechnology experts saw demonstrations by four companies on theirproducts and assessed their utility for preparing pro sedocuments After weighing the options we arranged for a donationfrom Lexis of their HotDocs document assembly software for eachstate which will greatly enhance the availability of legal formsthat lay people can easily fill out onlineRecognizing that selfrepresented litigants are a challenge forcourt systems LSC has collaborated with the National Center forState Courts the State Justice Institute the American JudicatureSociety Pro Bono Net and Zorza Associates to create a websiteresource center for professionals involved in selfhelp projectsThis is one of several endeavors by an ad hoc pro se group that hascontinued to work jointly on enhancements for pro se since it wasfirst organized in  at LSCs charter TIG Conference In Juneat the Annual Conference of Chief JusticesConference of StateCourt Administrators LSC held two sessions on successful self helpinitiatives and met informally with judges and administrators toexamine potential and existing pro se partnerships between civilcourt systems and legal services programsX Resource DevelopmentSubstantial new resources are essential to increased access toand availability of services to lowincome persons Level LSCfunding censusrelated cuts in many program budgets downturns inIOLTA and state government revenues made this past year one whereLSC support for resource development was essential to the vitalityof programs and state justice communitiesIn  LSC continued to offer technical assistance to lowerfunded states to increase resources For example our funds made itpossible for Louisiana to adopt a multiyear development plan andallowed West Virginia to launch a threeyear private bar campaignthat secured almost  in contributions and pledges prior tokickoff with the expectation of reaching its goal of  millionCollaborative efforts also are yielding gains in other statesPennsylvania civil justice community stakeholders joinedto bring about passage of a filing fee surcharge law that willultimately give about  million of annual funding for civillegal aidDelaware state planners collaborated on an endowment fundthat will provide longterm support for legal services It was madepossible by Delawares Combined Campaign for Justice a coordinatedfundraising effort by the state planning committee sponsored by theDelaware State Bar Association and other justice communitystakeholdersIn Virginia state planners were able to increase filingfee funding by  percent and through the statewide fundingplanning team created a statewide funding action plan adopted bythe Virginia Statewide Planning AssemblyXI Pro Bono EnhancementOne of the most powerful ways to expand client services andsupport for providers is to engage the private bar in poverty lawactivities Historically two barriers have interfered with broadparticipation in pro bono projects One is that few lawyers areexperienced in poverty law and most are reluctant  without supportand assistance  to handle such cases Second many privatepractitioners are unwilling to take a case when the effort it willrequire is not clearly set forth at the outset Fortunately manyof these lawyers are willing and able to help in other waysWebsitesEarly indications are that pro bono websites have the potentialto address the expertise gap As currently utilized a pro bonowebsite has two chief functions One is to list cases and projectsthat will benefit from private attorney involvement The second isto provide resources relevant to the cases and projects listed onthe website by making available materials such as forms andbriefing information relevant to the cases listed on the websiteand electronic access to experts who will assist the pro bonoattorney The first function acts as a forum for finding volunteersfor such activities as consulting on cases handling economicdevelopment transactions or working on intake systems The secondwebsite function supports volunteers who are uncomfortable in a newarea of law and need guidance and directionSpecial CommunitiesLSC administers the grant for the Veterans Consortium Pro BonoProgram to make available high quality free legal assistance tolitigants before the US Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims whocannot afford the cost of representation This year through thecompetitive grants process LSC awarded a fouryear grant to theVeterans Pro Bono Consortium a national organization that assistsveterans with their appeals process by linking them with pro bonoattorneysTIG InitiativesIn each of the statewide websites supported by TIG funds thereis or soon will be a section committed to pro bono attorneys Thesection is modeled after ProBonoNet in New York City a popularresource that contains substantial information on areas of lawrelevant to pro bono projects a calendar for CLE events and formsthrough which volunteers can pose questions to experts among othertools Pro bono attorneys are a valuable asset for lowincomepeople who have legal problems We want to sustain and grow privateattorney engagement by giving volunteers the necessary tools andsupport And website pro bono sections are essential to doingsoXII Intake EnhancementEfficient intake systems not only screen clients for eligibilitybut also give advice brief service and referral assistance tothose who cannot be fully represented Used well intake systemsoffer the promise of increasing assistance to many who are notcurrently served LSC staff were struck by the many innovativesystems used across the country In  we took the steps toencourage their growth and improvement through a program letteroutlining what we believe to be model intake practices We alsoadded review of and feedback on intake systems to all of ourquality review visits and through our technology grants we madeit possible for programs to improve their own systems using theexperiences of peersLSCs Program Letter on IntakeOur Program Letter on the characteristics of a telephone intakeadvice and referral system sets out the attributes of a superbsystem for grantees to both inform the field and create a set ofstandards LSC can use during onsite visits and for evaluatinggrant applications Intrinsic to the development of the ProgramLetter was the input we solicited on exemplary systems fromindividuals and organizations with special knowledge or experienceabout the topicIntake as a Critical Component of Quality Review VisitsIntake systems are examined during our onsite program qualityvisits In  recommendations and requirements issued in thewake of our visits led several programs to substantially modifytheir intake procedures One program was told to restructure itscapacity for telephone advice and brief service so that clientswould not have to personally come to the office for an intakeinterview We strongly encouraged another program to adoptprogramwide intake protocols that would make case handlingconsistent among all officesTIG Grants Enhancing IntakeBefore a lowincome person can receive appropriate legalassistance that individual has to gain access to legal servicessystem LSC promotes the use of technology to remove barriers toaccess by establishing seamless intake systems that cover an entirestate Several  TIG awards now well underway targeted intakesystems In Virginia callers to the statewide toll free

toensure that grantees legal work management and supervision isrigorous and effective Below we describe our efforts duringonsite visits and in the competition process to achieve this goalWe also show how the advocate component of statewide websitespromotes effective representation by sharing legal resources andexpertise  generally a function of legal work supervisorsLegal Work Management Reviews

create and empower a permanent statewide body thatcoordinates civil equal justice related efforts promotes theexpansion of civil equal justice initiatives and ensuresaccountability of all partners to

national partners to promote equalaccess During  we worked with national colleagues on specificactivitiesAmerican Bar AssociationLSC is very concerned about the law school debt burden thatgraduates carry A recent study found that the students median lawschool debt is more than   an amount that does not includethe additional undergraduate debt burden that many students bearThis debt burden coupled with the famously low salaries in thelegal services community dramatically reduces the ability of ourgrantees to attract and retain high quality new lawyers LSC hasjoined with the ABA Commission on Loan Repayment and Forgiveness tostudy this problem and to recommend solutionsNational Center on Poverty LawLSC has partnered with the National Center on Poverty Law toprovide training to the field on how to use the Internet and othertools to facilitate poverty law research In addition we supportedthe creation of a page Poverty Law Manual that introducesadvocates to the fundamentals of poverty lawNational Legal Aid and Defender AssociationLSCs work with NLADA continues on many fronts Collaborativeefforts enriched LSCs Resource Library Initiative websiteTogether we have advocated on behalf of LSC grantees at otherfederal agencies on issues arising out of other federal grants thatthe grantees receiveAARP and the Management Information ExchangeThe October launch of LRI was the result of our cooperativeendeavors with a host of national organizations  NLADA AARP LegalCounsel for the Elderly and MIE Our productive relationships withthese entities led to additional opportunities for informationgathering and sharing For example as a direct result of our LRIwork we were asked to cosponsor with AARP and MIE theInnovations in Civil Legal Services workshop at the NLADA AnnualConference described in detail above in Promoting the Developmentof Effective Legal ServicesLegal Services Technology Funders GroupLSC works cooperatively with several national organizations thatmake technology grants the Open Society Institute the National Center for StateCourts and the State Justice Institute Our joint goal is tocoordinate funding efforts to improve the delivery of legalservices through the use of technology In  our activitieswith the National Center for State Courts led to the award of a TIGgrant to our grantee in Maryland to implement a project on pro seresources first conceptualized by the National Center for StateCourtsConclusionThe past year saw the creation of many projects the maturationof several young initiatives and the opportunity to take existingefforts to new levels It has been a very productive twelve monthsnot without its stresses and disappointments Overall the Programsstaff is pleased with the progress we have made and believe thatour work has led to significant improvements in the opportunitiesfor poor people in our country to access legal services We arealso convinced that our endeavors have strengthened existing legalservices delivery systems so that clients now receive legalassistance more appropriate to their current needs and futurehopesMany years ago Reginald Heber Smith famously noted that thereason poverty organizations have not more completely answered thedemand of the poor for legal assistance is that they are grosslyunder financed That is as true today as it was in Nonetheless we believe that our technical assistance funds TIGawards LRI resources our partnerships with national organizationsand the many other methods by which LSC extends the resourcesallocated by Congress to our grantees has ameliorated somewhat thewoefully underfunded situation of legal services programs
