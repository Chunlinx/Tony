                                  Harvards  Question            Harvard Law School has undertaken a process oflongterm strategic planning so as to maximize achievement of its coremission according to Dean Robert Clarks semigrammatical but completelybusinesslike manifesto in the schools alumni bulletin As part of thisprocess HLS has hired the nations preeminent consulting firmMcKinsey Coto explain why law students are unhappy            This is not a difficult or mysterious question Ithas been explored in books such as Richard D Kahlenbergs BrokenContract and John Jay Osborns The Paper Chase and One L  afirstyearlawstudent memoir by future novelist Scott Turow The complaintsdont change much Most law students are there for lack of a better idea ratherthan any special enthusiasm for the subject matter They are heading for aprofession that is widely despised and filled with lawyers who wish theywerent These days top law students can anticipate being regarded as sharkseven as other career optionsinvestment banking Internet startupspass themby in glamour prestige and financial reward            Meanwhile they arepaying  a year to sit in large lecture halls and be hazed at random by adistant professor with a seating chart The curriculum mostly consists of longappellate opinions from which they are supposed to derive legal principles onthe needleinahaystack principle These two pillars of legal educationthesocalled Socratic method and the case methodwere both pioneered atHarvard and survive there less changed than anywhere else            No one forces these students to go to law school or tochoose Harvard in particular Indeed they compete fiercely to get in But thisjust puts them in an even sourer mood when US News  WorldReport s annual rankings list Harvard Law School not merely No  behindYale but for the past two years tied for that honor with Stanford            What concerns the HLSadministration is not so much that Harvard law students are depressed itsthat publicized studies show that theyre depressed A  NationalJurist survey assessing overall student satisfaction ranked Harvard Lawat the bottom of the pack th out of  HLS came in dead lastwhen Princeton Review asked  law students at  schools toquantify their quality of life Now we have something the modern universityadministrator can deal with This is not psychiatry This is management            There is nothing to be ashamed of in seeing a psychiatristum management consultant Nevertheless HLS did not announce that it wasseeking help In fact an alumni survey went out on the deans own letterheadand included a return envelope addressed to the suspiciously inconspicuousResearch International I received one in April It was  pages long andcontained  questions about my experience at the school from which Igraduated in  Meanwhile a fourmember McKinsey engagement team set upshop in a vacant law school office Team McKinsey surveyed current students andorganized student focus groups on demographic themes married students gaystudents Latino students Harvard Law Review members and so on Notwishing to be left out the law school faculty voted unanimously to expand thescope of McKinseys work to include faculty governance issues Faculty andstaff were interviewed individually as befits their rank            Actually it makes as much sense for Harvard LawSchool to hire a management consultant as it does for General Motors to dosothough how much sense that is exactly is an open question Systematic dataon students concerns might be just what is needed by a law schooladministration that has ignored mounds of anecdotal evidence But turning toMcKinsey was a bit odd since the company draws heavily on HLS for recruitsThree out of the four McKinseyites on the HLS project are HLS graduates Thegodfather of the McKinsey method yes another method former managing partnerMarvin Bower is a Harvardtrained lawyer whose innovation was to infuseconsulting with lawfirm professionalism In light of this connection McKinseyis giving Harvard a steep discount The study will only cost HLS a couple ofhundred thousand dollars            The connection shouldalso mean that McKinsey enjoys a head start in understanding the problem atHarvard Law School But it does raise a logical conundrum If they had such alousy education how good could they be as consultants Conversely if they areas good as McKinseys mystique implies how bad could their professionaltraining have been            But coming up with the right answer to a question likeWhy Are Harvard Law Students Unhappy should not tax the analytical skillseven of Harvard law graduates And furthermore the studys conclusions aremore or less irrelevant to the studys actual purposes both of which areachieved by the study itself One of these is cuddling the alumni NOT aDonation RequestWe Need Your Advice read the outside of the survey envelopesent to alumni True enough there was no solicitation inside But the surveyis nevertheless a marketing device intended in small part to gatherinformation as part of planning the next big fundraising campaign and inlarge part to create the feeling of ownership among an alienated alumnigroup            The other purpose is cuddling the students And herethe McKinsey study has already paid off Students seem to feel that the mereinvolvement of a management consulting firm is an indication that theadministration cares more than they previously thought Though some facultymembers feel McKinseys involvement shames the academy most think its ahealthy development for Harvard The students and professors of Harvard LawSchool would recognize this as the placebo effectif they had gone to medicalschool as their mothers really wanted
