                 uh what are your thoughts   well uh interestingly enough ive been reading in the paper about uh the option that says basically none of the above   yeah   and and uh given the choices thats sometimes how i feel i generally support President Bush and i feel like he gets a lot of bad press you know the the economy is really not his fault i dont think     uhhuh no no   but uh as far as anybody else running i think wow  is this the best we have to offer two hundred fifty million people to choose from and this is what we get   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh yeah i uh uh on Sunday night i was listening uh listening to uh the radio and they had they had speculated that uh there was some rumor that Tsongas was thinking of running again   yeah what i heard this morning is that although he has dropped out hes still got a lot of support in New York apparently   uhhuh   and today today you know it today is the New York primary and they seem to be saying that if he got a good hes still on the ballot in New York and they said if he got a good showing in New York then he would jump back in   uhhuh well that doesnt that seem sort of uh uh it doesnt seem seem like its useful for him to uh doesnt it seem like a waste of money though for him to come back into the race this late uh what are his chances of winning at this point   well  obviously he thought they werent too good if he if he backed out   exactly   uh i dont know maybe you know New York is a big primary   uhhuh   and there are a lot of others still to come maybe he feels like if he can carry New York strongly then he could still make it   uhhuh sure   but uh i dont know   yeah what what did you think about the Buchanan this term   uh its hard to say its nice to get somebody in there i would certainly never vote for him as far as i know   uhhuh uhhuh   but it its nice to have somebody else bring some issues to the front and at least ask the President some questions and have him have to defend himself   yeah   so i think in that sense its good i dont think that uh hes experienced enough to do the job uh   uhhuh   on the other hand maybe he is i mean  the newspaper men tell us all the politics anyway so maybe he can just go ahead and keep doing it   uhhuh right right well its yeah i i agree with you it does seem that he came in and kind of fluffed the pillows uh you know uh for the campaign for the campaign anyway so we didnt have to hear the same thing again   how about you yeah   uh we didnt have to uh  we didnt have to ignore a lot of uh Bushs success because you know he really did a lot in the last term he uh with with the Gulf War and all we could have we could have had our judgement clouded just by his his accomplishments you know i i really do think i am going to vote for him again next term but   umhum   but uh i wanted to know exactly everything that happened you know a lot of times maybe i forget   well when you look at it too how much does the Gulf War really count i mean how for example how much has it helped us as as a people   oh sure   im sure that we can say it helped the uh enemy rate of Kuwait um and uh sure it shook a people a few people up in Iraq but   uhhuh uhhuh   is is that a success or is that just sort of uh part of the job description as far as the President goes   right right uh what what i mean is though the strong sense of uh nationalism that occurred you know right after the war uh sort of heroized George Bush you know whether or not it was you know a success for us or whatnot  he tended to come out of the out of the   yeah   experience you know as the great American hero and uh   oh yeah yeah his his popularity was somewhere close to ninety percent at the time   yeah yeah   and it   so i i i am im glad that uh he cant get into office this time without at least uh addressing a lot of the the home front issues   yeah uhhuh   and uh well Todd uh it sounds like uh we may have covered a uh a minuscule portion of politics today   a very minuscule portion so what about Libya   what about Libya i have no idea what to say about   yeah you youve heard of the goings on there i guess   yeah i i dont know uh   if you know if youd asked me the same question about uh uh Kuwait you know at this early in the game i dont what i would have said then either i i dont   uh now of course the last time i listened to anything was on Sunday uh and they had still refused uh the concessions by the Security Council so   i thought it was let i have to make sure i get the uh stories right because because there was also yesterday the attract the attacks on the Embassy but now didnt Libya   right
