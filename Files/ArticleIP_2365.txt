                                 Whats Wrong With            This year of elections isalmost enough to make one give up on democracyor at least on the idea thatdemocracies are inherently more committed to peace than other forms ofgovernment            TheIsraeli chief of state who was totally committed to the peace process wasdefeated by a candidate who openly played on Israeli fears of Palestinians Thevictors idea of peacethroughstrength may make peace highly problematic            InRussia a majority of the electorate voted for openly nationalisticevenimperialisticcandidates in the first round Boris Yeltsin won the secondround only by recruiting Alexander Lebed a retired general with frightfulviews on Jews and other religious minorities            And inBosnia the mere discussion of elections has exacerbated ethnic tensionsallowing the most virulent nationalists to gain support and led to predictionsthat this democratic procedure could finish the country            What isgoing on Why is this most cherished belief not being borne out by eventsCould it even be that under certain circumstances democracies might bemore warlike than other states If so what does that portend for us andour search for a more peaceful world            The idea that democracies are the most peaceful politicalsystems is attractive and plausible but there is little evidence to supportthe notion Fewer than a dozen countries have been continuously democratic overthe past centurynot an especially large sampleand only two of them Canadaand the United States share a common border Many of these democracies havegone to war and not always in response to attack            Still worsedemocraciesor at least the electoral systems at their corehave producedmonsters some of them committed to waging war One thinks of Hitlersexploitation of the electoral system in Germany but one can see similar ifsmaller figures in Serbia and elsewhere            In thecountries emerging from the former Soviet Union aggressive nationalism hasbeen a winning formula for leaders who can deliver little else to theirpopulationsnot just Lebed but Serbian President Slobodan MilosevicArmenias Levon TerPetrosyan and others as well            Its tempting to view these examples as transitional Boththe Soviet and Yugoslav systems were based on the cynical exploitation ofethnicity so its only natural that succeeding systems continue the traditionOne could argue that the cure for despotism is democracy itself But that begsthe question of why democracies and often more established ones have beenless than peaceful            The Wests belief inpeaceful democracy endures in part because it celebrates us because wethink that the spread of democracy will usher in a period of peace that willallow us to concentrate on our own needs and ignore those of others Ourconviction reflects a widespread belief that the people are basically good andpacific while governments are fundamentally suspect and aggressive            If ourcherished belief isnt correct the reverse may be truethat under certainconditions democracies might be even more given to warlike behavior than otherforms of government Totalitarianism kept ethnic hatreds in check in manyplaces especially Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union Now that theCommunist totalitarians have been replaced by nominal democrats murderoushatreds and regional conflicts have reemerged            While its probably true that democracies are unlikely togo to war unless theyre attacked sometimes they are the first to take theoffensive And once involved in a conflict democracies may actually be lesswilling than authoritarian regimes to end it short of total victory Theseviews may make conflicts longer and more bloody than they would otherwisebe            While authoritarianregimes can make war without the consent of the governedas any number ofdemocratic enthusiasts have pointed outthey can also make peace withoutconsulting the voters Indeed democracies that take too many risks for peacemay not win popular support as the Israeli elections show            Nordoes democratization change the underlying reality of international relationsgeography With the possible exception of Poland countries do not move aroundvery much and thus their geopolitical concerns and the conflicts arising fromthem do not change very much The last decade has seen the triumphant return ofgeography in international relations and the enshrinement on the world scene ofthe old American political principle that where you stand depends on where yousit            Russias interest in gaining access to warmwater ports didnot arise under communismnor has it now disappeared We can hope that Moscowwill seek different means of advancing its interests differently than it has inthe past but democracy by itself wont repeal these pressures In fact thedisintegration of the Soviet empire has recreated the geographic relationshipbetween Berlin and Moscow that was the seedbed of World War I and World WarII            Theseobservations dont mean that we should withdraw our support for democracy inthe former Soviet bloc Democracy has done a great deal for all those who haveexperienced it but democracy alone is not enough Transforming those nationsinto peaceful members of the international system will require more than just afew elections and economic reform As the American Founders knew the rule ofthe people can be dangerous unless constrained by representative institutionsand constitutionalism Only if these additional arrangements exist can thesecountriesor our ownavoid disaster            We seem to have lost sight of the fact that democracy is asmuch about procedures as about preferred outcomes excusing Boris Yeltsins useof tanks against his own Parliament and his dispatch of troops to Chechnya ayear later This has made many people in the region who are still learningabout democracy cynical about what the system means And it has undercut ourauthority as democracys backers            Democracy by itself wontsolve all international problems it wont relieve usin AleksandrSolzhenitsyns phraseof having to worry about defending ourselves Insteadwe must work even harder to integrate these countries into the West and intothe values that have brought peace prosperity and freedom to so many peoplehere            That wont be easy Manywill grow discouraged especially in the short term as more open politics inthe former Soviet bloc lead not to peace but to more conflicts But weshouldnt blame democracy we should only understand what it can and cantdo
