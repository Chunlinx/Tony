                                  Kenneth Starr for the Defense            There he goes againAccording to associates interviewed last week by the New York Times Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has been actively considering an indictmentof President Clinton while Clinton is still in office The story publishedSunday surfaces at a typically inopportune moment The Senate is preparing tovote by Feb  on whether to remove Clinton from office Assuming that votefails senators will evidently consider whether to censure Clinton or toapprove findings of fact that he lied under oath and interfered with thejudicial system Starrs reappearance is just what Clinton needed to escapepunishment entirely            The leak is clearly aninside job According to the Times  Starrs associates with whom hespeaks frequently and has discussed the issue directly have beenresearching the issue and discussing it with Starr during the Senate trialStarr and his spokesman deny leaking the story The most charitable theory isthat it came from the group of prosecutors inside Starrs office whoaccording to the Times  believe Starr should seek the indictments Butby signaling that Starr might prosecute Clinton in the courts the disclosurefrom Starrs office protects Clinton in the Senate             It supplies an alternative villain Ever sinceJames Carville declared war a year ago the White House strategy has been todivert scrutiny to Starr Newt Gingrich and other enemies of Clinton In thepast six months the media and key congressional Democrats have turned onClinton twice first when Starr disappeared from the scene in September andagain when Gingrich disappeared in November By leaving Clinton alone onstagehis enemies forced Congress and the press to confront his shameful conduct            Now just as the Senateapproaches its verdict on Clintons misdeeds Starrs associates have shovedStarr back onstage and Democrats are turning the spotlight on him Clintonslawyer David Kendall is calling for an investigation claiming that Starr hasonce again engaged in illegal and partisan leaking Hours after theTimes story was released Sen Charles Schumer DNY declared onMeet the Press  Ken Starr is once again running amok On ThisWeek  Sen Richard Durbin DIll likened Starr to the obsessedwrongheaded investigator in The Fugitive  Republican senators groaned atStarrs gaffe citing it as further evidence that the independent counsel lawshould be scrapped The discussion of Starrs indiscretion supplanted thediscussion of Clintons             It antagonizes the Senate Democraticsenators were already angry at Starr for going to court to force MonicaLewinsky to submit to yet another deposition which she did for Houseprosecutors Monday These senators complained that Starr was interfering withthe Senates management of the trial White House aides lost no time turningthe Times report into another cause for Senate outrage Starr istampering with the Senate trial White House spokesman Jim Kennedy told theLos Angeles Times Saturday night Somebody ought to tell Starr hesnot the  st senator Democratic senators agreed Sunday morningon Face the Nation  Sen Carl Levin DMich grumbled that Starr orpeople in his office are trying to impact this trial Theyve tried to impactit before in a number of ways wrongfully irresponsibly The suspicion thatStarr is scheming to make the Senate punish Clinton provides a convenientrationalization for doing the opposite                            It relievespressure to punish Clinton in the Senate Clintons defenders haveargued for months that the Senate need not punish him because he can bepunished instead by an ordinary prosecutor and jury after he leaves officeStarrs gaffe confirms this argument freeing senators to vote not only againstClintons removal but against censure as well On Sundays television showsseveral moderate Republican and Democratic senators cited the Timesstory as evidence that as Sen Joseph Lieberman DConn put it Clinton canbe subject to the rule of law regardless of what the Senate does  Aprosecutor is still free to subject him to the normal criminal law and itsounds like Mr Starr is getting closer to doing just that On Face theNation  House prosecutor Rep Asa Hutchinson RArk observed with disgustthat the disclosure from Starrs office played into the hands of senators whosay theres no sense impeaching Clinton because he can be held accountablewhen he leaves office             It gives Democrats a reason to oppose findings offact Republicans have been floating a proposal under which theSenate rather than voting to remove Clinton from office would approve aresolution affirming that Clinton lied under oath and tampered improperly withthe judicial system Some Democrats have indicated they might support such aresolution depending on its language But the specter of a criminal indictmentby Starr stirs up suspicion among Democrats that these findings of fact mighthelp Starr prosecute Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justiceThis suspicion may be a delusion or a selfdelusion but it neverthelessprovides an excuse to vote against the resolution                            It pits Starragainst Lewinsky House prosecutors spent weeks portraying Clinton asLewinskys treacherous abuser They scheduled her deposition for Monday hopingshe would contradict Clintons testimony and convince senators that he hadcommitted perjury and obstructed justice Instead the Sunday Timesstory resurrected the notion that Starr not Clinton posed the chief threat toLewinsky Starr had already forced her to testify for the House prosecutors byinvoking her immunity agreement thereby implicitly threatening her withprosecution Now he seemed to be threatening Clinton with prosecution as wellWhere would he stop            The resulting deposition seems legally and politicallycounterproductive According to leaks that appear to have come from Clintonssympathizers  House prosecutor Rep Ed Bryant RTenn tried to interrogateLewinsky about details of her sexual encounters with Clinton but was ruledout of order  another prosecutor Rep James Rogan RCalif told Lewinskyshe could be compelled to testify again and  Clintons lawyers asked her noquestions and instead apologized on Clintons behalf Reports indicate thatLewinsky thanked Clintons lawyers for the apology and that she respondedcarefully and unhelpfully to Bryants questions lest she contradict herprevious testimony and get herself into more trouble with Starr            For more than a year Clintons surrogates havebeen calling Starr an outofcontrol prosecutor To their good fortune hesproving them right
