        okay well do you have any formal programs in your area   sure i used to cycle around the block two or   oh no     yeah i recycled once before no yes actually we do we have Berkeley is a very avantgarde recycling city   somehow that doesnt surprise me   yeah they they go around and they give you these boxes and you you fill these boxes up and you take them out and they leave you know uh you leave them on the curbstone and every Thursday or some such day they come by and pick them up problem is you end up with these boxes in your home that you know get pretty piled up with such things as glass and tin cans and newspapers and and and by the time you you manage to drag one downstairs you know its its work i i i just the the there theres got to be a better way of incorporating it you know somehow so that the manufacturers uh   yeah   uh that theres an incentive to get it back to them   yeah what i i dont know we we there are some beginnings of formal programs where we are though theyre not in our town i mean Jackie and i uh recycle cans you know we just we just fill up a we have a trash can set aside for aluminium cans and when it gets full we just take it down and drop it off at the recycling center but thats about the extent of ours uh i dont it seems to me like if if they really wanted to get serious or you know the government and uh the other private industries that could benefit from it would make uh perhaps more permanent uh exterior fixtures which you know wouldnt be hassle to drive to or carry stuff to you know that thats kind of one of the thoughts that i had about it   exactly you know what what they uh oh another thing is that it the industry has got to get the mind set that what theyd do affects the universe you know the affects the environment   umhum   what they manufacture has got to be and the way its packaged has got to take that into consideration   yeah   but like here in Berkeley you cant buy anything from a fastfood place anything like that thats in styrofoam   yeah theyve switched to that paperboard the pressboard stuff   uh and you know its its supposedly decomposes ive heard some stories though about that uh the thing that that lasts longest in in in a in a the the uh landfills       is not so much the diapers and the things that everyones yelling about but its the newspapers   is that right   yeah and thats really strange you wouldnt think that but whenever you see you know theyre usually uh wrapped real tight and bundled and under pressure themselves before they get put into the landfill so   yeah   inner areas of them are are protected       so they dont decompose   isnt that something   isnt that you know you and all those thousands of trees that gets cut down and you think well geez well newspapers pretty good because it will you know   yeah i saw a sign at the local WalMart here back there in the baby section talking about WalMart does not buy disposable diapers because they dont decompose as rapidly as people say they do so they just buy the ones that dont decompose at all  i thought that was interesting           indeed well you know theres got to be a fortune in that you know ive got all weve got to do is get together and figure out some way to to use these diapers in some useful product you know some some some   huh like like compost   well yeah yeah or or or or a compost brick uh you know   yeah   you know build your next sky rise out of compost brick you know youd see the little blue things flickering through it but       i think that might give it a little added touch of something im not sure what           oh   no but that so theyre aware of it in Texas huh   they are yeah theyre uh like i said weve weve just recently i guess in our part were like right in the middle of the state and you know were not more in some of the metropolitan areas like Dallas or Houston or something but that you you are starting to see more big large uh recycling like dumpsters where   that makes my heart sore because the last time i was in Texas was on a hunting trip and i was there with a couple of buddies and we had filled up a couple of cans were going down the road about eighty miles an hour and rolled down the window and just threw them out now   oh no you messed with Texas   uh i i will have to say that the people i was there with were Texans   uhhuh   i was visiting it was not my idea   well you know theyve got these adopt a highway programs they have to give the convicts something to do you know   well i i understand that and i think that that that hes certainly contributed to that   yeah im gonna say i dont typically   i want you to know youve taken a big load off my chest ive never been able to to confess that to anyone and now ive gotten to confess it   well im im happy to oblige  not happy that you did it but you know   well somethings got to be done i tell you what i was just watching a a show the other night on on Antarctica uh and how theyre wanting to make it a a uh an international park zone so that no one country you know gets down there and trashes it for mining rights or any other thing and um uh   yeah   it just it just amazes me uh you know that that that theres so little left on this earth where there is that sort of thing and of course the only reason that that place is left is because the damn climate is so inhospitable that no one can live down there you know   right right yeah well of course  theyre theyre trying real hard to devise ways to sustain life more comfortably down there just so they can get at some of those resources   yeah well theyre theyre doing it they you know theyre theyre learning and and its inevitably doomed and speck you know all they got to do is find one speck of platinum or one speck of gold or uranium and and   yeah well theres already oil there isnt there   well they not uh not absolutely for sure now there is some off offshore   umhum   but as far as on the continent i dont think that anyone drilled a rig on the continent yet   yeah   but uh in any event   huh   i think we all just sort of have to hunker down and do something about it but you know its like we we we have all the needs that you know a civilized society has and i think that its not all our responsibility to to do that i mean the the the manufacturers would would manufacture things in ways that were biodegradable and did not damage the the the environment you know i think that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those products   oh boy there theres such a higher level of consciousness about that now thats thats got to be i mean if you could come up with something like that just to the the marketing advantage would be phenomenal   yeah and i think that the people are ready to pay a little extra for that kind of marketing   yeah i well i think weve already seen that i mean just in the the this the few products that have uh plugged that is a is an advantage you know it costs more and people have jumped on them   yeah yeah well i i know im willing i just uh you know its just i i have certain needs for certain things and uh you know i really cant help it how it is packaged   yeah right right and then as soon as something comes along that is that that you need and all of a sudden its available and in a environmentally   i have the need for whats there found ways and i will switch immediately and i think probably the rest of the planet will too   conscious package i i tend to agree and it sure would be nice to see something like that   well listen its been a pleasure talking with you Steve right   yeah thats right i sure enjoyed it   alright well you take care and listen uh the next time you run over a beer can in the road   ill think of you  okay  byebye   please do alright bye
