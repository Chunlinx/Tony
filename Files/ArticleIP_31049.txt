                                 Generation Gap            The screenwriter andnovelist Hanif Kureishi  My Beautiful Laundrette   has a yen forambivalence for situations in which no character has a monopoly on eitherrightness or wrongness The characters are all right Or rather theyre allwrong No they arent Right and wrong dont comfortably apply They try toact as if theyre right but suggest by their behavior that they might well bewrongakin to a person who turns one way at an intersection and then keepsglancing anxiously at the rearview mirror To be human is to be pulled indifferent directions the least trustworthy people are the ones who seem mostcertain            This theorem applies especially to My Son theFanatic  directed by Udayan Prasad from a superbly wry screenplay byKureishi based on his short story Its central characterthe my of thetitleis Parvez Om Puri a Pakistani cab driver in a bleak industrial cityin the north of England The genial Parvez wants nothing more than to make itas an Englishman to the point of enduring a steady patter of racisthumiliations and drifting into a second career as a panderer Nevertheless hetells himself that his life has a kind of integrity            His grown son FaridAkbar Kurtha doesnt see it that way The angry young man dumps hisAngloSaxon fiancee and falls in with a group of Islamic fundamentalists someof whom he houses under his fathers modest roof At home poor Parvez isreviled for the decadent culture that he embodies at work hes treated as apet a little man by the German businessman Stellan Skarsgard whom hesupplies with prostitutes Parvez has no status in either Western or Islamicculture In his den he pours himself a glass of singlemalt Scotch and listensto Fats Waller and tries to avoid the incinerating glares of his increasinglytraditional wife Gopi Desai and the fervent prayers of his son And he findshimself falling in love with Bettina Rachel Griffiths an English prostitutewhose compromised purity seems to mirror his own            M y Son the Fanatic is built on incongruitiesonthe juxtaposition of fierce Islamic piety and amiable Western dissolution Thetensions give it a comic tingle but that comedy is rooted in melancholy andalienation The mix of tones is marvelously embodied in Om Puri a charismaticslightly ravaged star of Indian cinema Puris Parvez begins with a magneticconfidence in his own foolishness Hes proud of how he grasps for status Inthe movies prologue he can hardly contain his delight that his son is set tomarry the daughter of the local chief inspector a man whose revulsion for thisdarkskinned taxi driver with his cheap camera is manifest in every frozenhalfsmile Kureishi could have spun a whole film and a more commercial oneout of this Birdcage opening but he has already mined that vein in hishilarious novel The Buddha of Suburbia  When Parvez tells hisGerman patron that he holds himself above his fellow driversSir I just jokewith them A gentleman is my goalthe tension between how he regards himselfand how the world regards him is heartbreaking Hes in for the comeuppance ofhis life            But if the fathers wayis wrong the sons way is dangerously out of touch It condemns before itunderstands After all both Parvez and the call girl Bettina are playing bycapitalisms rules trying to get a foothold in a society that closely guardsaccess to its more proper ladders to the top That means that Farids moralabsolutismsand the fundamentalists picketing and firebombing of thewhorehousearent so much wrong as entirely beside the point Nowhere is thismore evident than in Griffiths lovely and selfpossessed performance whichtranscends every hookerwithaheartofgold clich What she does andwhat she is have no connection she does what she does to get by Theaffection between her and Parvez comes from the happy realization that in spiteof their differences theyre on the same bush league teamand each hasfigured out what the other is truly worth            M y Son the Fanatic isnt entirely pure in itsmotives Parvezs wife remains a remote and unsympathetic figure a woman whoselack of appreciation fully justifies his drift into the arms of another loverThe theme has been much on Kureishis mind His most recent novelIntimacy  is a nakedly autobiographical exploration of a mans thoughtson the eve of his abandonment of his wife and two small sons for a youngerwoman The breadth of Kureishis selfjustification in Intimacy isfairly breathtaking he really does need more characters more checks on thecentral characters point of view Kureishi is much more convincing as adramatist than as a monologist            Still My Son theFanatic isnt an easy sell Miramax picked it up for US distribution andsat on it for a couple of years reportedly debating whether to alter itsirresolute ending Its shocking that the company would even consider such achange since the films irresolution is its greatest strength Kureishishopelessness is the kind that leaves you exhilarated convinced that even ifthe characters on screen havent found a right way the quest for a right wayis what keeps themkeeps all of usalive The punk aesthetic lingers inKureishi The more hopeless the movie gets the more upbeat it feels            Critics of all persuasions have been beating their breastsand warbling for Disneys new Tarzan cartoon Theyre halfright Themovie is a collision between inspiration and tastelessness between thedefiantly quirky and the wholesomely homogenized I hated it in principleIhate most modern Disney cartoonsbut adored a good deal of it in practice Thestoryboarding frequently borders on genius and few cartoon characters have hadthe gorgeously dizzy aplomb of Minnie Drivers Jane            The noxious first Theres something really ickyabout the way the gorillas talk I know animals have spoken English incartoons since cartoons began to speak but Tarzan is the first timetheyve done it in a story in which language is a central theme The daft charmof Edgar Rice Burroughs protagonista little boy raised by gorillas whoseanimal and human languages are constantly vying for supremacydoesnt have thesame piquancy when the gorillas talk like characters from Leave It toBeaver  If were all the same under the skin or fur then whats thepoint of the story Glenn Closes tender mama gorilla has clearly been tofinishing school Lance Henriksens massive patriarch must have learned to talkfrom watching afterschool specials I said he could stay he grits afterbaby Tarzan gets adopted by his missus That doesnt make him my son Gorillacomic relief comes from Rosie ODonnell as Tarzans pal Id have welcomed herselfcongratulatory sarcasm in Instinct  but here it made my back hairstand up You can pretty much ignore Rosie Glenn and Lance but itsimpossible to shut your ears to PhilCollins that is whose songs featureAfroCeltic polyrhythms over softrock sludge            All is forgiven when Tarzan the voice of TonyGoldwyn meets Minnie DriverI mean Jane When he scoops her up to elude someangry baboons the sequence is more electrifying more dizzyingly vertiginousthan anything in Jurassic Park The Lost World  It gets betterwhen they stop to chat Hes a likable schnook with a long skinny chin and aslightly embarrassed lope Shes all blithe insouciancea wonderful parody ofproper English maidenhood straining to burst its corsets and grab a piece ofjungle hunk What a voice Driver has Breathlessly throatyit only justmanages to contain its own melodic exuberance
