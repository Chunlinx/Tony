their actionsno forgiveness no rehabilitation no excuseswhatsoeverbut shes also admitted to bouts with childhood molestationbulimia and bipolar mood swings and she has asked that people who suffer suchtraumas be given a little TLC There are hints that she has a most unBillyGrahamlike lifestyle In a bizarre episode a couple of years ago an FBI agentclaimed he was driven to attempt to murder his

still damned good looking tough but vulnerable and otherassorted mystery clich traits Whats special about her is her job chiefmedical examiner of Virginia which allows her to witness more gruesome sightsthan one could dream of During the s Cornwell worked in a coronersoffice and now she specializes in clinical descriptions of autopsiesexplaining in graphic detail how to analyze the vaginal swab of a raped corpseor how to test skin ripped off a tortured childs buttock As if that werentbad enough Cornwell has also given Scarpetta problematic colleagues TheresPete Marino a bigoted and emotionally stunted cop who eats and drinks toomuch and Benton Wesley an older WASP FBI profiler with whom she eventuallystrikes up an affair            In Postmortem  Scarpettasimpressive debut the tone was grim and graphic focused on the nittygritty ofcrime detection and the challenges faced by a woman entering this mostly malebusiness Scarpetta was the American counterpart in a way to

finallydefeated Gault murdering him in a Manhattan subway tunnel But in the newinstallment Grethen escapes from a mental asylum and goes after her            Characters like Gault andGrethen are the basis of the standard praise for Cornwell which is that shehas a Dickensian grasp of evil Dont believe it Temple and Carrie are cartoonmeanies who hate Scarpetta for no apparent reason theyre about as Dickensianas a satanic clown doll named Chuckie Cornwells plots are getting weaker andI wont claim too much for her prose either Lacking the selfmonitoring skillthats crucial to a really good writer she projects ugly fixations ontoScarpetta remarking constantlyand with embarrassing naked approvalon herblond Teutonic looks            Myfavorite Cornwellian clunker is a cheap bid for sinister

moved torather suspect erotic awe by the nubile beauty of Lucys perfect youngbody            On such issues Cornwell ishilariously confused but not without insight The increasing abstraction of herplots allows her to do what she does best write about the job The mostpoignant parts of her books detail the pressures Scarpetta faces as anexecutive whos responsible for the welfare of her subordinates but underruthless pressure to deliver results the impossibility of sorting throughoverwhelming floods of information and straining for an educated guess thesadness of a life lived in

almost supernatural evil She conveys somehow a genuine griefCall it millennial if you must or simply modernprofessional Gothic Thepain is out there could be her slogan At the end of Point of Origin
