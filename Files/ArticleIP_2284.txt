                                 Credit Check            In June  when RonaldReagans reelection ads first crowed that it was morning in Americainflation was at  percent unemployment at  percent The Dow was at interest on a year mortgage was  percent and the White House wasprojecting a budget deficit of  billion In the summer of  inflationstands at  percent unemployment at  percent The Dow hovers just under interest on a year mortgage is  percent and the administrationprojects a deficit of  billion If that was morning this must be highnoon            In otherrespects too the country is in better economic shape now than during theReagan years While the s recovery brought a rise in social problems such ashomelessness and welfare the s boom has been accompanied by a decline inthose same ills Recent hints of an increase in real incomes suggest thataffluence may be more widely shared this time around Faced with such brillianteconomic performance Republicans tend to be as eager to deny any credit to theincumbent president as they were to give him all the credit in the sDemocrats display the opposite inconsistency            Serious economists tend to agree with the currentRepublican line that presidents have less impact on the economy than mostpeople think Presidents can screw things upas Richard Nixon did when heimplemented wage and price controls in  or as Jimmy Carter did when hefailed to focus on the problem of surging inflation in  But when it comesto producing the general conditions of prosperity presidents have littlepower The governments main economic lever the money supply is the provinceof the autonomous Federal Reserve Board As Paul Krugman points out grossdomestic product growth has been remarkably consistent over the past couple ofdecades at about  percent a year despite dramatic reversals in economicpolicy            Nonetheless presidentialpolicy does affect the health of the economy Though the Fed is supposed to beinsulated from politics it is not completely immune A fouryear termalternating with the presidentialelection cycle means that a onetermpresident gets a Fed chairman of his choosing for just under  percent of hispresidency while a twoterm president has his own appointee in control nearly percent of the time A successful chairman reflects well on the presidentwho picked him Carter for instance deserves considerable credit for choosingPaul Volcker in  Since Volcker was committed to taming inflation even atthe cost of putting the economy into a recession just before the  electionCarter was committing honorable suicide by picking him            Furthermore presidents can make it harder or easier for the Fed to do its jobthrough fiscal policytaxes spending and deficits Presidents also steertrade and dollar policy but have a less tangible impact on business andconsumer confidence It may be ridiculous that our presidential elections arevirtual referenda on the state of the economy when so much is out of apresidents hands But if voters ignored the condition of the economy inchoosing their president they would be even less realistic            So with all those cautions in mind I askagain Who deserves credit In a recent column in the Washington Post James K Glassman argues that Reagan should get it Reagans tax cuts Glassmancontends fueled the current gush of tax revenues as well as a flourishingentrepreneurial culture This is pretty farfetched Taking into account bothtax cuts and tax increases Reagan didnt reduce the overall tax burden duringhis presidency Supplyside dogma notwithstanding what has boosted taxrevenues beyond expectations in the last couple of years are the last two taxincreases  in  and  And in fact the economy has reactedbetter to increases than to cuts See The BestPolicy Reagans large spending increases for defense and the growth inentitlements without higher taxes created a budget deficit that inarguably hurtthe economy Government borrowing left less capital for private investmentwhich meant that growth was lower and entrepreneurs were worse off thanotherwisefor which were paying the price today The credit Reagan deservesfor todays good times is limited to his sometimes equivocal support for freetrade and his reappointment of Volcker in  Under pressure fromfreelunch Republicans he declined to reappoint Volcker again in  butchose Alan Greenspan whos been just as good though under less challengingcircumstances            RobertReischauer of the Brookings Institution makes a more interesting nominationGeorge Bush Though to conservatives his name is still synonymous withbetrayal Bush is a minor hero for exactly the reason that Reagan puristsconsider him a major traitor By raising taxes significantly the budget dealBush signed in  challenged the expansion of the deficit for the first timein a decade The deals spending caps and payasyougo rules also broughtdiscipline to domestic spending The same year Bush fell on his sword bybreaking his read my lips pledge he impaled himself again by reappointingGreenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve Like Volcker Greenspan was afierce enemy of inflation who wouldnt prime the pump before an election tohelp the incumbent though that didnt stop the Bushies from prodding Greenspanto loosen up            Bill Clinton deserves as much credit as Bush and arguablymore He too rehired Greenspan and has had more respect for Greenspansindependence than Bush did Reluctantly but less reluctantly than BushClinton focused on the need for deficit reduction His  economic planwhich passed with zero Republican votes included a tax increase that wassmaller in real terms than the one Bush agreed to in  but was equallysignificant as a harbinger of changed direction His  economic programdirectly benefited the economy bringing down interest rates and boosting thestock market to record highs Like the  deal it was also a genuine act ofselfsacrifice on the presidents part Raising taxes probably cost Clinton aDemocratic Congress in the  election and might easily have cost himreelection in             With prodding from theGingrich Congress which also deserves some credit Clinton has remainedfaithful to the cause of deficit reduction He has also aided the economy inless obvious ways His Treasury secretary Robert Rubin has been atremendously reassuring figure to Wall Street With Rubins help Clintonmanaged to forestall a Mexican financial collapse in  which posed anunderappreciated threat to the US economys recovery then in its fifth yearLike Reagan and Bush Clinton has supported the extension of free trade UnlikeReagan or Bush he was in a position to deliver NAFTA and GATT by gettingenough Democrats in Congress to go alongthough one might argue that thebenefits of free trade are primarily longterm and dont have much to do withour current opulence            The economy could be stillbetter Real wages continue to grow slowly To increase wages significantlywithout inflation would require a return to pre levels of real growthwhich hasnt happened Just the same the American economy is the healthiestits been in a quartercentury And for his contributions to it the incumbentdeserves at least two cheers
