        why dont you start because im sure youve seen more movies than i have     i dont know um lets see have you seen John F Kennedy   no have you   no i wanted to go see that one i was hoping my roommate went and saw it and she liked it what about um Hand That Rocks the Cradle     no and i like i heard some bad reviews on that   its supposed to be kind of scary well lets   yeah yeah have you seen any lately  what about videos   no well i mean um lets see well actually i have seen one im trying to think of the name of it um its got Bruce Willis in it and um   is it a new one with him   yeah but i cant think of whos in it but it was real good   it wasnt Hudson Hawk was it   no huhuh that was horrible   oh i havent see that one   um its the guy thats from In Living Color   oh even i mean Keenan Winey  yeah i guess so Ivory is his last name   i yeah well you you know who im talking about im trying to well i cant think of it but that was it was really i thought i liked it because it was funny and they had so many it was i mean it was really action packed and it was bloody but they had a lot of um   uhhuh   like one liners and stuff but i cannot think of the name im so bad with names of movies   uhhuh well i had a little more time to think while they were trying to find somebody and you know i havent seen i havent seen um any current releases my husband and i just dont get out to the movies that much   oh really do you have children   um no but we were lazy  we like to rent and watch them and be able to rewind them and say what he say   oh i hear you well Leslie theres um a ton   we saw well we saw Flatliners i like that a lot   gosh thats been out a long time   yeah and um lets see Awakenings did you see that   now what was that like   oh it was great it was real good it was kind of and its a true story or so they say yeah about these people that that uh like   oh really   near comatose i guess youd say and they uh with medication theyre able to wake them up after after like twenty thirty years and i mean its not a real action packed movie but it was pretty neat   umhum i remember the name of  its called The Last Boy Scout it was with Bruce Willis and i cant think of the other name the guys name but yeah it was good   ooh and did you like that one you did okay and   im trying to think well uh what about City Slickers since you watch  um   you know ive been wanting to i every time i go to the movie store to rent that its all rented   thats the same with same with me   yeah i mean ive been at least three or four times just to get that movie and every time i go i guess i must be going at the wrong times   okay well um lets see   i did see Beauty and the Beast  its beautiful   well i want to go see that one but ill probably wait for it till it comes out on video because i dont think i can get any my date to take me   yeah  just go to a matinee theres so many kids there nobody will notice notice that youre not you know with a kid i said theres theres so many people you wont notice youre not they wont notice youre not with anybody   well  thats why im doing it well yeah thats true well um what about did you see Dances with Wolves   yes   i saw that two or three times and then whats the other one Kevin Costner was in   hm yeah i saw that one too did you like that one   Robin Hood okay yeah ive ive probably seen it about three times umhum   did you that was pretty long one   yeah but i like Kevin Costner   how many times did you see Dances with Wolves   i only watched that once   you did   yeah and i cried   uh i did too it was so sweet     uh i could probably tell you more that i wanna see than i have seen what about um Fried Green Tomatoes     yeah i wanna see that one too my husband kind of went hm   yeah well   so he wasnt real excited about going to see that one have may have to go with my mom   well a friend of mine went to see is it whats the name of it Father of the Bride with Steve Martin and she said that was real cute umhum   oh really yeah ill probably wait for that one to came up on video it has to be real good for me to spend the money   what about the one with um Arnold Schwarzenegger whatever   which one   Terminator    oh i havent seen that one either   well thats good i cried at that one too   you cried in Terminator    yeah at the at the end i wont tell you but  ill miss that   okay  lets see have uh  did you say youd seen Flatliners yeah okay what about lets see Edward Scissorhands   yeah that i saw for the first time uh uh probably about two weeks ago   i just loved that movie that was so sweet   umhum thats cute then therere some what are some other ones i wonder i havent really seen that many new ones because   oh no i havent either my in in fact were supposed to get out to movies tonight but i dont know what were gonna go see   now its too late now   yeah well we might be going to a late one yeah   no well um trying to think what else ive seen thats even i guess if i see them its because they come on HBO or whatever   yeah see weve got HBO and you they have to be pretty old to get on there   oh really   well i think so i think they have a lot of the same ones run over and over again   well see now Edward Scissorhands been on there like every week now   yeah thats what i hate is they overdo it when you know when they get a major release   im trying and then well what about the one with Tom Cruise in it thats an old one Days of Thunder   yeah i havent even bothered watching that one   really   yeah is it good   it it  its okay probably have to be a Tom Cruise fan   is it yeah well my dad is if you can believe that but im not a real Tom Cruise fan   oh really   nah hes okay but i dont think i dont see uh what i guess all the young girls see in him
