        ah so Beverly what do you think about drug testing   i think in some professions its uh essential things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly   yeah weve we got a lot of mistakes here uh in no Maryland Baltimore area because of um train conductors uh on drugs i think weve had two terrible accidents here recently and also on um   umhum   just like i bet you within five days a truck  where the uh a dump truck where the driver was uh high on marijuana i guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and uh drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the uh a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay   oh my goodness   and it would that would tried up traffic for a long time everybody died the fire was terrible it was awful so i yeah i think youre right i i think i if if if its if youre in a field but then you know who would test all truck drivers   they  thats that is a problem and every time before they get into a vehicle   you know right yeah i think i think at looking at athletes being drug tested   i mean umhum   i dont know even i think the random drug testing i dont know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs because theyre still being caught does that make sense um   right yes  it may make a difference for some of them   yeah and then uh i think   because they dont want to lose that lucrative uh career   yeah i i i think in the long run i think its it would be good i think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know the the test hasnt come down hard on anyone i dont i dont know   umhum right umhum however here in Dallas uh we had a a player Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team   yeah umhum   and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing and was to the point he is on probation its to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract and they wouldnt have to pay him and the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him but they couldnt afford to replace him and still pay his contract   right   and uh just recently he was uh missing from practice and whenever he missed like that usually he had some kind of problem and so a mandatory drug test was done was positive so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract   umhum yeah get rid of him right yeah but   and so in his case he lost his whole career hes been in the paper in jail and its just been awful and  talk about a terrible role model   yeah right i i think that that thats a terrible thing you know  its really funny though um i guess my dad was hit by a a drunk driver who was also high um when i was probably eighteen my senior year in high school   um oh my goodness   and um  though hes alive today and everything worked out fine it it it happened about two blocks from the high school and a friend came and got me and i was there and i could smell the dope and i could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him   umhum   and nothing ever happened and from from that point on i became so antidrunk driving you know now i think people should be allowed to drink i think thats an adult responsibility whatever   oh thats terrible umhum   but i really uh im so antidrunk driving and and drugs have uh long lasting effects and i i guess when i younger i was um  probably a little more liberal on the subject   umhum i think most of us are   yeah and but as ive as as as soon as that happened i guess when i was eighteen years old if youd have asked me id have thought it was fine but it by the time i was nineteen my opinion had totally changed yeah   umhum yes if you know someone for example we have uh some friends whose son was driving home from work was hit head on by a drunk driver the drunk and his wife in the car were killed   umhum   and uh Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school   right   he went through surgery after surgery and for a long time they didnt even know whether hed be normal again and he as far as his athletics athletics hes lost all of that   hm traction and all that terrible stuff right   he uh has been tutored and hell catch up in school and everything but hes still not back where he was he may never have all those motor skills back   right yeah i dont think somebody yeah you dont you dont you dont have the right to interfere in somebody elses life i cant even say you know i wouldnt even say ruin somebodys life you dont have the right to interfere in somebodys life   no another thing that we saw here recently one of some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a a train track ran through   umhum   and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train well he missed the train missed him but uh a big mirror type thing sticking out like a metal thing sticking out hit him in the head   yeah   he was in a coma for four months hes out of the coma now and eventually they think he will come back   umhum   but you dont know that and but hes lost he was an outstanding football player   right
