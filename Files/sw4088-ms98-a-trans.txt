        okay well uh i guess since i called ill start out with my feelings about it uh i think that its absolutely essential that some some at least some employees       of government agencies and companies be tested especially when it effects public safety i mean the military obviously uh people that run trains and airplanes and and the like   umhum   uh for others i dont know i dont feel as strong about it uh i dont really dont have any objection to it but i cant really say im for it either whats your feeling   well uh it it it it becomes sort of a a topic where i sit there and and i have a knee jerk reaction and then i have a a reaction after i think about it a little longer uh for me i i guess i feel like uh we have we we that we when we give in on these things we tend to move towards a a uh society where uh everything is a is uh regulated uh i think youre right about uh certain jobs and uh certainly something like uh a bus train pilots uh its obviously something thats a necessity it because it because the function of the job is is within all everyone pretty much everyone in the world uh would admit to the fact that that these drugs might impair their abilities   uhhuh   okay   yeah   and like so i guess in some ways im agreeing with you uh that those would be something that should continue to have uh drug testing of course it is certainly not acceptable for an Eastern pilot to uh have just had eight martinis before he went off to fly   right  or Northwest i think Northwest has had a lot of problems with that   right   i uh ive been in uh two two situations where ive had to under go grug testing drug testing i was in the military for a number of years     umhum   and then i worked for four years uh as a as a an electrical inspector uh in a nuclear plant that was under construction and in both cases uh you know we were subject to uh to random testing for drugs and i know a lot of people refused to a lot especially at the nuclear plant or would uh you know strongly object to it but uh you know i could see the need for it so i i went along with it       i i think if i were a clerical worker for instance though uh and really couldnt have effected anybody else im not sure that id   i think it might be inappropriate for us to say for me to say that in any in any industry uh something where where see youre talking about a plant where okay if youre a nuclear inspector   umhum   or where youre a uh person who works on safety features for nuclear inspection well that makes sense   umhum uhhuh   but uh were talking about you you know youre saying well uh and i think you uh that you just stated the same thing that if you were a clerical you you you know a clerical person there or you were a secretary there now wheres the justification   uhhuh right   what what what okay you know  lets say that we can you you you you had had a uh uh you went to a party and uh not not that anyone ever does it but you were smoking pot uh now how is that going to make any difference   um umhum   you know unless you very unless you uh uh PCP does exist apparently in the blood stream   uhhuh   for a long period of time but the ability for you to function seems to be   right   uh very it its very questionable as to whether it has any real effect upon you   right probably alcohol has more of an effect for for a shorter period of time   right so but i I just went through one recently   uhhuh   and uh the place i just transferred jobs not too long ago and so i went through the whole process and the   uhhuh uhhuh   theres really no justification what so ever for why i had to do it i mean uh   uhhuh   its a company that its basically a oh management engineering company   umhum so they were doing it just to they wanted to make sure that their employees were productive probably thats why   now what wait but then but then uh but then if the if youre saying that   thats probably why they justified it   uh     no im just trying to imagine why they would wanna test you   they should also regulate right what they should also regulate how many hours of sleep i must have they should also regulate how much what kind of nutrition i have they should also regulate see its a its a its a disturbing trend   right right yeah i i think that people who do something that could hurt somebody else   right   uh should be subject to the testing i guess thats probably the the way id term it and im talking about bus drivers as you mentioned and pilots and what have you uh others that really can only hurt themselves shall we say uh   umhum
