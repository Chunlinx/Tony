                                 Daddys Boys            Except for political junkies most people can tellyou precisely one thing about George W Bush His father used to be presidentNo wonder hes in majorleague denial when asked about matching Poppysachievements These are the kind of psychological analyses that Im not reallythrilled about talking about he told the New York                Times revealing in a classic Freudian protestation more than he realized            But it would beimpossible for anyone in Bushs shoes not to bear an especially heavy Oedipalburden The life of the only son of a president to become presidentJohnQuincy Adamsillustrates why W has followed in his fathers footsteps byattending Phillips Academy and Yale getting into the oil business running forCongress and now seeking the presidency JQA as he was called todistinguish him from Dad had the more daunting task of succeeding hisfatherthe nations first vice president and second president and an eminentpolitical theoristas one of the great statesmen of the early republic If Wwere to learn even a little about JQAs unhappy plight he might well realizethe virtues of psychological selfanalysis            The senior John Adams was a leader in the AmericanRevolution and wrote the influential tracts Thoughts on Government andDefence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States ofAmerica  He saw no reason his eldest son born in  shouldnt attainequal greatness Adams set a rigorous course of study for young John assigninghim for example to read Thucydides History of                the PeloponnesianWar in the original Greek at age  Morally stern Adams also admonishedhis son to make a good account of himself and continued to hector him wellinto his adulthood You come into life with advantages which will disgrace youif your success is mediocre Adams wrote to the yearold JQA in  Ifyou do not rise to the head not only of your profession but of your country itwill be owing to your own Laziness Slovenliness and Obstinacy            JQA didnt need hisfathers entreaties to work hard He had internalized them fully and hiscopious diary entries reveal neurotically high ambitions and an obsessionallevel of selfreproach for not meeting them Indolence indolence I fearwill be my ruin he wrote at age  voicing a refrain he repeated throughouthis hardworking life At that same young age he awoke one morning with ahangover after a night spent caroling with friends during which he recordedthe bottle went round with an unusual rapidity Yet for all hisselfflagellation JQA learned selfcontrol early It took George W Bush years and many more hangovers before he learned the same Of course JQAspaternally instilled perfectionism sparked a lifelong case of clinicaldepression Ws growingup experiences sparked a bornagain Christianity thathas led him to believe all Jews are bound for hell            JQA benefited as well as suffered from his fathersposition Where George Herbert Walker Bush furnished his son with contacts inpolitics and in the oil business John Adams extended to his son equally rareopportunities As a boy JQA accompanied Adams on a diplomatic mission to Parisand through that experience won the assignment at age  to be secretaryand interpreter on another assignment in St Petersburg These jobs primed JQAfor his later diplomatic career And just as the intellectuallyundistinguished George W doubtless got into Yale as a legacy JQA though hehad mastered Thucydides surely wasnt penalized for his fathers name when hewas admitted to Harvard            For JQAs earliestintellectual triumphs too Adams senior was at least inadvertentlyresponsible At age  JQA wrote his first major work of political philosophyin the manner of many works then under a classical pseudonym Publicola Arejoinder to Tom Paines Rights of Man  Letters From Publicolaemphasized the role of passion not reason in governing mens politicalbehavior Its conservative tone and polished stylecompared admiringly toEdmund Burkeled many to assume that John Adams had authored it The case ofmistaken identity fed its popularity and launched JQAs career as a politicalessayist The episode stands as yet another eerie precursor to George Wslife As a muchoverlooked New York Times story noted last spring Wbecame the GOP frontrunner largely because many people who told pollsters theyfavored Bush were actually thinking of the father the confusion triggered avirtuous cycle of high poll numbers improved fundraising and endorsementsthat has lifted W above the pack            Naturally JQA came both to revere and to recoil from themagnitude of his fathers accomplishments In a  address JQA vowed thatwhile the copious treasures of fame and achievement have already beengathered by the hands of genius he and his generation would still stay trueto the precious memory of the sages Though he was ostensibly paying tributeto the Constitution it was not hard to hear the deep filiopietism beneath thesurface            On the other hand JQAstruggled to stake out his own terrain as a lawyer or his ultimate fantasy apoet Naturally awed by his fathers achievements he swore he didnt want acareer in politics again not unlike the way W pursued business after failingto get elected to Congress at age  Yet no sooner had Adams undertaken hispursuits as an attorney than his father recently elected as the nations firstvice president informed him that George Washington had named the young manminister to the Netherlands The news dashed JQAs hopes for independence fromDad I wish I could have been consulted before it was irrevocably made hesaid of the appointment I rather wish it had not been made at all Thesenior Adams meanwhile took the occasion to chide his son to start payingattention to how he dressed            When John Adams became president in  he appointed hisson to the even more prestigious post of minister to Prussia In bothdiplomatic missions JQA received laudatory reviews and he was marked as animportant leader in his own right It could only have served as a painfulreminder of his fathers stillgreater fame then when after losing theelection of  to Thomas Jefferson Adams recalled his son so as not to givehis rival the satisfaction of deciding whether JQA should continue in hispost            Following his career asa diplomat John Quincy went on to ascend ever higher in politics He served asa Massachusetts state senator and a US senator and then during JamesMonroes presidency as secretary of state where he was largely responsiblefor formulating the principles behind the Monroe Doctrine Ensconced in whatwas then clearly the No  position in government JQA was the presumptivefrontrunner in the  presidential race though it was Andrew Jackson whowon a plurality yet not the necessary majority of electoral votes Adams wonthe presidency only because Henry Clay backed him in the runoff in the Houseof Representatives but Adams never lived down false rumors that he and Clayhad cut a Corrupt Bargain He unwisely fed the rumors and harmed his ownreputation by naming Clay his secretary of state            Despite Adams relatively unremarkable presidency howeverhe rebounded as no other expresident ever has He ran for Congress fromMassachusetts and revitalized served for  yearsnotably helping tooverturn the shameful gag rule that forbade the reading of antislaverypetitions on the floor of the House It takes little imagination to speculatethat JQA felt liberated to enjoy this second career only because on July  midway through JQAs presidency his venerated old man passed away            The tragedy of JQAs life is that for all hisspectacular achievements he was doomed to feel inadequate next to hislargerthanlife father W should only have such problems
