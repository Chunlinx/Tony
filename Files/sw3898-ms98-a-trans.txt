        okay Gene so its nice to talk with you and um food is a very intriguing thing our lives are are built around foods that we like and and nutritionally good for us what kind of dining out do you like     yes sir well there is two kinds one i guess id say is with my wife where we enjoy uh   oh   oh i guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant uh you know something nice   yeah   and the other is with my whole family whom we uh go somewhere that the kids will enjoy uh recently weve been hitting Panchos up its a local Mexican restaurant pretty heavily because theyve got a good rate on the you know good prices and everything   uhhuh Pancho thats a new one umhum   yeah yeah its its a chain down here uh it goes up into Colorado and down here i dont know where else it is what about you   we had one called ChiChis in this in our area   oh yeah   and uh we had a restaurant called La Bamba but its just it closed recently but ChiChis is a national restaurant i think isnt it Mexican do

we enjoy Mexican food im just not impressed with the quality of it its just primarily the price thats uh         satisfying at this point but the kids seem to enjoy it   is that right uhhuh   and uh lets see weve uh just recently discovered a super restaurant down here but its uh not part of a chain its just an individually owned seafood restaurant but the first one weve been to that uh i dont think there was anything on the menu that that any of us had that was uh not just really super its nice to find a place like that   oh boy that is wonderful well i i agree with you on that and i was was really a seafood addict myself i i love crab meat in particular   you know yeah um   i uh i can almost live on on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if  had to   oh boy have you ever been to uh what is it Original Book Binders in Philadelphia   i know the name but i havent been there   uh thats an old established uh restaurant i used to go there when i was in college   uhhuh where did you go to college   i went to the Naval Academy and we used to we used to go up there on uh for football games sometimes   oh  the Naval Academy uhhuh   and have some liberty and yeah wed go over there to uh  pretty sure it was original Original Book Binders i think it was yes   ill be darn   i havent been back there in years   well were were supposed to be talking about dining out but ill just make one comment that uh i just retired from Penn State and uh all my work has been in research for the Navy   okay what area     underwater acoustics   is that right did you have any dealings with the uh underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando Florida   i have dealt with nearly all of the all of the research laboratories that the country has   yes sir my dad worked there for years and years
