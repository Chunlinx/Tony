                do you have a favorite basketball team   Lakers   the Lakers LA     yes im from LA   okay       uh how they doing this year im not i havent even been following them very much   theyre okay theyre not um out of anything yet theyre still hanging in there   i know they lost recently to the Bucks in Milwaukee   yeah   thats thats where im from  so   yeah yeah thats about the i like the Lakers and uh Mavericks are okay but they they got a lot of problems   Mavericks do have problems without Roy Tarpley theyre not going anywhere   and see i dont think they should build up on one person like Chicago with you know with Michael Air Jordan and thats not good Lakers got so many different players   yeah they do they always seem to get the talent there   umhum i guess thats why i like them   well they i think yeah i think Milwaukee got lucky because Magic Johnson sat out that game   yeah yep im not too much of a basketball fan but you know i watch a lot i watch different games like   uhhuh   playoff games and stuff like that   do you think the Lakers can win the championship this year   no       not since theyre coach is gone   you dont like Mike Dunleavy   no   yeah he didnt they didnt let him have quite the the flair that uh Mike Riley had   huhuh Mike Riley was it and thats   well Dunleavys a good coach though he was   hes good its just hes not hes not Riley and i think thats the biggest problem is eventually theyre going to have to figure out what they need to do and catch on to each other   yeah well he doesnt have that Hollywood attitude   huhuh  would uh   no im pretty familiar with with Dunleavy because he was an assistant at Milwaukee   oh was he   uh yeah and he uh when when they had uh injury problems with some of their major players uh he actually put on a uniform and went out and played   oh my goodness   they they signed him to a ten day contract and uh he became a player even though hes assistant coach   huhuh thats all right then   the guy knows basketball i think hell do all right for the Lakers   huh boy you you like basketball though dont you   oh yeah oh yeah its fun im watching the im im busy watching the NC double A tournament uh the past couple weeks     uhhuh   and the NIT semifinals are on tonight   yeah see now i watch the the Final Four   uhhuh   once it gets down to like the Final Four   yeah right so are any of those teams of interest to you   UNLV i like them   oh yeah well  theyre theyre just   i guess because well that guy is from Dallas thats probably about the only thing yeah thats it thats the only reason why i dont know anybody else   Larry Johnson right well theyre just head and shoulders above everybody else this year   are they really   oh yeah theyre theyre so much better than anybody else its uh that theyre prohibitive favorites in winning all their games   but then you know just like that man said in this final in these in the NCAA whatever it is the little playoff games they play so many sometimes i do think its going to be more its luck and ambition you know   right well its its just unbelievable how many games they play in in college now Arkansas played thirty four games this year thats almost half of a pro season   yeah see thats thats too many games   its too many for students   you know and and then they supposed to be studying   right   you know   theyre talking tonight about this NIT game with Stanford and Massachusetts that the Stanford players actually took their final exams while they were on the road playing basketball   uhhuh are you serious   they have an honor system there where they would they had uh three hours to take their exams they sent them in by uh by fax and uh i guess by they used laptop computers to uh to get their exams finished   uhhuh hum   send them out by Federal Express and fax machine   i dont think thats good   yeah its incredible that uh that they have to do that i mean some of the the schools give you a break they give the students a break where they can take their exams when they get back from from a tournament   uhhuh   but uh these guys were actually on the road uh two thousand miles from from home when they had to file their uh their final exams and send them in   yeah i dont think thats i dont think thats good     yeah   that and then you know the laptop thats how i guess they really stuck it on a disk the teacher you know with no answers and they could take it like that and then just print it out in fax and it would be okay because you can put it on a you know on diskette     yeah   and just have them take it but then whos helping them   yep i dont know so do you think uh you think Vegas is going to win the finals then   see now thats yep   i think so too they plaid Duke and uh Duke has a lot to uh to atone for here last year that lost to Vegas in the finals by thirty points   in that the other one that upset that was an upset was Kansas last night   Kansas is a real surprise i didnt expect them to get that far   when they yeah i didnt think they was going to beat that team i dont remember the team but they shouldnt have beat them   uh they beat Arkansas yeah   i didnt uh yeah that that i like i like Arkansas   Arkansas just uh they had a rough second half   yeah   they came out uh real hot in the first half Todd Davis hitting his three pointers   and it was like they just died or something you know   yeah uh somebody took the fire out from under them they they werent getting their shots anymore     huhuh and   and Kansas just crept up on them and uh uh it was unbelievable because they they did that a few years ago too when they were seated a lot lower and they won the the championship   thats it umhum see now thats the thats the thing now   but i dont think they   everybodys waiting for UNLV   yeah well they they are just that much better theyve got so many stars   and see if Kansas if Kansas yeah but then you know it could be what if theyre not hitting that night or theyre low or anything and see i i feel like the college you know its kids its still kids   well sure i think anybody can can win on a given night but they have so much talents and the average age on that team is twenty two years old theyve got a lot of fifth year seniors that are playing   so yeah they just take them out think that thatd be all right   guys that are playing for long time uh theyre playing Duke uh this weekend uh the average age on Dukes team is nineteen years old   umhum umhum   Vegas the average age is over twenty two so theyve got just so much more experience than anybody else in the tournament right now but theyre going to lose all those guys at the end of the season theyre going to all turn pro i think Stacy Augmons a senior and Larry Johnson i dont think i think hes uh is he a senior or junior   yeah who   im not Larry Johnson i think hes coming out this year   hes yeah hes coming out in the pros this year   uhhuh and Anderson Hunt all their uh their best players i think are graduating   umhum   well maybe not graduating but at least theyll be entering the the pro draft   i dont i think i think hes going to move i think hell probably go he now Larry Johnson is definitely going to the pros   oh yeah for sure yeah   and uh theres some more that i dont i cant think of their names God my girlfriend she she gets me because i can describe them go you know that guy you know and shell name them for me     George Akals and Stacy Augmon   yeah now theyll come out in the pros   Anderson Hunt   theyll come out   uhhuh   theyre half theyre team is going to be gone now and see thats another thing for next year with UNLV theyre not going to have no team   uh well i wouldnt say that i i think   well i mean as far as the the top players you know like the ones they have this year you know   yeah their coach may not be there i think Jerry Tarkenyon may be headed for the pros   yeah hes nice   theres some talk that he may be uh coaching for the LA Clippers next year   uh the Clippers  thats another team and i dont think theyve ever done anything   they have a great amount of talent but they just have poor coaching i think   but um no coaching yeah thats all right   theyve got some great players on that team   that be all right between them and   i just think that yeah   then theres that uh lets see i like the Lakers Milwaukee Atlanta Hawks i like them too   uhhuh   i like probably uh the Houston Rockets shocked me the the i think it was last year when they uh last last year they beat LA last year   uhhuh well Houstons playing really well lately   yeah   last couple of weeks anyway since Akeem   because i know my sisters in LA see and she calls me up and tells me well LAs going to come down there and beat up on Texas you know and i said yeah and so when they came down  so what happened it took them a long time they beat them   uhhuh   but it was like four out of the three seven games they had to play the seven games for the for the thing you know just to beat them so it was like one game over   sure i think Houstons playing really good ball lately   uhhuh   ever since Akeem changed his uh first name to Hakeem  he added the H to the front   his attitude  i dont know i dont know them people   well uh i can understand that its uh  i dont know why he dropped it in the first place but uh   i dont either if it was his name he should have just kept it i you know thats your name thats your name   sure       so who do you thinks going to win the NBA this year   hopefully i dont think the Lakers are going to win but i think um oh whats his   Portland Portlands looking awfully good   no not Portland whats that team  with the little guy with uh the no Isiah   Isiah Thomas Detroit   yeah   Detroit Pistons theyre not as good as they were last year   i dont know i think theyll go i think theyll theyre good but theyre not great but i think theyll   theyll have to pick it up in the in the tournament then   but i think thats what usually happens to them   Chicagos playing really good ball with Michael Jordan   umhum   and i think they finally put things together   yeah they did good last night last night they had like a hundred and something to eighty so they they was playing real good last night   yeah well Chicago they theyve been struggling last couple of years and theyve had a good team for the past few years ever since they had Michael Jordan but they never did seem to make an impact on the playoffs   yeah   i think this year theyre going to really uh show some talent   i think also because they done took some of the pressure off of him   oh yeah   you know they because they always think its all him and see theres not you know   its not true they have a good supporting cast   thats not good but i mean everybodys always looking at him thats just like Larry Bird and um uh God Larry Bird what team does he play for Celtics   Boston Celtics right   yeah see because they put a lot on Larry Bird umhum   yeah i dont think the Celtics quite have the overall talent that it takes to win the NBA this year   humum   theyve got good individual players but some are getting old Robert Parish is thirty seven years old   yep   hes still playing center       and uh Larry Birds talking about retirement here i guess in another year   well hes out i mean hes hurt this year   yeah   so you know you never know   but theyre bringing in some good young players too   yeah   which is good   umhum   im ive always favored Milwaukee being from that area and theyve made some good moves in personnel but i dont see them as having the the type of talent that will win the NBA this year   yeah   they have to get by Detroit and Chicago  i think either one of them is a real tough challenge for them   yep if they get by Detroit i think they can get by by uh Atlanta   but yeah i dont think Atlanta would be much as much a problem as Chicago   well thats what i meant yeah they get by Chicago hey can get by Atlanta   uhhuh   it would it if you can beat Chicago Atlanta shouldnt be that much different   right   you just slow down Isiah Thomas and Atlanta is um they got what
