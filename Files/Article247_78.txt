                                 Do You Have Any Interns in That Basket            The press seems to have largely bought the idea that Clintons personalsecretary Betty Currie has strongly denied the New York Times story ofFeb  which suggested that Clinton had called Currie into work on a Sunday tohelp shape her potential testimony about Monica Lewinsky The MinneapolisStar Tribune  for example said that Curries lawyer had issued a stronglyworded statement saying his client was in no way coached by Clinton to providemisleading testimony The Boston Globe repeated the not coachedformula On CNN Jeff Greenfield suggested that the statement of Currieslawyer was the sort of categorical denial that Clinton himself should make            Wait a minute Lets take another look at exactly what Curries lawyersaid            I want to be absolutely clear to the extent there is any implication orthe slightest suggestion that Mrs Currie believes that the President or anyoneelse tried to influence her recollection that is absolutely false and amischaracterization of the facts I am shocked and dismayed by the numerousleaks regarding Mrs Curries grand jury testimony            Can you spot the Clintonistic fudge in that paragraph Thats right the keyword is recollection Currie isnt really denying that Clinton was trying tocoach her She just denies that he was trying to change herrecollection  Of course he wasnt Currie presumably recalls perfectly wellwhere she was when Clinton was with Monica in the Oval Office She was in heroffice next door most likely Clintons not trying to get her to think she wassomewhere else But as has been widely speculated he could have been tryingto get her to testify that Lewinsky wasnt alone with him because Currie waswithin shouting distance In other words he was merely schooling her in thespecial Clintonian definition of alone as in I was never alone in a hotelwith her            Since the statement of Curries lawyer was drafted at the request ofClintons lawyers you can bet each word was carefully weighed and vetted IfCurrie had really been denying Clinton tried to influence her testimony shewould have said Clinton didnt try to influence her testimony  not herrecollection            The Currie statement offers a good example of a major species of Clintonweasel The strong denial of something weak Clintons lawyers hope you will beso snowed by the phrases absolutely and slightest suggestion that you wontnotice that what is being absolutely denied isnt all that much            The only other statement released by Curries lawyer contains a subtlerClintonism Currie is not aware of any legal or ethical impropriety byanyone But of course she might not be aware that a semantic discussion onwhat is meant by alone was improper After Curries lawyer issued thisstatement Clinton himself employed the StrongWeak trick to great effectsaying he was pleased that Ms Curries lawyers stated unambiguously thismorningunambiguouslythat shes not aware of any unethical conduct            Clintons answers in the Flytrap scandal remind Chatterbox of nothing somuch as an old routine by the British comedy group Beyond the Fringe parodyingBertrand Russells televised reminiscences In the sketch Russell confrontshis neighbor the philosopher GE Moore who is sitting by the fire with abasket on his knee

you then have apples in that basket Yes hereplied and from that day forth we remained the very closest of friends                           HYPED STORY OF THE WEEK  That would be Time magazines accountof the testimony of Julie Steele erstwhile friend of Kathleen Willey Nowanother key witness could end up doing Paula Jones more harm than goodreport Jay Branegan and Viveca Novak in Mondays issue They note that Joneshad hoped to use Willeys tale that Clinton had made an unwelcome advance in But sources tell Time that Julie Hiatt Steele once a closefriend of Willeys signed an affidavit last Friday at the request ofClintons lawyers suggesting that the encounter may have been more innocentthan Willey claims and that Willey asked her to lie about it Time thendramatically recounts how Steele says she was called by Willey and asked to lieeven as Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff was on his way to Steeleshouse            Sounds important and Times readers could be forgiven for gettingthe impression that the magazine had discovered something new Trouble isSteeles recantation and the accusation against Willey was not new at all Itwas reported last August in Isikoffs original Newsweek story on WilleyThe whole saga including the dramatic call while Isikoff was in transit wasalso reported in the New York Times two weeks ago on Jan  SeeChatterbox for Feb  The only new element in the Time story was thatSteele has now signed an affidavit saying what everyone thought she would saysince last August Plus Steeles lawyer and Time  fudge on the notinsignificant question of whether Willey has consistently said that Clintonmade a passwanted or unwantedat her Time reports that Steele wasleft with the impression that there was nothing more than mutual affection                           CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE  Chatterbox was blown off recentlywhen it sought employment at Time  The bitter ravings of adisgruntled reject or trenchant media analysis You the reader make thecall  For its part Chatterbox absolutely and unambiguously denies anyimplication or the slightest suggestion that it was aware that any part of thisitem was solely influenced by any lack of mutual affection with Time  Itgoes without saying that Chatterbox is also shocked and dismayed
