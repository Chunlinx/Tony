AUTHORITY TO DEVELOP INTRODUCE AND PROVIDENEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICESA Innovation under the Postal Reorganization ActWhile preexisting law afforded limited opportunities for postalinnovation the Postal Reorganization Act of  gave thenewlycreated United States Postal Service a clear mandate toinnovate by developing effective and efficient services adapted tothe needs of the Nations mail users Section a of Title establishes the Postal Services paramount obligation to providepostal services to bind the Nation together through the personaleducational literary and business correspondence of the peopleThe same section establishes the performance criterion that thePostal Service is expected to achieve as a matter of postal policyIt shall provide prompt reliable and efficient services topatrons in all areas and    all communities Similarly a assigns the Postal Service the duty to plan developpromote and provide adequate and efficient postal services at fairand reasonable rates and fees The Act fosters service innovationby assigning the Postal Service responsibility to provide types ofmail service to meet the needs of different categories of mail andmail users USC  bThe Reorganization Act grants the Postal Service specific powersthat serve as the operational tools of service innovation Section of Title  grants the Postal Service plenary authority overcustody of the mail and its movement  a over thedeployment of post offices other facilities and equipment a and over the means by which stamps and other postageare sold  a and  The same section also authorizesthe Postal Service to provide establish change or abolishspecial nonpostal or similar services  USC aConclusion The Postal Reorganization Act of  clearlymandates that the Postal Service innovate by developing effectiveand efficient postal services adapted to the needs of the Nationsmail users Former  USC  a authorized the Postmaster General tomaintain a research and development program and to conductexperiments to enhance the operational efficiency and economy ofthe postal systemB Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic MailClassificationsPrior to  the array of mail services provided by the PostOffice Department was codified as part of Title  TheReorganization Act replaced this statutory codification of postalservices with an administrative process in which the Governors ofthe Postal Service establish and the Postal Rate Commissionreviews proposed changes in the terms and conditions of postalservices which are compiled as the Domestic Mail ClassificationSchedule or DMCSSection  of Title  provides that the Governors areauthorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail   in accordance with the provisions of this chapter Sectiona directs the Postal Service to file a request with thePostal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing amail classification schedule within two years of the ReorganizationActs effective date The Postal Service complied with thisrequirement early in  and a Domestic Mail ClassificationSchedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July Following establishment of this initial mail classificationschedule  b provides that the Postal Service may from timeto time request that the Commission submit or the Commission maysubmit to the Governors on its own initiative a recommendeddecision on changes in the mail classification scheduleDeliberations on proposed mail classification changes followproceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings isafforded to mail users and an officer of the Commission required torepresent the interests of the general public  USC  aThe Commissions procedural rules governing proposed changes in themail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR   et seq See former Title  Part IVMail Matter The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule ispublished as Appendix A to Subpart C of  CFR Part following  CFR   Docket No MC Phase I Opinion and Recommended DecisionApril   accepted in Decision of the Governors of the UnitedStates Postal Service on Establishing a Mail ClassificationSchedule June  Over the past  years the Postal Service has filed many suchmail classification requests with the Commission seeking either toestablish new postal products or to reconfigure preexistingservices Less frequently the Commission has begun proceedings onits own initiative most commonly in response to a mail usersrequest to do so Both forms of proceeding have proven to offeruseful opportunities to introduce innovations in postalservicesConclusion The joint authority shared by the Postal Service andthe Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adoptnew mail classifications is the mechanism for implementinginnovations in domestic mail serviceC Commission Procedures Adapted to the ExpeditiousConsideration of Proposed Service InnovationsRecognizing that certain types of proposed service innovationsmerit consideration under specialized procedures the Commissionhas adopted several sets of rules that are customized for definedcategories of Postal Service requests The rules depart from thosegenerally applicable to proposed mail classification changes byreducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service isrequired to produce and by expediting the Commissions proceduralschedule for considering the particular form of proposedchangeThe Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there wasa need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mailclassification requests involving proposed new services or changesin existing services that were intended to serve as experimentsThe rules contained in  CFR   through d providea mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trialtype hearingis required allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailabilityof data that would otherwise have to be filed and provide for datacollection for the duration of the experiment The experimentalrules also incorporate a procedural time limit of  days from theCommissions determination that the proposed change is experimentalin natureThese rules were not used extensively A joint PostalServicePostal Rate Commission task force suggested a number ofareas where additional special rules might further encourage PostalService innovation The Postal Service petitioned the Commissionin  to adopt rules to implement some of the task forcesrecommendations The Commission conducted a rulemaking to considerthe rules proposed in the Services petition and after consideringthe comments of interested parties implemented four of theproposed initiatives albeit in revised formThree of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited proceduresfor particular categories of Postal Service requests The fourthset specifies conditions under which the Service may use multiyeartest periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will becomecompensatory over timeThe first set of these new procedural rules incorporated intothe Commissions rules of practice as sections  through establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Serviceproposed market tests of potential new services The rules specifythe limited information the Service is required to file in supportof a proposed market test including a plan for testing theproposed new service and associated data collection and reportingrequirements They also streamline public notice and hearingprocedures and provide for issuance of a yes or no Commissiondecision on the proposed market test within  days consistentwith the procedural due process rights of interested persons ThePostal Services innovative Mailing Online service for which athreeyear experimental trial was requested and approved in DocketNo MC was initially considered and recommended by theCommission under the market test rules See the Appendix to thisreport under the heading for Docket No MCThe second set of rules apply to Postal Service proposals toimplement new services that would supplement but not alterexisting mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis fora limited time As in the market test rules the provisionalservice rules identify the supporting information to be provided bythe Postal Service in addition they allow the Service to explainwhy it should not be required to provide See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change A Report by theJoint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking June    CFR    CFR  information called for in the Commissions general rules formail classification proposals The rules likewise expedite publicnotice and procedural scheduling providing for a yes or noCommission decision within  days consistent with the due processrights of other partiesA third set of rules adopted as sections  through c of therules of practice applies to Postal Service requests forpermanent mail classification changes that are minor in characterMinor classification changes are defined as those that would notchange any existing rate or fee would not impose any newrestriction on eligibility for mailing and would not significantlyincrease or decrease the estimated contribution of the affectedmail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of thePostal Service The rules specify limited required supportinginformation allow the Service to explain the unavailability ofotherwise required data and also streamline procedural schedulingUnder these rules for minor classification proposals theprocedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is  daysfrom the filing of the Postal Service request if no hearings areheld and  days if hearings are scheduled in the caseFinally the fourth set of rules contained in sections  and of the rules of practice  applies to Postal Service requestsfor new services that it believes cannot recover all theirassociated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operationIn such instances the Services request must be supported bytestimony of a Postal Service witness that explains the rationalefor the proposed multiyear test period The request should alsoprovide Return on Investment projections other available financialanalyses and cost revenue and volume estimates for the newservice for the entire proposed test period The rules establish apolicy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal yearsfor the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introducedpostal servicesThe Commission adopted these four sets of rules in  to beeffective for a period of five years In light of their apparentworkability in several Commission proceedings and their continuingusefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the  CFR  c   CFR  Postal Service the Commission extended their application for anadditional fiveyear period in a recent rulemakingConclusion Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules ofprocedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service toprovide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovationsin a manner consistent with the due process rights of allinterested persons Docket No RM Order No   Fed Reg IV POSTAL SERVICE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATED RATE ANDSERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR GROUPS OF CUSTOMERSTO PROVIDE SERVICESFor a number of years some mailers have pursued the idea ofestablishing customized postal rates andor terms of servicethrough negotiation with the Postal Service Depending on theirrespective objectives and features contractual arrangements ofthis kind have been labeled contract rates negotiated serviceagreements or more recently niche classifications Inaddressing the consistency of these various approaches with currentlaw it is important to identify and consider all of theircharacteristics For example the legality of an agreement may bedependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performedwithout any regulatory scrutiny or instead submitted for some formof review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to itseffectivenessA Statutory Bases of Potential AuthorityNo provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibitsthe Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreementswith mail users Section  of Title  generally empowers theService to enter into and perform contracts and there is noprohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service and mail usersnegotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions ofservice should be changed However other provisions in Title cast into doubt the conclusion that the Services authority under  is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mailclassifications by agreement aloneThe obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural andsubstantive From a procedural perspective the legal soundness ofrate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtfulbecause the only means of making such changes recognized in theReorganization Act are the procedures prescribed in Chapter  ofTitle  These provisions require that rate or mail classificationchanges desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a requestwith the Postal Rate Commission allowing for public scrutiny anddeliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the PostalServiceFailure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding theintended changeNegotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of thesubstantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classificationsin the Reorganization Act Section c of Title  directsthatIn providing services and in establishing classificationsrates and fees under this title the Postal Service shall notexcept as specifically authorized in this title make any undue orunreasonable discrimination among users of the mails nor shall itgrant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such userSections  and  similarly specify fairness and equitytogether with other criteria as considerations to be observed inmaking rate and mail classification changes Without publicscrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or serviceagreement between the Postal Service and a customer there could beno assurance that these substantive criteria would besatisfiedHowever assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter  aremet changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user fortheir mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicablestatutory standards Section c directs the Commission toconsider the desirability and justification for specialclassifications and services of mail  c and thedesirability of special classifications from the point of view ofboth the user and of the Postal Service  c Regardingrates  b establishes the degree of preparation of mailfor delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and itseffect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service as a factor to beconsidered in connection with a proposed change In combinationwith other factors and the policies of the Reorganization Actthese United Parcel Service v U S Postal Service  FSupp ED Pa  affirmed  Fd  d Cir  certdenied  US  considerations could support recommendation of rate andclassification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs ofparticular mailersConclusion Rate and service agreements negotiated by the PostalService and mail users are permissible under current law if theprocedural and substantive requirements of the PostalReorganization Act are satisfiedB Problematical Contract RatesIn a rulemaking proceeding conducted in the late s at therequest of a mailer the Commission addressed the question of thePostal Services authority to negotiate rate changes in the form ofa proposal to recognize contract rates After consideringcomments of the Postal Service and other participants theCommission found the proposal problematical and declined to pursueitThe initial proposal considered in Docket No RM includedtwo variantsThe Commission might after considering cost and otherrelevant evidence establish a range of permissible rates forparticular subclasses with the Postal Service and individualmailers free thereafter to negotiate rates within this rangeorThe Postal Service and one or more mailers wouldnegotiate a rate and service package which would then i besubmitted to the Commission for a review and ii thereafter beavailable on the same terms to all potential usersThe Commission solicited two rounds of comments on the proposalfrom interested parties The proponent and one other mailer tookthe position that the Postal Service is authorized to enter intosuch contracts provided the procedural requirement of review underChapter  is observed Other commentersincluding the CommissionsOffice of Consumer Advocateexpressed doubts regarding the legalsoundness of one or both of the proposed variants of suchagreements The Postal Service commented that in its view legalconstraints would not preclude a contract mechanism in principlebut that no such arrangement would be permissible without theCommissions participation in accordance with  USC  through Upon consideration of the initial comments it received theCommission declined to pursue the contract rate proposal butsolicited further comments on several broad issues concerningpossible changes in the mail classification system The Commissionexplained that its reluctance to pursue the concept of contractrates was based on substantial uncertainty regarding the legalsufficiency of examining agreedupon rates after the fact ratherthan in a prior review It also raised the potential problems ofunreasonable discrimination that such contracts might cause incontravention of USC  c and the preservation of fair contributions tothe Postal Services institutional costs by mail volumes Suchproblems might well arise if the Service were to negotiatediscounted ratesunaccompanied by a change in service conditionsthat provided cost or revenue justificationConclusion Negotiated ratesunaccompanied by a change inservice conditions that provides cost justificationare aproblematical approach to introducing additional flexibility intoPostal Service business practicesC Negotiated Service Agreements and Specialized NicheClassificationsFollowing publication of the report of the joint PostalServicePostal Rate Commission task force on ratemaking the PostalService petitioned the Commission to adopt rules to implement someof the reports recommendations One recommendation included in theServices petition was adoption of Commission rules for reviewingon an expedited basis service agreements with postal customersvarying from the general rate and classifications schedules in wayswhich add value both for the customer and for the postal system asa wholeThe proposal in the Postal Services petition would haveestablished Negotiated Service Agreements as a new form of mailclassification with individual agreements to be reviewed by theCommission within  days In the Commissions Notice of ProposedRulemaking it deferred consideration of the NSA proposal citinglegal uncertainty regarding the consistency of negotiated rateswith the Reorganization Acts Docket No RM Further Invitation for Comments  FedReg    Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change supraat ratemaking provisions However the Commission also expressed ageneral willingness to address the concept in a subsequentrulemakingSince then the Commission has conducted several mailclassification proceedings under the other expedited proceduresadopted in that rulemaking These procedures have been shown to bewell suited to the consideration of niche classificationproposals Niche classifications are specialized mailclassifications including reduced but costjustified rates orfeesthat have been developed by the Postal Service in directconsultation with its customers to meet the needs and capabilitiesof a mailer or group of mailers For example the Commissionapproved a twoyear experiment of a program that enabled users ofbulk nonlettersize Business Reply Mail such as photofinishersthat could reliably determine postage and fees due to obtainearlier access to their mail at revised fees The Commissionsubsequently granted a requested extension of the experiment andultimately approved a request to make the experimental program apermanent mail classification More recently in Docket NoMC the Commission recommended three new worksharingbaseddiscounted Priority Mail categories after negotiating with mailerswho were willing to presort their mail in new ways that couldreduce the Postal Services costs Such niche classificationproposals are essentially Negotiated Service Agreements withoutany associated legal uncertainties or additional administrativebarriersConclusion Rate and service adjustments agreed upon by thePostal Service and mailers are legally authorized if threeconditions are satisfied The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding as theReorganization Act requires The agreedupon rate and service changes will work to themutual benefit of mail users and
