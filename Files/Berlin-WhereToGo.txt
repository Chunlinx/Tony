WHERE TO GOYoull need to plan carefully for a thorough exploration of Berlinwith a total area of  sq km  sq miles it is more than eight times the size of Paris Since the reorganization of the municipal transport system virtually the whole of the city is accessible via underground UBahn overhead SBahn railways bus or tram You should have no difficulty in reaching the outlying areas including Spandau the museums in Dahlem the parks and lakes in the Grunewald and the summer palaces in Potsdam by public transport Busy traffic and the inevitable parking problems make car rental a less attractive and quite unnecessary optionA good orientation exercise is to start with an organized sightseeing tourby bus for instance departing from the eastern end of the Kurfrstendamm Cruises on the Landwehrkanal or Spree and Havel rivers offer a more leisurely way of taking in areas of eastern and western Berlin that are not normally covered by the tour busesThe area on and around the Kurfrstendamm is probably the best place to begin as its very well served by information centers and other tourist facilities Your first port of call should be the Berlin Tourist Office which can be found at the Budapester Strae side of the EuropaCenter and is open every day the helpful multilingual staff will assist you with maps leaflets and other useful informationAround KurfrstendammBerlins main thoroughfare literally Prince Electors Embankment is known to Berliners as the Kudamm It extends for   km about  miles through the center of the city forming a triangular area enclosed by Lietzenburger Strae Hardenbergstrae Leibnizstrae and Tauentzienstrae Here youll find a vast array of shops cafs restaurants theaters cinemas and art galleries as well as nofrills fastfood stands and the inevitable souvenirsellersImpressed by the prolongation of the ChampsElyses in Paris to the Bois de Boulogne Bismarck wanted to extend the Kudamm out as far as the Grunewald forest However such pretentions were never realized and finally the avenue linked Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church to nothing grander than the Halensee railway stationWhen you are in the center of Tauentzienstrae notice the intertwined steel tubes of the Berlin sculpture which were designed for the citys th anniversary in  The two halves are tantalizingly close to each other yet fail to touch poignantly symbolizing the once divided cityAt the far end of Tauentzienstrae Wittenbergplatz is a large populous square and contains one of Berlins many memorials a stark sign outside the UBahn station which reminds passersby of the Nazi concentration camps The station itself is a beautifully restored Art Deco delight with lovely wooden ticket booths period posters and a central standing clockMore than just a department store KaDeWe Kaufhaus des Westens located on the edge of Wittenbergplatz has achieved the status of a monument since its foundation in  The food emporium on the sixth floor is extraordinary

food court in the glassroofed atrium where shoppers can help themselves to less exotic but equally tasty fare Its an ideal spot for a hearty breakfast before a days shopping The toy department is also well worth a visitBreitscheidplatz is the big pedestrianized area at the base of the EuropaCenter and a busy gathering place for shoppers and sightseers during the day In the center of the square is Joachim Schmettaus granite Weltkugelbrunnen or Fountain of the World which locals have gaily christened the aquatic dumplingSoaring above it is another very powerful symbol of the city the
