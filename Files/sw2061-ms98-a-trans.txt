                hello hey how you doing   hello not bad not bad Whats your name   Fernando   Fernando my name is Nick   wait let me turn off my stereo here   sure   because ive been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody yeah   really man am i   right what time is it over there are you are you in Dallas   no no im in Detroit or not Detroit im in uh California   are you   yeah i   because every time i got through i went to Dallas Texas   really   yeah im in North Carolina   oh well youre on the uh lets see   on the other coast   yeah twenty one yeah shoot man its what midnight almost   what yeah yeah its uh im watching Saturday Night Live here   yeah okay all right well i guess were supposed to talk what about credit card   what wait what what did how how did you get to know about the TI thing   oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this and   what what are you working on   a a Masters in uh information systems   really im doing my Masters in in Computer Science and Computer Engineering   yeah where at   at North Carolina State University   hey how do you like it out there   uh i dont because uh i come from a lot a bigger city than this one and i im in Raleigh and   yeah Raleigh Durham yeah   yeah that area and its really small all all you have is like towns built around universities like Chapel Hill   uhhuh yeah so it its basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they dont have a whole lot there   yeah where are you at   uh well im in Monterey California right now   oh okay so so i mean its like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people and thats about it   yeah two hundred fifty   yeah   okay it its its a lot bigger than Monterey is but were just uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco   oh okay   and its only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city   so so where do you go do you go to Berkeley   no no i go to the its the Naval Postgraduate school out here   oh okay because um i was looking at at the doctorate degree in Computer Science center at Berkeley   umhum   and theyre asking like for a um GPA of like three point seven or something like that and like theyre looking like for uh GRE like ninety nine percentile and this and that and its like   uhhuh yeah well thats what they look for whether or not they get it its hard to say   yeah i know thats why thats why i didnt apply i mean it was like   yeah   for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety nine percentile on the on the verbal part   yeah its pretty tough its pretty tough i mean uh lets face it you know and you know are you  did the you know as far as i found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know its what you do   yeah   you know so uh i dont lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that   so are are you going to go for your doctorate   probably not see im in the Navy   yeah   and uh you know unless the Navy funds it i probably wont do it until i if i do do it it will be after i get out of the Navy   when do you get out   oh probably be another twelve years   oh okay   oh you know i like what im doing right now   but uh but what if they pay for it what if they pay for   excuse me if they pay for a PhD   yeah   nah they wont pay for it theyve i think they have maybe two people a year go get get their PhD   because i know i know a couple of people here that work for um the Army um   yeah they civilians or uh military   i think i think theyre military but i mean the guy is still in   uhhuh   and um he uh he works over in Maryland   uhhuh umhum   and so hes doing his Masters here they gave him like a scholarship like for a year and hes doing it in like in a year and a summer   yeah umhum   and so hes getting that and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that thats why you want to join   yeah umhum   but uh this guy i mean you can earn a lot more money so you say i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once youve get your your you know Masters   umhum   they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so     well a lot of times its you know a lot of times its not the money that keeps people that keeps people   yeah   you know they they like what theyre doing they you know they feel good about what theyre doing that type of thing its more   but i mean i mean you the once you get your Masters you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty seven forty five thousand a year   umhum   and   oh easily im sure   and thats not what theyre paying   no well it depends on what rank you are of course   yeah yeah i know   well i mean like i say if youre if youre you know if youre at an upper level in the rank category you know youre probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year   yeah but thats uh   yeah those are few and far between though   yeah its like uh in IBM in IBM you can get certain points     umhum   and uh everyones a manager but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money   ye ah i imagine its really competitive   you know its like no i i mean IBM is like theres a joke about IBM which says you know its like uh all all the major companies get into a a boating race right   umhum   and so IBM says well we have to we have to have a team right and then they come in last and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it   uhhuh yeah   saying he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right       so he goes have you come up with a solution uh have you come up with a solution they go yeah change the rower  you know its like everyones a manager but you know its like only use like one person does the work so     yeah too many chiefs and not enough Indians   yeah so   yeah oh that can be that that can really slow you down   yeah that well thats the way it works i mean thats thats why theyre having problems i mean everyones a manager and   yeah i didnt realize that   yeah i mean its like its like the people that actually do the work there   umhum   are uh very few and then the other people just plan it you know its like its like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank   yeah push paper around uhhuh   you know like all these people are just standing sitting sitting sitting around just going you know like what shall we do has anybody thought of anything no And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along they go whats that this track which its going around the world and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time   umhum   and so its like the same thing with IBM you know so they have this think tank and they got to come up with ideas but see uh the the thing is that IBM is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff   yeah oh yeah theyve got a theyve got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market   yeah   and a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know people generally go with that because they figure that the you you you probably wont get fired for getting IBM material wheres if you try something different   and it fails and youre dead   theyll theyll say yeah why didnt you buy why didnt you try something more mainline   yeah well IBM doesnt fire anybody because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job   no umhum   which you you actually are like sitting around not doing anything so you quit   uh   i mean thats their policy they never fire anybody unless youre caught doing something illegally   illegal illegal or something like that yeah   yeah like if youre stealing something or doing anything like that but they wont let you off what theyll do is like   uhhuh   suppose you know like youre a manager so theyll put you into   uhhuh   keeping up the paper you know its like how much paper is going in   umhum   and then you say thats not my job so you quit   so in other words thats the way they force people out   right   thats why they can say you know theres no layoff policy   right   but it doesnt they dont really say that you know youre youre always going to have great career conditions   right   yeah hey thats kind of sad   no but i mean its like its like they they have like this different policy i dont know my dad works for them but its like IBM like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know its like   no   they wont say   well theyre the standard right now or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of IBM a lot of times and the main   yeah because see what happens is they have a good backup policy and anybody can fix it and so thats what youre gonna go for   umhum yeah well you know thats thats a thats a big thing   and and you know its like for example like Leading Edge have you ever heard of Leading Edge   yeah they are out of Korea right   what   leading edge dont they   they they made like uh small personal computers   yeah small PCs arent theyre out of Korea right   i dont know i i dont know but what they do is what they did i dont know is buy all the parts that IBM would throw away and build an IBM PC with all the parts that IBM would throw away yeah   uhhuh oh yeah   yeah because so is it like for example you test a chip       it cant last seven years but it can last five IBM says lets throw it away Leading Edge will say well buy it from you   okay   and so thats i mean theyre still around i think   yeah ive seen well ive seen them around anyway you know   so thats what thats what they do they buy all all the things that IBM throws away and they  thats why theyre so compatible   umhum   because i mean and by the time you have computer for five years youre going to throw it away anyway   most people do or they have to anyway   you know well i mean theres like when when you realize  teachers one of my teachers got this computer and it was like voice synthesis and stuff   umhum   and he got that he said you know its like um i was testing it and it was wonderful and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory and i want more you know and its like   wow   Jesus Christ you know its like why do you want more because its like one second of recording i mean you put into a Wave and you want to correct the errors into Wave   umhum   it takes so much i mean its like of course it does i mean by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model and you put it in there and you want to correct those and then you know youre trying to make the the Wave smooth so you can approximately of course its going to take a lot   umhum   imagine imagine what it is for us to make mark off models you know its like  Jesus Christ   thats amazing yeah well when you get yeah when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory theyre gonna require   yeah yeah   yeah both both in terms in RAM as well as uh you know standard memory or disk memory disk base   yeah well like they say like nobody can get enough you know its like   so   once you have something and its like i was watching this program on TV yesterday in nineteen seventy six NASA came up with Three D graphics right   well yeah you find out more yeah uhhuh   and they were showing this like Three D graphics Three D graphics view of like   like those hologram deals   what no no no no this is like this is like video game stuff okay but the only thing was that it was just lines okay like if you   like a hologram with just graphics on a on a okay
