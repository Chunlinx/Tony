               hi   okay do you work with a company that uh gives drug testing   sort of im a im a student but uh im in the National Guard and they do a little bit of drug testing     oh they do uhhuh what uh did they do that before you went in or what   yeah uh they they do it before you go in and occasionally theyll have a a random urinalysis   oh they will huh   yeah so you cant be smoking marijuana in in the military anymore   oh okay well ive i worked i dont work right now because my company i worked for PIE went bankrupt   oh   but um they was getting a program set up that for all new hires they was gonna drug uh give them drug tests   oh   but um they didnt hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there you know just stayed there because it was they had been there for a long long time   uhhuh   but um actually i think they should do it   yeah i i believe they should too   you know um i dont think anybody needs anybody thats to be working for them thats on drugs of any kind you know   uhhuh yeah definitely   but uh i dont know whether i believe that they should just randomly do it i think they should kind of warn them like you know well were going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired you know that this is whats gonna happen   oh you   and then if you dont like it why then you know youll have to go look for a job someplace else   uh but actually yeah you have to do it randomly otherwise people will cheat     well i suppose youre right there too you know um   yeah   personally i   they i know when i was doing my uh basic training in AIT theres guys who would fool around and then when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared so it does work it is effective   uhhuh umhum umhum hum   the only problem is you know if you have done drugs but youve stopped and uh you do get caught it is kind of kind of harsh   umhum  well i suppose they fire you and everything right then huh or what do they do with you guys if that you guys get   yeah uh we get counseling and uh i think part of our pay is docked if were first time offenders   oh i oh i see   i really dont i i havent been i dont do any drugs so i dont know   yeah well i dont either i wouldnt even think about it  i think anybody that does them are dumb dumb you know yeah really its so stupid God they you can you just watch it on TV and see how it just     crazy yeah yeah   burns your brain completely up you know you dont know   yeah wastes your future   yeah really really dumb huh  but um   yeah   uh see what else was i gonna say here   uh what do you think about our uh like uh other government agencies testing do you think our government agencies should test   yeah i think so i think they all should test really you know uh it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore   yeah yeah   that i dont know whats wrong with the people um but i think that the the government should do something about stopping it completely about it coming into our country   uh   you know they just slap somebodys little hand and you know well dont do that again and   oh i know yeah they arent   and then they you you know theyll get out and theyre right back at it again   yeah right now it is its too lucrative for the drug dealers so the the risks are worth it for them   yeah umhum umhum but uh other than that why i dont know   yeah   like i say maybe one of these days ill get a job because i am looking still for a parttime job you know since my company went bankrupt and ill see what they do you know but like i say i i wouldnt care because i   oh   i dont smoke i dont even smoke so  they can test me all i want i wonder what theyll do if you take medicine if that would affect it   yeah oh see thats  that is a problem sometimes some medicines will give off a a false positive   yeah see now that   ive heard of ive heard of that yeah   that would be really unfair then huh you know   yeah i i believe we should have the testing but they should be like if you get if you get a positive they should double check you and still give you the benefit of the doubt   yeah find out what you know if you have been taking some kind of medication and you know if that would effect it and everything   uhhuh yeah   but um well i guess thats about all we can talk about i think our five minutes is about up anyhow   well it was nice talking to you Rose   okay Lewis maybe ill talk to you again alrighty byebye bye   okay byebye
