                    Introduction        The association of inhaled particulate pollution and        cigarette smoking with pulmonary disease such as chronic        obstructive pulmonary disease is well documented            but the specific early responses of lung epithelial cells        to toxic substances in particulates  that predispose the        cells to disease  have not been elucidated Cigarette        smoke has also been considered a major player in the        pathogenesis of asthma and as a trigger for acute symptoms            Exposure to cigarette smoke activates an        inflammatory cascade in the airway epithelium resulting in        the production of a number of potent cytokines and        chemokines with accompanying damage to the lung        epithelium increased permeability and recruitment of        macrophages and neutrophils to the airway     Even        brief exposure to cigarette smoke has been shown to        increase expression of IL in primary cultures of human        bronchial epithelial cells HBEs in the presence of dust        mite allergen     Increased release of the chemokine        IL has also been shown for cultured HBEs exposed to        cigarette smoke extract CSE     and diesel exhaust        particles     However the precise molecular events        that bring about these intracellular changes and acute        inflammation in lung epithelial cells are not well        understood        Upregulation of cytokine gene expression in epithelial        cells has been linked to activation of specific signaling        pathways Involvement of the mitogenactivated protein        kinase MAPK pathway extracellular signalregulated        protein kinase ERK pp in cytokine regulation        has been demonstrated in HBEs exposed to diesel exhaust        particles    but not to cigarette smoke NFB is a        ubiquitous transcription factor involved in regulating        inflammatory responses and its targets include several of        the genes encoding cytokines and chemokines The activation        of NFB by oxidative stress inflammatory cytokines such as        IL and by TNF has been studied in depth     but        much less is known about the effects of cigarette smoke on        NFB activation        The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the        mechanism of inflammation induced by cigarette smoke        specifically the acute response to smoke The human        alveolar epithelial cell line A and normal human        bronchial epithelial cells NHBEs were exposed to the        particulate fraction of cigarette smoke cigarette smoke        condensate CSC and examined for the production of        proinflammatory cytokines and activation of MAPK and NFB        The results demonstrate that the acute phase response of        pulmonary epithelial cells to cigarette smoke involves        activation of ERK and NFB                    Materials and methods                  Reagents          RPMI

      viability and apoptosis          To determine the effects of CSC on cell viability          A cells and NHBEs were exposed to increasing          concentrations of CSC for  min then examined using the          trypan blue dyeexclusion test Fig A Maximum          toxicity for A at the highest concentration of CSC           gml was  At lower CSC concentrations           gml survival was greater than  for both A cells          and NHBEs Induction of apoptosis by CSC was determined          in A cells and NHBEs by using the TUNEL assay and          confirmed by DNA fragmentation analysis data not shown          NHBEs showed  to  apoptosis at moderate doses of CSC          A cells showed less than  apoptosis Fig B          However with increasing concentration of CSC NHBEs          showed as high as  apoptosis while A cells          remained unchanged                          Changes in expression of specific cytokines and          chemokines after exposure to cigarette smoke          condensate          To characterize the response of epithelial cells to          CSC we determined the changes in message levels for a          group of cytokines chemokines and celladhesion          molecules Total RNA isolated from NHBEs following          exposure to CSC was subjected to RTPCR and the results          are shown in Fig  IL was induced to a level           times that of untreated controls while the expression of          IL and GMCSF was increased fold and fold          respectively Expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM          was found to be approximately  times the level of          control IL and the chemokine RANTES were elevated          slightly Fig  This pattern of enhancement of          proinflammatory mediator expression implies that specific          effector compounds are present in CSC                          Involvement of the MAPK pathway in response to          cigarette smoke condensate          To examine if CSCupregulation of cytokine production          involves activation of MAPKs we examined CSCtreated          NHBEs for specific phosphorylated species Fig Ashows          the results of a western blot of wholecell extracts from          NHBEs exposed to increasing concentrations of CSC and          probed for phosphorylated ERK the activated form of          ERK Band densities on the film were measured and the          protein loading variations were adjusted by normalizing          to the levels of nonphosphorylated ERK The level of          ERK phosphorylation increased rapidly with increasing          exposure to CSC to a maximum of nearly twice the          control To confirm the results of immunoblot detection          of phosphorylated ERK NHBEs were exposed to  gml          CSC for  min then fixed and stained for phosphorylated          ERK Exposure to CSC caused a marked increase in          nuclear staining of cells with phosphorylated ERK          antibodies Fig B This nuclear localization and          phosphorylated ERK staining was largely blocked by          pretreating with the MEK inhibitor PD The          CSCinduced increase in IL expression was also reduced          by treatment of the cells with PD or the NFB          inhibitor PDTC Fig C These results suggest that CSC          activates ERK in these cells within  min                          Cigarette smoke condensate treatment induces rapid          activation of the NFB pathway          To determine whether upregulation of cytokine          production by CSC involved activation of NFB we          examined CSCtreated epithelial cells for phosphorylation          of the inhibitor of NFB IB NHBEs were treated with          increasing concentrations of CSC and wholecell extracts          were immunoblotted for phosphorylated IB Activation of          NFB involves the increased phosphorylation and          proteolytic degradation of IB Treatment of cells with          increasing concentrations of CSC resulted in an initial          rise in phosphorylated IB levels followed by a decrease          Fig A Protein bands were quantitated by densitometry          on the film and the phosphorylated IB densities were          normalized to the levels of IB NHBEs exposed to CSC          also showed an increase in nuclear staining of          phosphorylated IB as detected by immunocytochemical          staining using an antibody to phosphorylated IB Fig          B                          Effect of cigarette smoke condensate on          transcriptional activation of luciferase reporter          construct          CSC appears to activate NFB which should result in          transcriptional activation of NFBinducible genes          Therefore A cells were transfected with a luciferase          reporter plasmid containing a promoter sequence that          bound NFB and luciferase activity was measured after          challenge with CSC Treatment with  gml CSC for           min resulted in significant enhancement of luciferase          reporter expression compared to control Fig C          indicating activation of NFB TNF used as a positive          control also activated luciferase gene expression with          the same plasmid system Exposure of cells transfected          with the reporter plasmid to increasing doses of CSC          showed NFB expression peaking at a CSC concentration          between  and  gml Fig D                            Discussion        The complex changes in lung function morphology and        gene expression caused by compounds in cigarette smoke        involve a combination of direct and indirect effects on        cells but principally center around an increase in airway        inflammation as a result of cigarette smoking The results        of our studies demonstrate that the mechanism underlying        these acute inflammatory events involves activation of        specific signaling pathways such as MAPK ERK and NFB        leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines        One of the important observations of this study is the        effect of CSC on NHBEs Even at a concentration of         gml which does not induce significant changes in the        viability of these cells CSC induced increases in        expression of several cytokines at the mRNA level IL        which was significantly upregulated in NHBEs following CSC        exposure has been shown to be important for activation of        IL    and ICAM     This is also consistent with        the report that epithelial cells regulate inflammatory        events by secreting cytokines and chemokines such as IL        IL GMCSF TNF and sICAM     These paracrine        effectors can then produce further primary local        inflammation or amplify the effects of previously activated        macrophages eosinophils mast cells or lymphocytes A        notable finding from our study is that exposure of NHBEs to        CSC elicits the synthesis and release of a pattern of        mediators similar to that seen in A cells in response to        CSC These results imply that neoplastic cells and normal        cells respond to CSC in a similar manner        Cigarette smoke has been shown by others to induce a        synthesis of glutathione and gammaglutamylcysteine that        was associated with transcription factor AP or an        APlike response element     Although MAPKs and NFB        have been implicated in the upregulation of proinflammatory        cytokines the role of these pathways in normal human        pulmonary epithelial cells in response to CSC has not been        investigated The results of our study implicate the ERK        p MAPK pathway as a key element in this inflammatory        response an association that has not heretofore been        reported in normal human pulmonary epithelial cells A        significant finding of this study is that MAPKs such as        ERK pp are consistently activated in NHBEs        However upon exposure to CSC the magnitude of        phosphorylation increases The finding that IL        expression and MAPK activation are concomitantly increased        by CSC exposure and inhibited by PD is consistent with        the report that MAPKs activate expression of IL genes            Although the control of cytok confluence

min at           g Aliquots of  l of each lysate        were transferred to flatbottomed white microtiter plates        Dynex Chantilly VA USA and read on a Dynex MLX plate        reader in flash mode The transfection efficiency was        normalized by determining galactosidase activity in the        lysates from the cotransfected pLacZ plasmid                    Conclusion        In essence these results demonstrate that NHBEs respond        to moderate doses of CSC by activating both the ERK and        the NFB pathways and by upregulating the expression of        several genes encoding
