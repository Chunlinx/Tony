                                 The Arizona Debate Bush Brought to Book            Tonights Republican debate in Phoenix Ariz was much much better thanthe one that took place last week in New Hampshire That debate sponsored byFox News and WMUR television in Manchester was all inside baseball Thequestioners Brit Hume and Karen Brown asked McCain about his temper Bushabout whether he knew how to read and Keyes about his eccentric view that heis the victim of media racism This one sponsored by CNN featured far moreuseful questions about actual issues in the campaign Correspondents JudyWoodruff John King and Candy Crowley asked intelligently about educationeconomics and foreign policy The more varied format which also allowed thecandidates to question each other was a marked improvement as well            Once again all eyes were on the frontrunner George W Bushs secondperformance was consistent with his first He came across as jaunty likableand brimming with selfconfidence He did not blunder by confusing the Balkanswith the Baltics referring to the ruler of Korea as Kim somebody oridentifying the EITC as a baseball statistic But if Bush didnt blow it healso failed to reveal any hidden depths In the round of questions on foreignpolicy Judy Woodruff asked him my dream question which was what he learnedfrom that book about Dean Acheson he mentioned he was reading To be preciseWoodruff asked what lessons Bush took from the successes and failures ofAcheson and George Marshall            Still failing to identify the book which must be the recent Achesonbiography by James Chace Bush saidand this is a verbatim transcriptionchecked against my tapeThe lessons learned are is that the United Statesmust not retreat within our borders That we must promote the peace In orderpromote the peace weve got to have strong alliancesalliances in Europealliances in the Far East In order promote the peace I believe we ought to bea freetrading nation  The lessons of Acheson and Marshall are is that ournations greatest export to the world has been is and always will be theincredible freedoms we understand in the great land called America            One lesson Bush obviously did not learn from Dean Acheson is how to form agrammatical sentence Maybe he does better in Spanish but the man can barelyspeak English Ws most common difficultly as in the above passage is withnounverb agreement When he gets even slightly worked up he cant arbitratebetween his seeming need for a plural verb and his seeming need for a singularone So he uses both as in his favored expression are is Bush also commonlyremoves the to from infinitives as with in order promote the peace Syntaxis not his friend            The way he speaks reminds me of something I once read about the linguistMyrna Gopnik and her work on what I believe she calls Family K Althoughotherwise normally intelligent members of Family K stumble over basic grammarcoming up with sentences like The boys eat four cookie They have troublecreating the plurals of words and forming verbs in the past tensethings mostyearolds can easily manage I cant remember what Gopnik calls this rare andpeculiar form of aphasia but W and his father both seem to suffer from aversion of it Another possibility The Bushes actually are FamilyK            The second and probably more significant criticism of Bushs answer is thathis comments on whatever Acheson book he is reading couldnt have been moretrite and banal They are in fact simply Bushs own platitudes about thepresent attached to a book he claims to be reading Marshall and Acheson didntbelieve that communism could be contained or the peace kept by a policy offreetrading They argued for linedrawing and military confrontationapoint John McCain made it clear he understood in a glancing reference toAcheson and Korea in his own answer to a foreign policy quesiton Bushdisplayed this same callowness throughout the evening In other instances suchas in his closing remarks he simply recited familiar arias from his stumpspeech            The other candidate whose performance deserves comment is Steve Forbes WhatI noticed about Forbes performance tonight was that it was exactly the same asevery other Forbes performancethoroughly dishonest numbingly repetitive andincreasingly obnoxious in its gratuitous and ineffectual antiWashingtondemagoguery In only his second campaign Forbes has turned into a fullfledgedHarold Stassen figurea candidate for whom unpopularity serves as some kind ofweird inspiration The more you wish that Forbes would go away the more itprovokes him to stay and waste more of your time And with his money he canwaste a lot of your time             Some assume that because Forbes looks like a dork he must have somesubstance buried somewhere Though he sounds even more canned than Bush manypeople think of him as intellectually if not morally superior for canning theanswers himself instead of being sleeptaught by a team of former deputyundersecretaries In fact I think Forbes is far less of his own man than Bushand too much of a weathervane to qualify even as a genuine ideologue Bushfairly new to politics is still discovering his principles Forbes is alreadyabandoning his second set Where Bush has an idea of where he wants to lead theRepublican Party to the center Forbes thinks that if he figures out wherethe party is going he can simply hop aboard and ride it             Its this futile whoring after primary votes that has made Forbes such apathetic figure After his  debacle Forbes swapped his libertariantingedpurely economic conservatism for its oppositea preachy selfrighteous socialconservatism He pandered to what he took to be the ascendant religious rightby saying that abortion was the most important issue to him Amazingly enoughmany moral conservatives accepted his conversion But their support hasnthelped Forbesin fact it has made him more unelectable than ever So withoutso much as a blink of the eye Forbes has reversed course once again In therecent debates he has left abortion and school prayer to the true believersKeyes and Bauer and focused exclusively on the flat tax repeating the phraseas a kind of meditational om Only this time his fanaticism doesnt evensound sincere
