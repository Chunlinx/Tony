                                 Buckley and Quotas at Yale            Nicholas Lemanns absorbing new history of American meritocracy The Big Test  contains an interesting anecdote aboutWilliam F Buckleys inadvertent role while an undergraduate at Yale duringthe late s in helping that university restrict the number of Jews andCatholics it admitted Here is how Lemann tells the story on page                                              One year the Connecticut legislature got the idea of forbiddinguniversities to ask for information about the religion of applicants YalePresident A Whitney Griswold persuaded the student editor of the YaleDaily News  William F Buckley Jr to go up to Hartford and testifyagainst the bill Griswold told him such information would be indispensable forthe Yale Archives though Buckley an opponent of government regulation didntneed to be persuaded very hard A few days later when Buckley told YalesCatholic chaplain about his political mission the chaplain broke the news tohim that Yale maintained a ceiling of  percent on Catholics and on Jews andthat was why they needed to ask the question                                       Lemann got one detail wrong Griswold didnt become Yales president until afew months after Buckley graduated so the president in question would havebeen Griswolds predecessor Charles Seymour When Chatterbox asked Buckleyabout this intriguing storywhich apparently has never been told beforeexcept in a footnote to Dan A Orens  book Joining The Club A History of Jews andYale Buckley was a little hazy about the details                                             I met with Charles Seymour ex officio as chairman of the YaleNews  once every week I cant exactly remember whether it was he who askedme to go to Hartford or whether it was Yales lawyer FrederickWiggin I do remember at one point Seymour telling me that it was ridiculousnot to ask an applicant what religion his was since colleges are historicalresearch facilities I exactly remember going to see Yales counsel theformidable Mr Wiggin who asked why I opposed the law I gave the libertariananswer and he said Youre wrong The legislature can do anything it wants todo provided it isnt unconstitutional He instructed me in effect not tostress my own libertarian line but simply to say I had no reason to supposethat Yale had quotas                                       Even granting that Buckleys libertarian opposition to Connecticuts FairEducation Practices bill which never did pass would not likely have beenaltered by the discovery that Yale did indeed have quotas it appears thatBuckley was dupedeither by Wiggin or by Seymour or by both menintorepeating a lie that helped Yale restrict the number of Catholics of whom hewas one and Jews who got in According to Orens book Wiggin assured Buckleythat there were no quotas But there were quotas Whether these wereformal quotas cant perhaps be proved But against Jews there wereOren told Chatterbox admissions guidelines and understandings informalquotas that had the same net effect and these were not relaxed until theearly s Against Catholics theres less direct evidence of informalquotas but Oren got some former Yale admissions officers to admit that theircolleagues discriminated against Catholics during this period And at leastaccording to the testimony of Yales Catholic chaplain as recounted byBuckley it was a funny coincidence that exactly the same number ofCatholics and Jews were admitted into Yale            What Chatterbox wants to know is Why are we learning about this only nowWilliam F Buckley is not only a journalist but a journalist who has writtenextensively about his own personal experiences moreover the first bookBuckley ever published God and Man at Yale  was in part an argument thatYale should uphold its antique tradition of inculcating Christian values andbeliefs In taking this position Buckley ought to have noted the inconvenientfact that historically running a Christian college which to Yale really meanta Protestant college meant excluding to some extent Catholics and Jewsandthat a mere two or three years before publishing this book he himself hadencountered some evidence that systematic exclusion might still going on
