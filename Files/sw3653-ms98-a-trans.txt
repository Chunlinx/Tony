        are you in the market for a new car     um well actually about six months ago we were uh but it was kind of a different type deal we had uh a large conversion van that and were looking to sell it too   oh oh   uh to get a smaller car  but but when i was looking for the van we were looking around quite a bit   uhhuh oh you need to  down uhhuh and did you were you happy with the van you found   oh yeah yeah as a matter of fact the reason we sold the van was just so that my wife could stay home with our two boys now   oh uhhuh   so we got rid of that big payment and so now she now shes a stay at home mom   right right did they use a lot of gas those vans   um it did fairly well for me uh i got about fifteen sixteen   umhum oh that is pretty good   in in the thats combination city and highway driving and then on the open road i can get about nineteen or twenty   oh that oh yeah that is nice i thought they used a lot more gas than that ah   humum yeah you would think itd be a lot worse i know mini vans dont get much better than that they get about twenty one twenty two   no right around there oh well thats interesting we are just in the opposite situation of you were looking for something bigger  we have four children we just had   yeah ah ah   a new baby and so the car that we have only has the five seat belts and we need you know when were all going in it we need six   umhum yeah   so were looking for something bigger and i   uhhuh   i dont know we have a little Honda car that my husband uses it   uhhuh   to commute back and forth to work and it has been it almost has two hundred thousand miles   wow  you got your use out of that   right and its been such a good car but i wish they made Hondas with the six seat belts i i dont i dont think they make them that big   yeah thats true no i dont think so   and i im not sure that im ready for a van yet   yeah i have looked at some of the uh Toyota Toyota makes a real nice van i i like theirs a lot   oh oh   uh but if you really want size you know the prices are about the same depend you know you can spend as much on a mini van as you do on a full size conversion van   uhhuh oh   and the difference is the the conversion of course the mileage is a little bit worse   uhhuh   but because you do have a bigger engine and bigger transmission you can pull stuff like trailers and boats and stuff easier than you can with a you know the other mini van   right uhhuh oh are there a lot of vans down there my brother lives in Plano Texas and he said theres vans all over the place   oh umhum oh yeah yeah just lots and lots of vans     so thats i was kind of i my preference would to be just to go to a bigger car i think rather than rather than a van but you know even that is its hard to find a car that is big enough i guess   umhum     the problem we have now is our car it doesnt have a bench seat up front so if we had the bench seat then we would be fine but when we bought it we   oh it doesnt yeah umhum   we didnt get the bench seat up front so   yeah well i dont know if youd be how how old is your oldest   eight uhhuh   eight yeah see i i dont know how long youd be happy like that well i dont know how often all all six of you all will be in the car but i know that once you get one or two car seats in there   right   that takes up  a lot of room   ah and then that yeah then youd have your eight year old youd probably have your eight year old up front on the bench seat   uhhuh   but even even then after a while youd feel cramped especially if it was ah you know a fairly long trip in more than about an hour     thats true thats true i havent i havent thought about that because is there a lot more room in the regular size vans than in a car   uh oh yes definitely you you know a station wagon the back end of a station wagon probably can carry as much as a van but as for passenger space ah you cant beat a van because you can you can you can carry seven in a van and thats a mini van   oh uhhuh   on a large conversion van you can you know you can carry a lot you can carry about nine   oh so now why did you go with a large conversion van when you went   well because for what i wanted in a van the mini vans were were about a thousand dollars less     umhum   and you get almost twice the room in the conversion van than you do in the mini van   oh oh   plus like i said all the extra pulling power and i didnt feel i was losing that much on gas mileage because theyre not that far off   uhhuh oh right did you buy it new was it   yeah it was a new one uhhuh   oh and thats only about a thousand dollars difference   yeah i mean i was really surprised   yeah that surprises me too   because because when you you know you can like pick Dodge for instance they got two sizes of mini vans ones the extra long and then the other the extra long option with all the power options you know windows locks and the nice stereo   umhum uhhuh   it was only about fifteen hundred less than the comparable full size van   my word   and you know like i said uh the mileage on a mini van is about oh twenty one twenty two on the highway and on the you know on the full size it was nineteen twenty   nineteen so thats still comparable   and thats nothing yeah so you know i i said you know given that i said   wow
