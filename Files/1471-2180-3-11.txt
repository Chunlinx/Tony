                    Background        RNA viruses are important pathogens in humans animals        and plants Their short generation time and high mutation        rates allow them to adapt rapidly to changing environmental        conditions and make them everchanging targets for        antiviral therapies or vaccinations RNA viruses form        highly polymorphic clouds of mutants socalled        quasispecies       At viral loads of  or more        virions in an infected host viral quasispecies         in vivo often contain all possible        singlepoint mutants from the consensus sequence as well        as a sizeable fraction of two or threepoint mutants            Besides their importance as pathogens RNA viruses have        in recent years also become one of the main tools for        experimental verification of theoretical population        genetics and evolutionary theory in general reviewed in            This line of research can draw on a substantial body        of literature on the theory of quasispecies dynamics and        its relation to standard population genetics                              The quasispecies theory has been useful to understand        RNA virus evolution but the assumptions underlying the        model do not always reflect the biology of RNA viruses In        some instances the original model has been corrected to        account for discrepancies such as infinite vs finite        population sizes       However other factors need        to be considered as well For instance the standard        quasispecies model assumes low multiplicity of infection        moi that is each cell is assumed to be infected by        at most one virion At high moi when several virions        coinfect a single cell the virions can recombine             or reassort for segmented viruses                 Second the model assumes that the genotype of a        virion fully determines its fitness However this        assumption is not always justified since many viral        functions can be provided in trans  an effect referred to        as complementation Thus the phenotype of a virion may not        reflect its genotype        Phenotypic mixing        and hiding is a particular case of complementation        involving surface proteins above citations It occurs        either at high moi when two or more different mutants        or virus strains freely exchange genetic sequences and        surface proteins inside a cell or at low moi when a        mutant offspring is encapsidated by its parents        proteins        No general theory is available for the evolutionary        dynamic of a viral quasispecies under the influence of        virus density as it changes with changing moi However        some particular cases have been studied              mostly related to recombination and reassortment              and to the dynamic of defective interfering particles                In this paper we modify the        quasispecies model by incorporating phenotypic hiding        between wildtype virus and a deleterious mutant We assume        that the mutant differs from the wild type in a surface        protein necessary for cell entry so that the fitness        difference between two virions is solely determined by the        surface proteins and not by the particular genomes they        carry We show that phenotypic hiding of the mutant genome        behind wildtype capsids increases the mutant frequency        above the level predicted by the standard quasispecies        model This increase in mutant frequency is most pronounced        at high moi but exists also at very low moi        Moreover we show that the decrease of mutant frequency        from an initially high level down to the level of        mutationselection balance is slowed down substantially at        high moi because of phenotypic hiding        We propose that our model may explain some of the        quantitative differences observed between theoretical        predictions of the quasispecies model and experimental data        published in the literature               Footandmouth disease virus FMDV has been one of the        most productive models of viral quasispecies dynamics        reviewed in     FMDV belongs to the Picornaviridea        family It has a nonsegmented positive strand genome of        approximately  Kb encapsidated by viral proteins VP        VP VP and VP A conserved ArginineGlycineAspartic        acid RGD triplet in GH loop of VP recognizes the        v v or v integrin as viral receptor reviewed in        Ref     the first necessary step for virus entry        Work carried out with different RGD virus mutants and mimic        peptides        clearly demonstrates the        critical role that the RGD triplet has in virus entry and        its little tolerance to variation Among the few RGD        mutants that have been isolated on is RED a low fitness        mutant in which the glycine is replace by glutamic acid            RuzJarabo and coworkers found that after        revertant RGD genomes became dominant and mutant genomes        were no longer detected in the consensus sequence RED was        able to remain in the population for very long times and at        surprisingly high frequencies        There is a        qualitative agreement between the predictions of the        quasispecies model and this result but there is also a        quantitative discrepancy RED memory genomes can be        observed at much higher frequency than expected However        phenotypic hiding promotes a decelerated decay of mutant        genomes in the population and this decelerated decay could        be interpreted as a memory effect in agreement with the        results by RuzJarabo et al The research design of the        original work       does not allow us to        conclusively accept or reject our model as the correct        explanation for their observations but the values of        mutant frequencies predicted by our model are consistent        with the experimental data                    Model        We assume that the virus is propagated under serial        transfer and model the change in mutant concentrations        from passage to passage We assume that the difference        between wild type and mutant lies in the capsid proteins        such that the mutation affects the ability of the virus to        enter a cell but not the viability of the virus inside the        cell Under phenotypic mixing and hiding there are four        types of virions that can occur wildtype genotype with        wildtype phenotype wildtype genotype with mutant        phenotype mutant genotype with wildtype phenotype and        mutant genotype with mutant phenotype We will call virions        whose genotype coincides with their phenotype as pure and        virions for which genotype and phenotype do not coincide as        mixed In the following paragraphs we outline the        derivation of a set of deterministic equations that        describe the change in relative concentrations of the        different pure and mixed virions in an infinite virus        population More details are given in the Methods section        Our model is similar to models studied by Szathmry                    The probability         p                   ww          that an offspring virion is pure wild type is         p                   ww                     r          x                   w                   r Methods section Eq  where         x                   w          is the probability with which a particular virion that        infects a cell contains the wildtype genome and         r is a parameter related to the        multiplicity of infection Likewise the probabilities         p                   wm          and         p                   mw          that an offspring virion is mixed of either type are         p                   wm

       r  The formula that relates the        parameter         r to the multiplicity of infection        Eq  is somewhat unwieldy For reference and in order        to provide an intuitive meaning for         r  we have tabulated         r which we will call in the        following also the mixing parameter versus the moi in        Table         The probabilities         x                   w          and         x                   m          depend on the composition of the types of free virions        on infection Assume that         y                   ww          is the concentration of pure wildtype virions at        passage         t          y                   wm          that of mixed virions with wildtype genotype and        mutant phenotype         y                   mw          that of mixed virions with mutant genotype and        wildtype phenotype and         y                   mm          that of pure mutant virions Further assume that        virions with wildtype phenotype infect cells at a rate                    w           while virions with mutant phenotype infect at a rate                           m                              w           Then the total rate at which cells are infected        with wildtype genomes is                    w                  y                   ww                              m                  y                   wm           Likewise the total rate at which cells are infected        with mutant genomes is                    w                  y                   mw                              m                  y                   mm           Therefore we have         x                   w                              w          y                   ww                              m                  y

       x                   m                     x                   w                  Using the various formulas given in the previous two        paragraphs we find that the virion concentrations at        passage         t   primed quantities are given        by                We now introduce mutations into this model We assume        that the wild type mutates into the mutant with probability         For simplicity we assume that back mutations occur at        the same rate It is safe to make this assumption because        the rate of back mutations from deleterious to advantageous        mutants tends to have little effect on mutationselection        balance Mutations will typically not affect the phenotype        of the offspring virion which is determined by the        distribution of mutant or wildtype capsid proteins in the        cell The extended model with mutations therefore        becomes                            Results                  Extinction of mutant for             In order to evaluate whether the mutant can coexist          with the wild type or will ultimately go extinct if it is          not constantly regenerated through mutations we have to          analyze the fixed points of Eqs ad There are two          trivial fixed points corresponding to the cases in which          all virions are either pure wildtype or pure mutant We          could not find any nontrivial fixed points Since the          expressions involved are extremely unwieldy we searched          for nontrivial fixed points only numerically using the          function NSolve of Mathematica              A linear expansion around the fixed points tells us          whether the mutant can invade an established wildtype          population or vice versa If we introduce a small amount           of mutant virions into an established wildtype          population the total amounts of wildtype genomes           Y                       w                       y                       ww                       y                       wm            and mutant genomes           Y                       m                       y                       mm                       y                       mw            after the next passage become to first order in                              As long as                        m                                   w              as we assume throughout this paper the          amount of mutant genomes in the population decreases in          the first passage which implies that the mutant cannot          invade Likewise if we introduce a small amount  of          wildtype virions into an established mutant population          the total amounts of mutant and wildtype genomes after          the next passage become to first order in                     In this case the amount of the invading wildtype          genomes in the population increases which implies that          the wildtype can invade an established mutant          population The invasion of a mutant population by a          small amount of wildtype virions is shown in Fig           The preceeding analysis shows that Eqs ad have          only a single stable fixed point the one in which the          whole population consists of pure wildtype virions The          mutant will therefore always go extinct eventually          The rate at which the mutant disappears depends on the          moi Figure shows the ratio between mutant and          wildtype concentrations as a function of passage for          various moi Concentrations are measured with respect          to the genotype that is mutant and wildtype          concentrations are           Y                       m            and           Y                       w             respectively In the example given we have                        m                                   w              At low moi the mutanttowildtype ratio          drops from  at passage zero to values of  and lower          after four passages At high moi the reduction in          mutant concentration proceeds much slower For example          at an moi of three the mutanttowildtype ratio is          only  after four passages An interesting aspect of          Fig is that the reduction in mutant frequency during          the first passage is independent of the moi This          effect is a consequence of our assumption that the mutant          has impaired ability of cell entry In the first round of          infection when all virions are pure wild type or pure          mutant the mutant virions cannot benefit from phenotypic          hiding Therefore their frequency will decrease          corresponding to the true fitness difference to the wild          type independent of the moi From the second passage          onward the balance between pure and mixed virions is          established and further reduction of the mutant          frequency is slowed down at high moi          Figure shows the individual concentrations of the          various pure and mixed virions at an moi of five We          observe that the concentration of pure mutant virions          decreases much faster than that of mixed virions with          mutant genomes After ten passages both concentrations          are equal and after fifty passages there are more than          twice as many mixed virions with mutant genomes than          there are pure mutant virions When the mutant is rare          it is mostly hiding behind wildtype capsids which slows          down its extinction Interestingly the fraction of          mutant genomes encapsidated with wildtype protein is          equal to the fraction of wildtype genomes encapsidated          with mutant protein at zero mutation rate This symmetry          is a consequence of the symmetry of equations b and          c and disappears for                             Mutationselection balance for positive           We now turn to the general case of a positive mutation          rate  We first consider the case of vanishingly low          moi           r   When we set           r   Eq  becomes the          discretetime version of a model of maternal effects in          quasispecies evolution     In Ref     the          fitness of a virion is assumed to be the product of a          contribution from the genotype of the virions parent and          one from the virions own genotype The situation here is          simpler because we assume that fitness is only          determined by the phenotype efficiency of cell entry          In the language of Ref     this means we have           b                       i              for all genotypes           i From Eqs  and  in Ref              we obtain the steadystate concentrations of pure          and mixed virions neglecting back mutations from mutant          to wild type                    We mentioned in the previous section that           y                       wm                       y                       mw            for    Clearly this symmetry does not exist for             For      the ratio in          concentration of the two classes of mixed virions is           y                       mw                       y                       wm                                        m                                   w               There will typically be several orders of          magnitude more mutant genomes encapsidated in wildtype          protein than wildtype genomes encapsidated in mutant          protein Note however that this result holds only under          the assumption of vanishingly low moi As the moi          increases the mixed virions with mutant genomes will          still be at higher concentration than the mixed virions          with wildtype genomes but the ratio between the two          will be much smaller than  The ratio of mixed virions          with mutant genomes to pure mutant virions is           y                       mw                       y                       mm                                      m                                   w              at low moi that is there are more pure          virions than mixed virions with mutant genomes in          equilibrium We found numerically that at high moi          this relationship is reversed and there are          substantially more mixed than pure mutants          For the total amount of mutant genomes in the          population we obtain after summing Eqs c and          d                    For comparison the standard quasispecies model          without phenotypic hiding predicts                    This expression is equivalent to the one given by          RuzJarabo et al in their analysis of quasispecies          memory     Equations  and  differ only in the          factor                            m                                   w             This factor is larger than one for small mutation          rates that is as long as                                     m                                   w                       If the mutant has a substantial fitness disadvantage          in comparison to the wild type say at least  then           will always be small enough to satisfy this condition          Therefore phenotypic hiding will lead to an increase in          mutant genomes even at low moi The increase is at most          a factor of two for    and                        m                                   w              in comparison to the prediction of the          standard quasispecies model          For the case of positive mutation rate and high          moi there is no analytic solution available and we          have to resort to numerical simulations Figure shows          the decay of mutant genomes over time starting from an          initial state where mutant and wild type are present in          equal concentrations We have displayed trajectories for          a wide range of moi and we have also displayed the          corresponding trajectory generated by the standard          quasispecies model All trajectories show the same          qualitative behavior The mutant frequency decays quickly          during the initial passages and then levels off in          mutationselection balance As discussed in the previous          paragraphs the level of mutant genomes in          mutationselection balance is always higher in our model          than in the standard quasispecies model Moreover the          level of mutant genomes increases with increasing moi          The initial decay of mutant genomes is also influenced by          the moi and slows down with increasing moi In          general the initial decay of mutant genomes for             is identical to the one for    as described in the          previous subsection It is interesting to note that          phenotypic hiding influences the equilibrium          concentration of mutant genomes at low moi but not          the speed at which equilibrium is attained The initial          decay of mutant genomes is identical for our model at low          moi and for the standard quasispecies model                            Discussion        RuzJarabo et al measured the frequency of the        minority FMDV RED mutant up to passage  and found that        the frequency was still declining at passage             They observed mutant frequencies at passage  between           and   These results are in agreement with our        model of phenotypic hiding if we use a relative fitness of         for the RED mutant as compared to the wild type             and assume that  the fitness disadvantage is fully        explained by impaired entry  the mutation rate is            and  the moi is approximately five Fig         The moi in Ref    was between one and five        RuzJarabo et al noted that mutant concentrations around         would follow from equilibrium state of the standard        quasispecies model if the mutation rate were           rather than     However the standard quasispecies        model predicts that the mutationselection balance should        be reached around passage  Fig  which is at odds        with the observation that the frequency of RED mutants        continued to decline up to passage         It is important to note that capsid proteins can be        provided in trans during the production of infectious FMDV        particles     and phenotypic hiding has been known for        many years in a variety of picornaviruses              Other factors may enhance or reduce the effects of        complementation For instance compartimentalization or        physical localization should prevent to some degree the        free exchange of genomes and products        In order to test fully the predictions of our model we        would need data on the decay of the mutant frequency from        replicate populations propagated at different moi        Unfortunately such data does not exist Although        RuzJarabo et al propagated their populations at an        moi of  in their initial study    and at an        moi between one and five in their followup study            we cannot compare the mutant frequencies reported in        these two studies because the method of screening for RED        mutants was changed in the followup study      Table         Note b Moreover a caveat applies to the comparison of        the experimental data to our model RuzJarabo et al        determined the frequency of RED mutants by first screening        for monoclonal antibody MAb SD resistant virions and        then determining the fraction of RED mutants among them        from sequence data While this method successfully prevents        against counting MAbresistant mutants that are not RED it        does not measure the fraction of RED mutants that hide        behind RGD capsids If phenotypic hiding plays an important        role in this system then the fraction of hiding RED        mutants could be substantial and the reported mutant        frequencies would likely represent underestimates In        summary the experimental data are consistent with our        model but do not allow us to either accept or reject it        with certainty We have shown in the present paper that        phenotypic hiding can increase equilibrium frequencies by        factors of two to five or even higher for high moi It        is conceivable that other types of complementation can have        similar effects            Phenotypic hiding can bias fitness determinations if the        phenotype rather than the genotype is quantified This        bias occurs simply because a fraction of mutant genomes        will hide behind wildtype envelopes and will be missed an        effect that has been previously reported      As a        byproduct of our study we predict two phases of mutant        frequency decay specific to phenotypic hiding In the first        round of infection all virions are pure wild type or pure        mutant so that the mutant virions cannot benefit from        complementation Therefore their frequency will decrease        corresponding to their true fitness and independently of        the moi From the second passage onward the balance        between pure and mixed virions is established and further        reduction of the mutant frequency proceeds much slower if        the moi is sufficiently high as illustrated in Figure         As a consequence if fitness competitions are halted        after the first passage measurements of the phenotype will        not bias fitness determinations These effect should not be        observed in other forms of complementation but should be        characteristic of any situation in which the phenotype is        determined by envelope proteins Host range will often        belong to this category since receptor recognition is one        of its main determinants Other examples include antibody        resistant mutants and escape mutants when the antiviral        drug targets entry such as rimantidine and        amantidineresistant influenza strains or WIN        compoundresistant picornaviruses     Thus phenotypic        hiding can keep a relatively large frequency of mutants in        the absence of selective pressure that can provide a quick        response when such selective pressure is restored        Complementation can also complicate the interpretation        of other experimental results involving competition between        two or more strains For instance Miralles et al            tested the effect of clonal interference in VSV        populations by changing the population size in competitions        between wild type and a MARM mutant This MARM mutant        carries a point mutation that confers resistance to I Mab        but it is neutral otherwise     Clonal interference        occurs in asexual organisms when population sizes are large        enough to allow the simultaneous generation of more than        one advantageous mutation so that the best mutation has to        compete not only with an inferior wild type but also with        the other fitter mutants     Thus while the best        possible mutation should always be the one becoming        dominant the rate at which it does so should be slowed        down in large populations The VSV competition experiments        were carried out at increasing viral population sizes but        the number of infected cells was held constant that is        the moi was increased alongside the population size        Therefore complementation may also have contributed to the        slowdown of the speed of adaptation at large population        sizes and the relative contributions of complementation        and clonal interference to the slowdown would be hard to        disentangle The only phenotypic hiding effect that the        authors could avoid were related to the determination of        changes in MARM C frequencies and these only correlate to        the changes in beneficial mutation frequencies if the        beneficial mutation mapped to the G glycoprotein        Many infections in plants and animals are probably        initiated by one or few viral particles thus corresponding        to a situation of low moi As replication proceeds and        titers rise the likelyhood of coinfection increases The        best evidence for multiple infections         in vivo comes from the observation of        natural recombinants In the case of HIV for instance        rampant recombination has been reported even among        different subtypes      and the number of proviruses        per cell was estimated to be approximately three Another        well known example is influenza virus for which        reassortment is a major mechanism of evolutionary change            As in the case of HIV reassortment depends of        coinfection and once coinfection occurs complementation        is as likely to ensue as reassortment                    Conclusions        We have shown that phenotypic hiding has substantial        influence on the equilibrium frequencies of mutants in        selectionmutation balance and on the speed at which        deleterious mutants are lost from the population Our        theory makes five predictions that can be tested        experimentally         The rate at which the mutant disappears should        decrease and the equilibrium concentration of the mutant        should increase with increasing moi         A substantial fraction of mutant genomes should be        encapsidated with wildtype protein         The ratio of mutant genomes encapsidated in wildtype        protein to wildtype genomes encapsidated in mutant protein        should decrease with increasing moi         Even at low moi the fraction of mutant present in        mutationselection balance should be larger up to a factor        of two than predicted by the standard quasispecies model        if the mutant fitness is low compared to the wildtype        fitness         The decrease of mutant frequency during the first        passage should be independent of the moi and equal to        that measured for later passages at very low moi        Future experiments can be designed to test these        predictions and can thereby clarify whether phenotypic        hiding is a major contributor to viral memory and elevated        equilibrium frequencies of mutants                    Methods        In this section we present some calculations that form        the basis of the derivation of our model equations        We first calculate the probability that a virion        produced by an         n fold coinfected cell is pure        Assume a cell is infected by         k virions with wildtype genotype        and by         n          k virions with mutant genotype Then        the probability that an offspring virion is pure wildtype        is the probability that it has wildtype genotype which is                k          n  times the probability that it has        wildtype phenotype which is again         k          n  Thus the total probability is          k          n   If we want to know the        probability that an offspring virion is pure for a number        of coinfected cells with different ratios in their        multiplicity of infection of wildtype and mutant        genotypes then we have to sum over the different        contributions of all the individual cells In practice we        will not know exactly which cells are infected with what        virions However it is reasonable to assume that we know        the overall probabilities with which cells are infected        with either mutant or wildtype genotype Assume that         x                   w          is the probability that a cell is infected with        wildtype genotype and         x                   m                     x                   w          likewise for the mutant genotype Then the number of        wildtype genomes         k in a cell is binomially        distributed and therefore the overall probability                    ww                   n  that an offspring virion from a        cell infected by         n virions is pure wildtype becomes                          Likewise we find for the probability                    mm                   n  that an offspring virion is pure        mutant                    mm                   n           x                   w                  x                   m                   n          Now we consider mixed virions Assume again that a cell        is infected by         k virions with wildtype genotype        and by         n          k virions with mutant genotype In        analogy to the considerations for a pure virion we find        that the probability of a mixed virion is         k          n          k          n  regardless of whether the        genotype is wildtype and the phenotype is mutant or vice        versa The probabilities                    wm                   n  and                    mw                   n  that an offspring virion is mixed        of either type are then                Equations  and  are valid if all cells have        exactly the same multiplicity of infection However        infection is a Poisson process and some cells will end up        being infected by more virions than other cells Assume        that  is the multiplicity of infection of the whole        population Then the probability that a single infected        cell is infected by         k virions is         e          k           e          k  The factor           e in the denominator corrects for        the         e cells that will not be infected        at all We obtain the overall probabilities to find a pure        or mixed offspring virion by summing over all possible        combinations of infections with their respective        probabilities For example                After taking the sum we find                p                   ww                    cx                   w                  x                   m                   where the constant         c is given by                Here Ei         z  is the exponential integral         and  is the Euler constant    Finally by        making use of         x                   w                     x                   m           we arrive at                p                   mm                   cx                   w                     c           Similarly for a mixed virion we find                We obtain         p                   mm          and         p                   mw          from Eqs  and  by interchanging w and m in        all subscripts Equations  and  show that the        mixing parameter         r used in the main body of
