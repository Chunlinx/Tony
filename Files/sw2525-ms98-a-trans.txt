                okay   all set do you want to start   i can go ahead and start uh   sure go ahead   in Dallas theres definitely a crime problem i know its you know worse in the larger cities um its kind of a concern for me in fact at the moment im thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment and uh its i am single and female you definitely are going to worry about the location and uh   oh God   you know accessibility of people to be able to break in i live on a third floor now but i you know im real concerned that i i dont want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that and   do they have many buildings that have security there   the um some buildings do it depends on the location the area i live in right now is is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we dont have anything at all no burglar alarms no guards some some places do have guard gates that you have to get through or electronic access gates and things like that   yeah yeah well i i went to Dallas um when i worked for TI in Abilene and uh i im a little familiar with the city area Forest Lane and you know through that off off the freeway   umhum umhum   and uh it didnt seem like it was that congested in that that part you know because to me where we live out here in the north east it its there are a lot of buildings very close to each other   umhum umhum   and the cities are very populated with tenement housing   umhum   where there are more than one family in a house   um   and with with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language and uh theyre theyre going to the big cities it makes it very difficult   umhum   it really does and and i ive seen the same thing that youre talking about uh much more crime than ever before drugs of course uh a big part of it i think   umhum umhum   and uh i dont know a lot of younger people you know into more violent crimes   oh yeah yeah   that that thats really sad you know you got young boys or girls that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and no remorse what so ever   umhum theres a lot of that going on in Dallas too   yeah yeah   its really sad   it is and and i dont know if its uh the family you know thing where theyre not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and   umhum   the kids arent getting the attention that they need or the television   umhum   and i i really think that were were falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people   oh i agree i think that people are getting off too easy theyre getting theyre getting paroled too easily theyre just getting uh put on probation or something because the prisons dont have enough room so they get they get   i uh yeah   they get lighter sentences and some of those people they dont deserve to be let loose   yeah exactly and and you know they had uh in fact on the news last night we were watching this uh man who lost his ten year old daughter he ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone she now ten years old shes old enough to be alone for a few minutes you know   oh yeah   and while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store thats what it was and uh someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her   oh my gosh   and the whole bit and one of the men got uh i think it was seventeen years and the other one was in for uh life imprisonment   umhum   the one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven and hes out   uh thats terrible but   and the man said that you know if if it werent for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself and then go to McDonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing think a thing about it   umhum yeah   and i mean i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands   yeah   and that innocent people i i shouldnt say innocent because i mean actually actually if they commit a crime that theyre in the same circumstances but   umhum   the reasons that theyre doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know its like two different things   yeah   sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things   right its a little more understandable under the circumstances i guess   i dont know i i like the idea that uh if someone is from a foreign country   umhum   and they come to this country and uh commit a crime i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported   umhum   especially if theyre found guilty of the crime   umhum   you know once they they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty thats it we dont take care of them we dont support them   umhum umhum   nothing i mean they go right back where they came from   right we have enough enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is so let let their country take care of it we dont have i guess too much trouble in Dallas with well i guess i guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico   exactly and   that cause problems but uh   but thats uh theyre theyre so close i i dont consider Mexican people in the same category with uh especially like uh people who come from cultures that dont have the same uh kind of moral upbringing that we have   yeah umhum   like you take Asian countries or uh the Eastern countries where women are like in the foreground uh in the background and the men are in the foreground and its like you know um they live back in where where we came from two hundred years ago you know weve weve advanced beyond that   umhum umhum umhum   and i think that their uh mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing you know what i mean   umhum it was amazing i went to the Far East uh back in October to do some training for TI and i uh   its uhhuh   some of those countries were so safe it was unreal Singapore is very supposed to be very safe and in fact Tokyo and i thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people   yeah   but they at at the TI there i said is there any area i should avoid and the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl and said can you think o f any place where Dana shouldnt go by herself or anything and she she thought for a few minutes and she said no and he said is there any place you wouldnt go by yourself she said no and they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway   wow   and somebody will turn it in and the and nothing will be missing they said they can just about guarantee that there uh that that would happen if you did that i thought boy  in America if you left a purse on a subway you would never see it again   wow you better believe it if you wouldnt even have to leave it i mean it would get snatched right off your arm   yeah thats true thats true but i was thinking boy in Dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldnt go by yourself at night id have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out i mean   oh sure   i couldnt believe that she couldnt think of any place they said the crime apparently the crime is just uh   thats amazing well whats whats the difference there do you know   im not sure what it is there now i know what it is in Singapore is they have the death penalty and they really enforce it like for drugs      oh i i believe in the death penalty i really do   for drugs they they enforce the death penalty for that uh theyre just very very tough and i guess maybe thats the way Tokyo is too or Japan is too theyre just very tough on criminals   yeah yeah i think that were too easy uh and we take the the uh civil liberties uh stuff too far   umhum umhum   you know like people that are in prison i mean we didnt put them there they put themselves in that situation and as far as like them uh entertaining the rights that they should have   umhum oh yeah umhum   i mean we educate them we feed them we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and theyre back in again   uhhuh   im not saying theyre all bad but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives   umhum right   i think that they should be put away   and if theyre overcrowded well you know they shouldnt have gotten theirself there in the first place   get rid of them exactly i i really i i think that thats the whole key here this plea bargaining baloney   umhum   where uh you know they plead to a lesser crime or uh they plead guilty in or you know tell about someone else and they they get less time   umhum   or if theyre in there and theyve got seventeen years and theyre on good behavior they get for every year theyre in they get so many less you know that they dont serve the full penalty   umhum   i i i really think were going to far overboard with all of this   oh yeah i agree because its not fair to those of us that that deserve a safe you know life to have to   yeah same with drunk drivers   right   i think its too easy for them   umhum   that if the the laws and and uh were were harsher and were enforced   umhum   i mean you have to set an example you have to start somewhere   umhum   and i think that people know that theyre going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that theyll be out on the street again   umhum   an i and i feel bad for the policeman because hes out there every day facing these people   umhum right   this this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job and lets face it what do they get paid   right not much   twenty thousand dollars a year if theyre lucky i wouldnt do it for that   yeah humum and especially not in some of these big cities like in Dallas i mean theyve had theyre up in the top top five i think of cities that are getting policeman killed on on in the line of duty and thats really sad   it is it really is and i mean theyre the first ones that take the brunt of everything   umhum   you know and uh im not saying that theyre all good either because theres good and bad in everything but they theyre already uh have strikes three strikes against them when theyre out there   umhum umhum   because theyll arrest someone and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence and you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them uh you know what they say   right
