        okay     well what kind of pet do you have   one very old fat cat  Prissy and thats why Pat wont ever let me have a party at my house   thats right i remembered thats right Prissy gets you in trouble because you cant have them there   thats right she does shed a lot of fur   and how many pets have you had   shes weve had her for a long time we used to have a Spitz that kind of got deposited on us when a cousin was getting a divorce and we were supposed to keep her temporarily for about twelve years usually weve had dogs or cats   yeah well you know we have a dog named Pumpkin so what weve had him   yes   a year and a half and uh its okay i dont know i i i told my kids basically i would just not as i just soon not have a pet in the house but i give in   yeah im reaching that point too   yeah its its its hard for me i like pets a lot but i just dont like them in the house   umhum   so i wished you know i wish we lived in an area where we had a big backyard id have a dog  you know id have it outside but um i   umhum well im thinking of a next time about going back to a dog though because the cats really do shed a lot you just never get rid of the cat hair   do they   and i know there are a lot of dogs that are pretty clean and dont shed so Emily wants a dog a lot of her friends have little house mops kind of like yours   sure sure well it is easy and like Pumpkin is real easy i mean we dont even have to walk him much or anything he   umhum but do you have to let him outside for all his business and all yeah   yeah yeah he goes out in the morning   but see thats what would be hard for us since were not there a lot   yeah well unless you got a doggy door you know like my my aunt and uncle have a doggy door and their dog just goes in and out at will   umhum yeah   so that thats nice   i think Jay would go bananas over that though he he likes for our house to be as secure as possible   all sealed up yeah i know thats thats the problem with it but um   umhum   but basically dogs our dogs worked out has worked out well and i think its nice for the children i its not my most favorite thing in the world but   umhum that can be so therapeutic though when when i really want to just crawl into a shell i think uh wouldnt it be nice just to lay on the bed and pet the cat   yeah right well they are loving i mean thats   umhum   thats the thing uh you know my friend Barb i have a friend good friend whos just moved here and shes gotten two cats and honestly she is just crazy about those cats   umhum   and shes single lives by herself and they totally have kept her company you know i mean it is just its really meant a lot to her to have those cats   yeah and i really i i dont think im prejudiced since ive had both but i think cats are more prone to really have personalities i mean they own you rather than the other way around   umhum umhum umhum   and i really do believe that i get a kick out of seeing my seventy seven year old aunt with her animals and she had a cat get killed not too long ago and she said no more you know i just i cant go through that again and it wasnt three months before she had another one and just adapting to it just   yeah   like she always had   yeah   and its really neat for people living alone like you say with your friend   yeah its really you know Barb said she wishes that she had done it years ago you know that she had um   umhum   gotten an animal years ago because shes been single a long time and you know she says it just makes a world of difference to come home and have them in the house   yeah growing up it was so funny because mother would always have a soft heart for strays and   uhhuh   we never back then you didnt spay and neuter your animals that much you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never get rid of them fast enough before the next litter came along it wasnt usual unusual for us to have six and seven cats and i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them that were going to be award winning type  photos theyve always been a part of my life   well i guess so youve had them so you had them just from early on then   oh yeah we had a Cocker Spaniel growing up but but the cats were the things that i loved and especially with being around kittens and the babies and all   now were they indoor cats or outdoor cats   no no dad never never would have allowed that   right   so they always just kind of showed up and came and went and had babies and  we played with them we we used them as dolls sometimes wed dress them up and put them in carriages as much as theyd tolerate it   uhhuh uhhuh   so it was always fun   uhhuh well now see we lived on a real busy intersection in Phoenix and we had a dog but he was killed we we couldnt it was it was not it just wasnt conducive to animals   oh yeah that was traumatic wasnt it yeah   yeah it was it was very traumatic my sister it was really upsetting to my little sister and and um so that it just we didnt have many pets growing up just because our house wasnt conducive to that   umhum yeah   and uh it just wasnt safe we didnt have a fence and our dog just got killed wed keep him chained up but he got out and you know sure enough was hit by a car so   umhum yeah thats exactly what happened with ours and my brother really took it hard because he was the one that had left the gate open so he blamed himself personally although you know there were so many things that could have been different but it was hard for him to cope with it being his fault   oh yeah i bet   so i do hate that i thats one reason i like cats and critters that can stay inside because you dont face that   right   its its hard   right   especially if you really do get attached to them im im already kind of preparing for Prissy dying because shes pretty old and fat and oh i just know its going to come sooner or later so thats one reason ive been letting Emily talk about dogs because i think   uhhuh   we we say thats going to be the end but i think when it really comes to it well want another pet   how old is Prissy   shes at least thirteen or fourteen we dont know exactly because we got her as a young kitten or a you ng cat and didnt know that much about her shes a neat cat i mean she owns us all the way   um umhum umhum   but it does require a little bit of work and housecleaning   well uh you know it does thats just it and right now its i do well to just take care of my children   yeah yeah   you know without taking care of an animal too so   umhum and you have the problem when you travel too we always we board her now and that gets kind of expensive   thats right thats right we just we just were on vacation and uh it was you know it was expensive plus i think you know for Pumpkin he didnt you know he didnt like it we were gone two weeks and that was hard on him to be boarded for two weeks   yeah yeah umhum whered yall go   uh we cant talk about that can we  we went to Gulf  Gulf   no i guess not  its not pet related   Gulf Shores Alabama and New Orleans and so we had a really good time   oh boy yeah oh how neat   so but yeah Pumpkin was   but the puppy survived   yes he did i always wonder i think well now how much do they remember you know like   and you know my aunt says that they do drug them i just went bananas when she told me that that was a fact that she had shopped kennels and vets and that they all very lightly sedate them so that they sleep a lot and that just gave me the creeps because i you know i hate to think they did that to anything or anybody   oh huh   but she said every vets office and kennel if they would let it if they
