            okay hows the weather been out there   well the last three days its been pretty rainy we went to the beach and uh it started uh lets see around four oclock   umhum   and uh it had thunder and lightning it was and then you know it was just overcast and rainy for uh the next two two or three days straight how about yours   its been pretty normal for this year you know uh they have tornadoes about once a week and it rains about every three days the last two years before theyve had record rainfall by this time of the year theyd had enough rainfall for the whole year but this time were only um i think maybe five inches ahead of of uh normal so its not been bad at all   uhhuh youre from Virginia   im from Texas   oh from Texas   uhhuh and uh   i heard they had some flooding down there   um they had some flooding in Houston the other day real real bad over i think it was over the weekend   uhhuh hum   the radar just looked nasty with a bunch of red splotches all across it   uhhuh well the last couple of years were um were over as far as our rainfall goes before that it was really dry and uh everybody was you know talking about rationing water and doing this and doing that   hum   not really rationing water but just cutting down and uh it seems like uh you know the weather pattern is just shifting and uh that uh jet stream is moving uh into our area North Carolina   yeah thats thats right   and across but its uh changing latitude   there you umhum so you get a lot more rain that way   oh yeah   umhum brings in that cold air and mixes it with the with the warm air coming off the Atlantic Ocean   uhhuh   thats what   its finally cleared up its just now still still a little overcast but the sun but the sun has finally started popping out   umhum is the temperature like sixty sixty to eighties there too or   oh yeah well right now as a matter of fact im fixing to go play tennis its um id say its at least seventy nine eighty well about seventy eight seventy nine degrees   um do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean or   um actually the uh the wind normally blows lets see let me think about this south southwest   umhum   yeah uh but actually but actually our i guess our weather pattern comes from the uh blows north east yeah youre right it blows north east   umhum thats the way it does here most of the time   umhum   but uh sometimes it just comes straight from the north and then it and then it doesnt veer off to the east until you get down to Houston or or uh maybe mid mid Texas depends on how strong the cold fronts are   uhhuh how far how far are you from Houston   um well uh Richardsons a suburb of Dallas   oh i see so you so you dont have you dont get anything off the Gulf uh immediately from from the ocean   hardly ever unless theres a hurricane or something like that   uhhuh   well uh its kind of early for for i was going to say the weather man on on uh one of our stations was talking about the way that the weathers doing now is like tropical weather and he was afraid if it kept doing that that theyd have early hurricanes early hurricanes this year   hm well weve had some you know pretty pretty rough winds oh uh Bangladesh Bangladesh boy they they caught it bad   yeah kind of wiped them out   but well probably have our share of the hurricanes i know uh Hurricane Hugo you probably heard about that uh last year   umhum wiped everything out   yeah and theyre still uh  rebuilding from that storm so the the beaches here just get really beat up uh and it usually comes this way   yeah   it comes up from uh Miami uh down around or you know around the Bahamas and it usually travels uh northwest   umhum   and uh itll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits   do you do you get many tornadoes this time of year or   um lets see two years ago we had one as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house and uh it was real odd the um barometric pressure drops during a tornado and our uh fire alarm went off   um umhum huh   so of course that woke everybody up and we knew what was going on to uh you know go downstairs or go into the bedroom bathroom and uh take cover but uh   right   we get uh yeah were were uh we get our share of tornadoes   umhum and uh the uh uh you you arent in the mountains or anything like that are you theres just hills theres just hills   no huhuh were about two hours from the beach so uh   umhum   you know its uh barometric pressure i believe is higher in the mountains and we catch we catch some winds you know a few winds coming off of them i think but uh lets see yall just had a tornado   umhum   uh over close to Oklahoma and Texas   yeah they they had a lot of them they had a a huge one that was on um Inside Edition the other night in uh the southern part of Kansas   uhhuh   um they took a bunch of film of it it it uh kind of chased them it was a few hundred yards away and it chased them under an underpass and it was tossing around the car right before it got there and it tore up the people inside the car   oh gosh oh did it   and the the camera man on the news crew held the camera out they were hiding underneath the underpass and he held the camera out as the tornado went by   hum   and you the the wind you know it had a mike on it and the wind and everything was incredible   um boy i would have like to have heard that that could would have been something   i im surprised they didnt they because we saw it on the news a couple of days in a row and that and you know and that was way up in Kansas but over here its a lot its a big thing about tornados and people that get pictures of them   uhhuh uhhuh i used to live in Amarillo originally so im   yeah you can really see them well there yeah   oh yeah  we used to sit out uh especially in Borger we use to sit out on our back uh picnic table   umhum uh   and watch them come out of the sky through the funnel clouds and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground but otherwise wed just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds   yeah its really strange the way it does that   yeah   especially the wa y it starts it starts you know just like a little swirl in the clouds and and uh then it just grows from there   yep   and it and and usually its not even raining when it starts its just   yeah youd be amazed at how clear the sky was but the clouds are just really uh uh rolling kind of just real pillowy i guess   umhum thats right and theyre black and sometimes theyre even green colored   oh well i was in that uh big tornado went through Wichita Falls   oh yeah   and uh the sky i mean we were right in the middle of it when i mean signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us   umhum   and a whole roof of a restaurant came off  and uh it was a eerie uh a real eerie blue green color   gosh yeah   and the lightning was almost continuous just uh you know as if you put your hand on one of those electric uh things that causes lightning uh i think it was called the storm   umhum    yeah thats it   but um the sky the whole sky was full of that eerie blue green uh lightning   wow and thats about thats what we get this time of year just all the way sometimes all the way through June the last especially the last two years its rained um what i think it rained nine inches in in one one of the Junes the last two years and this year usually we usually get about five inches in May and its its over that so   um uhhuh we havent got that much rain but uh when it rains its its been down pouring   umhum all right well i hope you have good weather the rest of the summer   you too   have fun playing tennis   okay thanks bye   byebye
